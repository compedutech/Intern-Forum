I am enrolled in an online MPH right now, while learning how to code at FreeCodeCamp.  Almost done with the Basic JavaScript projects, and I realize I like programming a lot more then medicine. 

Sleeping 4-5 hours a day, worrying about patients, having to work 80 hours a week, 36 hour shifts with no sleep, and doing something I hate has taken a toll on me.  I am 27 years old, but I look like I am in my mid 40's.  I have always been the IT person in the family, and enjoyed it.  A lot of my education was paid through scholarships, since I finished undergraduate and medical school with honors.  So I don't have to worry about student loans.  

I was wondering what's a fast-track path for someone that is hard-working to enter the path of IT or programming?

I'll be honest, my CV is horrible for anything outside of medicine.  I feel trapped in this field, and need something to break out of it.  My goal is to get a job for any position that leads to IT and eventually computer programming, even if it pays minimum wage in order to change the direction of my CV.  I have a BS Microbiology w/ Honors; a MD with Honors.  Currently in an MPH.  

My goal is to finish FCC, and study for A+.  Problem is that application season for medical internships starts in September, and positions start in July.  My goal is to to be competent in either programming or IT to get a job before then.  So that way I don't have to do Medicine.  Any help or guide will be highly appreciated.

Thanks!"
4qp7na,2,2016-06-30,"Recent College Graduate, No Job, Depressed",throwawayplshelpmeee,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4qp7na/recent_college_graduate_no_job_depressed/,"Hey guys, so I apologize in advance for the length of my post because I tend to ramble. 

Long story short, I feel as though I've fucked up my entire life. Ever since I was a child, I never quite fit in at school. I had my small group of friends, but always tended to shy away from social interaction and struggled with low self-confidence. My self-confidence issues became more pronounced when I attended middle school and got bullied on a daily basis for the size and shape of my nose. To this day, as a 22-year-old young adult, I am still very insecure about my nose to the point where I've often considered getting a nose job, but never had the courage to actually go through with it. 

Regardless, in concurrence with the bullying I faced at middle school, I'd sometimes have confrontations with my parents at home and got physically beat many times by my dad. At the time, I had started to develop a video game addiction when I first discovered Runescape, before transitioning to World of Warcraft and League of Legends. These games perpetuated my introverted tendencies and may arguably be responsible for ruining my life, but they provided me with much needed reprieve from all the shit I went through each day. My dad saw that I was developing an addiction problem and forcefully prevented me from playing games for months at a time which led to a lot of tension between the two of us. At the time, I hated him, but realize that he had the best intentions for me, despite his short temper and physical abuse.

Despite everything I faced at home and at school, I kept going one day at a time and did well in class. High school was better than middle school for me since my peers matured and the bullying stopped altogether, but I found myself utterly alone each day with only a handful of friends at most. During the senior year of high school, I underwent my first bout of depression as I still had many tensions at home and would go days without being acknowledged or spoken to by anyone at school aside from my teachers. 

Now fast-forward to college; thankfully, I was able to resolve many issues with my parents and they paid for my education in full. I'm truly grateful for that, however, I don't think I deserved to go to college as I didn't make the most of it at all. While I learned a great deal about myself, made some great friends, experienced love/heartbreak and gained a well-rounded education, I somehow always found reasons to be unhappy. I got depressed once again during my freshman year as I had trouble making friends and adjusting to college life. This depression came and went and it caused my first girlfriend to leave me for someone else. For months after she left me, I foolishly spent an inordinate amount of time heartbroken, depressed and trying, in vain, to find another girlfriend instead of focusing on my studies. 

Throughout the rest of college, I thankfully shared many memorable experiences with some amazing people, but unfortunately still had issues with depression. I endured one of the worst bouts of anxiety and depression during the last semester of my senior year as I realized college was coming to an end and I was not at all ready for the real world. Somehow, I got through it and graduated magna cum laude with a 3.8 gpa and a degree in interactive multimedia from a noteworthy school. However, it's now been two months since I graduated and I'm having issues finding a job. I didn't really know what I wanted to do after college, but was hoping to land a job in front end web development, web design or digital marketing. 

Unfortunately, having graduated and applied to countless jobs, I've realized that I'm not qualified for many of the positions I'm applying for. College provided me a solid base of knowledge, but I'm finding that I have no expertise in any given area, and am just a jack of all trades. I'd basically need months in order to bridge all the gaps in my knowledge in order to pursue a career in front end web development. Not only that, but my design skills are very lacking compared to those of full-fledged graphic/web/UX designers. Lastly, I have not overcome the social anxiety from my childhood days and am quite terrible at public speaking which isn't going to prove very beneficial in a marketing-related career. 

Taking all this into consideration, I know I have a lot of potential, but have no idea which direction to take my career and which skills to invest in. Thankfully, I have the luxury of staying at home without the stress of accruing student loan debt, but I feel as though I have truly screwed up my life. I've continued to struggle with on and off depression over the last month and my parents are starting to feel as though I'm a burden; I don't blame them. They insist that there's nothing wrong with me and that I'm making things up, but we've agreed that I seek out a psychiatrist asap and get this shit addressed because it's gone on for too long. Unfortunately, I don't think there's going to be a quick fix to my predicament as it's largely due to a shitty mindset, attitude and subpar level of self-confidence that has only worsened over the years. 

That being said, I'm beginning to worry because I'm having issues speaking clearly and thoughtfully and my writing skills seem to have deteriorated compared to what they were like during my first two years of college. I'm truly afraid that the recurring depression I've faced since my senior year in high school has left me with permanent brain damage/brain fog symptoms and I'm losing all faith in myself. Not to mention, I'm still addicted to games, but have limited my play time to weekends. I also forgot to mention the fact that I'm a recovering porn addict, having pitifully fapped anywhere between 1-3 times a day since the age of 10. I read about the NoFap movement and tried it several times, but was unable to stick with it and have just resolved to fapping once every other day or so. 

In essence, I'm literally just a piece of shit with a liberal arts degree. I realize that I mistakenly wasted much of my time excessively playing games, indulging in porn, etc. and took corrective action to limit each of these activities, but feel lost now that I'm on the verge of entering the real world with no job in sight. 

When things are going well and I'm happy, I truly know I can achieve great things, but I've completely lost faith in myself as of late. The only other things I have ever achieved aside from my useless college degree/gpa is getting to diamond in League of Legends and maintaining a 6 pack throughout college. As an exercise enthusiast, much of my confidence stemmed from meeting and exceeding my fitness goals, but I realized that none of these things mean jack shit to employers. I should have focused more on my education as opposed to counting macros and climbing the ranked ladder in League. 

Moving forward, I want to live a more balanced lifestyle and put more effort into my career while also making time for the gym, games and my social life. That being said, what do you think I should do guys? I've completely lost faith in myself and feel as though I'm a poor excuse for my former self while stuck in this anxious and depressed state. The worst part is that I usually briefly overcome these feelings and start feeling more positive about my life, shortly before something triggers another inevitable slump back into a shitty mindset. This vicious cycle has continued for two-three months now.

I realize that I should definitely see a psychiatrist, that much is clear, but in the meantime, what do you guys recommend I do in regard to my career? I have three internships under my belt, one of which was at a Fortune 500 company so at least I've got that going for me, but as I mentioned, I'm a jack of all trades and don't know what career path to take. Do you guys think I should invest in a coding bootcamp to help propel me into a front end developer position? The problem is that I've always been very indecisive in regards to sticking with a career, but I realize I have to pick a field and learn as much as I can about it for several months if I am to get anywhere in life. I also realize that I have it so easy compared to some people since I have no student loans to deal with, but I can't help but feel unhappy and unmotivated. Most of my friends and family are achieving great things; some are going to med/dental school while others are working for top tier companies like Microsoft and Google, while I'm bumming around at home feeling lost. Thankfully, I'm only 22 and I have my parents' financial backing for now so there are still plenty of opportunities out there. Given that, could I get any advice? I appreciate any and all feedback! I know that if I stay depressed and continue making excuses without working towards definitive career goals, I'm destined to die a miserable and lonely man, having accomplished nothing in life. 


TLDR: I graduated with a liberal arts degree and am struggling with depression. I need advice on dedicating myself to a viable career path in order to turn my life around."

4qpbax,0,2016-06-30,GF making me insane while trying to study for the bar exam,[deleted],asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/4qpbax/gf_making_me_insane_while_trying_to_study_for_the/,"I've been with this girl throughout law school and we've both dabbled in stimulants, me with my ADHD meds and Adderall, her with blow and some of my addies at times, we screwed like crazy and I neglected class-time until I got some control with an antidepressant Lexapro. I was way more irritable on it and lethargic, but I was able to function and finish law school because of it. I think it also induced some sort of hypomania combined with my stims because I ended up interning at the WH over the summer and clashed with my co-workers and supervisors, it was just an internship so I got lucky without realizing it I guess. 

This past third year, I switched to a less potent med for law school reading called Vyvanse and although I physically and mentally looked better and clearer, I got complacent with my career because I figured my resume would bail me out when time came and Vyvanse worked wonders as far as being less potent drug and for sociability. 

Once the bar exam rolled around, I had to lock down and get back on the addies and now she's throwing a tandrum that I'm studying and I'll never change etc. yet she's still dabbling in whatever she was doing here and there at times without me even realizing it, which is why I was on Lexapro to begin with, I was dating someone toxic and put a lid on it. The anxiety was overwhelming when I tried to come off the Lexapro I had to go back on and now she's brawling with me because I'm more assertive on it. 

My theory is, at one point she made me feel bad for taking addies to study but most law students do and I am diagnosed ADHD and have it prescribed. With all that said, I still felt bad about it so tried to come off all of it which is where Lexapro was introduced to my life. I took her out places and old friends of mine looked at me like i had 1000 heads and I didn't know why, but the times I've been off of it, the overwhelming anxiety could be the fact she is toxic and instead of dumping her or getting rid of her, I tried to save her. That mentality went away when I treated myself for depression with Lexapro and now all she does is brawl with me and I'm trying to study.

I haven't cheated on this girl all 3 years and i'm getting fed up so I blocked her and just focusing on studying, don't even care if she goes out partying anymore at this point. I also live in a toxic home environment though and how am I suppose to distinguish what the issue here is or who the problem is? 

Leaving the WH and coming back to school I felt like a Red Pill King walking around there because I was bottom of the class, too busy screwing my hot gf yet had great resume, so even with job interviews this girl still makes me insane. Could it be that she knows I'm gunna want a normal life again after this exam and possibly see she's messed up and leave? 

I feel used and manipulated because I was trying to save her yet her family was never really trying to kick her out I don't believe and I don't even know how to get revenge other than massive success. Figured I'd ask you guys here because now I'm broke, she's in control and I blew an opportunity to save money but instead spent a year doing what she wanted and neglected my own needs. Thanks!

I'll give it to you straight, because I'm sure my demographics and dynamics are common here

-I'm a twenty-two year old man who left college about halfway through (my funding was severed due to a strained familial relationship, and I was unwilling to take out student loans).

-I've been completely supported financially by a very generous family member. I live frugally and I'm unable to save for incidentals and unexpected ""life occurrences."" I expect that I'm wearing his patience and generosity thin, which is understandable.

-Until very recently, I was living in a depressed part of Washington state, and was unable to find so much as a night-shift custodial position (hell, even Vector stood me up for an interview).

-I've spent the interim learning copywriting and (largely unsuccessfully) marketing my own freelance business. More recently, I worked as an unpaid intern for an HR startup; I left because they were unwilling to pay me.

-My girlfriend and I (she's the one thing I've got going for me) have moved back to my Upper Midwestern (it starts with an M) home city in the hopes of securing decent jobs. We've been here a month and she just received her first offer today. I dislike that I'm unable to feel much happiness for her and am actively resentful. 

I've had one interview for an entry-level writing position that I thought went rather well, however I saw the job re-posted on Craigslist today, so I take it that they're not going to bother replying to my ""thank you"" email.

I have an interview for another writing position next week; we shall see.

-I'm living at home (for the moment) and it's been difficult not to fall back into the trappings of a stagnant and resentful teenager.

-I've been utterly depressed about my joblessness and have lost the self-approval to exercise and have gained a shit ton of weight. I'm just starting to become active again and have cut down on the self-pity pizza.


I've come to the unfortunate conclusion that a lot of my problems are not any ""other"" or situational, but simply me. I'm doing my best to crawl out of the hole. So far, I've managed to get worms on my boots.

I'm looking for an outside assessment of my situation, and any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you."

Is this too low? I had a year of internship before this, at another local company, but they at least paid me 20 per hour. So I'm thinking of negotiating with them, but still I need your advice on this.


One of the reason I got this rate might be because I'm a F-1 student? They said this is a contract-to-hire role and that they will process my H1B early next year so that this could become a permanent role.
What should I do?

A lil more details about my background: 

My GPA is 3.77. I currently live in Dallas and had 1 year of internship experience doing mobile app development. The position I got is actually MEAN stack developer. The company specializes in eCommerce development, and one of the new platforms they recently added to the service list uses the MEAN stack technology targeting small to medium size business.

i'm living with our parents, trying to finish school (but i keep failing to do so), i don't socialize, i also have adhd (i was only dx'd with ADHD and AS this yr, so i also have comorbid depression and crippling social anxiety).

my brother will be graduating from college before me, he's in a frat at school (and is his frat's ""representative"", which i didn't even know was a thing), he's smart (computer engineering student, gets all A's with minimal/no effort), he's already done a high-paid internship in his field, etc. (he's also really mean to me now that he's in college...i think he's realized that i'm weird, so he doesn't want anything to do with me and doesn't take me seriously).

basically, any time i have to do something with my family, people fawn over my brother and treat me like i'm just a useless waste of my parents' support, and a waste of space in general. they'll speak to my brother with respect and as an adult, but then they'll patronize me like i'm a child, a moron, and an annoying weirdo, all at the same time.

it makes me feel terrible. what's worse is, while my brother is very smart, i'm not even sure that he's smarter than i am--my iq is in the top .2% of the gen pop, so statisically it's unlikely. but unlike him, i can't seem to do anything or finish anything, ever.

I guess things are getting a little better. I now officially live 12 hours away from my parents. I have my own apartment and I have a pretty cool internship. My NMom used to try to call daily but I've tried just answering her questions and then adding nothing. She hasn't called in a few weeks. 
I still don't have many friends and I have issues trusting people but I started talking to my boyfriend about the things I've been through. He listens and asks me a lot what I feel I should do but he's still adamant that I talk to a therapist. He used to talk to one and he's told me a lot about how it's similar to what we are doing but it's with a professional that can be more helpful. I also didn't mention earlier that the therapy I was in was through my parents church which according to my bf was probably way different because the person may not have been certified.

I guess right now my question is once you start to get away from your abuser what are some steps you need to do to make it so you can sustain yourself and not go back. I've tried to distance myself before but when life gets hard I always feel like a dumb little kid who needs them and I wouldn't fuck up if I was how they wanted me to be. I'm also trying to figure out steps to be financially separate.

And on a side note, I've been considering telling my best friend what has been going on. I haven't gone back to my home state in awhile mostly because of my Nmom and my Edad. Also my Nmom has been trying to get closer to this friend who also just had a child. I want to tell her what happened so she can know why I'm not going to come back and stay with them again and also to keep her child safe. The abuse with my NMom was mostly physical and emotional but also quasi sexual when I was nearing puberty. I used to think it changed when I left for college but the last time I went to my parents house NMom tried to kill me in a way I don't think I could report to the police properly.

I'm sorry for the wall of text. But  tl;dr any advice on staying vlc or telling my friend to stay away from my Nmom?"
4qpuzs,7,2016-07-01,Growing Up Pains,TheKirkendall,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/4qpuzs/growing_up_pains/,"Hello everyone,

I just need a place to... to talk. Life is confusing for a young one as myself. Tl;dr at bottom.

### Some background on me:

I'll be 21 years old next week. I've been a Christian since I was 5. I recently became a student leader for my church's youth group. I still live at home with 2 caring parents. I've been in a relationship for about 4 months now with a girl I've known a long time. I've got a group of about 5 close friends. I recently finished up a paid internship at a tech company. I'm currently unemployed.

Despite what should be a perfect life, I feel empty and purposeless. At 21 I feel too old for what I've done. Or lack thereof rather. 

I've been a Christian since 5, but I've never considered myself to be on fire for the Lord at any point. Rather I'm too lazy to read my Bible or busy with distractions to do more than pray. I'm trying to help at the youth group. I recently picked up the bass guitar to play in the youth band because God told me to. The only clear thing I've heard from Him in recent knowledge. I don't really know how to spend time with God. I don't know what He has planned for me. I believe in Him but He seems far away, which is probably my fault. I don't know how to get close though.

I live at home, rent free which is a blessing. But my relationship with my parents feels strained even though they have told me to stay at home until I can find stable work and get some money saved up.

I'm in a relationship with my first ever girlfriend. I've known her from a Bible study since I was 14. We got to be good friends and texted for 2 years until I finally asked her out. We're fortunate to a have a mentor couple helping us out. It's tough though because we used to spend a lot of time together but now she's so busy with her new job and church activities. I help out at a lot of those activities too but we're not with each other. We only spend 1 on 1 time one evening a week. And even then, I feel like she just doesn't have the time for me. Because she's usually tired during those hours. We've talked about it some but she says it's just stuff she has to do. A busy season in her life but even she said she has no idea when it will end. We don't text like we used to. It just doesn't feel the same anymore. It's a great source of unrest. I miss her.

I miss my buddies too. We used to do everything together. High school was the jam because school was easy and we had time to just chill, talk, play video games, and just enjoy life. Back when the future at least had some glimmer of goodness to it. Now I'm lucky to catch some of them online for a Skype call and some video games once a week. They're hurting too. One got in trouble with the law. Now his dreams of joining the Marines are dashed. The other is so lonely at his university. He told me he feels like an empty shell. My best friend has strayed from the Lord even at his Christian college. I hurt for them and don't know how to help.

I attended a community college in the area pursuing a degree in IT. After one year, they let me apply through the degree program to an IT company for a 3 semester (1 year), paid internship. My 1st semester there was fantastic. I got to work with people in a data center physically setting up equipment. 

My 2nd semester drove me to extreme sadness/emptiness/numbness. I got moved to OS administration, which I thought I would enjoy but I was mistaken. I didn't get to work with my co-workers as much. And I thought I would spend the rest of my life behind a desk. I was surrounded by negativity. It seemed everyone was there for a paycheck but convinced themselves they were living the dream. And they went home to drink and forget their miserable existence.

3rd semester had me working almost completely solo as both a physical and software troubleshooter. It was great at first and the sadness left me. I thought I had finally found my place. But God let me know not to accept a job if they offered it. This place was not for me. And sure enough, after being solo for a while and getting so tired of just fixing fixing fixing, the sadness returned. There were many mornings I cried at the breakfast table. I counted down the days till I left that place. And I was so happy when I did this May.

I've been unemployed since then. I have no desire to finish my degree. And I'm seriously considering abandoning IT.

### Life right now (tl;dr):

I have no idea what to do with my life. I feel as though I have no passions, no desires, no grand dream. The only thing that's stuck with me is joining the military but everyone is telling me it's not what it used to be. And how scary it would be to have Hillary or Trump for a commander in chief.

I'm lost and confused. Life isn't at all what it used to be. It's hard to derive fun from much of anything. Life seems pointless. I want to serve God though but I don't know how. I'm looking for some satisfaction in this life and I don't see it.

I must sound like a whiny brat. And that's what's kept me from sharing this with anyone. But... help. Does life get better? Does growing up just truly suck? Do I just need to get used to things being pointless and vain? Where is God?"

I found that programming professionally is not for me and it makes me depressed in general. I also have health issues and they scare me...doctors can't find the cause but one of them is definitely depression that I was diagnosed with.

My issues also stem from the fact that parents never guided me to anything. Well, not exactly. I studied chemistry, biology, math at school and liked it. I had a chemistry teacher who told me I would make an excellent physician. I find myself reading blogs on nutrition, find diseases fascinating but at the same time, my interest might be coming from my health issues. I still would have opportunity to attend med school but in my current depressed state, uncertainty about what I want, I don't see how one can succeed. People in med school seemed to be completely certain of their path.

Finally, while CS degree is marketable and I find CS awesome, I don't like programming that much. In fact, if someone gave me 10M bucks, I would probably not write a line of code again. Currently, I am stuck in London doing internship I don't care about and wallow in depression and self-doubt. My performance review was not good because of my issues and I find not caring about it at all.

I believe to be seriously messed up human being. I need to tackle the depression but the only option doctor gave me is drugs/SSRIs. I also can't admit to my parents that I don't want to do programming. They wanted me to go to med school because they saw potential in me as a good doctor. I wasted so much of their money.

So Me and Elizabeth met early into our Freshman year of College (2015).  We took to each other very well, and quickly fell in love.  We became each others best friends, we shared and communicated brilliantly, and overall had a very healthy relationship.  We were both happy.  For the summer she went to work as a hostess (where she lived in a dormitory setting with other employees), and I went to do an internship for my degree.  We talked often, and told each other about the important things in our lives.  This is where the drastic change to what I thought was our great relationship happens.

During our time together at College, Elizabeth had what she had called ""girl crushes"" on girls that she thought were cool, confident, and admirable.  I thought that they were exactly that, people who she admired and thought were cool, until Elizabeth told me that she thought that she might actually be attracted to these girl crushes.  I was completely fine with her being bisexual, but she was afraid of what people might think.  She definitely had some trouble coming to terms with this, and I tried as best I could to support her.  

By now we had been together for 10 months.  Early in the summer, Elizabeth sheepishly admits that there is a girl, Marissa, that she works with who she is attracted to.  She has become friends with her and really wants to hang out with her.  She explains also that Marissa is a lesbian, and that she is confident, cool, and quite a bit older than she is.  Marissa had taken a very upfront interest in Elizabeth, and Elizabeth had admitted to her that she thought she was bisexual.  She also admitted (to her) that she was attracted to her.  She tells me not to worry and I trust her, so we continue to live our lives.

Knowing all this, about a week passes and Elizabeth asks me how I feel about giving her permission to kiss Marissa.  Elizabeth explains that she still doesn't know if she is actually bisexual and she thinks the kiss could help her figure out this issue, which has become a more important part of her life since being in contact with this girl.  I hesitantly tell her that I am okay with it, but only because I want her to understand herself.  One night they kiss, and she reports back to me that she didn't like it but thinks that Marissa might have been a bad kisser.  She says that she thinks she is bisexual though, and is glad that she did it.

Fast forward two more days, I don't hear from Elizabeth despite our plans to call that night.  She attempts to call me at 4 AM but I am asleep and don't answer.  The next day, she explains that last night she was hanging out with Marissa in a group of friends, but the group of friends dissolved and Marissa and Elizabeth were left alone.  Elizabeth, knowing that I didn't want her to do anything beyond the kiss, explained to Marissa that I didn't want it to happen.  They somehow end up in Marissa's room and Marissa gives Elizabeth a back massage. which transitions into cuddling.  Elizabeth also says that Marissa groped her breast.  

I get angry and upset that Elizabeth did that with her, and that I thought it crossed the boundary into intimacy with another person.  She says that she didn't know it was crossing the boundary, and that she even tried avoiding crossing the boundary by telling her no kissing.  She also said that she just missed cuddling, because we haven't been together in 2 months since we left school.  Even though she claimed that she didn't know what she did was wrong, she called me at 4 AM and early in the conversation said that she felt sick.  I think she knew what she did was breaking my trust but she said that during it she felt like cuddling wasn't wrong.  She said that it ""didn't feel wrong.""  I am so glad that she told me.  In retrospect I don't think she told me everything that she was feeling, but we were able to talk our way past it and things seemed to be okay.  All was forgiven and we felt better after an emotional phone call.

The next day we talk again, and Elizabeth tells me that she thinks that now that she knows for sure that she is bisexual, she is not content in not experiencing another girl.  I tell her that I am not okay with that because unlike the kiss, being intimate with someone outside the bounds of our relationship was not something I was comfortable with, and never would be.  She says that it isn't about the girl and that it is instead about just doing the act and experiencing being with another girl.  While her thought that I worry about her falling for this other girl is partially true, I also am not okay with her doing something like this.  I am really surprised by this because we had talked about how much we were opposed to cheating, and I saw her proposition in a similar aspect.  I tell her that I don't consent to her having sex with Marissa.  She tries to tell me that I don't understand because it is about figuring out herself and experiencing new things, and that I need to look at it from that perspective.  I feel like she is trying to worm her way through my stance of it being infidelity and I don't budge.

Another day passes, and now we are talking only about her relationship with Marissa during our conversations.  I become more and more upset and she becomes more and more frustrated that I won't consent to her experimenting with her.  I try to be as understanding as I can be, and stop thinking that she is just wanting to experience another person, but that this is something important to her well being and understanding of herself.  She tells me that she can't feel absolute about our relationship if she can't feel absolute about her sexuality.  I defend my position saying that her sexuality isn't defined by who she has experienced.  At this point, I feel like what I am saying is being disregarded as ""not being able to understand her"" and that her position and feelings are based around some undefinable premise that I wouldn't be able to understand because I am straight and have never wondered about my sexuality.  At this point she is in full personal crisis mode, and this is the most important thing in her life.  For me, I am upset and wondering what the permanent affects of this are on our relationship.  We (or at least I) wasn't thinking anywhere near breaking up because of this, and the topic hadn't come up in discussion.  

The next night, Elizabeth tells me that she thinks that the best thing for us to do is to take a break.  I'm really upset by this because, during all this time, Elizabeth is telling me that she loves me.  And I love her.  She wants some time apart so that she can ""figure herself out"" which I expect means that she wants to have sex with Marissa during this break.  She also tells me that she wants to experience other things, and that she is too young for our committed relationship like the one we have.  I am heart broken by this, and this heart break is magnified by the fact that during all of this she is still telling me that she loves me.  That she wants to get back together after this break, and that she just needs to experience these things so she can be a whole person.  In a last ditch effort to get her to come to her senses, I tell her that I wouldn't want to get back together if we went on a break.  That people who love each other want to experience their lives together and that they would never willing separate.  She says that she wants these experiences and that she wants to grow as a person, and that the only way she can grow as a person is to do these new things.  She says that the only way we can actually date and be happy in the long term is if she does these things and then we are reunited.  I feel like this a perverted sense of strengthening our relationship, and at this point accept that she is going to do this.  We breakup.  I am devastated because I love this girl.  And somehow she is still saying that she loves me.  I don't know what to do or how to handle this.  

If you read all this shit then please leave some advice, it would help me figure out what to do.

TL;DR: My Girlfriend goes away for the summer, meets a girl and discovers she is bisexual, and decides that she want to temporarily break up so that she can experience other people and new things, all while telling me it is for the good of our relationship.  "

The capricious thoughts of Kirito on his Leafa enlightening.

Another in a series of idle iPhone fiction-pieces for your enjoyment and constructive critiques! Once such helps me polish it up I'll also post this at FanFiction.com. I'll strive to keep such Leafa x Kirito (and Girls Ops) stories as ""unique"" as I can, but it's difficult to do so please bear with it! Thanks!

&amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;

It whacked me with incredible awkwardness during our team quest high the snowy Bohemian Alps when we flung into another’s arms in whirling rejoicement and relief after finally slaying the brutal Sapphire Talon Roc, as I gazed raptly down at whose wide gleaming smile and big bright emerald eyes all dewy with happiness.

By the Gods!

I friggin’ love her!

Leafa!!

How could’ve I been in such blind denial, such cluelessness??

This willowy, busty, emerald-eyed sunny-blond sylph princess’s suddenly my Jack-In-The-Box love. Where’s my head been all this time?

We picnicked blue beaches and glass mountains together, fought dragons and ogres together, danced at Cait Sith weddings and raced other in the Asmir Sand Blizzard and helped overthrow Jötunheimr tyrants. We sweated and bled and battled and brawled together.

And suddenly the sum total of all that happiness thrill and joy just smacked me in the face.

Leafa. 

My peerless sparring partner and quest companion suddenly blooming into something much much more, my eyes and heart flying open to see her fay dazzle eclipsing Asuna’s.

I tried to cool down and examine my exciting eerie epiphany, admitting what I struggled to deny.

Leafa.

This sudden nova of my life who coyly seemed to intimately known me for a thousand years, who seemed to know what I was thinking before I said it as if she knew me in another life. As if we;d lived with another all along. As if we were long man and wife. As if...if...

Cruelly, my buoyant chest was punctured by a dismaying alternate reality.

Damn!

Damn!

Damn!

I just had to trip over a buried knowledge and invited the party crasher of another reality.

Of course she knew me from another life. IRL.

Suguha.

My instincts flinched at that, at envisaging my imouto-cousin’s forbidden tomboy face.

Damn!

Damn!

Damn!

How could I get to this point that I could forgot that here??

Then it’s been long since Suguha was mentioned whenever Leafa logged on. Normally inquiring a player’s true origins were forbidden in VRMMOs so I duly went along with the program whenever we played with our SAO gang, and Leafa in turn duly or slyly never mentioned or reminded me who or where she came from, which was only exacerbated by Suguha herself in keeping equally mum about our VR adventures back home. This conspired with the crucial fact that unlike other avatars in Alfheim, Leafa doesn’t resemble her root self one wilt, inducing my easy amnesia all the many many months that I adventured and played with Leafa as my secret therapy to get over Asuna’s mind-blowing “Dear John” text during her college internship in Brazilla, and since then I gradually slipped into the delicious lotus forgetfulness of regarding Leafa as a friend apart then a bosom buddy and now a step beyond.

Leafa is Suguha is Leafa.

Kind of.

Forgetting the obvious physical differences, there were marked aspects in their personalities that helped weave the amnesic spell, traits that were distinct and uninterchangable. They were almost like two different girls. Early on in VR, I met kids on my block IRL who were startled that Leafa was Suguha and had even fancied us a pair which I heartily laughed off, but that was a hollow laugh.  

Maybe an unconscious portelling of love lost then found? Or could these wonderful new sentiments really be a double boomerang rebound thing from Asuna skipping out on me, leaving me one sassy trophy sylph with a forbidden flip-side?

No, can’t be!

I don’t see Suguha in Leafa one way or the other. Suguha just doesn’t move me. There’s no flame there, no tickle of loins to look at her, no more than at a brother. Suguha herself simply doesn’t count here or there in my awakening of a too long overlooked universe.
 
But then, could it be that Leafa’s dazzling effect’s not only blinded me from her root but lifted the instinctive and social block all brothers have from knowing the separate woman hidden their imoutos? Did this mean that I was really in love with the girl behind Leafa’s mask?

I flinch!

Whether deliberately or by character evolution, Leafa’s a departure from Suguha in this world where different decorum and altitudes and rules apply. Leafa acts and talks here in freewheeling casual ways shied by modest Suguha IRL. It’s dramatic enough difference to make you wonder how good an actress puppeteer Suguha is in another synchronous universe or maybe it’s the first signs of a colony itching to stretch its legs at independence from a mother country.

If that’s so, the implications are staggering and enchanting...

But whether Suguha is simply letting her inner self hang loose as Leafa or is expertly acting the role is academic to me. All I know is I love Leafa and there has to come some accommodation made if I was going to seize the moment.

Geeze, I have work this out -- better, perhaps I should tell Leafa before she eventually senses it herself and makes my procrastination feel even more humiliating.

But how the heck do I confess my love to Leafa without ticking off Suguha? That’s almost as bad as asking a girlfriend for permission to two-time her, but I’ve got to let her know. Granted, it will instinctively feel awkward and uncomfortable as hell knowing that I’m also confessing to my hidden imouto, but one thing in my favor is that I needn’t worry about the humiliation of being turned down -- at least permanently; Leafa made her designs on me crystal-clear long ago during our moonlight waltz above the clouds, and later during our quests together she’d sprinkle little jests and teases about us being a pair beyond partners so I knew Leafa’s total acceptance was a done deal.

No, it wasn’t Leafa’s feelings I was worried about...

That thought helped me break our quest victory waltz and clearing my throat and mustering wits and guts I began --

“Leafa! We -- we have to talk,” I said with a serious tone melting her winning cheer.”Pick a far nice quiet place for us to remember.”

“Remember?” Puzzled but game, Leafa flew off to a lovely spot overlooking a sprawling flower glade bordering a crystal lake under an elm on a high hill.

Leafa almost sat near me and I always basked that smug macho feeling her trophy date effect imparted me, but now I felt as uneasy as a honeymoon bride.

Damn, she’s so pretty gazing me so fondly and pumping up my pride as a man!

How could’ve I denied any titillation being near her day after day?

Then intellectually, I knew that it was my imouto peering at me from far behind Leafa’s eyes, but the person there wasn’t exactly the same one here in a universe of high-fidelity role-play, and just like what happens too often with actors, method-acting so deep often creates a persona startling different from its poser. Like with Marilyn Monroe and Vivian Leigh, I would not be the first or last guy to only fall in love with a shy and bland ingenue’s far more exciting and dazzling role character.

And geese, being with Leafa was like the Fourth of July every day.

“Leafa...” I began, on desperate impulse skipping any standard stumbling preamble stall and just blurting it out. “Leafa, I think...I think I love you.”

The sylph smiled like a faithfully puppy being patted on the head. “I love you too, onii-chan!”

“No, no, I mean -- I love you, not like an onii-chan,” I stressed and her quizzically blinking emerald eyes grew wide with a dawning long realized hope and wish matching the sunny bloom on her face and her smile was a nova.

“Oh!! -- Oh -- Oh , onii-chan --!!” she cried, nearly bowling me over hugging me tight and I indulged the forbidden sensation of warm soft melons mashing against my pounding chest. 

Just like the same warm soft fleshy pillows that one night long ago smothered my face and sobs in Suguha’s tight sympathetic embrace when I thought I lost Asuna to matrimony with a traitorous bastard who literally caged her in VR, then on another night way later when I received Asuna’s staggering text message -- not a phone call or even a voice message but a lame text! -- that she fell head over heels for some dashing older (i.e. “mature”) doctor in Brazilla. Those same nice soft firm pillows again smothered and soaked my rejection’s sobs over Asuna that time, but now this time, they pressed me only for us.

Geese, Leafa’s feels so soft and plump and snug, just like Suguha’s IRL. I wonder whose is --

Geese -- why’d that pop into my head?

I gently held Leafa back while she wiped her eyes.

“So Kirito-kun finally kept his promise from our moonlight waltz above the clouds!” she sniffled with joy.

“Uh, I guess, but that wasn’t what moved me. I just -- realized after all this time being with you just how special and unique you are to me.”

“Onii-chan, if you only knew how hard it was holding it back! Wishing and hoping and praying for this day!”

God, I have to correct her. Remove a guilt-laden reminder...

“Leafa, I never want you to feel tortured like that. But...there’s something more...something...” 

“What’s that, onii-chan?”

“I -- I know it’s habit, but -- please. Just call me Kirito, okay?”

Leafa blushed like it was a minor foible. “Oh, I -- I forgot. Keeping in game character --”

“No, that’s not it,” I gingerly began, hoping I wasn’t about to break a bubble. “Leafa, when I said I love you, I just meant -- you.”

“I understand, oni -- Kirito-kun.”

“No, you don’t understand. I love you, Leafa. Only you.”

“I don’t doubt you’ll always be faithful to me, Kirito-kun.”

This is exasperating!

“Leafa, you don’t get it. I only love you! This you! Leafa you!”

Leafa prettily frowned with puzzled emerald eyes that blinked trying to grasp my meaning then glanced down at herself as though checking her appearance then back up at me. I could see Suguha’s visage emerging from emerald depths, crashing this fantasy bubble.

Damn!

“You mean -- ‘this’ me??” she asked in a bemused modest voice, and I didn’t know how to answer but let her grope my meaning. “You -- only love me this way, onii-chan? But -- I thought you loved me --”

“Leafa --” I gripped her shoulders. I felt like I was talking to an undesired middleman now, but I had to salvage this but quick. The girl far behind Leafa’s eyes had suffered and pined too long to have her wildest dream snatched from her. “Leafa, ever since we did quests together, I’ve grown to know you as a woman -- a unique person apart. A sympathetic sylph who pushed dozens of quests on me to keep me too busy from crying over losing Asuna. A woman stepped into the great gouge in my heart after she walked away. I can never forget how you saved me from eating myself up over Asuna.”

“Uh, you’re -- welcome, onii-chan...but -- I’m still me -- Suguha --” Leafa saw me wince at that and she slightly frowned in slight dismay. I hastily stroked her shoulders and bore into her eyes.

“Leafa, please understand where I’m coming from!” I effusively pleaded, “My instincts, my habits, my gut, my -- honor towards my imouto won’t allow me to confess that to Sugu’s face.  I can’t even utter her name here without seeing the image of me -- her onii-chan, pouncing his imouto like a lion on a lamb! It rakes my face and manhood and sense of decency and faithfulness as her onii-chan! . But all that doesn’t exist here. There’s nothing to damn or condemn my feelings for you, Leafa, because here you’re not my imouto but a whole other lovely woman. No blood, no relation. My manhood -- my honor -- my view of myself as a proper onii-chan -- even God would be good with that. Can you understand?”

Yes, I was being technically dishonest -- even ironically deceitful -- talking to the hidden Other beyond Leafa’s emerald gaze, but for once I could exploit the culture that had long been drilled into us. Leafa’s root was highly intelligent, but IRL was also very adherent despite a tomboy clock.

Heed our teachings, Suguha! May the strength of Japanese values and tradition bolster my words!

Wistful emerald eyes peered back if wrestling with my passionate assertions and her true-life vanity then Leafa’s shoulders slumped with a vapid nod.

“I -- I understand, onii-chan,” she almost ruefully whispered.

Yes!!

I wanted to grin and pet her head but that would’ve been worst than wrong now. Suguha’s accepted Leafa’s role in achieving what she only dreampt of IRL, and now I had to make her know just how much I regarded Leafa’s roots;

“Leafa, when you found out I was also Kazuto outside the World Tree gates that day, it pained me to see your shock and tears, then later hear outside Sugu’s room how she always felt about me. It tugged my heart like you can’t believe but I had to stuff it because I was hot on Asuna, but still, I felt like a real heel and a half not seeing the signs all along of how deep you felt about me. So totally blind and stupid --”

“Don’t blame yourself, onii-chan!” Leafa passionately blurted, grasping my hands. “You were only being faithful to your honor being my protective onii-chan! You couldn’t know what I hid in my heart from you!”

Thanks for defending me, Suguha!

“I’m really glad you understand, Leafa. I know it couldn’t been easy closing those feelings for me back up again after that waltz, but since then you honorably kept the green monster from destroying our home relationship until Asuna did that to ours.”

Leafa demurely smiled, but I’ll leave out my harsh belief that Suguha secretly wished Asuna would never wake again in the hospital after SAO. It was horrid to sense that, but on the other hand Asuna was Suguha’s secret rival and love can get mercilessly Darwinian at times. It was that quality that helped make Leafa such a forward and possessive personality apart from Suguha’s mute desire to be so. Like they say, all’s fair in love and war.

Leafa looked prettily bemused and struggling to say something she dreaded being answered. “What’s wrong, Leafa? Say it.” 

“I just -- I’m -- a little confused because if you love -- Leafa, it stands to reason that you love me -- Suguha, yes??” she asked with a worried dewy gaze under my gnashed lower lip.

Damn, Suguha’s so damn logical the wrong damn times! I can see where this was going so I’d better derail her train of thought and wistful hope pronto!

“Er, obviously so, Leafa!” And I hoped my big fat lie wasn’t so, “But, just as you realized just now, I’m trying to get over years as a proper and dutiful onii-chan only regarding Sugu as my imouto. It’s very very difficult for these new feelings to cross into real-life like this without feeling guilt and a pervert. That’s why being with you -- Leafa -- is -- is like being blinded from Sugu’s face and person and just letting her personality shine through. So yes, you can say I love Sugu thru a pink lens.”

That was off-the-wall clever I thought because it made Leafa quietly mull over a new vantage.

“I -- don’t wish to cause onii-chan any angst,” Leafa softly said like a proper self-immolating wife. “With great difficulty, I -- shall honor your regard of me here.”

Yes!!

“Good girl.” I said, petting beaming Leafa’s wonderfully alien cornsilk hair.

Great! I’m over the hump!

Once Suguha accepts the concept that I’ll only be fulfilling and addressing her desires through an alter-ego anything else is just fine print. Now if Suguha would now just slink back behind the curtain and let the star of this show come out and shine so we finally launch a normal pairing --

“So...do you think you loved me -- Suguha -- all along, onii-chan?” Leafa added almost gingerly, testingly.

Ditto damnit!

Leafa might look a beautiful blond bimbo but she’d Suguha’s wits and brains and worst, knew me backwards and forward like even Asuna never could. If I was going to lie to her it had to be a whopper of a confession anchored in unadmitted fact.

“Uh...maybe that’s why I put off being closer to you when I was little. Maybe I felt the first stirrings of these feelings for you and I felt awkward and afraid and ran from you.” 

“Afraid - of me??” blurted Leafa in a welcome vent of relief.

“Uh, well, most boys think girls are silly and yucky that age, right?” I defended with a grin. “That doesn’t mean that they still weren’t there, only my onii-chan duties put it in blind slow smoldering. I mean, sometimes when I saw you growing up, I wondered a little about it on and off, but never let it get past more than that.”

“I understand how you felt perfectly, onii-chan! It’s so painful to never share your heart!”

“I know, that’s why I want all that pain Sugu kept inside to go away forever.”

“But you’re asking me to keep my heart and feelings buried back home, is that true, onii-chan?”

I smiled and gently shook her bared shoulders. “Look, Leafa, I know I can go back IRL right now and Sugu will be there exactly like you are knowing all this, but I’ll still be facing my sister again, and maybe if I really pushed one day I can get over my proper onii-chan wall from talking and touching with Sugu this way, but I think it’d be dangerous because chances are that our affections will slip outside the house and our reputations and family honor will be ruined. I can’t do that, so we have to keep our affections here, safe and secret.”

“Only here??” The look of dismal disappointment on Leafa’s face was too cutely precious and she shook her head with doubt.

Geese, is Suguha kidding?? What the hell is she wishing between us IRL??

Shove a fire hose in your panties, imouto-chan!

“Uh, that’s the only safe way we can be together, Leafa. Surely you see that.”

She sighed a waifish bittersweet sigh, “That’s -- going to be hard, onii-chan. Very hard to sit across the table or alone in the dojo to not touch you or open my heart to you --”

“Leafa --” I semi-promised “--one day I’ll break this block and have you as you are, but I’m not going to ruin your life being caught my mom and dad and others in expressing our feelings. Picture that!”

Leafa ruefully nodded and her bosom swelled even more with a heaving sigh. “Of course, you are right, onii-chan. I’ll do my best and play the proper imouto-chan to her onii-chan back home but my heart won’t be in it.”

I assuagingly rocked her shoulders. “Just stay the same Suguha IRL and habit and routine will carry you through between being your true self here, okay?” 

She lamely nodded again, but that’s good! The more and longer Leafa and Suguha’s traits and characteristics are isolated from another to evolve apart in different worlds the better!

Leafa soberly nodded then suddenly perked up if she saw a silver lining; “But that also means onii-chan is free to love me here without strings or regret, yes??”

“Here?”

Shit. I walked into that!

Long suffering Suguha badly wants to seal the deal in VR or IR, yet the irony is that’s exactly what I yearn now. My heart throbbed for Leafa and my loins ached even more, to feel far more than just her warm fleshy melons mashed against my chest...

But not quite yet.

Not as long as Suguha’s ecstatic joy and relief at my supposed finally acknowledged sentiments toward her could impulsively spill the beans back home...

”Uh, sure, Leafa, in a little while. First I need to check out how Suguha acts feeling so excited and glad and whether she could keep it under a lid around other people. Again, she has to act totally normal back home and not give me any funny looks that’ll tip off Mom or anyone else who know us IRL that something’s going on. That’s very important, right?”

Leafa looked a touch flustered then grudgingly sighed as though Suguha’s content with just finally having me one way or another, even from behind a VR mask. “I’ll behave, onii-chan. I’ve waited sooo long! It’ll be hard, but I’ll behave, promise.”

“That’s good, but it’s not just that,” I continued, trying not to sound magnanimous, “I also want to make sure that Sugu is really really sure about this next step, since she treasures her honor and virtue so, you know?”

Almost comically casual, Leafa gave light shrug. “What does it matter here, onii-chan?”

Now THAT took me aback!

“Uh, er, -- I --  I just thought that -- that -- it’d mean something, keeping one’s soul pure to my innocent imouto.”

Leafa giggled then almost bashfully answered my puzzled frown, “Onii-chan, I’ve been with you every night every way I could think since I was thirteen, so my soul cannot be more corrupted!”

“Uh??” I mulled then blushed myself at her coy candor. “Oh, I get it. Is that why you take such hot showers getting up in the morning??” I quipped and Leafa giggled like a little girl and looked up at me with a headlight smile and shimmering dewy eyes.

“I promise you, onii-chan, I’ll have no regrets! Not a one!.”

“Kirito.”

“Er, Kirito-kun -- sorry.”

“You’ll get used to it soon enough, Leafa,” I said, kissing her creamy cheek but reining back my throbbing pounding yearn to go lower. As anxious I am to do Leafa I just can’t with her upfront in Leafa mode like this, with the specter of popping my imouto's cherry hovering over me. I need to get back our quest routine and totally forgetting Leafa’s roots again then love with a clear amnesic conscience. Plus having Leafa kills two birds with one stone since I won’t be violating Suguha’s honor even while fulfilling her wildest wish.

Leafa interrupted my thoughts with emerald orbs brimming with dew and petal-soft pink lips drawing close and pecking mine to tease and whet and tingle my clinging answer as I pressed back and indulged the awe of our first kiss and tasted her deep yearning and anxiousness while twin soft melons impatiently heaved and buckled and mashed against my thumping chest...

Yes.

This is sweet, to feel a new wild tug, as though wistfulness trying to blur Suguha’s pert tomboy face with Leafa’s into someone lovely and new.

Leafa Plus...

Awesome.

No, on this beckoning sunny balmy sea of soft flowers, I don’t think I’ll keep them waiting...

Yes, intellectually, logically, uneasily, I know I’ll be making remote disguised love to Suguha in her artificial dream, finally fulfilling my long willing and eager imouto’s desires, but Leafa’s face and persona will soon erase any guilt or qualms or misgivings or memories I have of her, at least till log-off. For certain Leafa will bloom and evolve here as she plays out Suguha’s distant stifled desires, and maybe soon my jealous imouto might even seduce herself into morphing fully into Leafa to totally engage her passion for me. Or maybe Leafa my love will totally part ways with her root by the split personality route and grow into her own cherry blossom branch here.

Either way it’s going to be an exciting ride, and all without touching a singe downy hair of my imouto's precious honor and virtue.

The best of both worlds.

Yes, I’ll work long and hard to help that happen.

Real hard.

I've been thinking about writing here for quite some time and i don't even know if this is the place to post this.

I've been fat since i was 10 years old and i'm getting fatter each day. I've tried to lose weight several times but i can't seen to keep it up. My friends and family(except my girlfriend) honestly don't belive I can do it anymore and tbh, thats my fault.

**My Routine ""Problem""** 

 I'm on a Engineering Internship during the day and Engineering school during afternoon/night.

* MON/WED

5:30am. Wake up
3:15pm. Arrive home from work
3:40 Gym
5:00pm. Go to university(Class 6:30pm) 
11:00pm. Arrive home (sleep asap)

* TUE/THU

Those are the days that i work my ass off
5:30am. Wake up
3:15pm. Arrive home from work 
3:40pm. Go to university(Class 4:40pm) 
11:00pm. Arrive home  (sleep asap)

3:40 Gym (NO CLASS FRI)

* SAT/SUN

Usually i spend time with my friends,girlfriend and family.
8:00am Wake up
9:00am SHOULD GO TO Gym (I'm working on it)

So, the problem is, on TUE/THU i can't cook a proper meal and spend basically 16 to 18 hours away from home. **How do you eat  ""easy to carry"" food without compromising your health?**

There are good parts to the job, but it's not the daily work I enjoy.  They reimburse my college tuition, offer training I've taken advantage of, and the insurance is fantastic.  I had the chance to study and contribute to several different network projects, and loved having time to review deeper aspects of it.  For example one project was about how to defend against caller id spoofing, so I got to go through how the call is setup/torn down, how signaling works, protocols, etc. to understand how everything works together.  

I know they have internship programs &amp; other positions available, but every time I approach managers about any different positions they just shrug and point me to the company job site- they only know about the call center(s), maybe retail store environments, nothing technical.

I have had a couple of job leads working for satellite installation that I'll be following up on, but how do I handle this with my current employer?  If I was working a different position, especially one that suits my degree, this would make me a very happy employee.  I actually do like the company and don't want to burn any bridges, but I'm starting to very seriously consider other options.

4qqzyb,2305,2016-07-01,It's not undemocratic to resist the Brexit result.,retroper,unitedkingdom,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/4qqzyb/its_not_undemocratic_to_resist_the_brexit_result/,"I've seen a lot of Remainers saying things along the lines of 'we should respect the vote - that's democracy', as well as Leavers saying 'Let it go, you lost'. I think they're wrong.

[I posted this comment in another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/4qk85c/liberal_democrat_membership_surging_with_one/d4uitys), explaining why the referendum was undemocratic, and why I believe it's democratically imperative to fight the result if one wants to Remain. It had some positive feedback (thanks for the gold, whoever that was!), so I'm posting it here:

Firstly, living in a democracy doesn't mean acquiescing to decisions you don't like. A part of living in a democracy means holding true to your own position and fighting for it using rhetorical and political means. Just think how the course of history would have gone if people had said 'Oh, well that's just the will of the people' - progress relies on people fighting even when they've lost to a majority. What if Ireland had voted against gay marriage? 'Well, that's that'?

In that respect, it would be deeply undemocratic, not to mention rather nihilistic, to see this 'decision' (it's not a decision in any meaningful sense - it's an advisory referendum and as such is irrelevant in any legal sense), or any decision you disagree with and say 'the people have spoken' and summarily pack away any objection or attempt to change the situation.

Secondly, in respect to this specific referendum, we have a referendum that was called by a man (who didn't want to call it anyway) who won less than 40% of the vote - roughly 17% of the whole UK population voted for this man. It was openly and unarguably won on a platform of lies - people thought they were voting to protect the NHS, to protect jobs, to block immigration, to protect fish stocks. You may differ but I believe an uninformed (or misled) vote is as much 'democratic' as is a craps shoot. The election was won with a 52% majority - correct me if I'm wrong ( /u/ThickTarget *has* corrected me on this, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/4qqzyb/its_not_undemocratic_to_resist_the_brexit_result/d4v7iu0) ), but a +/- 2% variance would be laughed at if used statistically to show any form of certainty. We say we're 'fifty fifty' on something when we're undecided; it's absurd that this referendum, with such impacts on our national life, could be 'decided' with anything less than 60% in either direction. If a democracy is a means to allow compromise between competing claims, this is no meaningful compromise.

Thirdly, you have the fact that we can't say *which Brexit won*. 'The people' have given a mandate to Leave, but the Leave campaigns fought for various goals, which are often contradictory. Did we vote for the Leave that believed we could be a stronger economic power by unshackling ourselves from the EU, while maintaining free trade with the EU, and thus maintaining freedom of movement? Because that's a very different Leave to the one that believes in limiting EU migration in preference of migration from the Commonwealth and elsewhere, which in turn is different to the Leave that wants to kick foreigners out (it's become clear that *some* people believed their Leave vote would see all 'foreigners' ejected within weeks). All of these are different to the Leave vote that didn't think it'd win and was just a protest.

At no point were we offered plans or real ideas for what a Brexit would mean. We had no choice of what kind of Brexit was offered, no way to say which side 'won'. We've had the disparate wills of disparate peoples with disparate aims lumped together and told they've 'won'.

To see how absurd this is, consider instead a referendum where we were offered:

* Stay in the EU
* Stay in the EU but make anyone who's from outside the EU/isn't white leave
* Leave the EU, but negotiate a 'Norway Deal' with free trade and free movement
* Leave the EU, make all EU migrants leave the UK
* Leave the EU and try to create a trade bloc with the commonwealth and/or Anglosphere
* I have no confidence anymore in any of our political leaders

Excuse some of the more glib-sounding options, but I believe they represent some of the (stereotyped) true intentions of some of those voting Leave. Either way, it should be clear that had we been given a choice between Remain and the meaningfully different Brexit options, Remain would have a clear majority.

Fourthly, some make the clear argument that we live in a representative democracy. We have elected officials whose duty it is to inform themselves to the best of their ability and then to represent those who elected them. The degree to which they do their jobs well is open to debate, as is the system through which they work, but this is the form of democracy that we have. As such, a referendum is an anathema to our democracy, and should be seen as undemocratic through that lens.

Fifthly, as [I've said elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/4qeyj9/petition_bring_in_a_proportional_representation/d4spca1), one could argue that the emergence of this referendum can be put down to various symptoms of our FPTP electoral system - our lack of PR has allowed for tensions to rise and anti-government sentiment to grow, with neither sentiment finding valid political output. From this perspective, the very existence of the referendum is only made possible through a lack of effective democracy in this country.

So, we have a referendum called by a guy with a tiny mandate, caused by a lack of democracy, held contrary to our democratic ideals, with an unclear proposition, presented to an ill-informed and deliberately misled populace, who voted for a lumped-together variety of contradictory reasons, to win by a majority that only just took them past the half-way point.

To rub salt into that wound, as things stand, we'll have the decision on whether, when and how to leave the EU taken by an unelected PM, facing an 'opposition' who will likely soon be bringing in unpaid interns to act as front benchers.

And I've not even mentioned the fact that two of the countries in this union voted decisively to Remain, yet will likely be dragged out by the other two countries.

BUT! It's not binding. The referendum could have been legally binding, like the AV vote or the Scottish independence referendum were, forcing the government to act on the result. It wasn't - it's an advisory referendum. It is wholly legal, and entirely within the 'rules of the game' of representative democracy, for the government to ignore the vote, hold off on acting on it, choose its own terms for a forward path, hold a second referendum, and so on. This is how the vote was set up, within the democracy. It's not undemocratic to recognise that and call on parliament to act to represent your views, as it its role.

If you voted Remain and believe that the Leave vote, if carried out, would be a Bad Thing for the UK, then it would be absurd to avoid using any and all *legal* means to push government not to act on the result of an advisory referendum.

The whole thing, from start to finish, is a massive exercise in the collapse of democracy, the fall of reasoned politics and government to mob sentiment and blind confusion. There's nothing undemocratic in seeking to reverse that.

&gt;Me: I'll try to fix it and let you know.

The user leaves the office and I try the usual tapping, software to fix them and power cycles but no luck, the 3 or 4 pixels keep shining brights on a black screen. Mind you these pixels were not grouped. After a while, my manager walks up to me.

&gt;Manager: don't worry, this is all covered by our full warranty/insurance we have, anything that happens to that thing is covered. Even the idiot who closed his laptop last year with a pen between the keyboard and the screen, they just fixed it.

So I called IBM and tried to report the laptop broken with the dead pixels, and of course....this specific thing does not fall under warranty or insurance. Turns out the pixels were not grouped close enough, even though it was super annoying shining bright it was not a defect according to IBM. 

So I hang up and start to tell my Manager:
&gt;Me: So, manager, this is not covered by any waranty, should I just give it back to the user

&gt;Manager: No give it to me.

So I proceed to give the notebook to him and then he opens it....

Please help me, I'm in a time of great need, please be patient, I know it's a long post.  :)


My name is Frank, and I'm a rising senior studying marketing, and I would really love to have a fall 2016 internship relating to business/marketing at one of the largest sports media/broadcasting companies in the world. They are actually in my hometown, and I've interned there last fall but not in marketing, but in something unrelated to my major (tech services). 

At the time it was hard to network there, and I wasn't able to make most of the opportunity, which is really sad. 

I applied there every season so far, but no response from the hiring department, even though I feel I left that internship a year ago on a good note. 

This fall, I'm applying there again but in marketing or business. I don't have any corporate sports marketing experience, just that previous internship at the company. I have been working at a small construction firm on the marketing/business side. I also interned at a small event marketing company for a few weeks, but it was not a good experience for me. Besides those three irrelevant experiences, I have some relevant coursework and a couple of activities on my resume which could just slightly help. 


The Main Point: I'm super passionate about working there, I want to learn, and I would try my absolute best at the internship if I got it. So many other applicants have better experience than me, so how can I stand out from the rest, and at least give my self a shot at being looked at? 

I cannot imagine myself working anywhere else. I feel everyone writes on their resume that this is their ideal company, and they're ""passionate"" but is there anything I can write on my cover letter or resume which would help me get an internship there? 

I'm a friendly guy, who's eager to learn, and very driven, it's just been hard finding relevant experience to put on a resume, that's the only thing that hurts me. 


Any help would be GREATLY appreciated. I'm putting all my effort on this internship.

THANK YOU!"

4qsjh1,14,2016-07-01,How to improve your movement / different button layout tips etc,DarcHK,CruciblePlaybook,https://www.reddit.com/r/CruciblePlaybook/comments/4qsjh1/how_to_improve_your_movement_different_button/,"Before we start i am on PS4 and the vid/post is tailored as such.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwIf16JNXgg

Back yet again with another hopefully helpful video/post! I will be going over what can be done to increase / enhance your overall movement with a more in depth look at shotgun movement especially. As usual I will be splitting the video into sections with the best controller layouts, which sensitivity is preferable and purchasable items being some of them. I tried to use OBS to capture the controller cam in the video but it rendered out looking like shit so I apologize for the quality…

First lets start with controller layouts – 

Default-
The standard layout that you are automatically running when you first play Destiny. Now I, maybe like many of you jumped in learned default and thought that was it but nope there are better options. Default restricts your movement by requiring you to let go of the analog stick unless you are running claw which we will go through later or have a modified controller. As such it is a bad option for reaching maximum movement potential.

Jumper-
To reach optimum movement freedom you need to be able to jump while maintaining control of your analog sticks. Destiny only offers one option for thisas a standard layout and it is jumper also often referred to as bumper jumper. Lets have a closer look at the Jumper layout. So your jump button is now L1, Your Super is X and your melee is R3. This layout is going to let you have freedom of movement to turn as you jump. It will be hard to adjust to at first but it is well worth sticking it out. The best place to practice is again going to be patrol. No pressure practice. It will take hours to get used to but I guarantee it will improve your game.

Claw-
Claw is accomplished by using the analog stick with your right thump then using your next finger to press the face buttons . Claw is a great method for maintaining default settings but will require you to change how you hold the controller. This is for the more hardcore and often most of the players that run this option have been doing so since Halo etc so think nothing of it.  New users to this method often complain of pain in their hand / fingers after gaming sessions due to its uncomfortable and overstretching position. Claw was a big thing in many fps games and will help you to keep control of your analog sticks while still maintaining the ability to press the face buttons etc. As I do not run nor have I ever used the claw method personally I took my questions to a beast of a player called AEGabriel that is one of the best titan claw players and he suggested that claw should feel natural and if it didn’t you would be much better off using Jumper and not forcing it.

Modified controllers – 
Let me first say I am not endorsed by any company to talk about their products. Personally I use a Scuf. What is a Scuf? A Scuf is a modified controller with 2 paddles on the back that can be mapped to buttons of your choosing. I have mine set to Jump on the right paddle and crouch on the left paddle. This allows for total freedom of movement as I can jump / slide turn all at the same time without my fingers ever leaving the analog stick. It took me maybe 6 hours or so to get comfy with it and maybe a week of daily play to get so fluid that I no longer have to think about pressing the paddles. Scufs while amazing are expensive but if you have the money and are willing to invest they are a great purchase and will improve your movement massively. If not my personal recommendation would be to learn jumper. Jumper once mastered will improve your game and give you better movement in general. It will take time and you will make mistakes but stick with it. 

Lastly specifically shotgun movement – 
The reason Scufs are great for shotgunning movement is that it allows you to slide and jump freely without letting go of the analog stick. This can be achieved on jumper but it will require a little further customisation and definitely more play time to get used to it. Basically we are going to change your grenade to O (ps4) and your slide to R1 and this can be done with the button customisation tool within your ps4. (visual guide in vid)
Throwing grenades with O is going to take some time getting used to alongside the new jump etc but if you main shotgun and want to peak out your movement this is an option you may wish to explore. Remember if you really can’t get used to it at all or you hate how it feels you CAN change back.

Sensitivity – 
I use 5 sens. This gives great turning speed while still maintaining long range primary shot. After asking around it seems that most snipers run 3-4 and most shotgunners 4-6. You need a slightly higher sens on a shotgun to give you that quick snapping movement to targets. There are those that run 10 sens and do well with it but they are only few. Again pick a sens and try to stick with it. If you are switching from a 3-5 your primary shot will suffer initially but will be regained with practice.

Kontrol Freeks –  Now I was super sceptical of these initially but I do feel that they work and work well. KFs are basically add ons for your exisiting analog sticks. Typically they increase the height of the stick by 40% but intern this also provides you with a 40% more increased range of motion which will help on snapping to targets etc. KFs also require less force to manoeuvre and as such you are able to make lighter movements and also quicker movements then you would without them. Personally I also find it so much easier to sprint with them and it requires hardly any effort at all.

Last few tips – 
Vibration  - Turn it off. It is a stress mechanic and will no way or form help your aim or your movement. In fact it is more likely to do the opposite.

Controller – If you can, play with your wire connected to reduce latency. Failing that make sure your controller is always charged. While a low power controller latency may not be physically noticeable it does exist. 

That’s all for now and my next video / post  will be a closer look at warlock movement in action with different points of view etc so that I may further explain the actions required. If you have any questions, feedback, think I said anything wrong or have any tips that I have missed please let me know. 

As always thank you for watching.

Please help me, I'm in a time of great need, please be patient, I know it's a long post. :)

My name is Frank, and I'm a rising senior studying marketing, and I would really love to have a fall 2016 internship relating to business/marketing at one of the largest sports media/broadcasting companies in the world. They are actually in my hometown, and I've interned there last fall but not in marketing, but in something unrelated to my major (tech services).

At the time it was hard to network there, and I wasn't able to make most of the opportunity, which is really sad.

I applied there every season so far, but no response from the hiring department, even though I feel I left that internship a year ago on a good note.

This fall, I'm applying there again but in marketing or business. I don't have any corporate sports marketing experience, just that previous internship at the company. I have been working at a small construction firm on the marketing/business side. I also interned at a small event marketing company for a few weeks, but it was not a good experience for me. Besides those three irrelevant experiences, I have some relevant coursework and a couple of activities on my resume which could just slightly help.

The Main Point: I'm super passionate about working there, I want to learn, and I would try my absolute best at the internship if I got it. So many other applicants have better experience than me, so how can I stand out from the rest, and at least give my self a shot at being looked at?

I cannot imagine myself working anywhere else. I feel everyone writes on their resume that this is their ideal company, and they're ""passionate"" but is there anything I can write on my cover letter or resume which would help me get an internship there?

I'm a friendly guy, who's eager to learn, and very driven, it's just been hard finding relevant experience to put on a resume, that's the only thing that hurts me.

Any help would be GREATLY appreciated. I'm putting all my effort on this internship.

THANK YOU!"
4qsl9x,0,2016-07-01,How to optimize / improve your character movement and button layout tips - originally an r/crucibleplaybook post,DarcHK,DestinyTheGame,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/4qsl9x/how_to_optimize_improve_your_character_movement/,"Before we start i am on PS4 and the vid/post is tailored as such.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwIf16JNXgg

Back yet again with another hopefully helpful video/post! I will be going over what can be done to increase / enhance your overall movement with a more in depth look at shotgun movement especially. As usual I will be splitting the video into sections with the best controller layouts, which sensitivity is preferable and purchasable items being some of them. I tried to use OBS to capture the controller cam in the video but it rendered out looking like shit so I apologize for the quality…

First lets start with controller layouts – 

Default-
The standard layout that you are automatically running when you first play Destiny. Now I, maybe like many of you jumped in learned default and thought that was it but nope there are better options. Default restricts your movement by requiring you to let go of the analog stick unless you are running claw which we will go through later or have a modified controller. As such it is a bad option for reaching maximum movement potential.

Jumper-
To reach optimum movement freedom you need to be able to jump while maintaining control of your analog sticks. Destiny only offers one option for thisas a standard layout and it is jumper also often referred to as bumper jumper. Lets have a closer look at the Jumper layout. So your jump button is now L1, Your Super is X and your melee is R3. This layout is going to let you have freedom of movement to turn as you jump. It will be hard to adjust to at first but it is well worth sticking it out. The best place to practice is again going to be patrol. No pressure practice. It will take hours to get used to but I guarantee it will improve your game.

Claw-
Claw is accomplished by using the analog stick with your right thump then using your next finger to press the face buttons . Claw is a great method for maintaining default settings but will require you to change how you hold the controller. This is for the more hardcore and often most of the players that run this option have been doing so since Halo etc so think nothing of it.  New users to this method often complain of pain in their hand / fingers after gaming sessions due to its uncomfortable and overstretching position. Claw was a big thing in many fps games and will help you to keep control of your analog sticks while still maintaining the ability to press the face buttons etc. As I do not run nor have I ever used the claw method personally I took my questions to a beast of a player called AEGabriel that is one of the best titan claw players and he suggested that claw should feel natural and if it didn’t you would be much better off using Jumper and not forcing it.

Modified controllers – 
Let me first say I am not endorsed by any company to talk about their products. Personally I use a Scuf. What is a Scuf? A Scuf is a modified controller with 2 paddles on the back that can be mapped to buttons of your choosing. I have mine set to Jump on the right paddle and crouch on the left paddle. This allows for total freedom of movement as I can jump / slide turn all at the same time without my fingers ever leaving the analog stick. It took me maybe 6 hours or so to get comfy with it and maybe a week of daily play to get so fluid that I no longer have to think about pressing the paddles. Scufs while amazing are expensive but if you have the money and are willing to invest they are a great purchase and will improve your movement massively. If not my personal recommendation would be to learn jumper. Jumper once mastered will improve your game and give you better movement in general. It will take time and you will make mistakes but stick with it. 

Lastly specifically shotgun movement – 
The reason Scufs are great for shotgunning movement is that it allows you to slide and jump freely without letting go of the analog stick. This can be achieved on jumper but it will require a little further customisation and definitely more play time to get used to it. Basically we are going to change your grenade to O (ps4) and your slide to R1 and this can be done with the button customisation tool within your ps4. (visual guide in vid)
Throwing grenades with O is going to take some time getting used to alongside the new jump etc but if you main shotgun and want to peak out your movement this is an option you may wish to explore. Remember if you really can’t get used to it at all or you hate how it feels you CAN change back.

Sensitivity – 
I use 5 sens. This gives great turning speed while still maintaining long range primary shot. After asking around it seems that most snipers run 3-4 and most shotgunners 4-6. You need a slightly higher sens on a shotgun to give you that quick snapping movement to targets. There are those that run 10 sens and do well with it but they are only few. Again pick a sens and try to stick with it. If you are switching from a 3-5 your primary shot will suffer initially but will be regained with practice.

Kontrol Freeks –  Now I was super sceptical of these initially but I do feel that they work and work well. KFs are basically add ons for your exisiting analog sticks. Typically they increase the height of the stick by 40% but intern this also provides you with a 40% more increased range of motion which will help on snapping to targets etc. KFs also require less force to manoeuvre and as such you are able to make lighter movements and also quicker movements then you would without them. Personally I also find it so much easier to sprint with them and it requires hardly any effort at all.

Last few tips – 
Vibration  - Turn it off. It is a stress mechanic and will no way or form help your aim or your movement. In fact it is more likely to do the opposite.

Controller – If you can, play with your wire connected to reduce latency. Failing that make sure your controller is always charged. While a low power controller latency may not be physically noticeable it does exist. 

That’s all for now and my next video / post  will be a closer look at warlock movement in action with different points of view etc so that I may further explain the actions required. If you have any questions, feedback, think I said anything wrong or have any tips that I have missed please let me know. 

As always thank you for watching.

4qsw3i,1,2016-07-01,My (23F) best friend (23M) is constantly being excluded by my other friend (23F).,LauraLeema,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4qsw3i/my_23f_best_friend_23m_is_constantly_being/,"Edit: you guys have definitely helped. Sam and I just need to move on. Thanks for helping me open my eyes.

So, I have known Sam for about 20 years now and I have known Alice for around 15 years. Sam and Alice have known each other for about 10 years, so there is some history there. Sam is my absolute best friend, we didn't like each other while we were the middle school age and younger, but in high school, we clicked and am now the best of friends. He is always there for me and vice versa. Alice had been a close friend of mine for years but slowly have drifted apart. In high school, we have these other friends, A, B, H, and S. After high school, H and S went off to other places and Alice, Sam, A, B, and  I stayed in touch. Sam is the only male in the group, but he is also gay, so it isn't like he is trying to get in anyones' pants in our group. So, I am the only one in the group that doesn't live in the hometown where we grew up, so that left Alice, Sam, A and B together to hang out a lot. So, thanks  to social media, Sam always sees that Alice, A and B  hang  out a lot without inviting him. Also, when I'm in town, Alice will text me to hang out with A and B for a Girls Night. A girls night means that Sam is the only one excluded. Now,  usually I always bring Sam because we're a package deal, but  Alice will plan these when she knows that Sam is working or busy. The thing is, anytime Sam is around Alice, he is always so nice, complimenting her and  asking how is she is and he always invites her to hang out with him at his house and such, but she doesn't always reciprocate. 


Now, this is what most recently happened. I'm away in Boston this summer for an internship, so I haven't been to my hometown in a while. I saw a picture on Alice's snap story of herself, A, B and two other people that I didn't recognize. Sam called me a few days later when we both weren't busy and told me it was H and S, the two girls from high school we haven't seen much of at all. Sam works at a very popular fast food place and both H and S came  in at different times within the same week and Sam, very excited, told them how they should all get together. He brought it up with Alice, B, and A when they had a lunch together, how everyone should hang out. Well, seeing that Snap story picture  from Alice really hurt Sam. He felt betrayed because it was his idea to get everyone together and Alice excluded him. Honestly, I felt like that was such a rude move. Not even a text. 
So, this is where I come in. Alice and her bf are coming up to Boston to visit another friend of hers and we might end up grabbing lunch together. I really want to say something, but I'm not sure how to go about it. It is such an endless cycle of excluding my best friend and I feel like this is the straw that broke the camel's back. Sam says he is done and just wants  to not invite her to hang out with him at his place and  such but I've seen this pattern before and it always goes back to hanging out. How would I approach this if I have dinner with her? 



   
**tl;dr**: My best friend is constantly being excluded by another friend in the group. I'm finally fed up with it and am thinking about confronting her about  it when she is visiting where I am in a few weeks. "

Are they roughly the same questions typically? Is there more live-coding involved in full-time interviews? Do they still ask you basic things such as what is an object and what is a class? etc.
4qt87r,1,2016-07-01,I [25/M] am starting to desire other women but I've been with my girlfriend [24] for 5 years. Not sure how to take it?,isayneigh,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4qt87r/i_25m_am_starting_to_desire_other_women_but_ive/,"I don't know where to start.  I've always been around my gf, not very much time apart.  I've either spent time away from her with my friends who are all guys, or spent time at parties with her and her friends who I was never attracted to.  Suddenly, last summer at an internship, I started making friends with women I was attracted to.  I was flirting, but never more than verbally.  I started to question myself then.

I moved back and everything was good again.  It seems when I'm with her everything is good, I love her company and we get along great.  However, I'm not really attracted to her much anymore.  I'm not repulsed, I'm sort of just indifferent.  We have sex frequently enough, but I don't feel as ""turned on"" as I used to.  More like I'm going through the motions.  But since I was back in the situation where I never had any friends that were girls, I assumed feeling like this was normal after a LTR.  

We moved in together to the location where I had my internship.  Now I'm hanging out with new people, and some attractive women.  I again feel like I'm flirting, but trying to not want to because im in a relationship.

My gf isn't annoying, I'm not frustrated with her ever.  I wish she was on a similar intellectual level as me, but I get past that.  I do feel as though she still needs me to remind her about important adult things like paying car payments, so she lacks some self sufficiency I'd like her to have.  But, the thing that worries me the most is how I feel about these other women and why I'd rather hang out with them without my gf than with both of them.  Or why I'd rather hang out with friends than go home after work with her.  

I guess it's partially I miss the feeling of first entering a relationship, but also it feels stagnant and I don't entirely know why.  I also feel like I should've been in more relationships, as I've only been in 2.  But I tell myself that feeling that way is shallow.  

I know this is all over the place, but I'm just not sure how to take these feelings.  I'm not sure if they're normal in a good relationship, or if it's a sign I need to break things off.  I don't want to feel like I've wasted time, but I also don't want to waste anymore."

I managed to find some helpful responses, but there are other matters I'd appreciate getting to feedback on.

I'm 25 and wrapping up getting my master's degree in applied mathematics and have gained an interest in becoming a data analyst or similarly titled professions, but have no real familiarity with data science courses. I've seen many data analyst positions available though often times they ask for several years experience of which I have none of at the moment. 

My plan is to learn Python, SQL, and familiarize myself with a more statistical approach to Excel, then look for internships prior to getting a job being that it doesn't look likely like I can obtain a job without some experience. I have taken three statistics courses as an undergraduate, though none of which were calculus-based (not sure how greatly this matters). I will be using a textbook to study on my own time that involves Python applied to data science to see how a programming language is used in this context. I'm also still debating whether or not I should learn R. Some people seem to say Python is better or just learning one of the two languages is really all thats necessary. 

This being my situation, I'm wondering if there are other things people might recommend I do or other suggestions that they may have that I've not included. Admittedly, I feel like I didn't get a jump on this quicker and that being 25 is a bit late to just be starting off. Also, thank you for taking the time to read this. I greatly appreciate all the feedback!"

I was pushed into medicine by overbearing parents and I've become disinterested with the hoops and hurdles you have to cross to become a doctor in the US.

Even though my boss and I get along great and everyone tells me that I'm doing great, I know that I'm not. I forgot to check an instrument and screwed up a set of data (which I redid, which put me behind). And on top of this, I was asked to help with something outside of my project when I have free time, which I never have (I don't even take 10 mins for lunch), and the one who runs that keeps asking me to help and I don't have time and I'm letting her down. And I just feel like I could be doing so much better and that they could have hired a much better intern, but they hired me, and I have to give a big presentation on my findings at the end of the summer and I'm worried about that, too, because I have to put the presentation together and I just hope I have enough data to do so. Which I should, but things keep going wrong with my instruments, which sets me back, too, and I can't prevent that.

I want to do a good project and make the company proud. It's not even that I desperately want them to rehire me. I just don't want to ruin a huge research and development project and have their company blacklist me to other companies and I'll never be able to find a job again. Oh, and I'd ruin a giant scientific experiment, which is probably worse. But I'm just so slow and I screwed up once in my first month and I just don't believe that I'm actually doing well. At all. Should I ask my boss and my team if we can maybe have a meeting to discuss my shortcomings and where I cna improve? Should I stay over hours/weekends more?

I spend a large portion of my free time on the computer, I've built a few computers, I help friends and family with their computers, I already know some C programming and am currently learning Java, so I think CS will be a decent fit for me. With my current savings I should be able to graduate debt free.

The only thing I'm worried about is my age. Would companies be willing to hire a 30 year old graduate? Would companies be willing to hire an older person for internships? I'm already aware ageism is fairly prevalent in the technology industries.

I have a master's degree in computer science/engineering, and I specialized more in low-level programing. I did 2 two internships that went great  but I didn't start working yet. I am really passionate about understanding what's happening in the machine, playing with arduino, embedded systems, that kind of things. 

But I am also *very* passionate about traveling, and I want to start my career abroad. So a while after graduating I went to Brazil to find my first job there (already lived there 1 year during my studies and loved it), but I haven't found anything yet and my visa will expire soon.

The idea of going back to my country is a bit heart-breaking and I was preparing myself to it, but I got an offer for a job that might be interesting but I don't really feel it. (I'm more of a C/C++ guy, and the job is about managing a big system in Visual Basic, with some SQL. They're proposing it to me because I know a bit of lots of things and they want someone quite independent).

So I think the best choice would be to refuse it and to find something better in Europe, but I'd like to have some inputs about it. If I start working with Visual Basic it will be quite a struggle to find a job related to embedded systems afterwards, right? Did you already face a choice like this (personal fulfillment vs. professional fulfillment)? What happened?

I'm 20 years old and have to live at home for the summer since college is out. I've been an atheist since I was probably 16 and been hiding it from my parents. They are pretty radical Christians. So as an atheist I've been forced into activities such as protesting outside planned parenthood and going on pilgrimages to eastern european countries where kids claimed to see Mary and sleeping on top of rocky mountains there. I'm signed up by my mom do do adoration in a chapel alone once a week for an hour and a half from 3-4:40 AM. In high school they made me go to a random guy I didn't know's house which was used as a meeting place for students of a local college christian group. (I didn't even go to that college!)Not normal Christian stuff :/

I've been pretty good at hiding everything with the goal that when I graduate I can move out and finally live my life. However last week my parents found out I had sex with my girlfriend. This was a disaster, we had a family meeting, forced me to go to confession, make me wear blessed medals, spread blessed salt in my room. I hate this so much why can't they just let me live my life?

They don't let me drive places because If I use their car ""I might go have sex and then the sin is on them for letting me use their property to commit sin."" 

The way I ""got out of it"" is the same way I've handled everything for the past years, I just pretend that I'm having a spiritual struggle and go along with the confession, the family praying etc.  I just try to be as agreeable as possible and it sucks but I see it as kind of a ""tax"" I pay to enjoy all the aspects of my life like having a house and food, and my parents paying 1/4 of my college. 

Just now my mom came in and had a big conversation about porn. She asked if I used it. I thought she might have had proof so I again admitted and said it's a spiritual struggle and now I'm being signed up for a support group in a church basement led by my friend's dad. FUCK THIS. I just want to live a life not having every aspect controlled by a fucking 2000 year old book and the words of random eastern european kids. 

Now they are even talking about not letting me go back to college. Since I might sin there and an education isn't worth my eternal soul. FUCK

Here's the thing, I know what I need to do too. I need to convince them let me go back to school, all I need is one more semester, I'm in a good field and a good student so I'm confident If I try hard enough I can get  an internship for next summer so I can be independent. 

The problem is now the time between now and then is going to be the worst shit. I have to adore christ in a chapel at 3:00 am, I have to talk about praying away porn with my friends dad in the church basement and I have to pretend I'm enjoying it and that it's helping me ""recover""

I've only ever told a few people I'm an atheist and the only one I'm still close with is away in the army so it's hard to talk to him. So for now I just had to rant about this somewhere. If you have any advice please feel free to give it. But for now I'm just going to study and work my ass off to get an internship and get out of this fucking life. "

The way I ""got out of it"" is the same way I've handled everything for the past years, I just pretend that I'm having a spiritual struggle and go along with the confession, the family praying etc.  I just try to be as agreeable as possible and it sucks but I see it as kind of a ""tax"" I pay to enjoy all the aspects of my life like having a house and food, and my parents paying 1/4 of my college. 

Just now my mom came in and had a big conversation about porn. She asked if I used it. I thought she might have had proof so I again admitted and said it's a spiritual struggle and now I'm being signed up for a support group in a church basement led by my friend's dad. FUCK THIS. I just want to live a life not having every aspect controlled by a fucking 2000 year old book and the words of random eastern european kids. 

Now they are even talking about not letting me go back to college. Since I might sin there and an education isn't worth my eternal soul. FUCK

Here's the thing, I know what I need to do too. I need to convince them let me go back to school, all I need is one more semester, I'm in a good field and a good student so I'm confident If I try hard enough I can get  an internship for next summer so I can be independent. 

The problem is now the time between now and then is going to be the worst shit. I have to adore christ in a chapel at 3:00 am, I have to talk about praying away porn with my friends dad in the church basement and I have to pretend I'm enjoying it and that it's helping me ""recover""

I've only ever told a few people I'm an atheist and the only one I'm still close with is away in the army so it's hard to talk to him. So for now I just had to rant about this somewhere. If you have any advice please feel free to give it. But for now I'm just going to study and work my ass off to get an internship and get out of this fucking life. "

Im pretty sure that a career in this field is for me, it hits all of my pros and very little to none of my cons. But im not sure on how to get started. 

Ive been out of college for a few years, only made it to junior level in a totally unrelated path (compsci). On top of that, I'm in louisville, and the closest school that offers a program is an hour away.

Im not sure if commuting will be feasible, and moving is almost out of the question. Online education I was only able to find one program, and its ridiculously expensive.

So im kinda stuck as to what I should do, maybe if I ask a few direct questions someone can help out? This is more to see if Im understanding things right, from what Ive read:

1. Im assuming that I can do *all* prerequisite courses at a local college, leaving roughly 2 years of a dietetics program to complete. Is that a good assumption? 

2. Is it possible that I may work through all of this education, and fail to get an internship? I have no idea what I could do if that happened.

Im very much wanting this career, and Im very much ready to start taking the steps towards it. Im just unsure of the best next step.

Any help you can offer is *much* appreciated. Thanks! "

We have grown through a lot of difficult problems, and I truly thought our relationship would weather past it all.

Let me start back when I first met my boyfriend, we were both in our senior year of college. My boyfriend was hopeless when it came to women, but we had a project in a business class we took together, and he was a really warm and nice spirited guy. We started talking and soon enough we were dating. 

He had terrible fashion sense, still wore super baggy jeans, wore oversized T-shirts. I helped him out past all of that. And no I wasn't the overbearing girlfriend, he flat out asked me for my advice. This relationship wasn't just me assisting hiim, but I just want it to be known that I am not ""some hood bitch"", in fact he was probably more so. 

After college, we both started working for accounting firms and we were apart from each other for a year. But then we both actually got a job at the same company so we stayed together in an apartment. This is really when things in our relationship started getting serious. Both of our parents and our family members both were talking about us getting married down the road. My boyfriend and I were making serious plans. 

Then things hit busy season and a lot of our plans got pushed back. My boyfriend actually started getting promoted in the company and he actually was responsible for managing interns and it really started getting to his head. I could sense the distance between us growing. 

The time when I knew things were bad, was when he had a training assignment out of state, and I went to contact him, and he would be annoyed at me reaching out to talk to him. It broke my heart, we were together for so long, and now, I was the crazy one for wanting to ask him how his training was going after three days not talking to each other. 

When he came back we had an actual talk and he pointed things out. He said that moving up in the corporate world is hard enough as it is. And that I am not contributing anything to it. He said that I am ""too ghetto"" and that Black women have no class. He said that he has seen the girlfriends of his White friends and that the reason why he doesn't go to Company house parties and Holidy events is because of me. That I will embarass him with my nappy hair. 

I cried so hard that night, I don't know how all of this happened. How did I go from a man that thought I was the best thing that ever happened in his life, to a man that thought he was too good for me. I just feel broken. I know our relationship even if we stay together will not be the same. A part of me really thinks that he just used me as a ""step up"" to get to the girls he always wanted. 

On Instagram and porn, he always liked White womeen, but I just assumed that White people are the majority so hey its normal right? But now I am really starting to see him for what it really is. If he was to tell me, hey I find White women's physical features more attractive, I can atleast understand that. But he doesn't have the courage to do that, instead he had to degrade Black women saying that we aren't good enough. 

A part of me is happy that I am not raising a daughter with a man that harbors these hateful views. But it doesn't take away the pain. I know this is ranty, and I know its a Friday night. But I wanted to mourn the loss of my 4 year relationship. Thanks for everyone who took time to read. "

Well, as fast as a girl can crawl with the ankles and wrists chained up. And of course, she hadn't heard the name 'Arianna' in some time now. She tended to go by Hucow 0021 for the most part.   
  
""Of course, Hucow 0021 was a rather special for us to acquire here,"" Olivia informed Emily, the new intern. ""She was handpicked up our CEO, Scarlett Williams as a personal Hucow. She worked unknowingly with us under the guise of a Secretary whilst we secretly fed her a concoction of lactation-inducing foods. One day, she complained of milk dampening her blouse, we hooked her up to the milkers, assuring her that the procedure would not take long. And that is when we chained her gagged her, and well; you can see the rest"" Olivia beamed as Emily kneeled down to stroke the blushing Arianna / Hucow 0021. Arianna of course remembered the day vividly, however many months ago it was. She would have uttered a complaint, if she were not ballgagged.   
  
The days since working in The Facility blurred into one, however. ""She is usually strapped to the metal apparatus we found her in. A tube in her mouth to feed, a tube at her nipples to milk, and a tube up her bottom to... Urm... Cleanse, enemas, that part isn't quite my area of expertise."" Olivia trailed off as Emily nodded.   
  
Arianna's blush deepened in shade. The enemas were the worst part of the day, of course.  
  
""And because this little Hucow is just so beautiful, some of the girls come in to her own room during their breaks to play with her; plait her hair, give her a spank, train her how to moo, whatever they see fit! Oh, as long as Mistress Williams approves. Arianna... I mean, Hucow 0021 is her personal calf, after all.""   
  
""So what about the other hucows? Were they all tricked here?"" Emily asked inquisitively.   
  
""Of course they were, silly!"" Olivia admonished back. ""Why do you think we keep them gagged? We offer ripe girls jobs as secretaries, administration, whatever anonymous jobs. After some weeks of controlled feeding, we deem them necessary to Hucowify... And yes; that is a verb."" Emily laughed in response.  
  
""And if they misbehave?""   
  
""Oh, you needn't worry. There is not period they are not tightly bound. But there are some punishments; caning, electrocuting, public humiliation, whatever incentivises them to keep producing. We keep our girls healthy for longevity, so you will notice their breasts do not grow beyond a D-cup at the absolute limit.""  
  
Emily scribbled note in her handbook.  
  
""But what about the boys you capture?"" Emily asked as they approached a double doorway at the end of the corridor. The hair's on Arianna's body stood up as she trailed behind on her leash and collar.  
   
""Watch and learn"" Olivia grinned as she opened the doors to reveal a warehouse with 50 men, all bound to chairs, with identical tubes running through their gags, and into their bottoms for waste. ""We can be a little rough, farming semen,"" Olivia explained. ""Mistress Maisenbacher, our German farm expert specialises on discipline on both Boys and Hucows, but she finds a natural concoction of vitamins appropriate for Cows, and viagra and no visual-stimulus for boys a necessary procedure"".   
  
Upon closer inspection, Emily gasped as she noticed the intense expression of anguish on the Men's faces as they were milked, tubes stimulating and sucking the semen straight from their raging cocks. It was collected through transparent pipework to a tank in the ceiling.  
  
""Marvellous, isn't it?"" Olivia smiled to herself. ""So, where do you fit into all this, Emily?""

His jaw hangs open like he mouth of a fucking cavern. I can tell from here he needs to brush his teeth more and lay off the fucking coffee. And the donuts, with his plump body and mustache he looks like a fucking walrus.

""Um..."" He babbles. ""I'm going to diagnose you with... Decapitation.""

""Decapitation."" I say flatly. My girlfriend, Emily, has to stifle back a laugh.

""Yes, decapitation."" The doctor says, actually managing to sound proud of his deduction.

""Well no fucking *shit* I've been decapitated!"" I shout at him. ""Fuck! Who gave Captain Obvious a fucking medical license?!""

It is pretty obvious that I've been decapitated, for a sight most unusual lays before the doctor. On his table lays my body. Resting beside it is my severed head, glaring up at the so called ""medical expert"".

""What I want to know,"" I say coldly. ""Is why and how I'm still alive?""

""Er, well, we've never had a case like this."" The doctor stammers. ""I'm amazed you can talk. Your lungs are no longer attached to your throat, so there's no air passing your vocal chords-""

""I don't give a fuck about vocal chords!"" I shout. ""I should be dead! Why am I not?""

The situation was unusual for all parties. I worked in a lab researching lasers, and we had been testing a high intensity cutting laser. However, my intern *Keith* had a cold and he sneezed so hard he headbutted the laser, sending it spinning and causing it to slice my head off at the shoulders. It hurt like a motherfucker, and imagine Keith's surprise when my severed head began screaming and insulting his mother. Keith was scared, the paramedics that showed up were shocked, and now the doctor is simply confused.

""I, uh, suppose we'll simply have to observe you and see if there are any complications."" The doctor says, turning red.

""Whatever."" I sigh. ""Em, let's get out of here...""

My girlfriend chuckles and helps lift my body into a wheelchair, allowing a nurse to wheel my body to the car while she holds my head in her arms. I have to admit, being carried around like this is kinda comfy.

Six days later and I'm back at work. My intern Keith has thankfully been fired. Unable to physically interact with the lab materials however, I've been moved to amprivate office in the Theoretical Research division, where my job is to effectively dictate hypotheses and math into a Dragon NaturallySpeaking program.

As I work, my phone hums and I see it's a text message from Emily. Thank god for voice commands. I tell my phone to read the text.

*So you know how dead bodies are supposed to get cold and stiff when they die?*

I chuckle as I feel the sensation of my girlfriend's hand brushing my arm. We discovered a day after the doctor's appointment that my body could still pick up senses and sort of transmit them to my brain.

""It's called rigor mortis."" I say to the phone.

*Well your body is still warm and soft...*

I sigh a little as I feel Emily hugging my body. Then I feel her hands wandering my chest and reaching down lower and lower until... Oh boy. I bite my lip and supress a quiet moan.

*And* this *part of you is still very much alive.*

I lose my head briefly and groan as I feel Emily's hand stroking my throbbing muscle, approximately thirty miles away.

*It's so hard! Is this that rigor mortis you were talking about?*

Then I feel something wet and warm and velvety dancing along the underside of my length and I let out a sharp, lusty gasp.

""Em, be careful with that..."" I pant into the phone. ""I'm trying to work here...""

All I get in response is a single emoticon: *;)*

Her hair in season 3 is ehhhh, her quirks, quick falling, and awkward feelings.. I can't help but love her because of it. Because she is extremely relatable. 

For instance: 

* Her relationship with George.. falling too fast and to get cheated on because the other person almost felt forced

* When she walks into the bathroom naked and doesn't wash her hands. At first, you think EWW however when she describes what she was feeling... I would have done the same thing. She felt like she was in high school with the popular girls just standing there judging her. 

* The whole Izzy situation. Extremely real and personal. Where she fears Izzy's presence around George and knows what's going on and has a hard time coming to it. Raw and real. 

* When she told everyone that they were on her service that day except Izzy. Everyone asked why Izzy was the only one one Dr. Bailey's service, and Callie tells everyone ""Because she is sleeping with my husband"". Her strength, her balls... I love it. 

* She ""stood up"" for Izzy when Hahn wanted to go to UNOS abut the Denny situation. Callie had no reason to, and didn't do it for Izzy, but because it was buried, dealt with, and over. She wasn't afraid to stick up for what is right. She has always done her best to stand up for what's right and wrong. 

In the latest season, I forgot why I loved her. It wasn't because she strayed so far from early show Callie, but because I lost my understanding with her. We think she is stupid for assuming Sophia will move with her to NY, but wouldn't all parents who gave Birth just assume that, specially caught up in that moment? 

Callie is short tempered, quick to throw a tantrum, but she doesn't judge and she is always making sure other people don't. Callie is my favorite, and I am so devastated she is leaving. 


**ON ANOTHER NOTE**

Season 5, when they have Lexie's intern class under Meredith.. those interns literally didn't learn anything and it bothers me. All the others were able to get surgeries, and assist in surgeries, and these interns have to practice IV on dead bodies, in which the elders steal from them anyway! "

I'm going to try to keep this as brief as possible.

A friend I went to school with whom got a Bachelors in Political Science  and then a Masters in Criminal Justice.  She got the masters at around 26 or so.  

Great, but not so great.

Since then until now (Aged 31) she had (2) internships that pretty much dealt with NOTHING she went to school for besides the name on the door of the building. And they were 6-months each. 

She has put in like over a thousand applications all these years.  She has talked to recruiters, hired resume tweakers and the whole nine yards.  Only as of recent has she gotten a promising interview that's not dealing with her degree but pays well for someone who has a Masters and she's going through the long process with that, to potentially get hired.

She has no criminal record or even a traffic ticket.  She is a stunning looking woman, gpa was 3.9 I believe for her Masters.  She hasn't participated in any extra-curricular activities as far as I know while at university.  Her job market is Illinois.  And yes, she has applied to many paths outside of hers but literally no one bites. No call backs, no emails, nothing.  Ever...

I've given her all the advice I could give her from someone who has always been employed with no issue at all (Computer Science).

Could any of you provide any real world tips?  Advice?  Know how?  I will be e-mailing her this thread once it gets some traction."

I started my second semester as a biochemistry major after switching over from MechE. I had to take the dreaded Organic Chemistry class for the first time, which included a lab that lasted 4 hours every Tuesday night. My girlfriend (at the time) was supposed to take the lab with me, but she got an internship out of state, so I was left to take the lab alone. On the first day of lab, since I had no friends, I was randomly paired with two other girls who were also alone. We exchanged numbers and went on our merry ways until the next week.

My then-girlfriend had asked if I was interested in dropping the lab and waiting to take it when she got back to school, but I had a strong feeling that I should stay in my current lab. So I stayed. 

My lab partners and I were all in serious relationships, one (we'll call her A) had been dating a guy for over a year and the other (we'll call her B) had been dating a girl for 3. *Hey, another lesbian! What are the odds that the two gay girls in the lab would be in the same group?*

I became good friends with B over time. We talked a lot and found out we had a lotttttt in common. We were able to relate often and we quickly built a sacred bond. I had finally felt comfortable calling this girl my best friend, and she was my first real friend that I made in my two years living in our college city.

Toward the middle of the semester, B and her girlfriend began having problems. Her girlfriend ended up breaking up with her. B was devastated, and she reached out to me for advice. I helped as much as I could and eventually B decided she wanted to try to move on. I supported her.

At a certain point after that time, B began to develop feelings for me. I still had a girlfriend, so I didn't return those feelings, and B tried to exit my life to prevent causing any issues in my life. I didn't let her leave. I valued her friendship too much. Maybe that was selfish of me, maybe it was too painful for her to stay in my life when I was unavailable and she couldn't have me the way she wanted. I don't know.

A few weeks later, my then-girlfriend and I started having problems. We were struggling with the distance and we were both left finding ourselves on our own time. Eventually, we drifted apart and decided that we weren't meant to be. 

Some days later, B and I are smoking together to celebrate the end of the semester and the end of organic chemistry. 

We ended up hooking up that night. 

Things got complicated for a while. I had said that I was afraid of commitment, so we agreed to just have a FWB situation. But then her feelings were getting too difficult to control. Shortly after that, I was realizing how strongly I felt for her, too. We agreed to let our feelings develop naturally and see where things went from there. No expectations, just free-flowing emotions. 

We began to hang out once a week when summer started. She lives an hour from me, but I really wanted to show her that I could make an effort for her. Each week I'd drive to her house and we'd go back to my apartment to hangout or we'd drive around and go on dates. I was falling for her, she had already fallen hard for me. I was cautious since love was a difficult thing for me, but she was making it hard not to fall in love.

On May 31, 2016 I asked her to be my girlfriend, officially. 

I've never been happier. Our personalities click so well. She's beautiful, funny, nice, smart, motivated, nurturing, caring, loving, and so much more. She understands me, comforts me, and always wants to protect me. She's amazing in bed, but that's just a bonus.

I just graduated college (in FL) with a public relations degree and knew I'd be spending the summer helping my grandfather in Illinois. A lot of free time ahead, so I approached a PR firm back in March inquiring about a internship.

The owner emailed me back within 12 hours and agreed, saying she’d even find place in their budget to pay me. We agreed to do a “trial run” by me writing an unpaid feature article. It would be published in a local feature magazine. I emailed her the article and even sent two follow-up emails. She went from emailing me back within the hour to never hearing from her again. She did not confirm she received the article let alone notify me if it would be published. 

In May I found out that she had indeed published my article. She made edits to the piece without running it by me, which violates the writer-editor relationship. The biggest issue was she did not properly credit me. We agreed that I would have a byline and instead she threw my name into the opening paragraph. In the journalism world, her edit names me as a source of information for the article, not the writer. Not to mention this was not what we agreed upon. 

I reached out to a former mentor for advice. He is an advertising professional and “called out” the woman on Twitter. She immediately emailed me – twice—that day. She begged me to keep the matter between us, blaming personal matters, like pregnancy complications, for her lack of communication.

I thoroughly explained why I was upset and asked her for $250 compensation and to rerun my article with the proper byline. She said she was not going to rerun the article, and would send the $250 when I sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement.  The NDA held me responsible not only for my own actions but those of my “friends, family members, and professional or educational associates.” There were multiple legal bindings I did not feel comfortable with, so I told her I would not be signing the agreement.

At this point she became less and less reasonable. Her responses took longer and she had yet to even apologize or acknowledge that she had done anything wrong. In attempt for her to take me seriously, I threatened to walk away from the deal and “go to the media” with our story. She's currently nominated for a local award and I politely mentioned that this award would make an excellent angle.

I heard back from her lawyer who politely threatened me with a defamation case if I went public with my story (side note: being a recent grad, I just took an extensive mass communications law class, I know my rights the defamation threat doesn't scare me). I asked him to reword the agreement and listed specific items I to change. He reworded one phrase, which I believe hurts me rather than helps. His last response was that the NDA as-is would be their final offer. I am VERY hesitant to go any further without professional legal advice. I know I have done absolutely nothing wrong so far, but the way they're treating me somehow makes HER seem like the victim

So what are my options? I'm not opposed to signing something, but definitely not what they've given me. 

I've been published 50+ times in print, online, etc. and I've NEVER had an editor simply drop me cold. It makes me suspicious that she's done this before...

Obviously her #1 priority is to protect her reputation. On one hand I'd like to ruin that by telling local media about what's happened. But on the other hand, I'd like to get some money out of this and never have to deal with it again.

4qvqc4,0,2016-07-02,How would you make Sombra? (Also me way overthinking how I would.),codish,Overwatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/4qvqc4/how_would_you_make_sombra_also_me_way/,"A pretty strait forward question, I heard Overwatch is gonna potentially get a new sniper support hero called Sombra, and
I'm sure many of you have (I know I have at least), for the fun of it, put thought into how you would have Sombra play. What her abilities would be and what not. So, lets hear it, how would you build the new hero?

Here's what I'd do. 

First of all, I'd give her a self defense pistol to switch to similar to Mercy's. She would be kinda useless in close range.

For her passive, her rifle would ""mark"" anyone she hit, tagging them until death to her and her teammates, making them visible through walls and such like Hanzo and Widowmakers respective abilities. The shot themselves wouldn't do very much damage compared to the other two snipers, and this is meant to color her play, rather than focus on taking out a single target, a skilled player might hit several, marking them all. To keep this from being to op a passive, a player could lose their mark simply by being healed. Lucio intern would be a decent counter to Sombra, his passive heal would almost completely negate her passive.

Every support has some kind of utility ability, her's would be a debuffing shot, Sombra would load some kind of special bullet, which would have several nasty affects, it would lower the targets speed, dps, as well as prevent healing for a short time (Maybe 10 secs?). And the bullet itself might do increased damage to boot. Of course this a is all dependent on the bullet actually getting to it's target.

Her second ability would be her heal. She get a fairly long lasting smoke grenade, which would slowly heal allies within, as well as provide cover from enemies. Allies would be able to see through the smoke, the area itself just getting a golden tinge from their perspective to signify that the smoke is there.

And finally her ultimate would be her giving herself, as well as her allies everywhere on the map active camouflage for a short period of time, making the whole team harder to hit. It would also go as far as giving them a complete immunity to aim bots and the enhanced sights of other snipers, helping her counter Widowmaker's ultimate, and Torbjorn's turret. Both of which could really use a counter to balance out their play.

Wow I put way to much thought into this. 

What do you guys think?"

I'm already accepted into school and don't have any reservations about going. Just trying to iron out some of the details in my head since I tend to try and plan financially as much as possible. Some background - My parents/grandparents are giving me an interest free loan to cover all of my tuition. They've done this for my other siblings in the past as well so no worries about them being good for it. In terms of assets, at the end of the year I should have ~7,000 in my bank account, ~22,000 in my roth, and ~10,000 in my IRA (with about 2,000 of that not fully vested). Currently make 48k a year and should be making in the 90k ballpark post grad-school. Three questions here:

1. I'm looking at quitting work around Thanksgiving and moving back home for a month (program starts at the very beginning of next year). Trying to decide on the best option of health insurance for that month and change between work and school (can get on school insurance January 1). Thinking of going without any insurance for that month since the gap exemption would apply for me, but I do have a chronic health condition (I've never needed emergency care though) so I don't want to leave myself open for possibly racking up huge medical bills. From what I've researched, you can get coverage via COBRA retroactively for up to 60 days after your work coverage ends. Is that correct and will I have to file/do anything special to have this option open for me? I'm ok with paying the high amount for COBRA if something really goes wrong, but don't want to fork over any money for it unless I have to.

2. Any advice on taking loans to cover my living expenses? Still crunching some numbers, but a rough estimate of my living expenses will be somewhere in the 1,000-1,5000 per month range. Am obviously ok using all of my savings. The program is 12 months. In terms of income I'll have a summer internship making about 20/hr or so, but not sure what my work situation will look like during the non-summer semesters. I've applied for financial aid and waiting to hear back on that, but if I don't get a Perkins Loan like I did for undergrad, curious as to if I should take other loans and how much, or if I should try to go for making it with what I have, and taking money out of my roth if I run short.

3. Any advice with what to do with my 401k? Would it be best to just leave it alone completely, or try to roll some of it over?"

Basically, after the first year of engineering school and experiencing how most engineering students live. Which is at a very high stress level where sleep, physical health, and personal relationships often suffer. I dialed it down to about 9-10 credits a semester. This way I am able to hold down a part time job, exercise regularly, keep my personal relationships together, and have uncompromised sleep. This works a lot better for me, its a more balanced and much healthier lifestyle, and my GPA is holding steady at around a 3.55

The thing is that my mother, don't seem understand that a STEM degree is a lot more work than the bullshit communications degree that she got thirty years ago. It's turned into a pretty consistent nagging.

I mean, my work life is going to be extremely long and there are far worse things than graduating at 23 with a good GPA and multiple internships under my belt. I'd rather take the extra year and a half, then go around stressed and feeling like shit all of the time. "

Though it isn't very famous since it's only 20 years old.  
  
My GPA, however, is at 2.4/4.3. I had serious trouble with math and procrastination, which was my fault. (For context, the average grade here is 2.7, which is a B-) 
  
I do however, maintain a keen interest in software engineering, learning what I can online. As a result, I've been lucky to have two internships under my belt.  
  
As a result of my GPA though, I've only been able to apply to startups since big companies tend to ask for transcripts and only hire 3.0+.  
  
I'm currently happy with the work environment at my summer internship, and I wouldn't mind working at a place like this for a while after graduation.  
  
My parents, however, in typical Asian fashion think I'm worthless unless I'm working at a Fortune 500 or something along those lines. They're also very keen on me getting a Master's in the US and finding a job there ASAP.  
  
Personally, given my bachelors' experience, my GPA, and my interest in learning self-paced online, I feel like I should spend a couple of years exploring CS topics on my own while gaining work experience before nailing down a few to study further with a masters'.  
  
My questions:  
  
1) Is my plan sound? Specifically, is there hope in being able to find at least an average masters' programme with that GPA few years down the line?  
  
2) What does career progression look like for people who've mostly worked at startups? I ask this because most people at startups I've worked at started their careers at or previously worked at big companies. Will I be missing out on a lot?

4qwi1l,0,2016-07-02,[NeedAdvice]30M ADHD trainwreck,dota2nub,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/4qwi1l/needadvice30m_adhd_trainwreck/,"Hi guys

I don't know if you guys can help, but I'm asking for advice anyhow. I really need to change, and I've got years and years of ingrained habits to get rid of. I'm a tough case, so sit down and listen to my story, I feel a novel coming on.

So, I've always been a smart kid. I say this not because I think it's true, but because everyone always told me so. I always got okay grades at school. Not great, not bad, but I never had to work at all for it. I just got everything I needed to pass the tests from my lessons. I've got a high IQ, which makes people say I'm gifted and I could make so much more of myself if only I could apply myself, that I'm probably just bored with the slow pace of things and that i need more of a challenge. I believed that stuff for a long time because I didn't know better.

But at university, I had to get honest with myself. I wasn't bored, things weren't too easy. I felt like I was actually always struggling and barely hanging on. I've been studying the same subject for ten years now, and I'm studying languages. I got my bachelor's and am relatively close to finishing, but... good god, ten years man. And I do okay on my courses, I test well, but when it comes to handing in papers... I sometimes just can't make the deadline. When I do make the deadline, I might've put a really short concentrated effort into my paper, but nowhere near as much time and effort as I should have. I get passing grades all the time, I don't fail things, but I'm absolutely terrible at actually getting myself to do things on on my own, be it sports or studying or writing papers or whatever. 

I'm good at scheduled things. I don't miss classes and when I'm with other people doing group work I'm engaged and productive. Too bad I'm kind of a loner. I'm a bit weird to be around and only recently made some good friends, though my social life is now pretty dang good. So at least that's something.

Now for the ADHD bit. I don't really now where to fit this in, but this seems like the best spot. I got married to the dragon (2 years older than me) somewhere around half my uni career. Terrible decision. We'd been dating for 4.5 years and living together for 2. She'd somehow managed to get me to move far away from uni through pretty manipulative tactics, though I was a doormat, thought I could never find another girl and had all around atrocious self esteem. So it was really my fault. Somewhere in that relationship, because she was demanding and because I was interacting with her a lot I realized something was wrong with me. It wasn't just that I struggled with school when I wasn't too interested and was able to lock myself in the library with a book I needed to read and only get ten pages read that day without remembering any of them. (I did that every day for two weeks once for a presentation and only barely managed a passing grade because the teacher felt generous) It was also that she could sometimes repeat the same thing three times while walking next to me and I just didn't understand her. Whenever I was in a social setting with more than three other people I'd lose track of conversations and couldn't keep up (with four people, there will be two conversations and I won't be involved in any of them at times, which is when my confusion starts and my brain tries to keep up with both, but can't, so I just start lethargically sitting there and people think I'm shy when I'm actually overwhelmed and stressed out as fuck)

Well, I'm sure you guys put 2 and 2 together by now. I got diagnosed with mild ADHD six months after I realized I had it. I got prescribed ritalin and then a long acting form of it and it helped. A lot. For a while. Though it seemed like I needed a bigger and bigger dose, which shouldn't be the case.

After 0.5 years of marriage came the divorce. I broke down under all the abuse and gaslighting and needed out. Still proud of myself that I managed to muster up the strength for it. I fucked up there and messed up some friendships, but damage other than that was moderate. My ex wife straight up stonewalled me after the couple's councellor basically sided with me (she wasn't a bad councellor. She really tried her damndest not to take sides, but man, you guys don't know my ex-wife. She wasn't explicit, but even as a trained councellor you can't hide it when you pity the fuck out of someone.) So I got an amicable divorce out of it (not like I worked at the time, so she couldn't plunder me since I didn't have anything and we didn't have kids. I could've sued her for support but I still had my parents and I just wanted to get away from her.

Anywho, the five months after the divorce were the best (feeling-wise at least, I'd say right now despite everything I whine about here, things are pretty dang great) of my life. I felt amazing. The ADHD was gone, I was in a weird, almost euphoric and calm state. I needed less sleep, but I wasn't manic. I just had more energy. I worked out, I concentrated well on school, I wasn't impulsive anymore, I was social and outgoing, I started meditating, I had amazing self control and wasn't an impulsive buyer anymore, it was great. I quit my ADHD meds. It was as if a switch had flicked. I lost all my social anxiety. But slowly, all this went away. (except the  ack of social anxiety, luckily that was permanent)

There's still days I pine after this state, probably not unlike someone who had a great LSD trip. I felt like I'd met god and lost him. For at least a year, I tried to get back there. Meditation, nutrition, Chinese medicine, heck even nofap. Sometimes I still feel glimpses as if it's coming back, but they always disappear. It was a weird flow state. I've now learned to accept it was a one time thing.

I'm still supported by my mom. My dad died a year or so ago (my parents are old, my siblings are about 20 years older than me to give you an idea)  And she's going to be nearing the end of how she can provide for me in a year or so, when I will hopefully have finished my studies.

About two years ago I'd decided I need to at least get a side job because I need to provide for myself. I got an internship at a catholic place that helped provide activities for university students. It was a good experience and I got out of my shell and made friends for the first time in a long while, but it didn't pay the bills, though it helped fill the gaping hole a bit.

After that, I quit university for a semester to work a full time internship as an editor at a publisher. It paid even worse though I worked maybe three to four times as much. But it was work experience and I learned a lot, which was the point of it.

At this point I am divorced, and I'm on and off my meds pretty irregularly.

I loved my internship, my boss loved me. I was struggling there too. Not in the beginning when it was new and interesting, but the problems started 3 months in. I started browsing reddit at work a lot. Couldn't help myself. I lost entire days, it wasn't funny.

Boss didn't notice. I still handed in my work. Regular work days helped keep me at least a little productive and I was good at it.

I secretly went to work on weekends and even over the christmas days to get things done. What I couldn't do because I kept distracting myself I got done by simply being there a lot more. I felt stressed and terrible but somehow struggled through. I got a very good recommendation by my boss at the end of it. He really thought I'd done a great job. I even got a side job out of it I could work from home while I was doing uni.

This is where the trouble starts. I went to uni again, got some courses, worked. This all worked out okayish. I was cutting my deadlines close in the beginning, but things got done. During that time I also got with my present girlfriend. She's the best. Not too much about her here as this is about me. Let's just say I learned the difference between a good and a bad relationship after my divorce as I made some experiences and what I've got now is way better than just good, it's an absolute dream.

So now I have to organize and split my time between girlfriend, school, and work from home. My sports activities I'd started were the first to go (had started bjj). Then I started missing work deadlines - because I suck at working from home, so easy to distract myself when on my own computer it's not even funny.

Honestly, at this point I don't know why they haven't kicked me out yet, I made some huge fuckups. My boss was still extremely nice, polite and decent about it and right now if I mess up one more time, he's going to be the one in trouble, not just me, because he held his hand in the fire for me.

I've taken steps. I am visiting my boss weekly now and give progress reports so I have some sort of schedule. This helps a lot. I also visited a new psychiatrist and am getting new meds again, hopefully they'll work a bit better. I also asked for a psychologist to give me coaching sessions. I start on those in two weeks

I want to pick myself up, but I know how these things usually go for me, so I have to be careful. I've worked on myself a lot before. It usually goes well in the brginning. I put a lot of energy into it. I make a lot of changes, force myself to work, and it pretty much works for a few weeks or even months. And then I burn out and it all breaks down.

I can't keep putting myself through this, it only ends up making things worse. Forcing myself and being hard on myself seems to only work in the short term. I don't know what moderation looks like and I need help. I need to do this very slowly and carefully this time so it may last. I want to end up with a degree and a real job that makes money. Nothing fancy, I just want to be stable and to be able to support a family without being near my breaking point all the time like I am now - even though I seem like a lazy fuckup from the outside. 

I hope the coaching helps. Maybe you guys can offer something too, idk. This probably would've fit /r/offmychest better. I am very hopeful for the coaching sessions right now, so we'll see how that goes.

There, that's my novel. Sorry for typos, it's the iPad's fault. If you've read this all, you're an angel, have some wings.

This got horribly long and I'm sorry but I really need some advice on what to do here.  


My best friend Jacie has always been very outgoing, confident and with a very rooted personality. She wears, says and does what she wants without care about what others think, in a good way mostly. Like she standds up for herself, she's very open and honest about her opinions, came out as bisexual two-three years back (we live and come from a pretty conservative place) and aspires to be a journalist despite some really hard pressure from home to go into law instead. She is my hero and I look up to her alot, she's an amazing friend and whenever we're out she's the life of the party, she has always had lots of friends and always did well in school and work aswell. But I think something happened these last six months and I'm getting really worried. 


I got an internship at the other side of the country, six months long an in a field I really want to work in, so I decided to take it. During this period, Jacie and I talked less than usual and I regret that now. Everything seemed normal over the phone, I noticed she was less active on social media (she used to live on instagram and snapchat but now she's low active at most) but she just said she grew tired of it and hey, fair enough. Some of our common friends said they'd seem her out less, but apparently she's been studying alot for some big application so that was also fine, I guessed. Basically just things that I didn't think were any big thing, but I should have put two and two together on that one. 


So I got back home a few weeks ago and of course, I wanted to see Jacie. Six months is the longest we've ever been apart and except for my family, who came out to visit me over easter, I've misses her the most. But she kept postponing our meeting and after two weeks I got enough and just went to her house to find out why she's avoiding me. 


Turns out it's like she's a completely different person. It's almost scary. When she opened the door she just kinda stood there? I said hi, why are you avoiding me? and she said she hadn't but she was glad to see me and invited me in. She was so soft spoken and barely looked at me, the whole conversation we had was me telling her about my internship and her just kind of nodding along. She didn't even drink the tea she made us, it was completely untouched when I left after twenty minutes. She didn't seem interested in me or what I'd done at all, didn't ""have anything to say"" about her life these six months, apparently nothing's happened at all if I'm to believe her. I've never seen her like that, it's like someone just sucked the life out of her. She kept saying she was glad to see me and she'd missed me, but eventually said she was just very tired and asked me to leave. 


Her appearance also changed. Jacie's always changed styles often but now she looked... Unkempt, i guess. I don't want to say dirty, but almost. She's gained what looks like twenty-thirty pounds and was wearing a sweats/shirt combo with stains and her hair was unwashed and she didn't have makeup - she even stopped dying her eyebrows, which she's done since 13 because they're very blonde and fair and she hates how they look. 


I've tried to talk to our friends about it, but they don't seem to think it a big deal. But she's a completely different person! How can they not see that?! 


I've met her a few more times since but it's har because she never wants to do anything, just stays at home and does nothing, I assume, since she's not out with anyone else either. The breaking point was last night when I tried to get her to talk about her future and journalism, which is one of her biggest passions and I thought that might bring some enthusiasm to her, and she told me she's thinking about ""skipping that whole thing"" and going into something like ecpnomics or law instead. That's the straw, I cannot deal with this anymore. She's wanted to be a journalist since we were in 8th grade, no fucking way would the Jacie I know ever go into fucking law. 


I feel like crying. My best friend, my sister, is gone and I don't know what happened. I am so worried for her but I don't know what to do, I fear she's having some sort of mental breakdown or something but I don't know who to turn to, if I'm overreacting and she's just changed, or what. Our friends seem to have completely lost contact with her and some are worried but not overly so, and since I don't know her family that well, I don't know if I should talk to them. They don't have a good relationship and she lives on her own. 


Please, I'm desperate and don't know what to do.

Please help me.",desperateandsadguy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4qww5u/me_24_m_with_my_gf_25_f_7_years_just_broke_up_and/,"Hello. I don't know if i should post this or if anyone will identify me. This might be a huge mistake. 

I have been together with my gf (25 f) for more than seven years. We have done everything together; studied, lived, travelled the world. I still love her so much and i think of her family as my own.

Around a year ago we started working out together cause we wanted to have a better lifestyle. She used to have pretty low self-esteem but this really helped, and we both look much more toned now. Our sex life also improved, and we went from having sex maybe once a week to two or three times a week. 

We both go to university and she got an internship this semester, which she was very happy about - and me too. Around two months ago after a party at her job she told me she did a bad thing and she felt very bad about it. Turns out she kissed a coworker on the dancefloor, but didn't do anything beyond that because she felt bad for me. Well things got very weird to say the least. For a long time i have had a fetish for humiliation/cuckold that i have kept secret and used to masturbate since i have a higher sex-drive than my gf. Hearing about what happened i was immediately turned on and we had sex three times that day. I told her about my fantasy and i was in kind of a haze of lust, not feeling bad at all. 

In the evening however, i started feeling bad. It felt like she had broken something in me and i felt sick. I have always trusted her and i felt so betrayed. I had to wake her up that night and we talked in bed. I really felt like we got everything on the table; how she felt we had become more like friends and less like lovers, how i didn't keep the house neat enough, how i did not pay enough attention. This clashed very much with my own observations. I noted that i had been working out and was fit and we had more sex than before, that i had paid every time we went out while she was doing her internship (unpaid), and all the things we had done together. She agreed that maybe her feelings did not match reality, but she felt them anyway. She told me she still wanted to be with me, but had also found out that she missed ""the hunt"" and wanted to be with other men (one night stands). 

After that things got very good for a while. We had a lot of sex using the fantasy of her being with others, but i still knew she wanted it for real, and sometimes i would feel like the world was crushing down on me. We talked a lot, and i told her that i might be okay with having a more open relationship, but that i needed to be in a better place and we had to keep it as a fantasy for now. She had pretty much crushed my self-esteem and i couldn't find it again. I had a lot of succes in this time otherwise (got offered my dream job), but i still felt like a loser. 

So time went on, and this week we went to a one-week music festival. She went sunday and i arrived on wednesday (due to other holiday plans). Tuesday night she came home to take a shower and meet me while i packed for next morning. She was wearing lingeri and we had very good sex. We had sex in the morning as well. 

While there i feel like she is snappy with me and moody. Yesterday (friday) i asked her what was wrong while we were away from the group of people we camp with. She said she did not want to say while on the festival, but she did anyway. She told me she thought we should have a break, but she didn't have time to think it through yet. She wanted to (her words) have some time, maybe a month, apart, to see if we wanted to be together. She thought we needed to ""stand on our own legs"" and she wanted to see who she was without me. Since we have been together for so long, all the people in our lives know ""us"" and not her and me. The time at the internship (with people who don't know me) and her days alone with her old friends at the festival had shown her she could be someone else and she wanted to try and be that person. At this point i was shocked and i wanted to figure out what was going on, but a few people from our camp came along and we played it as if nothing was happening, but i felt like i was dying inside. I wanted to scream and run away, but i didn't, just went and watched the first half our of a concert. It started to rain and we stood next to each other. It felt as if the rain went right through me and into the dirt. It felt like i was the dirt on the ground. We stole a few looks at each other. Then she said she needed to use the bathroom and i went with her. We walked in silence to the que, then we stood in silence. When she came out i asked her to walk back to the camp with me and she did. 

On the way i asked her to explain more. In summery, she didn't think i had enough attitute and social grasp. She found herself constantly wanting to sleep with other men and she felt extremely guilty. She is not wrong about the attitute thing. I am a very down to earth guy, and i prefer talking just a few people to being the center of attention. 

I told her i couldn't be here anymore and i needed to go home (we live together). She asked me to lie in the tent with her and hold her. On one hand i wanted to run away and never look back, to cry and cry and cry. On the other hand i wanted to hold her, to make her okay, to convince her to stay. 

We ended up lying there crying for ten minutes. I held her and she pulled my arms in. Then my tears turned to anger. Why would she do this to me? Why couldn't she wait for me to be ready? Why would she break my heart again? We talked some, and argued a little. I asked her what she wanted to do now. She asked me if we could still live together as friends, i said no. She asked me if we could do the break thing. I said it sounded like a lot of heartache for me. What was her plan? I would sit at home heartbroken for a month while she went and banged a bunch of dudes? Would she bring them home? Didn't sound like a good time. 

I told her i was gonna go, that we could talk sunday after the festival. She asked me if we were broken up. I asked her if she wanted a green light to bang other dudes, or what? She did. I told her if she did that to me after all this, we were done. She asked me, what if she already did? At this point i could feel insides turn, my heart felt like it was going to explode. Turns out she did some things with a guy on monday before i got to the festival. I told her to tell me everything right now. I was angry. Didn't want to be a fool anymore. Apparently she was drunk and went with a random guy to his tent. He fingered her and ate her out, but she insisted she left after that because she had a boyfriend. She said she was very drunk and it was all blurry. But she was sure they didn't do anything else and she never touched him. I got up, took my bag and walked out the tent. She came out and hugged me, told me she was sorry, that she was such a bitch for doing this to me. I didn't say anything, just looked into the clouded sky, not crying anymore. She said maybe she was just being nuts. She had wanted to talk to a professional before going to me with this, to see if she was being crazy. She was so sad and i felt so bad for her. Wanted to tell her it would be okay. I walked to the train.

Now here i am, in our bed, the day after. I just talked to her on the phone. She was more together now, said we should talk when she gets home sunday. I asked if i could call my mother and tell her, she said yes. My mom is not picking up though, that is why i am writing this. I don't know what to do with myself. I haven't eaten yet and i feel like i am in a dream. Sometimes i think to myself that i can get her to come back to me, that i can be happy again. Most of the time i am just overwhelmed with the situation. I honestly have no idea what i am going to do. Guess i will just go into work monday and see what life is like now. I am afraid i will break down, that i am not in control of myself. 

So my question is: What should i do? Should i try to get her back? I would do anything to have her back right now, but i don't trust myself. I don't even know if we are really broken up. Feel free to ask me anything if you want to.

**tl;dr**: GF (25 f) and I (24 m) in a rough patch after 7 years. She did stuff with other people and we are broken up/on a break. I don't know what to do :("

I've been thinking about moving to Canada for a while now, and I feel like now is the time to do it.
Ive been looking around on this sub and on http://www.cic.gc.ca/ and it seems a lot harder than I originally thought. I have always been hearing about french people going to Canada after they finish their studies, but from what I can tell it is not that simple. I did the eligibility test for the express entry and the other programs and I am apparently not eligible for anything, unless I find a job in Canada before applying. Is it really the only option or did I miss something?

I will in a few month have a engineering degree in computer science, I just need to finish my internship. The company in which I'm doing my internship is offering me a permanent contract afterwards, so going to Canada would make me refuse a job offer in France, which makes the decision quite a bit harder :p (even though it's wouldn't be that hard for me to find another job in France if I really needed to)

I have also read about the Working Holiday Visa, but from what I understand there is no way to stay after the visa expires, so I would have to go back to France (and Canada doesn't seem like a country I would want to leave :p)

Feel free to ask questions if I missed anything, but I'd greatly appreciate your help :)"

4qxipi,1,2016-07-02,Me [29 M] with my cousin/roommate [23 M] are having an apartment dispute.,denominator,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4qxipi/me_29_m_with_my_cousinroommate_23_m_are_having_an/,"Hey all,

I'm really confused by a simple situation with my cousin and would love some 3rd party opinions or suggestions here.

We live in a 3 bedroom, 3 roommate apartment. I live in the biggest room, a third roommate lives in the next largest, and my cousin lives in the smallest (and cheapest) room. I manage collecting and paying the rent, and have lived here for 3 years in the largest and most expensive room. A month ago, the third roommate had to leave the lease early, so both of us arranged somebody to sublet his room. I also arranged for a good friend of mine to takeover that room starting in September for the new lease.

The departing roommate and I agreed on the room sublet and new leaser (my friend) for September. Recently, my cousin spoke up and said he wanted to move into the room in question. I told him this was not possible, because everything had already been arranged.

Now he is causing an uproar, getting his parents involved, and even his father is leaving unsavory comments on my Facebook photos of me going bowling with friends.. Saying ""You're going down the wrong path"". Like, seriously, because of a group photo while bowling?

Honestly, I don't know if I should feel in the wrong here. He is a bit of a recluse (except with a select few of his friends), always avoiding conversation with everybody in the apartment, specifically me for some reason. He is not the best roommate. I always need to clean up after him in the bathroom and kitchen... I never made any comments about it because he is family, and is also a relatively frail guy who usually goes to complain to his mother and father if he doesn't get his way. He's the guy who snapchats all the time, posting pictures of his food, but not actually being a normal social person. When I have friends over, he avoids them. When he leaves for pride weekend in NY, he tells nobody. He'll only speak to me if a girl is around, he is gay and has an affinity for speaking with women but not ME for some reason. Massage a woman's feet? Sure. Talk to me about his internship, or my job interviews, or ANYTHING.. No.

Am I being unreasonable? I don't get it. I know I probably should have discussed the new roommate for September with my cousin, but honestly he does his best to avoid me and makes me feel like a turd. I remember one morning I was dressed to the bridges for an engineering interview and also capstone presentations, and he literally said NOTHING to me as he walked by. We JUST starting talking about the room situation, but he left for July 4th weekend without even giving me July's rent, or letting me know he was leaving for the weekend.

Some people tell me he's totally in the right because he's currently on the lease and the new person entering is not. Others are telling me to let him know I don't like living with him, so too bad so sad he's not getting the room. Do you guys have any insight on this situation?

tl;dr: Cousin wants to takeover a bigger room in the house, but it was already promised to another person by me and the current tenant of the room. Cousin is non-communicative to me, but is telling his parents all about it."
4qxn4h,0,2016-07-02,HOW do I JUSTIFY MY LACK OF cAREER sUCCESS AND hOW dO i STOP COMPARING MYSELF TO MY pEERS?,el_confused,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/4qxn4h/how_do_i_justify_my_lack_of_career_success_and/,"Long post, but here's my situation: I'm 24 years old, I have a BA from UCLA, and I've been working at a grocery store for the last two years. 

I've always had high aspirations for myself--I've always wanted to become a doctor. Due to financial circumstances, lack of proper immigration status, and an inability to get the prerequisite coursework, I chose to get a degree in political science hoping to pursue law school (this decision was made 2009-2011). 

My last year at UCLA (2014), I decided that law school debt and employment opportunities were out of kilter. Loans too high for expected employment. I graduated with a 3.6 (A-), which is not shabby but not too great. I floundered for a year, thinking that I'd take up medical school. But poor family and financial situation really stopped that goal in 2015 Fall. 

I only have work experience in min wage jobs. The one internship that I did start lasted two weeks when I realized I wanted to pursue something else. I was too immature to realize that I should've held on to it. Now it's a black mark on my resume. 

Meanwhile my peers are doing pretty well. It took them a while to find jobs, but they're in entry-level positions. They make enough where there lives are exciting. 

I don't have any passion anymore. I wanted to medicine or law and it made me want to study, want to achieve. I don't feel like working elsewhere...and I don't think any entry-level position would really hire me. I've always been shot down. 

How do I stop comparing myself to my peers? At this rate, the age  when I will most likely achieve financial independence will be early to mid-30s. What cripples me more is my lack of romantic relationships; my peers are getting married, but I can't find someone who finds me stable enough to really get serious with. 

I just needed to vent. Thanks reddit. "

In 2013 I got my first job in retail. Worked great everyone like I and even to this day I still have my friends from that place. In April of 2014 I was approached by a guest while at work who turned out to be an employee for a staffing agency. He convinced me to quit my job and work for distribution center for another retail place for more pay. Being 18 and naive he sold me on the job and I took it. After working there for 2 weeks I was totally drained and unhappy. Working 12 hour days I had never experienced such a drain and I just walked about. The place had a high turnover rate so I told myself it was alright, but 
I should have put in my two weeks. I went back to my first job which took me with open arms. In October of 2015 I took another job at another retail place. They seemed like they weren't willing to comply with my school schedule so I just walked out, again not putting in my two weeks. 

This time I didn't go back to my first job instead I got a job at a web design place as an intern. I worked there for about 6 months and never had a problem with anyone. I ended up putting in my two week there because I changed majors from web design to Arts-Photography and I moved too far away. So in April 2016 I quit the web design place the right way and took some time of with the money I had saved up. Two weeks ago I got two job offers one for a home improve by retailer and one with a warehouse position with my brother. Obviously I took 
the job with my brother after already starting with the home improvement retailer. I called the home improvement retailer and told them I took the other job. I asked if there was anyway I could be rehireable and she said no. I had only went to orientation. So that's 3 jobs I have had where I just walked out without putting in my two weeks. I have never been fired. Now 
this job with my brother is by far the most physical job I think I'll ever have. Just moving double stacked washers and dryers, refrigerators, and double stacked ovens all day out of trucks at starting at 2 in the morning. When interviewed I asked if they had a high turnover rate and they said no, but when I started the employees told me ""you're like the 30th person in 3 months"". I can't do it especially while going to school. It's so hard and early in the morning. I live with my brother who has a child so it's hard for me to get proper sleep. 

I can't tell if these reasons are true or if they are excuses I just tell myself because I am a piece of shit. I have had 6 jobs in the past 3 years and I'm already going for a 7th. 3 of them have been for only two weeks. I've burned these bridges. I feel like an idiot and like people expect this of me. I just want to do something that I can be happy doing while going to school, but I have these jobs on my record forever now and they won't go away. I don't know what to think. I feel horrible. "

I was born in a country where I am called a foreigner. I did my bachelor in a different country in computer engineering and I finished the topper of the class but I am still a foreigner. I couldn't land a job at intel in that country because they cannot accept foreigner fresh graduates (something that I understand fully, but oh well). I am currently back to my original country of birth but can't land a job because most jobs are directed towards the citizens of that country. I can't go back to my country because it is in the state of war and the economy is ruined. 

Having said that, it is not about money for me, I have always wanted to contribute to the welfare of my community, country and the world. However, one needs some money to live at least! At the same time, I am not complaining here, I am just stating the facts and asking for guidance.

4qy8bb,1,2016-07-02,Future Schooling Decision,Skcuhc1,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4qy8bb/future_schooling_decision/,"Here is context:

I am 20 years old, and currently half way through my Junior year at a State University, dual majoring in Accounting and Finance. I transferred to this State School from Community College. I live near the Pittsburgh area.

Due to me transferring in from Community College (Some items didn't transfer the way I wanted them to) and deciding to dual major, I will have to earn 134 credits to earn both of my degrees (which also means me taking extra classes during the semester and a summer/winter class). One of the requirements for testing into the Certified Public Accounting Certification is that the applicant has 150 credits from an accredited college, as well as a Bachelor's Degree in Accounting. In order to reach this 150 credit requirement I will need 16 more credits. That is another semesters worth and totally doable for me. However I am unsure of how I should do this since I have two options. I am expecting to graduate in December of 2017 (I took summer classes last year) and do one of these two options (or another if you guys suggest something smarter) in the Spring of 2018.

1. Take easy classes and use my internship job (which I can convert into credits) to fill in the 16 credits. (I used this internship for 3 credits last semester, I should be able to suck out 12 more credit hours from this job and take two other easy classes to fill the requirement). This would be more profitable for me in the short-run as my internship is paid for so I could place the money into my student loans.

2. Minor in Computer Science OR Information Systems. This option would mean that I have Bachelors Degrees in Accounting and Finance as well as a Minor in Computer Science or Information Systems (muh STEM). I would only wish to do this if it meant better employment opportunities and salary in the long run. Doing either minor would take 18 credits, and would most likely kick my ass due to work load. So if it wouldn't help my job prospect in any way I do not wish to do it. Also if this is the better option, which minor should I take?

I have considered a Master's Degree in Accounting but after realizing I needed only 16 extra credits for the CPA exam I wish to take this other path instead. If worse came to worse I could go for a Masters Degree in the future and hopefully with aid from my workplace. I was also told that in more fields of Accounting than not CPA &gt; Masters.

My loan debt is expected to be ≤$20,000, all Federal so that shouldn't cause any issues either.

Next year, I will focus on computational physics and try for an internship.

After my B.Tech in computer science, I plan to do my M.Tech in computational sciences. With this I will go for my PhD. I want to work for CERN or IceCube. So finally my questions arise.

Is this path fine till my PhD program?
Should I leave bioinformatics behind and only concentrate in computational physics?
Also should I spend some time on parallel and high performance computing?

Also which should be my area of research for my PhD thesis from these -:

 1. Computational Physics.

4qyyb0,3,2016-07-02,What Should I do for my last Semester of Schooling?,Skcuhc1,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/4qyyb0/what_should_i_do_for_my_last_semester_of_schooling/,"Here is context:

I am 20 years old, and currently half way through my Junior year at a State University, dual majoring in Accounting and Finance. I transferred to this State School from Community College. I live near the Pittsburgh area.

Due to me transferring in from Community College (Some items didn't transfer the way I wanted them to) and deciding to dual major, I will have to earn 134 credits to earn both of my degrees (which also means me taking extra classes during the semester and a summer/winter class). One of the requirements for testing into the Certified Public Accounting Certification is that the applicant has 150 credits from an accredited college, as well as a Bachelor's Degree in Accounting. In order to reach this 150 credit requirement I will need 16 more credits. That is another semesters worth and totally doable for me. However I am unsure of how I should do this since I have two options. I am expecting to graduate in December of 2017 (I took summer classes last year) and do one of these two options (or another if you guys suggest something smarter) in the Spring of 2018.

1. Take easy classes and use my internship job (which I can convert into credits) to fill in the 16 credits. (I used this internship for 3 credits last semester, I should be able to suck out 12 more credit hours from this job and take two other easy classes to fill the requirement). This would be more profitable for me in the short-run as my internship is paid for so I could place the money into my student loans.

2. Minor in Computer Science OR Information Systems. This option would mean that I have Bachelors Degrees in Accounting and Finance as well as a Minor in Computer Science or Information Systems (muh STEM). I would only wish to do this if it meant better employment opportunities and salary in the long run. Doing either minor would take 18 credits, and would most likely kick my ass due to work load. So if it wouldn't help my job prospect in any way I do not wish to do it. Also if this is the better option, which minor should I take?

I have considered a Master's Degree in Accounting but after realizing I needed only 16 extra credits for the CPA exam I wish to take this other path instead. If worse came to worse I could go for a Masters Degree in the future and hopefully with aid from my workplace. I was also told that in more fields of Accounting than not CPA &gt; Masters.

My loan debt is expected to be ≤$20,000, all Federal so that shouldn't cause any issues either."

- Several finished projects on GitHub
- 2 Android apps on Play Store
- Built website for company from scratch that I've been maintaining for a year
- Successful internship at a startup
- Started a company
- Good enough in Android, Node, Web Dev, Java, Python, and SQL to make viable products.

I seem to be developing skills for both Mobile and Fullstack development. As a result, I'm not particularly exceptional at either.

Am I overvaluing myself when I ask for 110k as a starting salary for a new grad? I'm definitely still lacking in areas of testing, design patterns, UX, and UI but by the time I graduate, I definitely think I'll be worth 110k.

Should I be persistent in my starting salary goal, lower it, or take a low offer and work at a company for a few months while searching for higher pay?"

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

4qzd3p,1,2016-07-02,Anxious about friend (19F) working with me (19f) soon,benes_the_menace,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4qzd3p/anxious_about_friend_19f_working_with_me_19f_soon/,"My friend Kelly and I are both computer science majors about to start our sophomore years in college. This summer she has a very prestigious internship. I am working at a pretty small company as an intern this summer. I love my work very passionately. I am extremely happy there. 

Kelly is very VERY driven. She studies constantly; her grades are great as a result. She is super friendly and is extremely popular. She is an integral part of my friend group at school and I will be living with her in the fall, as well as two other friends. 

Due to past events (that aren't really necessary to describe in detail) I also realized that she is extremely particular, gets very angry at people who aren't as neurotic about schoolwork as she is (I would never want to be in a group with her), prides herself on not seeing doctors when she's sick (and doesn't take care of herself in many other ways), is willing to do almost anything to get people to like her (including let her true friends and herself get walked all over and mistreated), and other issues. She has been known to tell half-truths to avoid upsetting people, so I often don't know whether to believe her or not about some things. 

She's nice and fun in small doses. I would not want to get close with her. 

The point is, she's started asking about my workplace because she's interested in working there in the fall. I hope to continue working there in the fall as well. She even asked which division I'm working in and which project. Her interests are very similar to mine so I wouldn't be surprised if we work in the same division. And I'm quite certain she'll get the job—this company is in no position to turn someone like her down. 

I answered her questions honestly, explaining the ins and outs of the job and explaining what I did and why it was awesome. I felt bad about wanting to lie. The truth is I don't want to work with her. I love the environment and if we are on a project together I don't want the stress of her micromanaging or taking over. There are things about the workplace I can already imagine her getting upset about and I don't want that kind of negativity there. 

What's worse is (and I know this is immature and stupid and pointless to think about) she's much better at this kind of work than I am and I'm scared she'll somehow replace me. This last concern is not so bad though and mostly in my head; she's not smarter than me I don't think and I've put my best effort in here so I would be really surprised if she replaced me in any way. Her academic advantage over me is mainly because I have trouble buckling down to study, which is a separate issue altogether. Mainly I'm dreading having to be around her so much and deal with the stress and potential negativity that comes with her. 

I'm aware that I can't stop this situation from happening and that it probably is going to become my reality. So: how can I prepare myself for this? And how can I handle it?

Note: I'm not lazy or stupid. I did very well in high school. Like, *very* well. I'm still learning to adjust in college and I'm by no means doing horribly, just kind of average, which I'm really not used to. I'm working on that on my own. This is more of a social problem than anything. 

**tl;dr:** Friend I was trying to keep a healthy distance from is about to join my idyllic workplace. How to keep things civil and not be miserable?"

I've been thinking about posting this for a while. Probably going to be long, but I've got time.

The year was 2010. I had just graduated from a prestigious private high school with 3.8 GPA and a 32 ACT. 

I was admitted to the local state university honors program for biomedical engineering on full scholarship. Because of the excess funds, I was actually being paid to attend school.

I was madly in love with my very first girlfriend.

I began my freshmen year of college with the firm conviction that I was on the right path. 

Little did I know that the world was just waiting to shit profusely on my life. 

In December of that year just before finals, my phone rang and it changed my life.

It was my mom.

""Ring ring""

""Hello""

""7412, I need you to pick up your sister from school.""

""Mom, I'm 30 minutes away and I'm kind of in the middle of some...""

""7412, I NEED YOU TO GO GET YOUR SISTER AND MEET ME AT THE HOSPITAL. ITS DAD. HE'S HURT. ITS BAD.""

""... What? What happened? Is dad ok?""

""No time, just go get your sister and meet me at the hospital.""

Click

I remember siting there for a few moments trying to process what had just happened. Then I grabbed my keys and ran to my car.

The next hour or so is a blur I don't really remember. Got in the car, hauled ass to my sister's school. Told her what mom had said. Hauled ass to hospital.

When we got to the hospital, my mom was just sitting in the lobby crying. 

""Mom! WTF is going on? Where's dad.""

""He's in surgery... There was some kind of accident at work... I don't know...""

The next few days were the worst of my life. For the first 24 hours at the hospital, the only thing I knew was that my dad was is surgery and the doctors weren't sure if he was going to make it. The following details, I found out later.

My dad was a forklift operator. While driving, he ran over an uneven surface. The forklift tipped. Dad reached out with his hand to try and catch himself. The forklift cage crushed his arm.

Dad laid on the ground bleeding out until on his coworkers found him. Dad told him to go get help. The coworker... panicked. He just ran off. Didn't call 911. Didn't go get help. Just fucking took off.

Dad was able to get out his belt and use it as a turniquet. They found him passed out with the belt looped around his arm. His jaws were locked around the end.

They were able to save Dad's life... but not his hand.

His left arm was amputated from just above the wrist on down.

The next couple years were hard. 

Dad had horrible mood swings, was on god knows how many drugs for the constant pain, and had 100+ surgeries. 

I stopped caring about school. 

My grades tanked. 

Lost my scholarships.

Put on academic probation.

My girlfriend dumped me.

I had to pick up a job since my dad couldn't work. 

Because of the mood swings, my relationship with my father became incredibly strained. 

He hasn't been the same person since the accident. Who would have figured?

There's a lot more but I'd like to hurry up and get to the good stuff.

Lets just bullet point shit

Bad Stuff

* Academic probation twice

*  Dad disowned me

* Multiple attempts to get back with GF led to no good for anyone

* Sister attempted suicide

* Other bad shit

Good Stuff

* Landed an internship with a shitty company, for shitty pay, with shitty people

* Shitty internship led to awesome Co-op with pretty cool people

* Awesome Co-op led to better internship 

* Better internship led to several job offers before graduation

* Graduated college with a degree in Mechanical Engineering in May

* Accepted a job offer and starting working in June

* Made up with my Dad (So much more to this, but I doubt anyone wants to hear the sordid details)

* Sister is in a much better place mentally

* Dad is too

* I'm now engaged to an awesome woman

Moral of the story

Bad shit happens

Never give up

All the late nights in the library are worth it


Edit 7.3.16 

Thank you all for your kind words. I posted this hoping to encourage the lurkers out there that anything is possible if you work hard enough.

A low GPA is not the end of the world. 

I graduated with a 2.4 overall GPA.

I had three job offers the December before I graduated.

As best I can tell, the hierarchy of truly important things goes like this.

1. Are you personable? Can you talk to people and make them feel like you've been friends for years?

2. Do you have experience in a semi related field? 

3. Do you have ""Good Grades"" in a related degree.

Hopefully you can answer yes to all three. If not, two of three is usually sufficient. If you answered no to any of these, don't worry. They're all fixable. 

* You can learn to be personable. Just smiling and being friendly goes a long way towards getting people to like you. 

* Have you read How to Win Friends and Influence People? Read it

* You CAN get an internship no matter what. I got my first internship by being prepared. The summer between my 2nd and 3rd year of undergrad, I was in another state visiting family. It was the middle of June. I got an alert on my phone that there was job posting to my school's job board. I immediately checked the board. It was a manufacturing facility looking for engineering interns! I called the listed number and spoke with the HR rep for a few minutes. Sent him my resume. 

* I got that job for three reasons. 

1. I was prepared. I sent my resume in literally minutes after the job was posted.
2. 5 people had turned it down before they hired me because it was shitty pay in a shitty environment with a long commute. 
3. I was willing to do what other people wouldn't.

* That internship led to a co-op, a different internship, and a job offer

* My last internship, I was so broke that I moved to the location with just what would fit in my car. I slept on the ground of my rented ""house"" until I could afford an air mattress.

So while I graduated school with about 40k of debt instead of 0, I still graduated. I truly believe that if I can do it, so can you. 

I'm writing this for you. For the guy/girl that is barely passing. The person that is scraping by. You CAN do this. 

Know one thing. There is nothing in life you cannot do if you refuse to quit. Nothing.

4r03fc,12,2016-07-02,I live in a rent-controlled apartment (NY) and need to leave for a co-op (like a long internship) for 8 months. Landlord says he can legally end my tenancy (and therefore my rent-controlled rate) if I am no longer living here full-time. Looking for info/advice.,rudetoask,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4r03fc/i_live_in_a_rentcontrolled_apartment_ny_and_need/,"My mother lived in this apartment and I was able to ""take it over"" after her death at her rent-controlled rate. I am now a student and have been offered a ""co-op"" which is like a long internship. I will need to live in another state from January to August 2017.

Since this apartment is rent-controlled it is much, much cheaper than comparable apartments and it makes financial sense for me to keep paying rent here rather than finding a new apartment at the end of the co-op.

I had not even intended to inform the landlord of this right now, but another tenant of the building (an old friend of my mother's who cares about me a great deal) threw a little party to congratulate me. The landlord came around to do something and someone told him about my co-op and that it's in another state (this person meant no harm and thought the landlord would be happy for me). 

The landlord in turn asked if I expect to keep living here after that, and I said I did, but he said that if I am no longer staying in the apartment after 30 days he can consider it abandoned even if I have already paid rent and still have items inside. He told me that he's happy for me but that 'financially' he's forced to not allow me to keep the apartment in these circumstances.

I would appreciate any info/advice. I am hoping I can get legal help through my university but I am not sure how much help or what that will entail, so I would appreciate any knowledge anyone can offer. Thank you."

A few months ago, I posted a topic regarding a fan-made concept about a playable [Eliksni Guardian](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/460ov5/eliksni_guardianthe_reclaimed_a_fan_concept_w_art/)

It got a lot of support, and as a result I got a lot of really good feedback. For the last couple of months (Like, during the start of the Spring Update) I have been working on a conceptual document (game-design document style) to further elaborate on the concept itself. Why? Well part of it is for fun, this whole thing has been an exercise in creativity and conceptualization, and part of it is for the folks here who provided all the feedback and support in the first place. But since it's not done yet ( it's close to 60% done, but taking much longer since I now have a part-time job and internship)
I wanted to show some teaser materials from the document. (Also a status update/announcement of this project.)


http://imgur.com/a/8Fhi1


**For starters, here is/are the pages regarding the Envoy class &amp; it's subclasses :**
https://www.dropbox.com/s/17pp78mr17hwymb/Envoy_Subclasses.rtf?dl=0

These pages include new names for the subclasses, new images for them (made by yours truly), new info, and edits I made based on the feedback I've received from the community.

But that's not all.

http://theresiidentdevil.tumblr.com/image/146424259380


Originally, I was going to do all the art for the project myself, however, as my freetime got more limited, I decided to hire some art help. Currently, I have a certain Devil Down The Street helping me do the artwork for this project, and designing all the armor sets for that could be obtained by The Reclaimed and sketching out conceptual character creation obtains for this concept. (Her further works can be found here: http://theresiidentdevil.tumblr.com/  --*Seriously, go give her some love. She does amazing work.*) The armor you see there, is the starter set for the Envoy class, **The Born Again set.** The concept document will also have more concept images drawn by myself and Anna, which include but is not be limited to:

* Concept Art of the Bosses encountered in the Reclaimed's story missions.

* Concept art of the Ghost Shells you could obtain, (Example :http://imgur.com/a/KlupC )

* Concept art of the weapons.

* Concept art of the Exotic armor pieces for the Envoy class. (Examples: http://imgur.com/a/8Jh9J)

* Emblem designs (Examples(s): http://imgur.com/a/kSDBC &amp; http://imgur.com/a/qIUW8 )


**But exactly will this document contain that isn't found in the previous topic?**
&gt;The document will contain:

&gt; * A layout of all the story missions of the Eliksni Guardian/Reclaimed (21 missions in total, all unique to the 
class). 

&gt; * A script of the dialogue and events that happen in each mission and how to beat them.

&gt; * Detailed summaries of the bosses encountered, their combat behavior and stratagems*

&gt; * [Grimoire entries for bosses, events, and more] (http://imgur.com/a/2oDvx)

&gt; * Exotic weapons and armor for the Envoy class

&gt; * Quests exclusive to the Envoy class

&gt; * and more!

**So what needs finishing before I post this document to this subreddit and elsewhere for public consumption?**

Currently:
&gt; * Concept art for the weapons, armor, bosses, etc.
&gt; * Boss battle Info ( nearly 85% complete, have to finish writing out the battle mechanics of 2 more bosses on Venus.)
&gt; * Story Script for each of the missions (the layout of them is finished, and I know exactly what happens during each mission. Right now I have the Prologue mission and the 1st Mission on the Reef complete. I just need to write out the rest.)

&gt; * A few more Grimoire entries, including finishing a few more entries of the Lost Testaments, House Credos, and the bosses.

&gt; * Flavor text for some of the weapons and armor.

&gt; * A few surprises. C;

&gt; * And some polishing and edits.

While I certainly still have a lot to do, I've gotten a lot done and hope to finish this document before **Rise of Iron releases on September 20th.** That's my deadline.

I wanted to announce this, as I wanted to see if this is something that perhaps a large part of the community is still interested in, and wanted to give any preliminary feedback to before/while I proceed as this isn't just for myself but for everyone who helped back the idea in the first place.

Again, this is all for fun, and it's definitely a pet-project, but I feel like I've put a lot of work into this and wanted to see how my audience felt. C:
Hopefully, it's something that interests at least some of you here.

As always, thanks for reading! I hope this post wasn't too long winded (and falls within the guidelines/rules of this subreddit). Comments, concerns, and critique is read and appreciated as always!
 


**-Deedah**

**EDIT: I made a side note, asking if anyone would like to help contribute to the project (help edit and polish, or provide any additional art which I would be willing to pay for.) but I feel by saying contribution, that I miscommunicated that I meant monetary donations which I do not need or require at all (nor would I ask or pressure anyone to do so.). Any money put into this I paid out of pocket from money I've saved up. Also, I felt the last passage was out of place. I apologize for that entirely. Hopefully that didn't leave a bad taste in anyone's mouth.**"

I'm almost to the point of not going through with this idea as I'm not convinced it would play out right and I'd be pursuing this solo. The name/motto for this idea is 

**Yeerow** - *Social Karma*

**What it is** - Yeerow would be a social experience of offering your personal service/product up in an open platform. You might be offering logo design for 10 people and once you open the campaign(what I was calling it), it would go into a categorized new feeds where people can claim them. Once the campaign has been completed, it counts towards the user that offered it in some sort of point system. 

**Why create it** - I believe this type of platform would be great for multiple groups of people. College students and interns can offer these services and way of practice and building up portfolios. Freelancers can offer their services as a way of building clientele as satisfied people would be more apt to return for official business. Budding startups could use this network to assist in bootstrapping and getting an MVP finished. For all of these reasons, my hope was that it will be people consistently paying it forward. 

**Why I haven't went through with it** - I've played around with mockups and spoke with co-workers on it. I've received great responses on it and but I just don't think I can take on this kind of project by myself. I don't even know if it's something the general technical field would be into and get involved with because I don't really have a lot of techie friends.  I don't know the legalities behind it and can't afford a lawyer to talk to as I'm just a family man with a passion for tech and coding. I haven't found any duplicate ideas and knowing that an idea is worth little compared to execution, I'm not worried about people stealing(even though I'm probably not ever going to be able to handle this size of a project on my own anyway). 

So...does this even sound like a good idea worth fighting for or is there a lot of potential for failure? Please be as critical as necessary!

To be fair, Winston Churchill had an army. I had a PFY and a flash drive with enough illegal dealings on it to constitute a crime in simply possessing it.

I had talked to my wife and Motorcycle IT Guy about it, and they both agreed what I needed to do. I took a deep breath, taking in all the courage that I could muster. The day prior I had given Skip instructions to take a week off, to hopefully keep him out of it. I walked into HoHR's office and shut the door behind me. 
 
""Had I wanted the door shut, I would have shut it."" 
 
""Yeah, you and I need to have a little chat."" I threw a folder down on her desk. She flipped through it quickly and immediately stopped. 
 
""Where in the hell did you get this…"" 
 
""That's irrelevant. What's important here is that I have a copy of that, and if you want to keep playing this game then I'll make sure that gets around."" 
 
""That's blackma-"" 
 
""Really? All I'm asking is that you back off your personal vendetta against me."" 
 
""How dare you"" HoHR stood up and pointed at me. ""Do you have any idea who you're dealing with?"" My smile gave away my answer. 
 
""I was somewhat hoping you'd ask that. Do you happen to remember what happened to Intern a couple years back?"" 
 
 Intern was, quite aptly named, an intern. He had worked here for a few weeks one summer, before my time. Apparently, he slipped and fell on a staircase and died. It was a pretty huge fiasco in the building at the time, police inquiries and the like. 
 
""Do you remember that? Intern's untimely death. What would you say if I told you I had a video of you, in the staircase, right as you pushed him."" 
 
""You're lying."" I was, but she didn't need to know that. 
 
""Admit it!"" I yelled at her, I'm sure that everyone in the nearby offices was standing outside of the door at this point. ""I saw it, I saw you do it. You thought you were so clever, making it look like he slipped. Did you really, honestly, think that you'd get away with murder?"" 
 
""What do you want…"" She whispered, a broken shell of the plume of hatred she had been up until that point. I almost felt sorry for her, knowing what was about to happen. She was 
 
""What I've always wanted, to do my job and have you leave me the hell alone."" I paused ""Unfortunately, that's not in the cards at this point now is it?"" 
 
 It was at that point that the Detective walked into the room.

**Chapter 14 – The Aftermath**

The coming months were arduous, to say the least. I had made a deal with the Detective beforehand, I plead guilty to being an accessory to a crime and my sentence was five years of probation. I pulled the trigger on everyone, all at once. They arrested the Head of HR (HoHR) for murder, and she was convicted several months later. To the best of my knowledge, she's not only still in jail, but won't be up for parole until my children can vote. The CEO was convicted for insider trading, which is the blackmail that HoHR had on him. Money somehow escaped the laundry list of convictions, which I'm not sure how that happened. 
 
 Really Cool VP and several other VP's spun off into their own firm, and when they did they presented Skip and myself the opportunity to work with them at $NewCompany. We're both still there to this day, the PFY and myself. Work here is rather uninteresting compared to the events that happened at $Company, but I'd rather not be interesting. Motorcycle IT Guy decided  to move out of the area, and settled down somewhere in Arizona. The last I heard from him he had gotten married and was expecting a little one of his own. 
 
 Unfortunately, the events at $Company were completely true. When I decided to write my tale, as unbelievable as it sounds, I first contacted the Detective to ask if I should even bother. He has read over and given his blessing on this version of events. I wish I could say that I didn't have to change things to protect the innocent, no matter how few of them there were. Both Skip and the Detective read over this story, and both of them agreed that it's detached enough for it to protect ourselves. 
 
Since I know you won't appreciate a cliffhanger. Dan is currently retired. When $Company went under he decided that he was done. He survived a heart attack not too long ago, so I suppose he can't be in that great of health. 
 
 Oh, one last thing before I close this tale. The PFY has instructed me to write both a set of tales involving $Company before I was given Sword or MITG quit, and another set for the events at $NewCompany. I'll be starting those soon, so this isn't the last you'll hear from me. 
 
 Cheers, 
rstrt

**A short story about my love for character action games**

Firstly, I will talk about my favorite genre, which is the Character Action genre. As you guys can see in these two pictures, [like this one](http://i.imgur.com/ou9D01v.jpg) and [then this other one](http://i.imgur.com/vkubCCD.jpg), I'm quite fond of the genre. Since my PS2 days I've been in love with these stylish combos and characters, and I've lost count of how many times I have beaten Devil May Cry 1. Everything about the combat feels nice, the soundtrack adds a nice touch to the game, even though the plot is somewhat lacking in comparison with western ""AAA"" titles. Upgrading your character, unlocking new combos and difficulties adds a huge amount of replayability. My all time favorite is DMC3, despite being the hardest one. There was also Viewtful Joe, equally hard.

There's something that I find really funny: When I was a kid I managed to complete, in every difficulty level, both DMC1 and 3, but I can't do this now, 11 years later, because my reflexes are not that great anymore!

**About the game I want**

After this great PS2 era, I got a x360 and purchased **DMC 4** on its release date in 2008 (my console was bought circa 2006) and I simply LOVED Nero, the new main character, only to find out that I would be fighting against Dante frame 1 after starting the gameplay! I felt like in MGS2, where Snake gets replaced by Raiden and everyone, except me, got upset. *""I know it's not what I used to play, but he got someth...""* **BAM**

Here we go, DEMON ARM. Now I can fetch farther enemies without relying on the stinger, keeping the combo alive in a cool way, and then, further in the game, we can use Dante once again, but this time it is possible to switch Styles ON THE FLY. It was nuts.

After a while I got the DMC HD Collection on the x360 and replayed them all. I love this series so much that I bought it once again on the PS3, but right when I was going to get DMC4 again, they decided to re-release this gem.

Now, on this PS4 version, it is possible to play with even more characters (Virgil, Trish and Lady), including new costumes and stuff.

I always wanted to import a physical copy, but I decided to forget about it and get a digital copy. The problem is that I - compulsively - spent money that I couldn't spend, and now I have to save some to pay for college. It's also my break from college, and my internship is going to give me a break from 11-15, but I will not earn money for this (which is something OK since it's not a real ""job""), so my income will be even lower this month. You know... *college*.

So I decided to ask for this game here. The price is quite harsh (there are cheaper games out there), but some good soul could help me relieve all this good, fast-paced memories. I promise I will get good and do combo!"

As the title said, I'm currently working on a small team of interns on database design and a web-based CRM app. Thus far the workload shared has been incredibly disproportionate - peaking last Wednesday when, after meeting to discuss our next steps and outline *specifically* what needed to be done for the rest of the week, I completed all but one or two of the tasks on our itemized list of ~15-20 while they played various games and chatted around.

Our chemistry as a team (on a personal level) is pretty solid and I hate to be the guy to kill the fun, so it's hard to take a stand and tell them to stop dicking around and actually contribute. What makes it harder is that some of them are openly accepting of just how little they do, meaning that even if I do take a stand it's entirely likely that nothing will change. I'm afraid that, if this continues, the project will fall short of our goals and that will reflect poorly on everyone involved.

I have a midterm review on Tuesday - a one-on-one with my manager. I'm thinking this is a strong opportunity to bring this issue up and hopefully get some sort of resolution kicked into gear. However, I really don't want to come across as a ""tattle-tale"", nor do I want it to appear as if I'm throwing my team under the bus.

Is talking it over with my manager the right decision here, or should I go directly through my team first?  Is there another option here that I should be considering?

Thanks in advance for any input, I really feel like I'm in a bind here."
4r0wzb,45,2016-07-03,surgery underway,rubiesintheskies,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4r0wzb/surgery_underway/,"I finished med school this past month and through some colleagues I have made my way into rounds, no time off for a vacation. Just the need to dive right into work. I've been interning in the OR for about two weeks now, working 36 hour shifts with 12 hours of rest in between each. After a while the lack of sleep, food, and sunlight start driving you to the brink of insanity which is why I thought nothing of the events that happened two nights ago. I attributed everything to a stressed out mind but I'm not sure if that's all there is to it anymore. 

The majority of the time the OR is a hustle and bustle of moving bodies with a constant flow of patients, hospital staff and gurneys coming in and out. Those days are the toughest, especially on your feet. There are other days where the pace seems to slow down and we get a breather. The doctors bring in residents from other specialties and we're off the hook from operating though we still need to make rounds. Then come the days of legend: Dead days. That's what the other residents call them. Once in a blue moon the operating rooms are empty and we have no scheduled surgeries just an occasional emergency but even that's rare since most emergencies usually need stitches and a tetanus shot. 

Two nights ago was one of those days. Everything stopped moving around 10:43 pm. The hospital had fallen into a sleepy lull. There were eight of us in total that night: 2 floor doctors, 2 nurses, 2 residents, and 2 interns. Most of us had been up for more than 18 hours at that point and were just begging for somebody to show up and help us fight the boredom that had taken residence in the first floor of the hospital. We all chatted for a while or checked our phones and if things really got boring we did some paperwork. By 12 Dr. Smith (with holding name for obvious reasons) said he'd had enough for today and if anything came up we should get him from the break room. We all nodded and watched him go out the doors into the hallway. Soon after the nurses followed saying they needed to go out for a smoke. ""You'll be fine without us for a few minutes right?"" ""Sure thing, have one for me too."" Jen, my intern companion had quit smoking a few months back and she'd always say that the hospital made her want to start again. 

Now it was down to us three to man the fort. Jen, Dr. Joe and me. 

Not more than fifteen minutes had passed when it started. Being the one closest to the door that lead to the operating rooms I heard it first. One of the swinging doors had opened. I looked away from my phone and towards the sound. ""Hey Jen, did you hear that?"" I asked. ""Huh?"" she said as she pulled out a headphone. ""What? Sorry."" ""Just now, there was a sound."" ""I didn't hear anything...obviously,"" she smirked and put her headphone back in. Dr. Joe was in the cubicle away from the desk and it seemed like he hadn't heard anything either. I shook it off and went to get a book out of my bag.

An ear splitting shriek filled the room, stopping me dead in my tracks. I looked back and saw Jen stand up straight and take both headphones out. ""I heard that one..."" she whispered. Dr. Joe came running out, ""What the hell?"" We all made our way to the doors that connected the room to the rest of the operating floor. ""What was that? Somebody messing around? Initiation week for us or something like that?"" I asked. ""Not that I know of..."" answered Dr. Joe. We made it to the other set of swinging doors and looked through the small windows into the next hallway. All clear. Dr. Joe pushed one of the doors open and stuck his head out, ""Anybody there? Anybody need assistance?"" There was no reply, just a thick silence that made my stomach lurch. He walked out of the room and now stood completely in the hallway where he stood frozen with a puzzled look on his face. Jen and I walked out as well and looked towards where he was facing. Operating room 4 had its lights on.

""PLEASE! STOP! PLEASE! IT HURTS! THE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! THE ANESTHESIA DIDN'T WORK! PLEASE STOP!""

Dr. Joe bolted towards the room rather quickly for a man his age. Jen and I took off after him, stopping just behind him as he threw open the door. Sure thing, the lights were on but there was nobody in sight. ""Stay outside. Look into the other rooms, carefully."" Jen took the first two while I walked back to number five. I pushed the door open and waited as the lights flicked on. Empty. I let out a relieved breath and went to check out room 3. Same thing. Dr. Joe was still looking into room 4, rubbing the bald spot on the back of his head. Jen walked up next to me. ""All clear on this end. Hey Doc, just...what was that?"" He shrugged his shoulders, ""Dunno, collective insanity? Let's just go back."" He turned around, closed the door behind him and waited until the lights turned off before walking back into the main room. With our nerves rattled we settled back down on the chairs at the nurse's station. 

From behind us came a child like whimper that made us all spin around. There she stood, no more than 5'3'', dark complexion, small build probably 100 lbs., dark hair matted to her head. She was wearing one of the hospital's robes, a little stained around the abdomen. ""It....hurts...I-I told them it didn't work but they just kept cutting..."" she whimpered. Jen and I sat in the chairs with our mouths hanging open. ""Um...what exactly happened?"" asked Dr. Joe, obviously the more composed one out of all of us. The young woman crumpled to the ground and began screaming. ""They wouldn't let me go! They kept hurting me! Please don't let them hurt me!"" Dr. Joe ran to her and gently helped her to her feet, ""Get me a bed ready!"" Jen set up a bed while the doctor and I moved the patient. We laid her on the bed and began to do a routine exploration while Dr. Joe asked her some basic questions to which he got no response. She had gone catatonic and just stared blankly at the ceiling. I had just finished hooking her up with an IV when I heard Jen gasp. I turned around and saw the expression on her face. She had lifted the robe just above the navel only to reveal a horridly sutured jagged, incision. I pulled down the robe and walked back to the nurse's station to call the cops. Dr. Joe ran out to get security and probably some help. Jen took a seat next to me and put her head in her hands. ""Just what is happening D?"" I shrugged and waited for the other end of  the line to be picked up. Looking over my shoulder to check on our patient I froze, letting the receiver fall from my hand. ""Shit..."" Jen turned to me and then turned around.

She was gone. The bed was empty, with absolutely no trace of where she had gone. I felt my blood run cold and my knees shake. Dr. Joe showed up with the nurses, Dr. Smith and security. He looked at the empty bed with disbelief and then looked at us. 

For the next two hours the hospital was on lockdown while police searched the building looking for the woman that fit our description. We told them everything that had happened that night and how she had just vanished. They came to the conclusion that we were overworked and probably just tired, there was nothing out of the ordinary. We tried to tell them there was no way we could have all imagined the exact same thing but they seemed to think otherwise. Come sunrise we were escorted out of the building and were told to go home.

It's been two days since and we've all made it back to the hospital...it's late. I just heard the door swing open.

Luckily I made it home safe with no incident, but it scared me and my fiancee when I told him. I was able to get a nap in and we went to fireworks. 

Fast forward to bed time. We go to bed at about 1am and I just laid there. All night. I had to be up at about 8 to go to an internship. I finally got out of bed at 6 because I was worried I would wake him up.  I was on the couch for maybe 5 minutes before he woke up and asked me what was wrong.

I broke down. I just started bawling about how tired I was and how it doesn't make any sense and how my body hurt physically and mentally and I just kept crying. He is amazing. He held me and after some sweet talk and convincing I decided to stay home from my internship.

I sent the appropriate emails and after checking my paperwork we found out that I can have benadryl for sleep/allergies. And that's where I am now. Cartoons are on and he is making us breakfast while we wait for the benadryl to kick in.

I live in India and hope to get into a good computer science program in a reputed university (in USA-I'm also applying to other countries but in this context I'd like help with the USA colleges).


I recently gave my ACT and got a 34 in it (35,35,33,30) but my school grades are pretty erratic. In my 9th class I got an 8.8 (out of 10) and then in 10th I got a 9.4 (again, out of 10). In class 11, things changed a lot and I did horribly and averaged an 81.9 (out of 100). I'm in my 12th right now and just gave the ACT on 11th June. Since I had previously given the SAT and miserably failed (got 1850-M700,CR570,E580), I studied really hard for the ACT and ignored the studies going on in my school. My exams are coming up in 20 days and I have not done anything and am expecting not more than an average of 75 (out of 100) which is pretty bad. So my grades increased from 9th to 10th but then miserably fell in 11th and 12th.

I've been attempting to develop a portable wildlife web cam that'll be accessible to people externally. I have no issue with the web side of it, my issue is the software to use for this.

I'm currently an intern for the RSPB and looking to get this set up to view bats, birds and other critters at night (NoiR). I've attempted to set up MJPG-Streamer and had no luck. I like the look of the interface. I had success with VLC but it's severely limited in functionality web wise.

Does anyone here know any software where I can essentially create a simple web page and stream the camera?

My hardware:

Raspberry Pi B,
NoIR camera,
UBEC GPIO battery pack,
Raspbian (NOOBS) 16 GB,

I appreciate any replies!

Cheers guys."

Hi there. I'm about to start the college application process. I live in India and hope to get into a good computer science program in a reputed university (in USA-I'm also applying to other countries but in this context I'd like help with the USA colleges).

I recently gave my ACT and got a 34 in it (35,35,33,30) but my school grades are pretty erratic. In my 9th class I got an 8.8 (out of 10) and then in 10th I got a 9.4 (again, out of 10). In class 11, things changed a lot and I did horribly and averaged an 81.9 (out of 100). I'm in my 12th right now and just gave the ACT on 11th June. Since I had previously given the SAT and miserably failed (got 1850-M700,CR570,E580), I studied really hard for the ACT and ignored the studies going on in my school. My exams are coming up in 20 days and I have not done anything and am expecting not more than an average of 75 (out of 100) which is pretty bad. So my grades increased from 9th to 10th but then miserably fell in 11th and 12th.

My skill set from class experience includes Windows Server administration (2 classes), Networking (2 Classes), UNIX/Linux (1 Class), OS Security/Security Principles (2 Classes), C++ Programming (3 classes but not by strongest skill set), and countless other courses (GPA 3.61).

.

In addition to class experience from labs, I have been actively working as an assistant to the System Admin for the computer science department. This has helped me grasp the concept of client/server architecture from our windows domain environment, hardware repair, printer setup, OS deployment with Imaging Software (Ghost-Cast), VMware Esxi, etc... I also was given the opportunity to intern at Sandia National Labs where I am currently working as a cyber intern developing virtual systems using Xen Server. This has given me the opportunity to apply my knowledge on  Windows Server administration, as well as learn on virtual networking via VyOS, and basic Exchange installation and configuration to setup mail servers.

.

 
What would career advice would this community provide for me? I am actively pursuing career to become a Jr Admin (to build my way up as a System Admin eventually). Am I pushing for a career that still above my expertise, and if so what job titles would you recommend I pursue?  Thanks for reading and any advice!!

.

 
PS. (Also studying Cisco Networking  on the side through books, lynda tutorials, and packetracer).....

Also, I am looking for a position that not only pays well ($55k+), but that will help me learn more about the Networking/Administration field. I am pushing for $55K + as many students from my school earn $50+ with far less experience (not saying I'm better than them, but if I know more than them, I believe that I should earn more than them, please don't take this as a sense of arrogance, I just want to earn what I believe is fair).

4r2gpa,1,2016-07-03,[21F] dating [20M] for almost 5 years,tenobrac,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4r2gpa/21f_dating_20m_for_almost_5_years/,"Come august, my boyfriend [20M] and I [21F] will have been together for 5 years. The beginning of our relationship was quite rocky due to the fact that we were young. He was 15 and I was 16. After that first year though, things couldn't have been better. We really started to truly love each other and had a great relationship. Never truly fighting, just have small arguments that we were able to talk out in a civil way. We were able to have fun and goof off. 
That all has really changed this year. Lately my boyfriend [20M] has been experiencing depression. This is something he had never experienced before never really understanding depression or why people couldn't just be happy. And now for the first time, he truly knows what it's like to be depressed.


Here's some background about him. He's a logical thinker. All of his decisions are based on what the logical thing is to do. If it helps his personality type in INTP (me being an INFJ). He's ambitious in that when he finds something new he likes, he really gets into it and is eager to be good at it/obtain the skills needed. For instance his job. 


Straight out of high school, he was able to obtain a stable full time job. He was chosen out of many people for an internship at a circuit board design company, many of these people being in their late 20s with college experience under their belt. But not him, he had no college experience and was barely 18. But he was chosen and eventually hired. To this day he still works there (about 2 years). 
He wants to reach his goals, and he wants it as soon as possible. But he never really slows down to think about the process of getting where he wants to be. 


The first factor that really set off his depression was actually his job. He works in an environment where in the office the lights are turned off all day. His coworkers are much older than him so he finds it hard to get along with him. On top of that, one his coworkers is rude toward and goes out of his way to show my boyfriend [20M] that he doesn't like him.
He admitted to me the other day that he feels he's not ready for this type of job commitment as it is one he could stay in for life making decent money. He honestly wants a minimum wage job where he has more free time and there's less of a commitment. He's starting to use his emotions to make his decisions in that since his job makes him depressed, he wants to quit. He would rather be happy and broke than rich and depressed. 


Another factor I recently learned is my friendship with his brother. He is one of four children with an older brother and an older sister, as well as his younger brother. Within the last year or so me and his young brother [18M] have become really close. We both have a similar sense of humor and similar personalities. We both starting going through rough times with friends and (for him) girls. We both didn't really have anyone and started opening up to each other and now we hang out every single day. During the winter time, all of three of us would hang out every day. He has truly become my best friend and the little brother I never had.


It was great. The two of them butt heads sometimes but we still had a great time. Because of my boyfriend's depression, he's gotten more fed up with his brother and has become more distant. His brother has good intentions at heart. He can a bit disrespectful and take things a bit too far. He does purposefully annoy (my boyfriend) because he knows it annoys him. 
Since [18M] and I hang out so frequently a few of my boyfriend's friends have made comments about us hanging out a lot. It's something I understand because it is weird that I've become best friends with my boyfriend's brother. But the only person whose opinion matters is obviously my boyfriends. And honestly there have been many instances where he encouraged us to hang out and he has explained the situation to his friends and has told me that he's okay with it.
Yesterday, was a rough day for my boyfriend. He has been planning to go camping up north with a few friends for about a week. Once the day came, plans fell through and he was quite bummed about. It honestly ruined his entire day.


His mother has a place up north on the lake and invited everyone up to hang out and see fireworks (4th of July weekend). So instead of him camping, we went up to the lake. He was clearly in a bad mood. When he's upset he makes it known. He's down and pushes everyone away. In an effort to cheer him up I decided to be the one to drive (he usually drives, and it's ~1hr drive). We stopped off at McDonald's on the way and throughout the day I'd give him the space he needed but whenever I saw him I'd tell him that I love him and give him a hug, a comfort pat, a kiss, etc. 
During the day, we (me, him and the fam) we were hanging out, talking, and he clearly wasn't interested in the conversation. He left randomly and I asked him where he was going and he said a walk. I asked if he wanted me to go with him, and he said no. So I let him go. His brother asked if I wanted to go kayaking with him so I said yes, and we did for a bit. When we got back, my boyfriend wasn't there and his brother wanted me to with him on the atvs so we did that as well. Later on, when we got back the fireworks were starting and I made sure to sit with my boyfriend. At the end of the night he admitted that he feels that his brother is more important to me than he is and that I wasn't there when he needed me.


A few other things is we had a talk recently about how he felt that he knows that I love him but doesn't feel it. And we talked about how he'll go out of his way to change for me but I won't change for him. And I told him that he was 100% right. And I feel horrible about it. (by ""change"", I mean bad habits not an overall personality change). I've been trying my best to go out of my way to show him that he's loved, but I feel it's too late and the bad out ways to good.

Lastly, along with his brother stuff, I mentioned that his brother probably annoys him because of the way my boyfriend reacts to situations. He gets quite angry and worked up easily. My boyfriend felt I was blaming him and I told him my intention wasn't to hurt to him but maybe see things from another perspective and I now see what I said was wrong.


He keeps saying he's confused and he loves me, but he also feels resentment toward me. I guess what I need advice in is what to do. I hate seeing him this way, but I feel no matter what I do I upset him. I just don't know what to do anymore."

I'd like to spend $500-$650, but I'd be willing to spend up to $800 if I find something that is worth the extra money. In the US.

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 

Good battery life is definitely one of my criteria, as well as at least 8GB of RAM. My current mac is 6 years old and has 4 GB of RAM, which I find isn't enough. Storage space would be nice but not a huge requirement, as I will likely end up getting an external drive anyway.

* **How important is weight to you?**
 
Not important

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
 
Windows

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 

At least 15.6''

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 

This is important. I'm about to enter my senior year in college as an Engineering major, and I currently am working an internship where I am using different CAD programs. I plan to keep this computer and this job for a long time, I'd like to be able to work from home with these programs after graduation, and continue using them through senior year. I will also require it for general school use and downloading hundreds of GBs of music and movies. Here are some of the programs I'd like to be able to run on my laptop, and simultaneously if possible:

AutoCAD MEP, Revit, AGi32

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
 
Probably won't be doing much gaming on this computer

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
 
Of course good input devices are always a plus, but no hard requirements here for me

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**

Basically I want a good computer for school and business, I've been using a macbook for the past 6 years, it's held up nice but it's definitely time for an upgrade and now that I'm about to graduate college and start working, I need a reliable windows computer. I was looking at some Lenovos but had a hard time finding one in my budget that met my requirements. Found some Dell inspiron laptops too, but some of my friends advised me against getting a Dell computer, saying it will only hold up for 2 or 3 years. Any help in finding a good fit for me would be much appreciated. Thanks!"

   Academics:   
   
4.0 UW GPA

1/~300 in a public high school

35 ACT (35 E, 36 M, 34 R, 34 S)

790 Chemistry SAT 2

Rigorous courses. Took almost all the AP sciences except Physics C and CompSci. 

.


ECs: 

Quiz Bowl (9th - 11th), Environmental Club (secretary), Beta Club (10th -11th), Tutoring (10th - 11th), Violin (~9 years, went to All-state, involved in my local youth orchestra), internships in science labs (9th and 10th), various regional awards. Will most likely be a National AP scholar by the beginning of senior year, if that matters.

.

Here's my list so far:

Reach: Cornell

Match: GA Tech (most likely)

Safety: UGA (automatic acceptance for valedictorians and salutatorians)


Yeah, I only have 3 schools :P. Financial aid is very important for me, since my mom switched careers a year ago, and my dad works an average paying research job. I have the Zell and HOPE scholarships if I stay in Georgia, and any OOS colleges should have good scholarships. I'm looking for colleges with good STEM programs, but with a friendly, liberal, non-cutthroat atmosphere. I know that my stats are very good, but I don't know if I can really aim for the super prestigious colleges, since my ECs aren't spectacular. Since I'm going into engineering, I don't think that matters too much, but I still want a college that will challenge me academically, and that will provide me with a lot of opportunities. I'd be completely happy if I go Tech, but I'm still looking to expand my college list.

4r38i8,79,2016-07-03,My [21/f] room mate [22/m] owes me hundred of dollars in rent money after only living with me for two months and needs me to drive him to and from work.,macaroni_veteran,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4r38i8/my_21f_room_mate_22m_owes_me_hundred_of_dollars/,"My room mate (who we will call Bob) is a chef and part time student who was fired from his second job for being late within a week of moving in, and had been looking for another one before I got him a cooking job at the strip club that I work at. I gave him the option of being MY tenant instead of the landlords when he moved in (so that I would be responsible for our 1250 rent and he would pay me his half instead of paying the landlord) but he refused.

If it weren't for this situation, I would be having an entirely stress-free summer. I have an internship with a newspaper (I am an English and Journalism student) which pays for my gas, I'm taking two easy online courses for college, and before Bob moved in I worked one or two nights at a strip club a week for groceries and fun-money. I am blessed- my father pays my rent, utilities, and car insurance. If it were not for this situation with my room mate, I would be having an amazing summer. 

When he first moved in, Bob was struggling with paying his security deposit. He is my friend and I am a stripper who makes a considerable amount of money per night, so I lent him four hundred dollars to help him pay his deposit (two months of rent). I think this set the precedent. It was around this point that he was fired from his other job, which he waited until the end of the month to tell me (after I'd assumed that he'd already payed his security deposit and the landlord began angrily texting me because Bob wouldn't answer his phone when they called).

Bob cried to me about how he has never had to pay this much rent by himself before (he used to live in a cramped apartment with his friend and his girlfriend and their child, and only payed 200 per month without utilities). He is also trying to save up money to go back to community college (he dropped out and needs to pay 1800 for the classes he was taking because financial aid won't cover these unfinished courses) and was regretting ever signing the lease. I forwent sleep that week so that I could work at the club an extra two nights to scrounge together most of the rest of the money. He contributed 500.

He spent the next few weeks applying to jobs and sitting around the house smoking pot and playing video games.He is apparently a month behind on rent somehow (he owed the landlord last months rent as well as the security deposit we paid) and needed to pay this month's as well by Friday. 

I got him a job as a chef at the strip club I work at. He does not drive, so last week I needed to drive in to work at the club three hours early so that he could start prepping food while I sat in the back and did my homework and wrote articles for work. 

Before I got Bob this job, I was hoping to quit. I've been dancing on and off for six months, and I absolutely hate it now. It was fun and exciting initially, but the harsh, sad reality of being a stripper has really set in for me. I'm surrounded by drug addicts and perverts, have become desensitized to being groped and insulted, and get treated like shit by my boss every time I come in (for example, I tried to reschedule for this week to fit my schedule at my internship and he took me off the schedule for the whole week). 

Apparently the other chef also lives in our town and may be able to drive Bob, but if he doesn't, I'll have to take a collective hour and twenty minutes driving him to and from work each day, coming home early from my internship to do so. I have a job as a bartender at a private social club lined up that will begin next week and will pay me 200 under the table three nights a week. 

I've talked to my landlords, and if Bob gets kicked out, I will need to pay his half of the rent until I find another tenant to live with me. I do not know anyone else looking for housing (I'm in college for an extra year and all of my friends have graduated).

Additionally, the worst part- last week, when I told Bob that I couldn't work any more days to help him, he said ""okay, I'll talk to my mom about lending me the money. I didn't want it to come to this"". WHAT THE FUCK? WHY DIDN'T YOU DO THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE? For now, we've worked out that until he pays me back, he does all of the dishes and the cleaning. He also cooks a lot of my meals. However, he acts pretty indignant about this (the nerve!)

Bob's father deals marijuana (which was a very foreign concept to me- I come from a white upper class family and couldn't imagine my father dealing) and Bob says that he's going to start dealing to help pay his funds until he's in a stable situation. He says that he might start dealing to the girls at the club. I'm not sure how much he would make doing this and don't want him to risk his job. 

Bob insists that this situation is temporary until he finds another job and that the fact that he needed to pay the security deposit and a month's rent initially in addition to his job loss screwed him up. He promises me up and down that in a month or two, he will not need my help at all. Do you guys believe this? What do I do? 

I did not fucking sign up for this.

TL;DR: Roommate owes me over 800 dollars, needs me to drive him to work every day, and wants to start selling pot to cover the difference. To cover his ass, I need to work extra hours at my second job that I'd wanted to quit. This situation is wearing me thin.

UPDATE: Room mate just sent this text to our landlord:

""I thought I could afford the apartment but I just don't make enough. I deeply apologize, my only offer to you is  a possibility to set up a payment plan. If not, I will find a new place to live. Thank you for your time and hospitality""

When he called me about it, he asked if I wanted to move to a new place with him. Obviously I don't, but I don't know if I can find anyone new that I actually know personally in the near future. "

It started with an Asian sensation that graduated from an underdog liberal arts college. He wanted to become a doctor, but was rudely reminded by life that he was waaaaaaaay too immature to even consider it. Yet he blindly followed his parents so stereotypically and tried to convince himself that he should become one. And so he interned for a neurosurgeon and was acknowledged as one who provided the ""gold standard of patient care."" But I digress.


At the end of this internship, he was offered a 50/50 split of a startup for a VR project (I'm calling him today). It was because of this bait that this crusty, yet crafty, asshole was able to get a dope dick PC on behalf of his father's credential sacrifice. Father of the Year. 


I made it sound way worse than it actually sounds. I wanted a dope gaming PC and I knew that gaming would ultimately enhance my career. I just wanted to make sure that my father realizes this as he lacks the deep understanding that all of us do. But he put himself into more credit card debt and so he sacrificed out of love for his son. I cannot thank him enough for how grateful I am to have such a great father.


However, there was a condition. In order to keep this PC, the GRE's would have to be taken and I would have to apply to graduate schools. Fuck. Standardized tests are the bane of students. Still though, I would only be studying for several hours and I would use my off-time to research and hone in on the craft of YouTube. I home-paged this sub-reddit and did my best to learn and contribute. 


The hardest part of starting was to pick a good name. Most people have boring ass names. Markiplier told me that his name is literally mark + multiplier and I felt a little disappointed. The hug helped though. 


And so I needed a good name. Well, my last name is literally Moon and so I decided to pick one of the 20+ nicknames that I've acquired in my life. Want me to list them? No. I'll only give 4: Moonbear, Moontang, Mooney, and The Last Moon. 


By the time I was 10 years old, I had already lived in 3 different continents. I had seen more of the world than over 99% of kids my age. Yet, through this incredible journey, the trade-off was that I had to lose ALL of my friends. When you're young. It's hard. Really hard. I wanted siblings to keep my lonesome self company, because at least they wouldn't leave...but after 3 miscarriages, enough was enough. I couldn't bear myself to ask my mother to go through this pain again. Every person goes through tragedy. It is our choice to let it shackle us, or empower us.


Okay so cool name. Next is the hard part, picking a reason to start. The honest truth that often people try to trick themselves into believing is that they are a special snowflake. They think that they are providing a service to the community, yet the reality is that there are 1000's of people who provide the same thing. That is why, economically, the Let's Play format is considerably favorable for those who have capitalized it during it's scarcity. I digress.


I started off wanting to show kids that there is nothing wrong with being yourself. I say kids specifically because I understood the demographic of the audience who watch the big 3: PewDiePie, Markiplier, and Jacksepticeye. Puberty.


I wanted to give a gift, because I had recently passed the never-ending gauntlets of adolescence with flying colors and high self-esteem. I wanted to give the gift of wisdom to those struggling with the same things that I did. And so I created a series dedicated to this. It still goes on (I look at my old ones and cringe, but it's nice to see that I was able to feel more comfortable).


Luckily, because I was in film club during high school, I had editing skills. And so after finishing the GRE's with an average score, applying to top tier schools with an average GPA, I created my channel ( I even applied to Cornell University). Initially, I went into CS:GO casual lobbies and shoutcasted (I have a blessing and a curse: I don't shut the fuck up). This brought me my initial traffic that reached up to around 300.


At this point I did let's plays with a format of one game genre on specific days. This failed because to viewers, it felt like the same thing. But then luckily, one of my good friends referred a contest held by TechSource, a channel with 500k subs. I entered my submission and headed off to South Korea. It was at this point that my channel experimented with vlogs. It was okay. I do it only for travel. Anyway, while I was in Korea, TechSource featured me and through this recognition, I was able to hit the 1000 sub milestone. I made a celebratory video of myself playing the guitar like august rush. It's the only real song I know on the guitar to trick people into thinking that I can play the guitar. Or maybe I'm just tricking myself into believing that I can't play the guitar. Too meta. Moving on.


Because of this 1000 sub threshold, I was allowed to attend a 2-day YouTube Creator Academy program and begun my networking journey. I broke a record in which I was able to recall 30+ names and channel names. At the beginning of the program, an instructor hinted at this challenge, and being sensitive to information, I decided to go the extra mile and record everyone's name and channel name and study in the morning before the final class. Like a swan, on the outside I may seem like a flawless sack of feathers, but I'm pedaling my ass off underwater just to keep on moving. If you want to attend this program, just google YouTube Space, home-page their site, and check their calendar every day.


I gained a lot of wisdom through this experience. I met a lot of great people. Here's a [gif](http://imgur.com/7SHrx0V) of all of us. I'm the one with the kid on my shoulders. 


It was at this point that I had entered a contest held by PewDiePie. He wanted us to take his catch phrase and put a fun, unique, and creative spin on it. I had been teaching myself Swedish over the months as a side project so that I could relay the core message of my channel to him one day. But up to this point, I had been using my camera phone or a webcam to record myself. While I was in Korea, one of my best friends donated money to me and I was able to buy a canon 70D, an amazing dynamic mic (RE320), and other studio equipment. I'm deeply indebted to him. 


After the creator academy program, I was featured on PewDiePie. I have a video that's been seen by over 8 million people. TWO people actually recognized me at Vidcon. Unbelievable. And it was at this point that I tasted the temptations of fame. The volatile fire that can either empower you to burn brighter or leave you as a pile of smoldering ashes. It was because of this recognition that I was able to gain my current 4000 subs. I was expecting to grow larger, but the circumstances of the video wasn't an active call to attention. It was just purely off the incentive of the audience if they were interested in me.  I believe this is much better than a Shepard herding sheep to me. It was a hero that came to seek wisdom.


At this point, I started to get weary of showing my face all the time. When I played video games in the let's play format, it felt like a burden. I wasn't playing video games the same way I loved to. It wasn't about the game anymore, it was about my reaction. And so, this shift in focus and perspective started to deplete my will in editing these kinds of videos. And it's something that many, especially big channels, feel. It is the *chains*. 


I attended Vidcon and met legendary people. Tay Zonday gave me access to an exclusive party and I was able to interact with people there. It's great that you have a lot of free food like crab cakes and exotic pizzas. OH AND THE OPEN BAR TOO; HOLY SHIT. THESE BARTENDERS WILL PUT 3 SHOTS OF COGNAC WITH JUST A SPLASH OF DIET COKE. But I didn't like the fickle attitude of some. “Hey, I like you. You should come to this party. Bring girls. Oh man, sorry, the uber is full.” Although I made a fool of myself at times, there were moments of heroic inspiration that moved many members of the audience. I think my best impression was with Markiplier, and since I relate the most to him, I am glad. Markiplier told me that he is now bound to his internet personality. He lost his individuality in a sense and now has permanent restrictions on his life that many take for granted. He can't go out in public for the fear of being mobbed. If he wanted to say “Fuck it, I just don't want to make a video today,” millions would be outraged. If he does anything, ANYTHING wrong. It will be publicized and broadcasted to the world.


Yea. No thanks. I'm cool with my 4000 subs. If this is where I peak, sweeeeeeeeeeeeg. I'm so happy and grateful to those who have joined me on this journey. Because there are a lot of parts that I'm missing out. A lot of happiness that I've shared with others. A lot of sadness that kids came to me about. A lot of comfort that I gave to them. The one thing about my channel that separates me from most is that I ask the audience to email me about their personal problems in case no one else will listen. Because that feeling of recognition when you're in pain is so reassuring, it should never cease to exist. And so I will continue to fulfill my duty to address the suffering insecurity that plagued me for a decade by being the person I needed back then for others who are dealing with it now. And since I'm small, I can manage. If I had 100's of people coming to me for something like this, I would be too exhausted.


But I haven't told you the best part of this entire experience. It's something that goes beyond my channel. For the first time in my life, I feel like I'm in love with the most gorgeous girl I've ever met in my entire life. All the travels around the world, seeing many different exotic beauties, I now have something that I had so desperately wanted for, but NEVER received. And it was because of the gift that YouTube had given me. It helped me refine and find drive in my voice. Walk like a god, and your goddess will come to you. That is the ultimate truth in romance.


So I ask of you, the reader, why do you YouTube? Do you upload videos so that the mother who misses you can see you every day? Do you continue to embarrass yourself to show others that mistakes are necessary? Have you finally realized that focusing on the number will only drive you insane? Maybe you'll laugh at how silly some people are in trying to become famous. If one thing's for sure, there will always be someone cleverer than you and vice versa. The question is. Will you be a dick about?


I address the darkness of YouTube by producing videos with the concept of light behind it. Yet there are others who fall into the temptations of darkness because they focus on the number and the riches it promises. We all experience it just by watching it. I'm just as affected as you or others. If we allow ourselves to be corrupted by this darkness, our situation will become more dire than it already is. Kids these days have no idea what they want. And so to give them literally everything they want is very dangerous. Yet there are heroes that arise, despite these challenges. And they inspire others to become the best version of themselves. So we must trust our children to make the right decisions, because we can only give them so much guidance. But with irresponsible parenting (KEEMSTAR) becoming a much more prevalent situation, many kids find themselves without a reliable source of truth and wisdom. And to ignore this problem will only lead to one thing. Adults who didn't have a reliable source of truth and wisdom. So do your best with the time that you have now to make a significantly positive impact in peoples' lives. It's not a contest, because as long as you can do it for one other person, you can smile knowing that your light broke through to someone during a time when darkness haunted someone else's eyes.


And one day you might find yourself in the center of all the light because you earned the company of others. It is at this point that wonderful things can happen. I'm pleased to announce that I will be living in a dope house next month while I attend Cornell University for a masters in Design and Environmental Analysis (Human Factors/Ergonomics). What will happen in the future, I do not know, but I am filled with hope and anticipation.


We are all lanterns, moving across this black abyss that is the internet.  And so, it is our responsibility to shine as bright as we can, but it will only happen if we can build enough light inside ourselves. Only through struggles and friction do we continue to radiate. So we must not forget that pain and suffering is necessary to understand compassion an empathy. And this is only done if you hold on to the most important, yet difficult perspective.


Keep it positive."

Now all I have is my flatmate who is incredibly busy with her job, her other friends and her boyfriend to spend much time with me. I can't stand it when it's loud and I can't and won't ever be invited to hang out with her friends- I can't talk to them. I'm left alone most evenings and weekends because she's busy, and I know I can't depend on her for social interactions because she has her own life, but it's difficult.

I've tried so desperately to make friends. I've tried so many university clubs and societies, but I just can't do it. I start talking and then people just look at me strange and I don't know what I've done wrong. You can't make friends if you don't talk but if I do talk its wobbly and rambly and awkward. I don't think I'm being rude, I'm just not doing it right? 

I've tried at work- but work is the worst place in the world. I'm an intern and I can't tell if my team are mad or disappointed when I ask questions so I keep quiet. I work for a huge company and the building is almost full. People walking around seems so loud and I'm constantly on edge and anxious. When I have lunch with other interns I struggle to talk to them, even when we go for drinks I just don't know what to say or do. I feel like the weird, quiet, wobbly odd one out.. 

There are some people who I seen semi regularly in the lab at uni, but it wasn't much more than a Hi and someone to sit with in the lab. I can't seem to make connections with people..

I haven't had a close friend in years and I don't know how to make it better. Something is wrong and I don't know how to explain it properly. There's no one I'm close enough to talk to about how I feel, not even in my family. I wish I knew how to fix it. "

4r439d,2,2016-07-03,I'm depressed and feel stuck and unable to do anything about it. Advice?,VerdantWinter,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/4r439d/im_depressed_and_feel_stuck_and_unable_to_do/,"I'm spending my summer at an internship in California away from friends, family, and loved ones. I've been struggling off-and-on with depression for the past 3-4 years, and was seeing a psychologist for most of the spring while I was at university in Boston, but obviously was not able to continue therapy while I'm away.

I was hoping that this summer would be, if not better, at least no worse than the spring. I was looking forward to the change of place, to not stressing about academic work, and to my internship (which, by all appearances, should be a really good thing). But, despite all of that, I'm feeling worse than I have since my first true depressive episode. I can't motivate myself to work, I have no ambition, I'm lonely, and even the usual things which serve to distract me (like video games, music, reading) don't hold any pleasure (i.e. anhedonia). I've tried making friends or romantic/sexual partners, but social anxiety makes that really difficult.

It seems clear that something needs to change, but I feel like I'm stuck and don't have any good options. At the end of the spring, my psychologist and I talked about the possibility of me talking to a psychiatrist and maybe starting some sort of medication, and if I still feel this way when I return to school in the fall, I suppose that will be something to try. 

It seems like I can't really make any effective moves towards benefiting my mental health now, though: it takes time to develop a relationship with a doctor, and I'm leaving at the end of August. If I were to start medication this summer, I would have to find a new doctor when I return to Boston, and that sounds like a lot of added risk and uncertainty when psychiatric medication is already somewhat hard to prescribe. 

So, here I am. I don't know what to do. Spending the next two months in this state sounds like hell, but it seems like I don't have any better options.

Any advice?"
4r46cb,5,2016-07-03,I [24M] need to know if I should pursue a relationship with an off-limits colleague [21F],darkbluetwilight,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4r46cb/i_24m_need_to_know_if_i_should_pursue_a/,"Hi,

I [24M] am not long out of college and have been working in a company for the last two years. I am not bad looking, reasonably confident and have no real issue talking to girls. Yet, I have never had a girlfriend. 


My excuse for this is not having enough exposure to girls since I did engineering in college, have only worked in engineering-based companies and I don't get out all that much. So relationship options for me have been few and far between. 


However, in January of this year a student intern [21F] started on a 9 month placement. She is very cute, funny and smart. We both love music, movies and we both want to travel. She does little things that I think are just adorable. For example, I sometimes see her alone in the lab with one earphone in her ear doing a little dance as she works, unaware that people can see her. She is so funny. There is a 3 year age difference between us but our maturity levels are very much the same. To my disappointment, I realised on her first day that she may be in a relationship. I know this because she wears a Claddagh ring. A Claddagh ring, for those who don't know, is a ring (that originated in my country) that most girls wear that give you nice detail on their relationship status. It consists of a heart embraced in two hands. If the hands point towards the fingertips then the girl is single. If they point towards the wrist then she is in a relationship. Her's pointed towards her wrist. However, some girls use it falsely to fend off boys they don't like or if they are not quite ready for a relationship.


Assuming she had a boyfriend (and to a lesser extent is also a colleague and a student intern), I put her out of my mind onto my ever-growing ""off-limits"" list. For the first few months of her placement I treated her like any other student intern (i.e. challenged her with tasks, told her to clean things up after herself (in a nice way) and supported her when she had difficulty with things. The usual way one treats a student intern).


Now here is where it gets interesting. In the last two months I have noticed her interacting with me in strange ways. She started finding excuses to regularly come over to talk to me at my desk. When I talk to her, her cheeks go slightly pink. She laughs at all my stupid jokes. She confides in me on different aspects of her internship (I did the same internship as her in the past so we have a lot in common). I am such a dummy that I didn't realise that she may have been warming to me all along. It only really hit me recently at a work team building session in a local resort. She spent the whole day with me. When we were in the forest she wanted me to walk her back to the lodge. We sat together for the dinner part where she kept her leg pressed against mine and often bumped it when she wanted my attention for something. We talked to each other all night at the bar. She stands really close to me. So close that her hair often whips off my arm. This sends a tingle to my very core. I really, really like her. A lot. There are other male student interns and colleagues of mine that she doesn't interact with in the same way she does with me.


I need advice badly. I don't understand how girls work. I am really afraid that I am mistaking romantic affection for just plain feminine friendliness. Does she just like me as a friend? I am really afraid that if I ask her out that she will just say ""No, I have a boyfriend"". It would kill me if she said this and I think it would draw us apart. 


We are planning a work night out soon, which I think would be the perfect time and place to make a move. The clock is ticking as her internship is over in August and there is a chance that I won't see her again after she leaves. What should I do???


   
**tl;dr**: Student intern who I really like and want to ask out but may have a boyfriend and time is limited. What should I do?"

Kinda. I'm a programmer and my job, from this month, is to support two interns in their summer holiday project.

There's a lot of people on this sub that either have an experience with internships as interns, or have an experience with management. Answers from both of you are appreciated a lot!

I've worked for my company for 2 years. Now I've got a job to coordinate a summer holiday project for two interns. They have to write some thingy from 0. They are talented, from good colleges and with good grades.

Anyway, I have many dilemmas and managed to express a bunch of a-bit-chaotic questions.

1) Should I involve in architecture planning, or let them do it?

Or maybe I should try to do it together with them? Wouldn't it feel like a classroom, since I know more about things, and have a clear vision of it already?

2) In general, how ""deep"" my involvement should be?

I heard that other people have big projects and they to them mostly alone. It's not how I imagine our intern project: I thought that I will coordinate it all the way, get continuous feedback etc.

It's a kind of project that's gonna be used pretty early, though. Maybe there's the difference?

3) How to give them negative feedback?

There's gonna be a negative feedback. Code review or ugly documentation. It's because they are interns on their first project, and also just because they are new, so they aren't adjusted to our ways of doing things. 

I mean, it's not always about code being ""bad"", sometimes it's about being ""different""; no need to do the same thing twice and differently both times. Let the logical duplication be a physical duplication. And I want this code base to not be very diverse from our other code bases (maybe it's a bad decision?).

How to do it, so that they won't feel encouraged?

4) Any general advice is welcome!

Those are also my career questions - it's a big opportunity for me to ""exercise"" and develop new skills, because it's my first time coordinating other people's work. I hope you don't mind this kind of question being posted here.

I know I'm asking general questions. If there's anything you can recommend me to read, like books or blogs - I would love it.

Cheers."

4r48l7,1,2016-07-03,My ex [22F] told me [25M] that she wants to see other people,GooseFlaba,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4r48l7/my_ex_22f_told_me_25m_that_she_wants_to_see_other/,"I first noticed her back in college when she was in 2 of my classes that spring semester. We initially started off as homework buddies. We started getting to know each other better, and not long after our first introduction I took her out on a date. We started making out and progressively got towards making it official around June 2014. She's good looking,caring, smart and sweet. She had some domestic qualities that I thought was extremely cute, she was very interested in home makeover shows, she liked cooking and cleaning, etc. You get the point... 


Things were going great, we were both so so happy with each other, until I graduated from school in May 2015. In school, she was a year below so we didn't graduate at the same time. And unfortunately, our homes are kind of far from each other. I live in Queens, New York, she in Long Island. Things were getting tricky as weren't able to see other as often as we would've liked. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with life, so I was unemployed right after graduating until 2 months ago. I hated asking my parents for money to go see her, my family is very poor. She on the other hand was busy with an internship over the summer, and once she started with her senior year at school she was busy with her classes, homework, exams, part time job, volunteering, she was the president of an acapella club, rehearsals, gigs... We only got to see each other 12 times in total from May 2015 to Jan 2016. Things were obviously tough for the both of us, but more so for her as she was in a place where she was constantly reminded of me and because I was figuring things out for so long she started to not feel important. 


So we broke up in Jan 2016, something that I saw coming if I was in the same shithole of a situation once she graduated, but I wasn't quite ready for it to be that early. I was hoping she would be more patient with me. So we broke up, I tried to convince her otherwise but she wasn't having any of it. We still maintained communication after, and I was doing my best to get over her and try the ""lets be friends"" route. She's my best friend, I am her best friend, it's just tough for us to lose each other for good. 

So I saw her again a couple months later (around March?), and things were just so normal. It was like we weren't broken up in the first place. We had our deep conversations, we made out, had sex, and overall just had a great time. I see her again a couple months later (end of April) before I started my new job, she came out to the city. Went to Dumbo, Brooklyn, walked around, chatted, held hands, all that stuff. Again, just another great time. And then I saw her again for the last time, I went out to Long Island. Got us a room in a hotel, and had a blast. I have to add that she got accepted to a job all the way out in Chicago for 3 years. So those 2 days I spent with her was emotional. We both just teared up when we said our goodbyes, as that was her last time in New York (barring holidays our her like Thanksgiving), and now to think about it that's potentially the last time I will ever see her.


She moved to Chicago a couple of weeks ago. Yesterday we were chatting up on FaceTime, and she drops this bomb on me that she's open to seeing other people. And honestly, I'm just so heart broken. I guess I was being stupid, but I honestly thought that we were going in a good direction. I was hoping we might get back together, now I have a job, except now the distance is even greater. I was even going to take a plane to go see her for this 3 days weekend. I wanted to spend my birthday with her (it's tomorrow). 


I am afraid that we will never be with /see each other again, afraid that she will find someone else out there. I can see myself spending the rest of my life with her, we have good chemistry. It hurts me that it has come to this.  I accepted her decision. I told her that I couldn't be friends with her if she's open to seeing someone else. I wish this was all just a nightmare, but unfortunately it's reality. And I'm not coping with all this too well. Doing my best to distract myself from thinking about it.


Any advice would be much appreciated. I don't really have any questions, but if you guys have any questions to know better of our dynamic feel free to ask.



   
**tl;dr**: -Dated for 1.5 years

-Graduated from college, and things started to get rocky. Saw each other 12 times from graduation till break up.

-We still talked with each other, met up a few times.

-She moved to Chicago, and told me that she open to seeing other people out there while I'm still very much in love with her. "

The cluster runs under a load balancer and is a group of LXD containers. My goal is to scale a new node within the cluster with XYZ threshold is met. 

My question is somewhat elementary, but I am wondering what benefit this has? The only thing I can come up with is that more requests can process through the load balancer and the queue is reduced. However, does this reduce CPU load of the main system at all? I'm presume not. 

It brings me to the question of wondering what to even monitor to determine the need to scale up a new node in the cluster. The parent system or each individual container?

TLDR;
What is the benefit of horizontally scaling a node within a cluster and what's a good monitoring approach in doing so. "
4r4p9o,41,2016-07-03,Thank you and farewell! Why I decided to leave computer engineering and a NASA dream for liberal arts.,throwawaycompz,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4r4p9o/thank_you_and_farewell_why_i_decided_to_leave/,"Just wanted to share my experience, and for anyone else having any doubts, don't be afraid to pursue your dreams. Ever since I was a child I was extremely fascinated by space, the universe, consciousness. I was always good at math and loved computers, so I decided computer engineering was for me. I would get a job at NASA and it would be awesome!

For about three years I was a computer engineering major at an ivy. I had a 3.5 GPA and was doing well in my classes. I thought hardware was interesting, the math was tedious, but I as some of my friends were just bearing through it for the money and job prospects. I had several internships and even a job which changed my perspective. I was absolutely miserable and stuck at a computer coding all day, something I did not enjoy. I talked to others in the field. They were all very bright and kind and told me that more than likely I would get a job in software or in manufacturing as those were oversaturated. I may land a hardware gig, but NASA was out of the question. When asked if they liked their careers, they all said yes, it was very laid-back, they made good money.

I think that's when the reality really hit me. Here I was at a computer desk and where I would be stuck for the rest of my life completing projects for a company, basically as a human robot. This isn't meant to offend any one, but for any one that feels the same. I realized for the past three years I had been sitting in class just memorizing and regurgitating information and formulas and building robots with NASA in mind. Even if I had prospects of a career in NASA, what had I been *learning* for myself? I wasn't learning about the universe, I wasn't learning about existence, space, consciousness...these burning questions I've had since I was little. Unless I acted fast I was going to be stuck at a job I didn't find any fulfillment or passion in. I enrolled into the liberal arts college in my school and out of the engineering school. I am studying philosophy and cognitive science and I am happy. I aim to go into academia and never stop learning!

This thread has been extraordinarily helpful to me over the years. Thank you for the homework help, the support, the dank memes (jk). It's been a wild ride and I want to tell anyone else - do what you find interesting and makes you happy :). Find your passions, and if thats in engineering or not, I wish you all the best of luck! Farewell!"
4r4t6i,0,2016-07-03,My [20M] mother [50sF] is harassing me to get a summer job that I don't need or want,TVKMarkII,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4r4t6i/my_20m_mother_50sf_is_harassing_me_to_get_a/,"I totally understand that I may well sound like a spoiled brat but please, hear me out.

I'm currently at university, just finished my freshman year, where I went a bit crazy and spent a lot of money. Not extreme, but I have gone into my student (0% interest) overdraft.

My bank statements got sent to my mum's house until I realised and cancelled them, and now I just get them online. But it's too late, she ""accidentally"" opened one of my statements at some point and saw I had gone into my overdraft, and ever since then she's been telling me to be more responsible with my money, and insisting I get a summer job to pay it off.

What I don't want to tell her is I've money saved up to pay for it all. It's money I earned over the last couple of years, from a job I love but can no longer do (skiing instructor), as well as birthday money, general savings and inheritance. Paying it off will barely make a dent into the savings and I'd pre-planned going into my overdraft in freshman year because I know over the next couple of years as I start properly focussing on work, move into cheaper accommodation, and going out less I will be running a small surplus. However, telling this to my mum, she will just assume it's *all* my inheritance from her father, which would upset her. Or she'll tell me I need to get a job anyway and not rely on my savings. 

**Edit:** Some of my savings were always meant to pay for some of my university, but I unexpectedly got extra funding and so my parents encouraged me instead to invest the amount that I was going to use for university. I didn't think twice about it but I realise now that they severely underestimated living costs where I am at university (as well as general cost of membership for the things I am part of) and if I could go back I wouldn't have invested that particularly part of my savings and I wouldn't have this issue now.

Since I got home for the summer, almost every day without fail she's harassed me about getting a job - either she's sent me incredibly passive aggressive emails with links to various jobs (most of which I cannot do, either due to a health condition I have which prevents me from doing physically laborious jobs such as waitering and manual labour, or I'm not qualified for, such as accounting jobs asking for experience with specific accounting software (which I do not have) or caring work or otherwise). Or she's outright come into my room or the kitchen and had a go at me for not finding a job yet. Telling me to just walk in to agencies and shops and ""beg for a job if you have to"". She seems to be convinced that, in her words, I'm ""desperate for money"" and need a job ASAP. 

Recently she's started threatening to force me to pay rent. This has never been on the table before - she's always promised that I could live rent free as long as I was in full-time education, regardless of whether or not I had a job. 

I almost threatened to go and live with my father (40sM), who walked out on her last year for another woman, but managed to stop myself because that would only escalate things. 

Now, just to clarify, I don't have an aversion to working. Frankly if I found a job I thought I would enjoy, I would apply for it. Because who doesn't want to get paid for doing something they enjoy? My old workplace that I was hoping I'd be able to go back to has closed, hence why I can no longer do that. 

I also have a (very well) paid internship lined up for summer 2017 which will more than cover any unseen expenses next year, as well as pay for a holiday I'm planning. That is the kind of thing I would happily do if available.

But the jobs available (temping, cleaning, bar work, etc.) don't interest me and aren't worth (to me) the time I could be spending with friends, outside, or getting ahead on work for next year.

Despite this, I have in an attempt to satisfy her, applied to over 30 jobs. Some I got rejected immediately due to lack of experience/qualification/not suitable for the role. Others I'm awaiting a response. But this still isn't good enough for her. 

As I've already said, I don't need the money, and I don't want the jobs. But my mother doesn't understand that.

I just don't know how to put it to her. She's one of the most irrational people I've met. Once she's set on an idea she *will not* be dissuaded from it, and she's pretty dead set on me getting a job. 

I've never been super-close to my mum, but it feels at the moment that this job issue is really putting a strain on our relationship. I don't want to be in a house where I know I'll be yelled at for making a different choice to what she wants me to make. I just want to find a way to tell diplomatically that I don't need the job, and to leave me to work things out financially for myself. 
   
**tl;dr**: How do I tell my mum that I don't need the summer-job she's so insistent on me getting because I have the funds to cover the overdraft she knows about due to infringing on my privacy?"

It's outside the US but I'm a US citizen. I'm toying with the idea of doing a Masters in Computer Engineering.

My GPA is a 2.68. I don't have much to redeem it. My major GPA isn't much better. My GPA during last 2 years is pretty much the same. My grades in some of the relevant courses to my chosen specialization (computer architecture) C's. I could probably get good rec letters though.

A professor has given me the opportunity to do research related to computer architecture for him. I don't know how much guidance I will get. I'll have to give up an internship that will begin soon to do the research. That internship would help land a full time job for after I graduate in December. Research less so.

Would doing research now even help to get into a less selective grad school? I probably shouldn't bother with it if the answer is no or if I have to also work for a few years first.

The only things I have going for me are competitive programming experience, some personal software/hardware projects and an internship - Things that would help with getting a job but probably not for grad school."

I've been taking online courses for Python and other coding languages(trying to see what I can apply my skills for). The biggest thing that I'm proud of this internship that I've applied for and I'm in the final runnings for.

Because of this change I've been sleeping well, getting up early, and I never feel like I'm wasting time. I've been going out more and I feel alive. Other than dealing with a breakup, I don't think I can come down from this.

This post is kind of braggy and I'm sorry but I want to give you guys thanks. Thanks for listening to my problems when I thought that no one else was there to listen. If you feel like you're in a rut just face those problems head on. It's scary to really change your life because it's all you've ever known, but if you feel like you're going no where you have to make changes."

As of right now I am enrolled in an online MPH, learning how to code from FreeCodeCamp, and studying for CompTIA A+.  I really dislike clinical medicine, and realized I chose the wrong path in life.  The 80 hour work week (actually 100 hours, but 80 is recorded for legal reason), 36 hour work shifts, and the constant stress of worrying about patients took a toll on me.

I rather be involved with the computer science field.  I don't care if it's IT or programming.  I just want to be able to find a career in this field before July of next year (before medical internships start).  I built my first computer early, trouble shoot computers, played around with HTPC, VMare, and read CPU/GPU benchmarks on my spare time. 

I am looking at CompTIA A+ practie questions, and I am scoring around 70% without studying on the 220-901.  I feel like I can pass the test with a month of studying.  I am putting my FreeCodeCamp course on hold until I take and pass the test.

I really just want to change my CV as best as I can.  Any advice or directions?  Willing to work minimum wage in order to get first job at a help desk.

So far some recommend I skip CompTIA A+.  I am thinking of withdrawing from my MPH to enroll in a Masters of Health Informatics also."

I dropped out of college my first semester because I honestly was not ready for it. However I do not regret my time there.

I am currently working as an intent at a medical device firm and I am being trained on software validation testing while planning to attend community college. All my life everyone has always tried to tell me to find a job I love doing and it has made it a stressful two years trying to figure that out. However the other day I had a huge epiphany that I don't really care what career I work, I just care about the money. Even when money didnt matter to me as a kid all I wanted was more of it, it didn't matter how I got there. All I care about is a manager/boss that is cool/laid back but will still be on you and coworkers that I like. So far every job I have worked has had this environment and it is amazing. I know any job I choose to work I will advance rather swiftly I am just having a hard time figuring out which job I should go to school for. I would prefer to be in a white collar industry and something on the computer. Should I continue something with the software validation testing? The last intern they trained went on to work at SAS for 150k a year but I do not know what they were going to school for as well. I would prefer not to go to school but I know too many adults that only got so far without that piece of paper saying they graduated. Any suggestions would be amazing!

My last job I was the youngest person by 10 years and my manager sat me down 4 months in and told me by the end of this summer he was planning on promoting me ahead of all of them I just needed more experience in the field. 

Edit: Also looking for tips to better myself and get ahead. When I was in school I never went because the teachers I had always taught me how to pass their tests and didn't really teach me anything and it was a waste of time. I have a hard time finding things to be intellectually stimulating. I know I'm smart I just don't know what to do with my intelligence. I've always been athletic and I picked the one sport you really cant go professional in. Since I was always athletic and doing sports, I was naturally good at anything I started doing, but since I'm in the real world now and not doing sports, there is always a learning curve and I have a hard time starting anything because I am not immediately good at it.

**Side side note I'm a number and stat fanatic and can talk peoples ears off with numbers."

I will be graduating a semester early and will be out of school by Fall 2018.

I've started looking at some graduate school programs and have read that the Spring application season is generally much more competitive due to the limited amount of spots available. However, I have been considering applying to some schools in the spring anyway in order to secure an acceptance early and not have to worry about applying to jobs as a fallback of not getting into any graduate schools in the fall. 

The worst case scenario for me would be to get only rejection letters in April and have wasted the spring semester, when instead I could have started working fulltime. If I received at least one acceptance in the fall, I could either take the offer and start in the spring or I could take two internships in the spring and summer comfortably knowing that I will have an offer afterwards.

With that in mind, I have 2 specific questions:

1) How much of a disadvantage will I be if I apply in the spring?

2) Would I be at a disadvantage if I got rejected for the spring semester and reapplied immediately for the fall?"

4r68d0,1,2016-07-04,Tailspin,Surefest,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4r68d0/tailspin/,"Hey! Im a 22yo male who lives in a college town. I used to be a shut in high school and was like that all the way until I moved out at 20. I was always the ""good"" kid in high school. Never drank, didn't smoke or anything like that. When I moved out and went off to a 4 year university after living at home and going to community college for my first two years of school, everything changed.
I decided to move in with a kid i knew from highschool that was living in the same town as me. He seemed pretty cool in high school and the couple times we hung out afterwards so I thought it would be nice to have one friend going in. Little did I know he was a serious alcoholic, which is fine I guess. It's college and I needed to live a little. So after my summer internship ended about a week after I moved in my friend and neighbors decided they were going to get me drunk. Little did I know their sole intention was to get me so trashed that I wouldn't want to drink anymore and would always dd. It definitely didn't stop me but it slowed my progression of drinking. After a couple of months my sisters introduced me to weed. Which was a godsend for me or so I thought.    It let me escape reality without the negative consequences of alcohol. I eventually met two of my best friends now through it as they supplied me for a little bit. After a while my friendship with my roommate started to get rocky when I realized exactly how bad his alcoholism was and apathetic he is. So I stopped hanging out with him and started to hangout with some of the other friends that lived at our complex. I eventually started to get closer and closer to this girl we were friends with. She was in a rocky on and off relationship with a guy and I was a loner so we just clicked. We spent a good couple months hanging out and talking. Although we never started dating or anything like that. We were like the best of friends. And I always used to get shit from our other friends because it was so blatant that I loved this girl. I was desperate to find a new place to live because my roommate was driving me insane and was trying to steal shit and lie about utility's to get money out of me. Well my friend had gotten back with her boyfriend and he lived at our apartment too which is what I needed since I already signed a lease so I got my lease transferred and ended living with him. It wasn't bad or anything we lived together peacefully which was kind of a surprise because he knew I liked his girlfriend and she had some sort of feelings for me. The eventually broke up again and I ended up taking his side sort of. Just to make it easier on me considering I lived with him. So I spent a couple months avoiding the one true friendship I had. They would get back together every once in a while for short spirts until they had a huge blow up. She ended up texting me some shit asking why I wouldn't tell her that he had been cheating and shit like that.(side note, I honestly don't think he was but I told them that no matter what happened I wouldn't intervene in the relationship for the sake of my friendships. And everything continued for a while. I forgot to mention at the start of my new lease I stopped going to school and ended up working full time at a bar to pay my bills and other shit. Then the day I probably will never forget happened. We were playing video games in the morning since my roommate hadn't been feeling so hot, then we decided we would go grab a bite to eat. We were walking out of our place when we saw a couple people playing ball at the court. So we laced up and decided we were going to show them up. And after what seemed like the shortest 10 minutes of my life it happened. He was chasing a loose ball and he collapsed. We all laughed at him at first until he didn't get up. I ran towards him and he looked liked he was having a seizure. We called 911 and did our best to keep him still and not hurting himself. The paramedics came and ambulances him off. I had already called my friend even though they weren't talking at the time I didn't think anything was that major I just wanted to see if he had a history. Then I called his mom/dad to let them know. I then drove to the hospital. When I got there I asked what room he was in and some lady came out and put me in a smaller room and told me she was the hospital chaplain and that they had called a code blue on him which meant he wasn't breathing. I freaked and text our close friend a and told them all to get to the hospital. His grandparents arrived not long after me since his parents live like 5 hours away. I had to sit there as his grandma yelled at the hospital staff to figure out was was wrong. Not long after another one of friends showed up and we decided to go sit in the waiting room. And that's when she showed up. I sent her in and we sat out there and a couple more friends showed up. Then the Chaplain came out and told us he had passed. I was so in shock and the rest of the night is kind of a blur. I couldn't even shed a tear until the next day when I had to call my parents. Then I lost it. The next couple of months would be different. A couple of us had settled into the new normal. I had started drinking more which I just shrugged off as college behavior. And I would reconnect with her and we would have on and off waves of talking and not talking. We're both quite people so it isn't uncommon for in to not talk a lot. She started seeing other guys again although nothing serious. At this point I've started binge drinking most nights i don't have to work so like 2-4 nights a week compared to where I used to be at at like 2 nights a month. And I'm still smoking like a quarter a week. All of this leading up to the events of this weekend. It started off with Friday night. We're talking again and I managed to get off work early and make it back for volleyball which we usually have a group of friends playing most nights of the week. She wanted to play but wouldn't only go out if I did. So we both met up at the court and played for a little bit. After a couple of minutes my knee gave out and I couldn't play anymore. So I sat out and just hangout until everyone was done. Then went home and went to sleep. Saturday morning my dad came over and game me my crutches and some hydros/oxys to help with the pain. I took some hydros and she another friend and I went to lunch. After lunch we were all off for the day so we picked up a bottle and started drinking. She went to the gym real quick so missed most of the day drinking. I was on the hydros from before and we started smoking and drinking. This is when I was hardly breathing and my friend almost had to take me to the er. I ended up being fine and we kept drinking. We all get together for a little pregame before going out and everybody gathers up at a friends place. We're playing some games So everybody was pretty drunk when we left. We end up hitting up the bars. I was text a couple friends including her most of the night. At one point I'm borderline blacked out and get a text thinking it was her for some reason. It ended being my mom who was already pissed at me for not taking it easy but she told me not to drink and especially on the pain meds. Well I ended up accidentally ratting my self out to her which pissed her off. Our group split and ended up going to two different bars. My best friend ended up at the other bar blacked out and walked home. Which kind of ticked me off since we never get to go out together and the one time we can she ends up bailing. We fall back to another bar where the only thing I remember doing was sitting I a booth texting her. I said some really fucking stupid shit which I told wish I could take back. Basically did the whole drunken confessional except in a much more rude and attacking way not in the I'm drunk I love you way. We end up back at a friend of a friends place where everyone is doing coke. I've always kind of wanted to try it but was on the fence. I was so trashed at this point I wouldn't be surprised if I did meth/heroin if they had had it. So long story short in two days I managed to trash my self image, almost killed myself, severely dented the one true friend ship I have and my parents hardly trust me and think I'm a fuck up."

First of all, sorry for a throwaway, but my main reddit account being quite active and easily tied to my real life identity makes it not comfortable to ask career questions.

I'm coming to /r/ITCareerQuestions to ask for advice on getting into the fields of application/web applications security. I did read that one [Meta] thread about security everyone posts around here so no need to link me to it. The thread was helpful but I still have questions.

I'm not coming into IT with no experience, I've been working in the field for about 12 years and have accumulated what looks like a considerable amount of experience in various fields. I would like to try to assess what I do know:

* Formal education: B.Sc. in Computer Science;
* Real world experience in software development: have built several productivity applications in J2ME. Those were widely used, had to abandon them with the apparent death of J2ME; Went on to build mobile apps in C/C++. Unfortunately, Windows Mobile did not catch on as well so had to abandon these as well. More recently've built several apps in C++/QML for Blackberry 10 OS, now that the OS is dead as well, those are, once again, abandoned. I was not very smart in picking platforms!
* Real world experience with a small ISP: operating network equipment and building the physical network, we were providing the last mile both over Ethernet and 802.11 connections, operated our own AS and a set of Juniper equipment so that provided me with knowledge of networking. I would say I have good experience in the field.

* Experience operating a, once again, small web hosting providing service. What I've had built was a small LAMP hosting setup with a off-the-shelf hosting panel. I've also built a custom billing and order proccessing system in PHP which has automated our payment processing, hosting package creation and domain registration activities. Having a need to build such a system made me learn almost everything there is about the underlying technologies: web protocols, domain name system and so on. I would assess my knowledge in this domain (web technologies) as very good.

* Experience running a small web software shop: teamed up with a couple of friends and've built a couple dozens web projects, mostly in e-commerce using a usual combo of php, postgresql and the like. Since it was a very small enterprise I was responsible for both the backend and frontend development, so I have very good experience in these areas, frontend being html/css/js.

So, it is understandable that while working in the field I was hacked again and again, people around the world were bruteforcing my ssh, tried to use my customers' outdated Wordpress setups to root my servers and, after failing that, installed scripts to send out spam putting my addresses on blacklists. It both infuriated and fascinated me so I've started to learn. I've read books like Applied Cryptography and Secrets and Lies, sources like OWASP, subscribed to 2600 and Hacker News. I've realized that this is indeed my thing. So, about three years ago I've started doing whitehat bug bounties. I've discovered that I know enough applicable knowledge to do such work. Since then I've participated in a numerous bounties with apparent good results, discovering vulnerabilities ranging from boring CSRFs to more interesting remote code executions on well-known companies' web properties. It is both fun and well-paying, some of my write-ups got reposted on /r/netsec, Hacker News, whatnot and sparkled discussions. So I've decided to 'go pro' and do this full-time with a retirement package and health insurance. 

I'm writing all that to explain that I think that I understand the basics of how the things work so I know what to do to make them work more secure.

That's my background. Now, what can I expect with that? Unfortunately I don't have certs. I know I can pass CEH and feel like I can pass OCSP (I know it going to ruin my life for several months and destroy my self-confidence though), I have confirmed experience - hall of fames, published write ups, letters from companies confirming my whitehat work. 

I also feel that my experience is fragmented. Since I've picked up everything on the road here and there I'm afraid I may be suffering from Dunning–Kruger effect feeling that I know more that I know in reality. 

That brings me to an idea of applying for a junior-like position in Security. I have enough money saved to suffer a year of low salary if it helps me to get a hold in the area and improve my level of experience. 

So, where should I go from here? What should I look for and apply? What are the lowest-level positions which can bring me to full-time pentesting, application security jobs? Are there any internships in the area? How should I build my CV -- I don't have any experience of employment in the area, should I just link to my existing work?

Thanks!"

Hopefully this subreddit is as nice as the LSD one! Happy Fourth of July!!! (for fellow Americanos)

So here is my current life situation. I am 20 years old and basically haven't done anything the past 2 years since leaving college where I was not mentally ready. I got accepted to a private religious school (somehow my ACT got me in because it was high even though I had an extremely low gpa because my teachers very few teachers I had were actually mentally stimulating and did not enjoy that I did not let them talk to me like I was a teenager and instead tried to make them treat me as an adult (hence why I am friends now with my old coach and I can't make friends my own age, only adults.) 

I honestly really do not want to go back to college because I would prefer to be trained by a company as I feel that is the best way for me to learn and excel vs. being taught one thing in school and then being told at my job that that is completely wrong (this has happened to me before). However I do know that not having the wonderful piece of paper that is a diploma will keep me from advancing in a career like I know I will be able to (this has happened to my uncle who is so extremely successful and intelligent that he is one of the few people I idolize in those aspects ( I would love for him to mentor me but he lives several states away), he just chose the military vs. school a long time ago). 

In my family I have grown up always chasing money. Even when it did not matter to me, it is something I have always wanted. Just the aspect of it makes me happy. I even want to collect different types of silver bullion's just for fun. I have a fine taste in things that I just simply can not afford in life right now (ie. fine wines (thank you alcoholic genetics) cars, clothing, houses. To get to the main point...

I know at some point in my life I will own my own business because that is what I have grown up around. Both of my parents have owned their own business for most of my life and I have a pretty solid knowledge on what it takes and how to run it successfuly. This is one of the reasons why all of my former employers welcome me back with open arms and I am always considered for promotions extremely early, even when I don't fully know what I am doing. My work ethic also helps here because I am perfectly willing to work 18 hour work days 7 days a week as long as I know what I'm doing on said task and it is not stumping me due to lack of clear instructions ( I am not confident in the work I do if I do not have clear instructions or I am just learning what I am doing but I can pick things up extremely fast if it is thoroughly explained like I do not know the topic. Many employers talk to you like you already know the topic and this is extremely frustrating to handle because when I ask for them to dumb it down, every task after that they talk to me like I am retarded and they over ""dumb it down"" so to speak which makes me angry (my adderall for my ""off the charts ADD and ADHD makes me angry or ticked off easily with other people) and frustrated that I am being treated as a lesser person because I asked for help once.

I am currently an intern for a medical device firm that has me as a ""contractor"" and it pays me $12.00 an hour. They are currently training me to do software validation for something they are developing. I got this job because my mom and I are extremely close. We went through a lot together and had a rough come up to where we are in life now (she had me at 19 and had an abusive situation). We are finally a middle class family working our way up due to the fact that her business she owned was in the red and she dipped into family funds. (To put into perspective for my younger brothers (3 and 12), shes looking into land to build a house that is 400k) and my brothers have all the things they need to be successful in life and I am stuck playing catch up because I was a really bad child growing up due to my compulsion disorder. I honestly should be in jail right now. I didn't get diagnosed with my ADHD until I was almost 18 when a pretty bad incident happened in the family with me and I ran away from home to my psychiatrist and slept on his office doorstep (didn't even own a car) and forced my family to listen to me that I have no control over my actions. There is a little bit of backstory for you to understand me a little better. Back on the topic of the job, me and my mom are super close and she has helped me find opportunities before, which I really do appreciate considering this time last year in my life I was working 5 jobs at once during the week with no time off, but I have a hard time getting a job ""because of her"" even though she says that I didn't get the job because of her but because of myself. ( I have developed a lot of insecurities over the years that I have walled up and shoved in the back of my mind that I am working through but don't know how). I feel like I get the job because of her because she doesn't think I can make it on my own or that I'm actually not as smart as I think I am. With this job, I know I have it as a solid full time job for the next three months but I do not know the extent of it after that. There is a rumor that since I will know the software so well, that I will be the best candidate to travel around and sell it (which it will be very successful due to the potential I have noticed from it), but this is a rumor and I can not rely on my future/budgeting to move out (my step dad who I consider my real dad is lying to my mom because a shirt smelled like weed and he figures i'm too busy smoking weed to help out at home (I hadn't even smoked that day I was coming home from by third 15 hour work day in a row and only had 1 hour of sleep in the past two days. I rarely smoke to get smacked high, it helps me sleep with my insomnia and lets me relax due to how tense I get working all day/the work nightmares I have when I sleep). And now I am currently trying to save every dime I can get to move out because tensions are getting high due to the messages I saw between him and my mom + the fact that they don't enjoy the fact that I don't leave my room even though there is literally nothing to do outside of my room in this house besides constantly cleaning. I can work from my home and I sleep all the time (I really think I either have low testosterone or I am hitting pubertly late like my biological father as I want nothing more than to sleep and eat all day...or i'm extremely depressed still from failing to reach my one goal in highschool to win a state title (I took second to arguably the best guy in the state who dropped to my weight a week before regionals) which I hate that I might still be hung up on that right now and cant let go because I dont want to be ""that guy"" who cant move past highschool. So now I have decided to move out because I am struggling to get my life together living at home and I know moving out will force me to get my shit together and stop wasting time. I even recently gave up video games and I am about to give up drugs (except LSD so I can look at myself from another persons view) because all I think about is how I am not enjoying these activities anymore because I feel like I am wasting time that could be spent bettering myself. I actually hate every minute i'm not finding a way to better myself and put myself in a good position for life but I do not even know where to begin... 

Now my other job I work at a baseball stadium. Yes...I sell lemonade and snowcones professionally. The pay is actually amazing though considering I rarely make less than $15 dollars an hour and can reach upwards of $40 an hour. However this job is extremely inconsistent and keeps me from having an established schedule... But I love my bosses their who treat me as an adult and we throw business ideas back and forth at each other. They have even mentioned to me partnering with them down the road.

I don't know what to do since both of these jobs could potentially leave me jobless (or the internship so to speak) could give me reduced hours where I could no longer budget or live on my own.

I am extremely stressed out. I owe my parents 4k for my car/taxes, and I owe my private school 10k where I have to pay 330 a month. All I want in life is a job I can climb the ladder in while making good money. I am willing to learn anything hands on if I can avoid school, or be mentored like I currently am, I just want security and and a place that will help me grow to my full potential.  I'm extremely indecisive in my career and life commitment right now not because I cant find a job that will make me happy, but because I can't decide on what career will be the most profitable for me. I only care that I at least like my coworkers and whoever is in the position above me is actually intelligent/gives respect to get respect.

I know I have high expectations of other people and who they are, and I have the same for myself, I've just been procrastinating because honestly, I'm scared. I'm scared of being in debt. I'm scared of living up to what my whole family (extended) thinks I will be, and I want to be the most successful I can as a ""Fuck You"" to everyone who doubted me or talked me down in life. Someone Please help me.

They do not want me there and say ""we do nothing here , there is nothing for us to teach you, relax and we'll send you your internship certificate""

So, as things stands now, I have no experience, my resume looks nothing like that of an mba student, and companies would start visiting my campus from september.

How can I get some experience?? I've tried various freelance/remote work sites and even they ask for experience( which is a bit understandable) for work as simple as data entry.

Any advice would be appreciable. Thanks

* Did Computer science engineering before mba
* Had a decent internship experience in undergrad as an android dev
* Entered mba after completing engineering and taking an year off to prepare for exam/learn japanese"

The first 5 years when we were together, we were only college students/fresh graduate. He worked he a job he loves.

He expressly said he wants to get marry once we finally settle down with the hassle (my internship and postgraduate studies) and from time to time talk about positive aspects of having children

At the 5th and 6th year he changed his job, working for his family, he was extremely stressed with the job and everything went downhill after I start my internship. One evening he just said he doesn't want a marriage and kids anymore, I was so distress he take them back. From time to time he bring them up. While sometimes he seems feeling positive with marriage again, but he says he is quite firm that he doesn't want to have kids

When I asked the reasons he just say because this is a very sad world to grow up with, sometimes he say some other reasons like, what if the kid grow up to be a disappointment 
If I want more detail he said ""I will let u know when I have more ideas"", he is so reluctant to talk about it!

I don't know if I should press for an answer, is he stressed and tends to have anxieties easily? 

As to me.. I love this man so much I thought I can compromise with anything, but over the course of this few months I realize whenever I want something from him I convince him so much he surrender. I wanted to keep it from myself but whenever he inadvertently says things like ""if one day we have kid.."" Even he just say it casually (I think he only says it in hypothetical/for a joke) I would easily think he changes his mind and go on and convince him again! It seems I always fake compromising.

Should I stay and enjoy this relationship while it last or just end it to stop torturing us? We have conflicts a lot because he doesn't really share his feelings like he used to anymore.

He is so great with kids, many occasion little girls say ""I want to marry uncle J (my BF)"", very caring 

Is it only because he is young (26M) and not ready yet? I don know "

As far as I'm concerned it doesn't work full stop, I can't ever get it to load.  The line from the head IT guy is that it doesn't work with the office wifi because they did something with the domain controller, using the website address for a setting in some way, which makes the site inaccessible.  Outside the office it should be fine.  There must be an element of truth to this because this particular website is made with Wordpress and you can't log into the wordpress account on the office wifi, but you can elsewhere.  My main question is what have they done with the domain controller, how stupid was it, can it be fixed, etc. etc.?

Whenever I try to load the website from outside the office, I get met with a welcome page from IIS7.  I went on the aws account for the company's websites, and in the route53 section, the particular website in question is neither listed under hosted zones nor under registered domains.  I mentioned to the guy that maybe this had something to do with why the website wasn't working and he brushed me off with some talk about his domain controller mistake.  For what it's worth, downforeveryoneorjustme says that the site is up.  So my second question is, do you think the website not working has something to do with it not being listed under hosted zones?

4r78z5,0,2016-07-04,"Me [23M] with my Ex-GF [21 F] dated 1.5 years, broken up ~1 month, I want to be friends but emotions and dynamics are weird",whoknowsnotmeha,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4r78z5/me_23m_with_my_exgf_21_f_dated_15_years_broken_up/,"I don’t really know who in my life to go to about this issue, so I’m hoping that y’all will help me gain some perspective. Sorry about the length. 

About a month and a half ago, I broke up with my girlfriend. We both cared a lot about each other, but I realized certain issues just were not going to go away. I will get to those in a moment, but I will fully admit the way that I broke up with her was totally selfish. When I finally got the nerve to do it, we were both very, very far from home and on opposite sides of the world. She’d just started staying with extended family to nanny for the summer, and I had just gotten to Europe for internships. Also, she was in the middle of a nannying job at the time, which she could not leave. I have regretted that particular bit a lot, but I did not know if I would have the nerve later to do it. There has been other, later jackassery on my part, like focusing too much on things that she did wrong in the relationship which was affecting her more than I realized.

In any case, I have tried to be there for her to deal with this break up and so that she will have someone to talk to. I know she’s been very lonely there, and though she has other friends whom she can call and talk to, I know that there are some things that she wants to talk to me in particular about. I also know that I make her feel secure and talking to me makes her feel better. I recently apologized for treating her badly over the course of this whole thing, because I do want to stay friends with her. 

As for the reasons that I broke up with her, there were a few. First, the final thing that led me to break it off was that we went to the wedding of one of her ex-bfs (which, doing the math at the wedding, he was pursuing his now wife while they were dating, but whatever). They’re not much older than we are, and the whole ordeal made her very affectionate with me and she started to talk about marriage very seriously, which we’d done in the past but I’d made it clear that I won’t be ready for years. All I could think of was “I don’t want to marry this girl and have things be like this forever.” This came to a head when my high school best friend got engaged and my other best friend told me she was thinking it would happen soon. 

In terms of lesser issues, though, we’d both gained a lot of weight and could not seem to stick to any diet or exercise when we were around each other. This affected both of our confidence and health levels significantly and really started to wear on us. She is an extremely messy person and at least once I would come to my place (where she practically lived rent free) to find it totally trashed, with the kitchen having plates everywhere and food “accidentally” left out of the refrigerator. Finally, for to most part, I felt like she would not take my time and effort into consideration, whether it was asking for rides, favors, whatever, I felt like if she asked me to do something, I would almost always do it, but if I asked her to do something then she would often not do it or if she did then she would act like she was doing me some grand favor. To me, though, all of these are side issues and I think that I could have tolerated or even worked with her on most of them. 

The main issues which made me feel trapped, though, involved communication, respect, family and, unfortunately, sex. The communication bit is one of my failings. I hate confrontation, and when there were issues, I would often downplay them until things kind of exploded. After having worked on this though, I realized that this was only part of the problem. The other half of it is that she would not take my concerns seriously unless I did actually freak out about it. Even if she acknowledged the problem, which was only sometimes, she would try to be accommodating but that would only last until she got stressed out about something and things were back the way they were. The family thing is something that has worn on me because there is not much I can do about it. My family dynamics are super weird and it freaks a lot of people out that as a result I am not as close to my family as most others are. Not only that, but one set of my parents really did not like her and made it very clear to me from the beginning. When they scheduled a trip to come see me and came into my place, it was messy, like always. Of course, much of the mess was her stuff, which really clenched their dislike even more. 

The sex part is pretty complicated. When we first started seeing each other, we would fool around all the time. Hell, we missed class sometimes because we couldn’t keep ourselves off each other. Within a few months, though, that almost completely stopped and it’s been rare ever since. Somewhere in that time she got on birth control, which she blamed for her decreased sex drive, but this had been a trend for some time. We probably had sex twice every about six weeks, on average. This is not close to satisfying for me, and I don’t really believe it was for her either but I felt that there was nothing I could do. She would always say how small my dick was compared to the other guys she has been with and that despite my making improvements, that I was bad at sex. I’m sure that most of her saying that comes from her just liking to be totally honest with me, but it still hurts. Still, it was becoming clear to be that we’re just not very sexually compatible and that we’re just too young to be in a mostly sexless relationship forever, even though she seemed to think that the trade-off for other things was worth it. 

REAL ISSUE HERE!

So, most of why I am writing is because things between me and her are just in kind of a… weird place. We still care about each other and have even expressed that to each other, but we both seem to realize that it just probably won’t work out. One of the reasons is that now not only does my family dislike her, just more strongly, but now her family thinks I’m an asshole for breaking it off with her while overseas (okay, fair). Also, probably too many things have been said at this point. 

Here’s the thing though. She had a Tinder date recently, which, okay fine, whatever. She can go out with whomever she wants. That didn’t bother me. In fact, I wasn’t bothered until she called me the next day and told me that she went on the date and that they had sex. Then she went into detail about the date and then about the sex, which they had multiple times. I was surprisingly hurt when she told me all that. I know it’s irrational to be upset about this; she’s single after all. But something about her having sex really bothers me, especially like she described. In my mind, it makes me think that all of the sex issues were my fault after all. It makes me feel pretty worthless. I know that she is going on a trip soon and has mentioned that she wants to find at least another guy to hook up with on it. I have my own escapades in the works, so it’s not as if I’m becoming a monk, but it does make me feel like that if I couldn’t even impress the girl whom I loved for that long, then how can I hope to do that for anyone else? This is especially confusing to me because she has told me before that I was the first guy to make her really orgasm, at least occasionally. I don’t know if that’s true or not anymore, but it seems like a weird thing to lie about.

There’s also the fact that she calls to talk to me every day. Mostly, the conversations are pretty nice but they are pretty littered with reminders that we’re not dating anymore, mostly coming from her. She’s also done some things which seem pretty purposefully teasing, like being naked on video chat but only showing her face and things like that. 

At this point, I just don’t know what to do. I feel like somewhere, I still care about this girl and I really enjoy talking to her, still. We still have good personality chemistry. I don’t know that I want to lose that. But I don’t know that I want to stay in a ghost of a relationship like we’ve got going on right now. Any advice from an outside perspective?

TL/DR: My ex-gf and I who had a very messy relationship and many relationship issues are trying to be friends, but the conversations are regular, tend to be weird and sometimes passive-aggressive. Also, because of sex issues, I don’t know that I can emotionally handle hearing about her with other guys, though I know that it will/should happen.

Please help me not giving up.,darkest_hour_f,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4r7hfj/my_life_turned_into_a_nightmare_and_i_need_some/,"I'm trying my best to make this as short as possible, but I'm in serious need of advice because I'm close to a nervous breakdown. I'm a 31y old female from Europe who used to live in the US to go to grad school. Everything was fine, had good grades, work experience (part-time jobs, freelancing, interesting internships worldwide) and a huge zest for life. After graduating I moved back to my home country and landed my first full-time job from which I got fired unexpectedly after a couple of months. Wasn't eligible for unemployment benefits (because employed &lt; 1 year) and had to apply for social support. Couldn't find a new job for a few months and then got pretty sick. I couldn't put student loans on hold , so I had to move back in with my mom in order to be able to make the smaller payments. (She's amazing and a huge help, so I'm grateful for that)

I'm currently running from doctor to doctor, waiting times are a joke, so far they could (thank god!) rule out a brain tumor, MS and lyme. I got my blood checked but they only found a severe iron deficiency (which is getting treated) and very high inflammatory markers. I'm just a shadow of my former self with severe neurological failures that nobody can explain. I'm in therapy because I started to get depressed. My therapist says I only have a depressive episode that will go away once I'm back to a normal life.
The social support office is pressuring me and banks started to harass me because they want higher payments that I can't make. I'm waiting for an appointment with a debt adviser but things like that take forever. One particular bank is threatening me with garnishments and ruining my credit. I want to avoid bankruptcy at all costs because it takes so long in my country and ruins a lot of things like the ability to rent an apartment. Obviously, I can't live on my mom's couch forever.

On top of that I got dumped by my long-term boyfriend and found out that he has been lying and emotionally (probably also physically) cheating on me. He was verbally abusive a lot, so I guess I dodged a bullet. I can't deny that it hurts though. He apparently wanted out of the relationship for a long time and thought it's a good idea to act like an a**hole so I would eventually get the hint. Worst part was when they told me I had to go get a brain scan (because they suspected I had MS or a tumor) I asked him to come visit me (we were long distance) and he sad he can't because he's short on money and doesn't get a day off. He then fabricated a huge fight where he didn't talk to me and he later confessed that he took two weeks off from work to fly to freaking ASIA with two people he met on a travel buddy side.

I try my best not to lose hope, but I'm afraid that I will not get out of this situation without it ruining my future. I already have a gap in my résumé now. I feel like a complete loser, I'm scared every day and I hardly eat or sleep.

Any advice, any warm words, ideas.. I would truly appreciate them. Maybe you can share how you got out of a similar situation. Maybe you can tell me what I could or should do next.

Thank you and sorry for any mistakes, not a native speaker.

4r83vu,5,2016-07-04,Where to go? PhD(Computer vision) or a software engineering position (hopefully with Vision related work),kislayabhi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4r83vu/where_to_go_phdcomputer_vision_or_a_software/,"Hi

I am an international Masters student in CS. I did my BS in Electrical but got interested in Computer Vision in sophomore year.
Back then I used to work hard and got myself into GSoC'14 (Summers junior year) and GSoC'15 (Summers after senior year). Due to these, I was able to change my stream from EE to CS for my Masters program in Univ. of Minnesota. The day I came here, I joined our Robotics lab and worked for the Fall semester without any pay, just because I loved computer vision. The professor gave me RA for the spring(he liked my work, I think) and insisted on providing RA for the summers. But I tried interviewing for internship positions related to computer vision + machine learning for the summers. Somehow, I was always underconfident about these interviews . I eventually screwed up and thought maybe I don't want to go to industry. I provided these details to the professor who then told ""For a person, going to industry from school is easy but the opposite is very difficult"". As time was passing by and people were getting various internship positions (I hate the fact that people choose positions which are too monotonous just because it ""pays""), I again agreed to accept the RA for summers thinking, atlest I will be working in Computer Vision.

Now 1.5 months down the summers, presently I feel the urge from the surrounding to decide between a PhD or go for a good job. I think if I spend more time on deciding which way to go, I will end up in a murky situation. I say this since I still have 2 months left for the summers. I am good with the RA work and can spare some time for Data-structure &amp; Algorithmic interview preparation. (Last time, I was so underprepared that it showed on my face.)

The problem is goal setting. If I prepare for my interviews thinking that ""if some opportunity shows up, i should be able to grab it"", my preparation will have loopholes. 
To have a clear goal, I ultimately have to answer this ""PhD or Job?""

I know deciding whether to go for a PhD is a life decision.  I went over to some excellent articles over these present on the web:
1. http://www.cs.unc.edu/~azuma/hitch4.html
2. http://shouldigetaphd.com/
3. http://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/25136762019/advice-to-prospective-grad-students
4. http://neurochambers.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/tough-love-insensitive-guide-to.html

I ended up understanding that, ---&gt; ""PhD is hard work. Only do it if you MEAN it.""
Sometimes, I see my fellow batchmates and envy them for having a clear goal in life. 
From this post, I hope I was able to propagate the fact that I love Research. But I do feel that the hunger for knowledge that I had in my undergraduate days has decreased. 

Currently I am working on both my RA and interview prep with my goal as ""A computer vision job which has research embedded "". This is too vague.

Any comments, suggestions on how should I use my time will be of great help.

Thanks!"
4r84d0,17,2016-07-04,"I think workplaces are the perfect breeding ground for affairs, yet you're paranoid and crazy if you're suspicious of a friendship at work",rant_whatever,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4r84d0/i_think_workplaces_are_the_perfect_breeding/,"So I'm still new to emotional affairs and I still may not understand them 100%. But I've discovered over the course of the last weeks that my SO and one of his coworkers have been getting closer and closer. 

And this is about a general beef that I have with the modern circumstances of relationships between men and women and how people are forced to spend their time away from home and at work. I believe that the modern 40 or more hour week is contributing to a lot of divorces and breakups.

I believe that this constant being together forges an emotional intimacy between coworkers, that wouldn't have been possible a century ago. I mean it's crazy how well you get to know your coworkers after a short amount of time, you may even know more about them than your friends at times. I also believe that you naturally develop sympathy towards someone if you see them enough. 

And it's great if someone feels at home at work, hopefully many people do. Although from my personal experience many don't. Still, I can't shake the feeling that so many affairs start at work, yet when you become suspicious of a coworker of a SO, you're crazy and jealous and everyone is going to play it down. I mean, the circumstances of a positive working environment are a perfect breeding ground for an emotional affair. All you need then is being drunk at a christmas party and there you have your spouse screwing his ""we're only friends"" coworker.

Maybe it's the culture from where I'm coming from, but the scenes I've seen at workplaces are completely insane. At my first summer internship I saw a young woman in her mid-twenties flirting with an older coworker. She would sit on his desk, giggle, touch his arm, shoulders and they would chat there for over an hour. They would go to lunch together. And then she met her new boyfriend, of course also at work. And I always noticed a certain tension between her new SO and this older coworker. In the following year two coworkers married there, split up again. Then the guy who was sitting just next to me was fucking another coworker, even though he was married and had kids. After this went down the drain, he started a relationship with yet another woman from work. Last time I saw him he had a new girlfriend.

At my current workplace a coworker tried to kiss a female worker in the ladies' bathroom. She was ""surprised"". She was married, had kids and had been discussing everything on her mind and her relationship problems with said male coworker. She even admitted to flirting. She couldn't explain it to herself. 

Even though it's only a small company, there are three relationships that formed at my work. My parents also met at work.

I'm sure that many people have made the same observations. I have been cheated on and since then, I've been always alarmed when I heard about ""friendships"" between my boyfriend and women that just didn't feel right in my gut. Yet somehow I have the impression that people always say ""Oh, they're working together. It's nothing. You're overreacting. Of course they're close"". If they were friends outside of work, it would be completely different. The moment you say a friend of the opposite sex is a coworker, it's seen in a different light. Suddenly it's ok to go to lunch together, only two people. Or it's ok that the hot blonde is sitting on the desk of a middle-aged men, laughing for hours at his jokes. Just because it happens in the confined space of something that we call ""office"". Or two people getting drunk together, coming home in the early morning hours. All because they're ""just"" coworkers.

It's ridiculous. It's frustrating. I've been hit on myself at work and I just don't get how people always minimize everything that happens at the office. It's kind of a convenient cover that you can put on all your inappropriate relationships. Just say it's work and everything is forgiven and forgotten. 

So this may just be my personal impression, but society forgives so much more that is happening at work. It takes the edge of many actions that would be frowned upon in other environments, like a bar, a restaurant or the house of a friend. And why? Yes, relationships develop if you're together for eight hours a day. But how exactly does this excuse inappropriate behavior? I don't want my SO flirting, doesn't matter if he's at home, at work or in Africa. I don't care.

That worker that was flirting with the woman? Being at work enables him to do this. His wife will surely never find out and even then, he can just pull the ""she's just a colleague and friend"" card.

I believe very much in feelings and that they can't be controlled. I think a crush can happen at any time and in principle, this isn't immediately something to be concerned about. But at work, the constant being together, interacting and emotional intimacy feed the fantasy and the crush, making it stronger and escalating it further. I mean it's true, you can't just avoid talking to your coworkers, you can't just cut off contact. And then a business trip creates the perfect environment for a physical affair. 

Why is no one addressing this? Not only is no one acknowledging that many cheaters meet their lover at work, it's downplayed  and minimized. The general population is thrown into a situation that creates perfect breeding ground for affairs and then people wonder about the soaring divorce rates. 

It happened to myself. I sat next to an attractive coworker and he shared the same passion with me, something that bored other people to tears and he was the only one that I could talk to. Yet I found that we were soon talking just as long as the married coworker and his ""office spouse"". It happens faster than you realize. 

What I'm trying to say is that I wish people would react in another way. I think a newer perspective is needed. That a working environment can foster relationships that are similar to family bonds and that this can be a danger for certain susceptible people. "

Thanks in advance for all your help. So as the title says I'm looking to major in cs and really like the idea of going to school in New York. I am a rising senior and I have stats that would be a match for NYU and I think make me at least a candidate for getting into Columbia (2260 sat 4.44 gpa at a good school and several leadership positions). When I visited last spring I could see myself enjoying both social scenes though I did see a large difference between the two. I am currently doing an applied math/cs internship at Hopkins over the summer and really enjoying that side of computer science, also my goal is to found a startup after college. I would not be receiving financial aid at either school so they are both equal in that sense. While Columbia is ranked somewhat higher in cs (19 vs 29 usnews) in looking at both programs NYU seemed to have a lot more to offer with their prestigious courant institute, courses in game design and mobile/web develpment (I'm not planning in seriously pursuing these fields but I still think it would be really fun to learn about), and four different startup incubators compared to Columbia's one. My question is, would it be ridiculous to pass up an opportunity to go to Columbia for NYU? Maybe NYU just does a better job selling their programs, but it just seems that everything else being equal NYUs computer science program has more to offer (for me specifically) despite its lower rank. Thanks for reading all this and I hope to hear your opinion!"

4r8rjr,0,2016-07-04,"My [20/F] boyfriend [29/M] is very smart, but is not career ambitious and isn't looking for a job...at all.",materialisticgf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4r8rjr/my_20f_boyfriend_29m_is_very_smart_but_is_not/,"I met my boyfriend (let's call him James) 5 months ago. He was smart, charming, funny, and kind.


I feel like I need to make two disclaimers. First, I am not materialistic, at least I don't think I am. I like having nice things, but I don't think money should be the top priority. I think a successful career is an amazing goal, but not at the loss of family and close friends. Second, he is not ""immature automatically because he dates young"" as I am the youngest girl he's been with. The youngest woman was 3 years younger than him and the oldest was 10 years older than him.


James has not been to college. I knew this going in and it didn't bother me. Many, many people I know have been successful both financially and personally without getting a degree. He also doesn't have a job right now. He got injured while looking for work back in the winter and had to have surgery on his knee a few months back. He was told that he could start working as of July.


Me, I have plans. Since I started working when I was 16 and started with the goal that I would not let my bank account drop below four figures and my savings account is always topped up full (4 months salary for emergencies minimum). I've been paying my own rent and food for years now. My parents are not helping my out with college, at all. In fact they cut me off and completely when I turned 18. Although I consider my finances important, I still have fun. I go out to eat with friends, I buy myself nice things occasionally, I go clubbing, I take little trips, I'm planning for spring break down in the DR this March.


Originally, when James and I met, he said he was going to pick up an apprenticeship at something that would have him making 40K a year once he finished his training and got a steady job. I was fine with this. Although I always saw myself being with someone who had a ""powerful and prominent career"" blah, blah, blah I really didn't care. In my opinion, EVERY job is important and as long as you're working and being smart with your money (ie, saving, investing, etc.) you're better than good. You're ahead of the game.


Unfortunately, James just admitted to me today that he's flat broke. He's living with his mother and father, they're quite elderly and both have health problems so he's getting a little money from the state. However he has $150 in the bank and only has $40 left over at the end of the month after expenses which he has to use for treats and hanging out with friends, things like that.


What's more than that, he told me he's too depressed (he is diagnosed) and stressed to pick up the apprenticeship. He doesn't have money for tools, etc. and has given up looking. His plan is to wait a couple months then do a short term gig with a friend, maybe pick up something more serious after that ends in November. He was really upset and crying and frustrated, as if the world was being unfair to him. He said he'd have to sit and wait and take time to figure out what was best for him.


In my opinion, getting a job is easy. I've worked as a model, in a bookstore, as a server, in a temp agency, and recently I am a paid intern in a lawyer's office. I'm also going to school 10 months of the year. It isn't that difficult to find work if you're really looking. Then again I've been depressed and I know you just feel like nothing is worth trying for. But when I offer him help looking for jobs or writing cover letters, he says he doesn't like to accept help.


What should I do? On one side, this is a red flag. He's 29 and doesn't have a plan or a job or even an outline of what he wants to do. He's ""waiting to figure it out."" On the other, he is so supportive of me. In general he cooks every meal and cleans and takes care of his parents' house. He's been super helpful with me, supportive of my goals and ambitions, even took a day to help me fill out paperwork and mail it in. Honestly, I feel like he's the traditional ""wife"" in this relationship who supports her husband's goals while practicing their housekeeping skills. In this way, I feel like a money-hungry bitch with unrealistic expectations. Is his lack of a career or a plan a big issue?


TL;DR: Is my boyfriend's lack of job ambition a red flag for financial problems or just a rut he's in?"

As the title suggests, this is the first time I have ever been cheated on. A few months ago, my girlfriend went to a guy's house to help with homework. They are in the same major so I thought nothing of it. Well she calls me around midnight saying he kissed her and apologizing. I told her it wasn't her fault and said its okay. A couple days later said she was getting bored with us some and we need to work on spicing things up.Well fast forward to Memorial Day and I find text messages between them saying ""miss fucking you"" (from him and he's in another state right now for an internship) and her response ""hehehe (:"". I confronted her about it and she said he was being a dick and she was being sarcastic. She apologized and I thought there's no reason to not trust her. Well last Monday I saw that he had texted her so the next day I grabbed her phone and did some digging (slightly unethical but whatever) I then found nudes to him on snapchat that he had saved. I confronted her about it a little later and said how stupid that was of her to do and that those were from the same time as the text messages and she had not talked to him since. I then asked if they had ever hooked up and when. She admitted to hooking up with him the night that he had kissed her. She said how that was a mistake and how she felt dirty after. 

But she continued to talk to him, with the example being the texts mentioned earlier. She has apologized a huge amount. 

We were best friends, and she has mentioned that. We had just hit a year together a couple weeks ago. I just don't know what to do. I don't want to care about her feelings but I still do. I feel horribly betrayed, angry, and sad. Friends and my parents say to leave her but she is begging me for a second chance. 

Oh and a real kicker? She was engaged to a guy a few years back and he cheated on her so she knows exactly what I'm going through.

What should I do?

Update: For anyone still caring or following this, I ended it. Thanks for the advice and the support. I greatly appreciate everything."

4r9yi5,1,2016-07-04,"If you've got the time, thank you!",scottiemac9,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/4r9yi5/if_youve_got_the_time_thank_you/,"Hey guys just wanted to come here as you guys are my favourite people on the Internet. This is long and may not be what r/tree posts are meant to be but if you can spare the time I'd appreciate it. 

As you may have heard Kevin Durant joined the Golden State Warriors. For those who aren't familiar basically one of the 3 best players in the league joined the team that set the best record in history this year and was 60 seconds away from being back to back champs. As if that's not bad enough, Kevin Durant's team played the Warriors in the semi-finals and choked away 3 games in a row to lose. Competitive nature screams ""rematch, right here right now!"" instead he goes ""well, if you can't beat em might as well join em."" 

The reason I'm telling you all this is because this has severely upset me. I'm a 20 year old male who is ridiculously ambitious and a competitive athlete at heart. This decision, while the first of this magnitude, is far from the norm. More and more the NBA is losing it's competitive balance and these ""super teams"" are forming, leaving the same 4 teams in title contention year after year. Of course, this is sports so anything can happen, but it freaking sucks! 

I've been at crossroads my whole life as to what I want to do and due to that I've been trying to live life as purely and freely as possible while figuring out the right path to go on. That's how I found cannabis for what it can really be. For those reasons I haven't attended post secondary, instead opting to work full time for the last 3 years and save (which I did successfully). In March of this year I left my job and went into unemployment with the purpose of devoting 24 hours a day for how ever long it took to think, plan, asses and then act on my future. I came to two conclusion. 

1: attend a program at a nearby college titled: Sports Management. 3 year program with an internship, which I would use effectively to net me connections. While playing basketball on the school team, being the best possible player and teammate, and letting that carry me into basketball circles. From there I believe I would have set myself up for many career paths in basketball, all leading different directions. Think of being in the middle of a spider web and having all those strings leading all over the place. As I said before, I am extremely ambitious and refuse to settle for what I don't want, which in turn would lead me to the top, a job with an NBA team. 

Here now I must inform you that I still live with my parents in Toronto, Ontario. I don't have the greatest relationship with my parents and regardless of how well I do while living with them, I am certain I can do much more while living on my own. I'm still at home however because: 1. Housing is expensive and my parents do provide housing and I have no shame using that to my advantage to make life easier on myself. 2. Toronto is the basketball hub of Canada, and larger than many cities in America contrary to popular belief. If I were to work towards an NBA career, Toronto would be my starting point. 

2: My second option has been formed through my love of trees. Which essentially is to enjoy life as much as possible. In this scenario that is achieved by moving to Beautiful British Columbia (which is what the license plates say there) Vancouver and the surrounding areas are the most beautiful places in Canada. I've always wished to live out there. I have grandparents, aunts, uncles and baby cousins out there with whom I get along with better than any family I have here in Toronto, exception to my sister and brother in law. Every time I go visit I dream of living there. Getting myself a job that I enjoy and that will provide me well financially. Vancouver area offers me what Toronto can't in terms of 365/24/7 enjoyment. The weather, the nature, the lifestyle, the activities, the women (I'm a sucker for Asian women). I could go on and on without even mentioning the tree;)  

Now this option has far less concrete planning behind it, but that is also why it is particularly enticing. I allow myself more time for growth and figuring out what I may like to do. I could theoretically find something I enjoy more so than basketball (which here in the now there isn't anything). And that's not to say a plan for employment/schooling couldn't be drafted in the meantime. 

But I can't help but feel that to move there and chase after those things that will bring ""happiness"" is settling. And would it really bring happiness? Yes it would provide more enjoyment, but happiness comes from within, I truly believe that for true happiness, one must feel like they have conquered the world. To the point they are so immensely proud of themselves that they can't be touched. Or hit some dank tree. But what do I know I'm 20.

It's impossible for me to give you every thought and variable in this dilemma, and only I know what I'd want. But even just drafting this has started my brain to work more than it had all day as I've been processing this. If you have taken the time to read this, thank you! And if you can offer your 2 cents I'd like that very much. No two minds are the same, but us marijuana enthusiasts are pretty similar.

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.


------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up (would love her to look like Madison Ivy)

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

4racn1,2,2016-07-04,My future and my parents,browntown125,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4racn1/my_future_and_my_parents/,"Lately, I have been feeling anxious about my future, specifically after I graduate from college. After living away from my parents and gaining a different perspective on them, I feel suffocated by their presence. My parents continue to see me as a kid rather than an adult despite my many efforts to show them my maturity. This belief that I'm a child manifests in them constantly shoving expectations down my throat. To be honest, I'm perfectly fine with my parents having expectations of me. They are paying for my incredibly expensive education (extremely expensive NYC private school) and on top of that they have always been very supportive of me financially. 

Their expectations however are constantly changing and it is driving me crazy. My dad sometimes says he wants me to only focus on school then does a complete 180 flip and berates me for lacking social skills because I am a part of the Super Smash Brothers Melee community. They wanted me to get an internship for the summer but when I tried applying for positions in new york (I'm a freshman CS student so internships are difficult to secure right now) they switched and told me to stop applying and come home. They then recommended me a position with a family friend where I would live with them for an extended period of time while learning unix. When I said no to this they got extremely angry and called me a whole slew of things that cut very deep: ungrateful, selfish, spoiled etc. They then told me they weren't paying for my expensive education for me to waste my summer at home doing nothing.

Now when I tell them I aspire to move to the west coast and work in the tech industry there, they say they want to follow me and move wherever I move once I graduate. I feel like there is no escape from this cycle of my parents not recognizing my adulthood and then judging me based on the most arbitrary things. I feel like even though theoretically independance should empower me, the things my family has provided me with will make me forever indebted to them and any attempt at becoming a true adult will be smacked down by that authority. If I try to make a decision in my life that my parents don't approve of, they will keep calling me all these horrible things. I feel trapped and helpless like I'm in a cage and nothing except my parents dying will free me from this.

4radtu,6,2016-07-04,A few questions about jobs in Web Development,WebDevAllDay,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4radtu/a_few_questions_about_jobs_in_web_development/,"So quick background, I moved back to the states when I was 20 after living for 8 years in Europe. At the time I was living with a friend who worked in IT. He was attempting to make some extra cash by doing a website here and there. I was actually familiar with html + css since I wanted to build a better website then mangastream.com at the time. He was working in Wordpress and I easily picked up on how it works, within a few hours I was already better at it than he was. It ultimately led to him finding me a lot more jobs and that's how I sort of started working as a freelancer (if you can call it that). I worked entirely in Wordpress and Joomla my first 2 years. I eventually picked up Javascript since there were a lot of jobs related to that and would do any sort of job he could get me, from fixing minor issues, working in node.js back-end, databases, creating custom slideshows or other minor scripts. So for the next 3 years I used Javascript extensively, especially with single page apps. I should also mention this wasn't exactly full time since I didn't always have jobs, but I would still work over 40 hours a week since I'd work on my own projects and such. To be as honest as I can be since I want honest answers, here is what I am good at:

 * Vanilla JS (pretty much everything except canvas as I've never used that yet) but coding in JS comes really fast and easy for me.
 * Lua (created a fully fledged mobile app on iOS + Android)
 * Pretty extensive work in Node.js using third party API for storing the data properly and analyzing it thoroughly. Used MongoDB, Redis and a little MySQL.
 * Wordpress, Joomla. I've used PHP to edit wordpress quite a few times in the past, but I wouldn't say I am proficient or knowledgeable in it. I forgot to mention I am self taught in everything programming related and with the help of google I'd be able to figure out what I'd need to edit in PHP to get what I wanted.

Can't really think of anything else on the spot. I was debating if I should finish this course before applying to companies, [Senior Web Developer - Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/senior-web-developer-nanodegree--nd802), mostly hoping to finish it within 2 months, but not sure how much it would help? I figured adding some frameworks like Angular, React, Ember might help since I've heard a lot of top companies use them. I'm the type of person who spends his free time learning whatever I am currently using so I can become familiar with it much faster, but I obviously can't write something like that on my resume. Regardless, since I've never actually been hired before and my only interview was at Riot Games within a week of coming back to the states (which I failed miserably because I sucked at talking), my questions are:

 * Should I start and finish that course or any other before applying to a company?
 * Anything else I should do to best prepare myself?
 * Should I apply to internships first or go straight for a web developer job? 
 * How much starting pay would I be looking at? Do I get much less if I start as an intern (even if I get hired after the internship?)

Feel free to share anything else that would help me out and thanks in advance, I really appreciate it."

Let me give you the quick of where I am today. I went to school for Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology, it's a 2 year AAS that dealt to a small extent with circuitry, embedded engineering and a small amount of programming (make this for loop count, draw sprites on a screen, etc.).

I knew before this degree I wanted to be in the help desk, it was why I went to school but I got convinced that I should pursue programming and for a bit I enjoyed it. I took a year off school after my AAS to pursue a job in circuitry to discover that I didn't like it and subsequently went back to school to pursue a degree in computer science. Now here I am with $10K USD in student debt and 2 and a half years of school to go and 1 year into a programming internship and I've discovered... I do not like programming at all anymore.

I want to help people understand technology, I want to set up their smartphones and laptops, I want to help them teach others. I don't think a bachelors in computer science is a fit for me but I don't know where to start to get a job in IT. I'm so lost on how to start or where to start, I don't want to pursue another year of programming at $4K a semester because taking on that kind of debt for no reason is just plain silly.

Please help me."

the past four months of my life have been absolutely awful. I've struggled with depression my whole life, but a breakup with someone I really cared about and thought I could have a long relationship with triggered a severe depressive episode that I haven't been able to break out of. I've been more depressed than I have ever been in my life. I literally couldn't even get out of bed for the longest time (until I was prescribed Buproprion, which helped with being able to get out of bed, but unfortunately not with the depression itself.) I also started abusing my klonopin prescription and mixing it with alcohol frequently, leading to a tolerance and it no longer working for me. now my social anxiety is back and I'm no longer comfortable anywhere, feel like I can never say or do anything right in social situations, and am just completely uncomfortable in my own skin. Very few things make me happy anymore and I just don't see a light at the end of this tunnel. Even if I spoke to my psych about how I'm feeling, I still feel like I'm in way too deep and can't stand to keep living like this much longer, definitely not for the amount of time it would take to get on new meds and figure out new therapy methods/whatever.  

On top of this, I'm feeling immense pressure about school because I'm going to be a senior in college in the fall and in my program, there is a mandatory internship requirement and I also have to take a full course load and work to have money to live on on top of that. I constantly feel this pressure weighing on me literally every second. I don't sleep anymore. I'm so anxious about finding an internship because there's only three places in my town that are relevant to my career goals, and one already turned me down and the other I've already had experience with and don't think I could realistically spend the required 15 hours a week there. I'm having so much anxiety about this (because if my only other option turns me down or won't even interview me, I'm absolutely screwed) that I get physically sick.

As the depression and anxiety have worsened I've found myself thinking more and more of just fucking ending it. It's been four months, nothing has gotten better, and it would be the only way out of this pressure my school is putting on me (taking time off is not an option, my parents who cosign my loans adamantly do not support that and do not take me seriously when I try to convey how seriously bad I am feeling.) I just got back from a month of studying abroad and was hoping that would lead to a change of perspective for me, but it actually made things worse because the ""friend"" that I went abroad with turned out to be a very mean person to be in close quarters with, and made horrible comments about my daily anxiety and made me feel like nothing but a worthless burden to everyone around me. 

I have daily thoughts about killing myself in a specific way (that I apparently can't go into here, but is almost guaranteed to be successful). It's gotten to the point where I actually fantasize about it, and I've written multiple suicide notes. I'm at home with my family now, and would never kill myself here because I would never want my parents to find me, but when I go back to my apartment in about a week, I'm afraid I won't be able to stop myself. I just feel worthless, like nobody cares about me or would notice if I was gone, and that this is the only way out of the immense pressure being put on me that I can't handle. 

I don't even know why I wrote all that. I don't think anyone can help me. I just don't know what to do and deep down, I would like to live and see things in my life turn around, but they aren't and haven't been, and I can't keep living this way, so I am seeing this as the only option left. "
4rbdyq,7,2016-07-05,Subterfuge: the beginning of the end of my faith,AJEstes,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/4rbdyq/subterfuge_the_beginning_of_the_end_of_my_faith/,"A long time ago I was very religious, and I decided to participate in discipleship schools and short term missions with a youth focused international ministry organization. My first experience with them was exemplary, and I had a blast and felt my faith grow - so I returned a second year as a staff member... And that allowed me to see the inner workings and machinations of the organization - and it is this which slowly broke me until my eyes opened to the falsehoods I was being taught.

The first of these machinations came in subterfuge. The founders of this organization had a son who was a Hollywood director. Now whether his films were religiously motivated or not I neither know nor care (though he did suck as a director). However, during one of these films he allowed a group of students from an audio/video ministry school to volunteer as interns at his set - they recorded their antics and made a cute web series about it. Under an anonymous username I posted a comment about one of these videos expressing concern that in one of the videos they were asked a who's hot or not question, and I thought it was a little inappropriate for a Christian group.

Fast forward two hours and a higher-up in the organization pulls me out of a meeting and tells me I need to delete the comment. His rationale was that the group was not wanting to advertise they were religiously motivated, that they were trying to be incognito and sneak their proselytizing in. I acquiesced and deleted my comment and even my profile... But then it started to sneak in what had happened. 

This organization was monitoring all web traffic on this topic, and then tracked down my email from my account, connected that to my name, found my affiliation with the organization, and sent someone to fix the problem all within a few hours. All so their members could have a better chance of stealthy preaching...

It was this level of subterfuge and control that first made me realize that members of a church organization, and even the organization itself, could be duplicitous, corrupt, and controlling. There was nothing divine or righteous about them, just people trying to get power.

It was this seed that grew into my realization that all religion is just fabrications used to control our thoughts and actions - but it was a lot more steps and a lot more brokenness and betrayal before I got there... Perhaps stories for another day.

TL/DR My own church tracked me down to hide a comment I had made which drew focus to an incognito missionary group they had sent. They had to track me down digitally and physically to do this. Start of the death of my faith."

It's been 2 years since we ended it. Two years since I drove to our place with tears in my eyes crying like a toddler on the phone with my best friend while packing my things while you weren't home. ""This is for the best, it's what we need"" I kept telling myself. I told myself that for months leading up it. Quite frankly I was at my wits end. We both worked endlessly to barely pay our bills while all my friends were off in college with internships that paid more than I made in a year.  I used to get so angry at you and looking back on it now, it was purely incidental I was so frustrated with how our lives turned out. 4 years was a long time just to bask in failure. I kept trying to make out like you where the bad guy, like you're families consistent intervention in our business was a bad thing. It wasn't. I was so narcissistic, so horrible to you that I'm surprised you never cheated on me. You told me after the breakup you dreaded coming home and that struck me so hard. All I ever wanted to do was make you happy and make a life for us. I got so caught up in what I thought where permanent shortcomings that I overlooked everything that I now miss. I hate not having someone to have an inside joke with. I hate sleeping alone. I wish like hell I could re-add you on Facebook and we start chatting again and eventually wind up where we once were. I have dreams about it some nights. Whenever I'm even remotely close to your place or I see you in my suggested friends list I clam up. So afraid ill see you with another guy. Happier. A guy whose already learned the lessons I learned. That I physically shake. I want so badly to forget it all, to just wake up and not have this memory of you tied to me, weighing me down like an anchor. It's skewed my view of women so much I haven't had an honest relationship since then. I shouldn't sill feel this way. You don't. I'm barely a memory, probably someone your friends make fun of. Someone you'll compare the next guy to.  There's so much of me I never got to show you and it eats me alive. One of my coworkers birthday is the same as yours. I think that's primarily why I'm not going to her party, even though she has a pool. I pray that one day I'll wake up and the thought of you will be distant and cold. "
4rblyd,2,2016-07-05,"So many things are wrong with me (26f), I don't know what to do. Fucking my life up by sleeping around.",havingabadday12,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4rblyd/so_many_things_are_wrong_with_me_26f_i_dont_know/,"I don't know if I'm posting in the right subreddit because it's about relationships and sex or more about my stance towards those two things.

I was a virgin till I was 25 and lost my virginity with my first bf. It was painful but it was with someone I loved.

I was depressed pretty much my whole life and my depression was what caused my first break-up. The break up of-course made me have a literal mental break down (almost leading to being admitted into a hospital) and it basically led me to have an affair with a married man (42m) at my internship at a bank. We were afraid of getting caught so we pretty much always met up in a motel and had sex.. no dates or anything. This made me borderline suicidal and I continually tried to hook up with other guys in order to stop seeing the married guy who I really had feelings for. This included a one-night stand with a guy from a club (not even protected sex which fucking scares me now that I think about it).. and two guys from my church.. one guy from my university.. then 2 guys from tinder.. So i slept with 8 guys in the span of less than 1 year and that makes me feel fucking depressed.

It was pretty much just sex. I realize now that I was using sex as a placeholder for emotional connection and I didn't even really enjoy it. I've never even had an orgasm once with the guys I was with.

Well I broke up with my last guy after a really tumultuous relationship of 1 month and a half where I cheated on him with my ""ex's"". After the break-up, I was ""alone"" for 1 week until this random guy asked me for my number on the way to work. I met up with him and turns out he just wanted sex. So i refused and he never contacted me again. 

2 weeks pass before I caved and contacted the married guy again for sex.. and the guy from the university.. and then finally my ex (who I pretty much begged to get back together and was rejected).

And through all of this, my mom found out about all the guys I was sleeping with by going through my texts &amp; phone while I was sleeping and pretty much kicked me out of the house calling me a psycho bitch (understandable) for a month until she told me to come back home.

After that, I contacted another guy I had no interest in - and met up with him to kind of assuage my feelings. He did and then i pretty much discarded him cause I still have no interest in him - but only after I got myself back on tinder to meet some new guys.

Well I matched up pretty quick and met up with one guy yesterday. He invited me over to his place for netflix and chill time and I said I wasn't into casual sex to which he replied ""I actually mean netflix and chill"". So i agreed and went over and of course we started cuddling right away and I was lying there thinking what the fuck was wrong with me before things escalated and he was about to put it in when I stopped him and said I had to leave.

So i left and now I'm sitting here writing this.
Im just so tired of myself now. My family is fed up with me and they don't trust me anymore. My friends have seen my mental breakdown (which was made very public by yours truly) and distance themselves from me. I quit antidepressants because they didn't seem to change shit regarding my behavior. I feel like I'm at a dead end.

I've been going through therapy for a year now and it's not helping. I switched over to a new therapist who is a girl and had my first session with her yesterday. She tells me that I was repressed as a child by my mother (and to be honest she still is that super catholic helicopter parent) and it's coming out in sexually deviant ways. I don't know what to do anymore.

Well there was my rant. I'm meeting another guy tomorrow for a date. I hope it goes well."
4rca2z,1,2016-07-05,New framework as a programmer,Alpy94,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/4rca2z/new_framework_as_a_programmer/,"So you know when you start a job or an internship as CS student, they might give you a new framework. 

That happened to me. I have to use Caffe for my CS internship. That isn't the rant part. 

So you start learning the framework. Some parts of it are a bit complicated but slug through it. 

Some documentation is lacking, but you slug through that with trial and error. It is annoying, but I can work with that. I had worse. 


No No. The part that is frankly really annoying me is when you get a problem. A problem that shouldn't be mathematically possible. I check Google. No solution. I ask on SO, on the forums. I get a few responses, but not really a solution. 

I read the code ( which isn't really commented) to find the source of the error. I try everything my mind comes up with. I woke in the middle of the night to come try something. Nope. 

I tell myself, I better love forward a bit on things that I would have done if there was no error. The problem is that now I can't move forward with that part. So I can't do a thing but sit on my ass. Which is insanely frustrating when you are trying to impress the guys who gave you the internship. "

For my final semester in school I'm planning on doing an independent study that consists of me building an HTML5 based mobile application.

As of right now, I was thinking of using Angular and Apache Cordova to allow me to create an app and port it to all mobile platforms easily. While I have done some tinkering with this before, I found that the two didn't exactly play nicely together - sometimes my Angular code wouldn't fire and sometimes my Cordova hooks just didn't load.  

With this in mind, would my fellow Angular devs have any suggestions as to how to build a mobile app using Angular? And with whatever tools you suggest, how would you structure the project (things like file structure and using RequireJS vs Browserify, etc.)? Project setup has always been my least favorite part of development and I'd really appreciate any advice you all have.



***EDIT*** So the general consensus is to use Ionic (on top of Cordova?) to build things. Going to be taking this route - thanks for the help all!"

[We hear the sound of a clock ticking, a little bit of foreshadowing as we see a clock inside a house; the clock says… 4Shadows Futurefilms Clock Company (from the future)]
[We see black and white pictures of Mark Owney, Thomas Edison and in a bit of foreshadowing Jonny Future, the last picture is a thin-faced sad-looking bald man with a large ox-like retard girl who is trying to lick her own ear and a radical young skater dude… then a strange invention: a pair of sweatpants pop down and the brown stained groin area is sprayed back to the original grey… the news plays on a TV: a blond woman describes the “recent theft of uranium by Tunisian Terrorist Leader Brojoellah Leechallah,” a menacing shot of a swarthy fat Arab preaching to a crowd is shown the end of his speech is caught as we move past the TV: “into a mixed, filthy, MONGREL RACE!”…]
“Hey Ope? Hey, Ope!” An old dark-skinned man, with the stylish hairstyle of individually placed pube follicles and massive acne pock marks, enters the house. “Anybody home? Chipstein, come here boy!”
We see the old man turn a knob up to 1,000,000; a humming is heard; he turns another knob up to 1,000,000; and another; then seventeen more… the humming is unbearable. The character picks up a microphone. The camera zooms out and we see him holding a glass of red wine and a huge speaker is in front of him… we know that we’re in for some spontaneous fun! The man effeminately adjusts his hair in the dark reflection of the centre of the speaker. He brings the microphone up to his mouth… we can tell this is a man who has held long cylinders in front of his mouth before.
“SWEEEEEET CAROOOLL--------“
[The explosion of sound sends the old man flying across the room, BANG! He slams into a bookcase and in a moment of foreshadowing we see hundreds of small pieces fall on him… pieces of eggshells!] The man looks at the speaker… its completely blown apart. The man slowly takes off his sunglasses in a cool guy type way: “Whoah! … Holocaust, baby!”
BRING BRING BRING!
The man picks up the phone: “Anthony, bortha!, is that you?” comes a masculine frat-boy voice.
“Yeah! Hey, Ope, where are you?”
“Alright we got Tony from the New York on the online.”
“Opie, wheres Chipstein is he with you?”
“Tss, tss, yeah I’m a good time traveller Anthony cause my mother says I’m always taking up space… no wait, I don’t know.” There is a long silence the Opie speaks:
“Alright man I’ve found you; can you meet me at the radio station tonight at midnight?”
“Well actually I hav-“Anthony is cut short
“HOLD ON HOLD ON HOLD ON! I need you tonight man… fhuuuck!”
Anthony sighs; we see this is a man who has a hard time being assertive and manly.
“I’ll be there.” We hear all right and some other woops in the background from the phone as Anthony rolls his eyes-then he jumps.
GONG GONG GONG! The future clock is gonging loudly.
“Anthony, where we at with my clock man whats going on?”
“Yeah its gonging… its 8 o’clock.”
“Anthony my experiment worked, I pumped up the minutes just a bit… just a little bit…”
“Opie are you saying…” Opie sniffs and makes noises down the phone…
“Opie is it… WUH-OH! ITS 8:45… I’M LATE TO MEET DANI AT SCHOOL!” 
[We zoom up on Anthony’s scared face and the Power of Love plays loudly. Anthony runs out the door and we see him putting a scarf on. Then he jumps the garden fence and slaps a big pair of goggles onto his face. Now we see why, Anthony takes a second to stop and stand with one hand on his hip and the other still holding his wine – he nods and smiles, then finishes his wine. We see what he was nodding at, his 1920s cool guy automobile! Some super cool shots of Anthony driving around 1950s America: We see big posters of a mayoral candidate Patreeky Oneesh (Anthony makes a comical face), a man with a simpleton-like face pulls his head out of a sack of oats (he and Anthony wave to each other), Anthony takes his hands off the steering-wheel to rub his eyes in disbelief – he thinks he sees a large whale having buckets of water thrown on him – buts it’s another friend and so he waves happily to the man, lastly Ant sees a 42 year old wacky Florida character with a pina colada inside a coconut and a Hawaiian shirt… but that’s not all! This rebellious young fat kid is driving a speedboat up the road, Anthony is shocked and his head spins a full 360 degrees in a comical fashion… “Pretty cool, huuuh?” the fat kid yells as he zooms away. Ant looks in his mirror and says: “it sure is Erock… it sure is!”]
Anthony runs up to the school gate and sees a young boyish-looking girl. She holds him and pulls him the other way. “Hey baby!” he says.
“This way, you have to watch out. Kermit Brand is looking for you.-”
But before she can finish a large but squatter version of Kermit the Frog swing around the corner slams Anthony up against the wall. “Hold it right there McCumia!” He looks menacingly into Ant’s face. “Are you still hanging around with one of my students Dani… this is a little bit of advice McCumia this Dani is a known child and drama queen, you’re in a very dangerous situation. You’re gonna be in big trouble!” 
Anthony makes some “pff-this guy!” type faces and the studio audience (who didn’t seem to be here before) give a laugh and a “Woah-oh!”
Kermit does not take too kindly to this! “Hey you gotta a real attitude problem,” he Kermits out. “You’re a real creep McCumia! You remind me of your Uncle Paul, he was a real creep too! I don’t even know why you’re going to the xm radio try-outs this afternoon, because no McCumia has ever amounted to anything in the past present or the future!”
Anthony gains a new confidence and looks Kermit in his frog eyes: “Yeah… we’ll im going to change the past present or future!”
[We cut to 4 intellectual looking types sitting on chairs in a gym-hall. From left to right: we have an obese red-haired fat woman with glasses, a thin gay-looking man with a pencil moustasche, an old crusty woman who looks like Hilldog Clinton, and a thinnish black man. They look shocked and displeased… to say the least! … And we’re about to see why! … The camera swivels 360 degrees to show the stage they are looking at: We see Anthony in a KKK uniform doing the Nazi salute and beating a hanging black man from a tree, a Cop is beating a black man with a prop baton rather roughly and a hipster-type guy with a homosexual moustache and beard has un-tethered his pantaloons to his ankles and is thrusting a butt-plug into his anus while he stares down the judges… The black man stands up, and swishing one half of his suit jack back to put his hand on his hip, then raises his other finger up… he booms out: “I’m afraid you’re just too damn racist!” The word echoes 37 times as the screen fades to black (this is foreshadowing).]
We cut to a dejected Ant walking with Dani and drinking a bud light.
“One firing is nothing Anthony, you’ve got to create your own network… it’s like Ope’s always saying-“ Dani consoles him
“-Yeah yeah, if you do radio for 20 years you’re better than everyone, period.” But then something catches Ant’s eye. He jumps onto a bench and watches a big black transsexual knock a camera out a weedy middle-eastern man’s hands and assault him.
“Some day, Dani, some day.”
Dani looks sympathetically to Ant, he leans in and for a moment we think they will kiss-but-
HONK HONK! Now we see the giant squat Kermit the frog in a 1950s car. “Dani! Get away from that old creep and in the car.”
Anthony starts to sweat and fidget, instead of saying goodbye he nervously does a Ronald Reagen impersonation: “Yes, well… umm… well…” Dani looks uncomfortably at him, she feels embaressed for the old man, she says goodbye, slaps Anthony on the arm and hops in the car. As the car drive away the Kermit looks disapprovingly at Anthony.
Anthony turns around after the car is gone and kicks the bench angry at himself, but notices a piece of paper fall from his arm where Dani slapped him. It’s her number and it says “I love you.” Anthony’s old leather face brightens up; he looks proud and nods again. We see him slap his goggles back on, hop in his vintage car as the POWER OF LOVE starts again, ah yeah!
When Ant makes it home it is now dark. He opens the door and sees two figures. A strong tall figure wearing white and black make-up is towering over a small man with glasses, the small man looks idiotic and Jewish.  The idiotic Jewish man’s tie is in a double Windsor.
“I can’t believe you loan you’re daughter for sweat love and she has chlamydia, I mean seriously Intern David McCumia Senior – I could have been killed!” The man speaks with a suave sophisticated accent but you can tell he is angry.
“That’s right, I certainly did, I’m sorry Biff Simmons.”
“You really are a real butthead Intern David. And where’s my reports!?”
“Oy gevalt! Biff I guess I forgot-“
This tough guy Biff character then does something unexpected he knocks on intern David’s head. For a moment we think good gravy has he lost his mind? Does he really think that this idiotic Jewish’s man’s head is a door?
“Hello! Hello!? Anybody home McDavid?” Aha! The audience thinks, it was just some common roughhousing. Intern David laughs goofily at his own expense.
Anthony looks angrily at Biff and Biff notices, he walks over slowly to Anthony and they lock their gazes. For a moment we think a scuffle may occur. Then Biff says “I’m gonna fuck your girlfriend.” And with that he leaves.
Anthony now looks at Intern David. Intern David seems to anticipate what Ant is going to say and his voice leaps up into a high-pitched frenzy: “Ant what do you think about that Ant I didn’t know what to do and now that Biff guy is here calling ME a butthead on my show and what do you think about that guy Ant I think he’s a real piece of shit and I’d like to fuck him in his mouth Ant, what do you think about that Ant?”
“Ah GOOOOH! What do I care I already FUCKED HIM, AH GOOOH!” Intern David laughs goofily and then says: “Ohhh Anthony, you and you’re impressions!”
Now we see Anthony’s mother for the first time. The camera zooms up her legs and we see something strange: this mother has a peckah! She hangs up the phone and struts into the living room:
“Kids we’re going to have to eat this cake by ourselves, you’re uncle Lamarr isn’t getting out of prison.” She slaps a mediocre looking cake onto the table, the icing shows a black man with bull horns leaving a prison cell (… this is foreshadowing), the letters say: “PREP yourselves, Lamarr is free!” Anthony looks at the cake, he feels nervous but doesn’t know why (unbeknownst to him he is foreshadowing).
“Now kids it would be proper if you all dropped him a line.”
An odd offensive bird-like boy who seems to be Anthony’s brother says: “Hey ma that icing looks like that lotion you said Lam-“ 
“Now you mind your manners chipper!” Chip gets up to leave and she continues: “and come over here and kiss your mother goodbye.”
But this Chip character makes a face and snortily laughs: “What the fuck I ain’t kissing you, your lips taste like peckahs!”
“Oh Chippah! You always was the comedian in the family.”
“And hey Intern David Dad you got a whole bunch of oil on yer head or sumthin! And Anthony your girlfriend was calling, she was, wait, she was calling me asking me to come give her the old spoon up the ass like she likes saying Mr. big chippy Chippah!”
This makes Anthony look at his watch for unexplained reasons.
“Oh that girl is no good,” says Mrs. Lightning (Anthony’s mother) “any girl with no peckah is not very ladlike to me, isn’t that right Chippah?” 
“Yeah that don’t make no sense ma, where would she pee from?”
“Now mind your manners Chippah! Your father always minds his manners, like the time we met.”
“Yeah he was up in a tree like hey im tarzan or something then grampa hit him with the car and hes all he im steven king or something im gonna write a book about a big PECKAH that eats everybody!”
“That’s right Chippah, and then I realised I was gonna sped the rest of my life with him.” She looks at Intern Dad McDavid who is looking the wrong way and laughing slightly every so often. We detect that maybe Dani is not so happy.
Cut to scene, Anthony swerves up to a sign and skids in a cool guy way. We see the sign says: Twin Jews Mall. Anthony snaps off his goggles and says: “… Lebensraum…” A female member of the studio audience drowns in her own pussy juice. Anthony looks and sees a van it says ‘Turtle and Hughes Eggshells Company. (Foreshadowing).
“Chipstein hey boy!” 
The dog barks then says: “Yeah I’m having a ruff day here, don’t paws you’re vhs players folks, tss.”
The van opens mysteriously and the bald man from before is shown. Heavy hang his bosoms and then comes his time machine! But this is no ordinary time machine, it’s a delorean with a radio satellite on its roof!
Opie picks up a radio microphone with ease, we can tell hes been doing this for a long time. “Alright you’re back with the Greg and Tony show, September 3rd, 1953!” Opie then chases the dog into the car with a commanding presence.
“Tss looks like I’m gonna be driving people up the wall here! They should just put me in a future jail or something!”
Opie lets out a powerful sniff, a sniff that makes us go “Oh Shit! Something’s about to go down!” Then he remote controls the car… to the future that is! YEAH THE FUTURE!

4rcwn6,4,2016-07-05,Dealing with Guilt and Anxiety,ThrowTomAwayOkay,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/4rcwn6/dealing_with_guilt_and_anxiety/,"So background, I (20, M) got dumped about two months ago. When we broke up, we agreed to stay friends. She just kept saying ""I don't want to just never hear from you again, I still care a lot about you but I understand if you need time"" and she said ""please just don't be mean to me"" and stuff and I reassured her we could stay friends and stay in contact and stuff. But when I said that, I didn't realize I was making a mistake. I didn't realize these three things:

1) that you aren't supposed to stay in contact with an ex, you are supposed to go no-contact
2) how hard a breakup would be (at the time I was relieved, but shortly after started dealing with intense heartache
3) That she was going to start posting pictures online with another guy a week after we broke up. That's the thing that absolutely wrecked me

So I then decided to look up online how to deal with breakups and found this subreddit. Since then, I've unfollowed her on social media completely and stopped talking to her, working on focusing on myself and stuff. 

But since my heart (which can be too soft) still cares about her naturally, I'm dealing with a lot of guilt about going no contact. She pretty much asked me not to do that and I told her I wouldn't. But like I said, I didn't realize those three things at the time, and things have changed since I told her so. She will every once and while still try to text me, and I just keep it very short. I don't be specific, I'm not detailed, and I just tell her that my life is going well. Her last text was about her internship and I simply said ""sounds nice"".

Now I'm feeling so guilty about being cold and no contact but I'm doing it for me. I'm moving on. I just need some reassurance that I'm not a douche. That acting like I'm not interested in her life is okay, despite what I said to her to begin with. I'm just trying to deal with this the right way

4rcxaj,48,2016-07-05,"Welcome to Residency! For those of you just starting off, here's some tips:",Novelty_free,Residency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/4rcxaj/welcome_to_residency_for_those_of_you_just/,"1. Write everything down. I can't emphasize enough that no matter how good your memory is, you need to write everything down. Every morning, print out a daily list of patients and notate important information like vitals and labs. Write out your own list of to-dos with check-boxes before rounding but leave room for additional check-boxes for to-dos that come up during rounding. Look over your list multiple times a day to make sure all boxes are checked.   
  
2.  Listen to what your patients are saying. As an intern, only the medical student has more time to spend with the patients. There will be times where you will be the only one to catch something because your resident is new and can't handle 20 patients and your attending hasn't spent time with the patients yet. 

3. Even if you are unsure of management, know your patients from vitals to labs to medications. Again, besides the medical student, you have the most time to know your patients best. Rounding will go much smoother if residents and attendings don't have to stop and look things up and can just get information from you and then make management decisions. It will also help build trust between you and your residents/attendings if they know you know your patients from front to back.   
  
4. At appropriate times throughout the day, ask your resident and attending about reasoning behind their management decisions. If possible ask them to provide you with a relevant source (not always possible as a lot of stuff in medicine is based on culture rather than hard evidence).   
  
5. At appropriate times throughout your rotation, ask for feedback from your resident and attending on how you are doing. Ask for tips on how to become more efficient and where you can improve.   
  
6.  For hand-offs, don't let your fellow intern off the hook if they seem unprepared to give a hand-off or don't know the answer to a question. They need to be sure about their patients before they give them to you to cover. If they can't answer a question, ask their resident, and don't let them leave until everything is clear. At the same time, you don't have to memorize everything they tell you in hand-off. That is almost impossible for covering 50 some odd patients you don't know. While they are telling you the hand-off, pay attention to their notes to make sure they are legible and clear. If they aren't, you will seem like an ass, but you should ask them to make their notes clear for you.  
  
7. Answer pages relatively quickly. If you don't answer them in a reasonable amount of time, nurses get nervous and then end up paging you multiple times, making it nerve-racking to deal with other things.   
  
8. After you have handed off your patients. LEAVE. If you stick around, there will be something insignificant that comes up that will make you stay. Don't feel bad about it because everyone on call goes through it. As long as you've done your best not to give extra work to the covering team, get out while you can. Do what you need to at home after you have handed off your patients. 
   
9. Be respectful to nurses and PCAs. This rule doesn't change when you become an intern. It never changes.  
  
10. For some reason, I feel like it's wrong not to have 10 tips. Don't forget to take care of yourself. Eat lunch even when you're busy. Sleep. Go see a doctor when you are sick. Don't ignore what your body is telling you to take care of others. If it gets to be too much or you are feeling depressed, talk to someone in the program. Some programs are malignant, so that doesn't always mean your program director, but it should be someone that you trust or an outside ear if you don't trust anyone in the program.    
  
Hope these steps help you newbies out. Good luck!"
4rcyeu,7,2016-07-05,How I nearly gave a stalker a job,SirGuala1,catfishstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/catfishstories/comments/4rcyeu/how_i_nearly_gave_a_stalker_a_job/,"This is the story all about how I (21M) was using and app called WeChat, which is the Asian equivalent to WhatsApp. 

So I added a girl from a very long while ago, and after months she started texting one morning, throughout the day she seemed alright, quite normal and fun. But then at nightimes she will get naughty all of a sudden, more direct than usual for a girl. But I didn't give it much importance. She tells me that she will come to my city for an internship in January-February. Which I wouldn't mind to meet a nice looking Asian girl for a date, if I was there at the time...

So the next day she tells me about this cousin she has, that is looking for a job etc etc. She tells me that he has certain conditions such as that he's on a student visa expiring in JANUARY, available hours and even the cousins number. I interviewed him on the phone and all was fine by this point.

But then I realized that from all the pictures sent not 1 was a real selfie, maybe 2/3 from the same girl. When I asked about taking pictures from a window all I received was clearly cropped pictures from Google. The ""sexting"" was way to direct for a woman, and very unoriginal voicenotes as well. And Then she seemed over interested asking about job for the guy. After I started to attach some cables I figured out it was the same person, just a gay Asian dude looking for a job and have fun by pretending to be a woman and getting pics off guys.

Conclusion? This FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT, was pretending to be a WOMAN and I nearly gave him a JOB. As soon as I found out I played it cool and made sure he didn't get the interview at my workplace. Once this was done I cursed him out on both his phones.

This is gonna be helpful to watch out for these scumbags, nothing against gay people but this shit is just twisted. 

Don't do this shit just because you want to get some pictures off guys. It's creepy and one day you'll bump into the wrong person, like me :)

I've tracked data received to my phone and through some digging I got the guys address. I'm not a spiteful person, but I would like to make sure he doesn't try to to this again to nobody else. Any ideas?"

*So I'm a Intern at a company because of my school and I work in different sections of the company marketing ,logistic ,IT ,etc.*


*So one day I was doing my stuff on IT and the phone rang, I picked it up and started talking with a salesman for the company, he was having problems with his mouse so I tried to help him, the conversation went like this:*


&gt;So when did this start happening

&gt;Today when I started my laptop

&gt;Maybe it is damaged or something like that, but Ill try to see what's going on,could you give me your IP so I can enter your machine?

&gt;Oh yeah sure


*They can get their IP using a icon that exists on their computer in case something like this happens, I dint even think at the time how he gave me the IP without using a mouse, it completely slipped past my mind*


&gt;Hmm ok I'm in can you see the mouse moving?

&gt;Yes I can

&gt;So it's not a problem with the configuration of the machine but you should be able to move it, I can't understand why you cant, could you try moving it now that I'm in here?

&gt;Sure


*I can hear him trying to move the mouse icon around but nothing happens,so I stay for about 1 hour checking configurations to see if it is the computer and not the hardware, suddently I see his mouse moving on the screen*


&gt;Did you just move it?

&gt;Yes

&gt;How?

&gt;I used the mouse-pad


*You guys have to understand that no salesman uses a actual mouse on their computer they just can't because they have to use the computer in cars and such, so when he said mouse I tough mouse-pad and I explained that to him,and said that still his mouse should be working(he told me that it was brand new) then he says that it was really hard to put it in and it made a weird noise when it went in, so I got suspicious.*


&gt;I really don't know how to fix this sir, you have to send us your laptop and mouse so we can check what's going on

&gt;Ok I'll do that now Thank you


*The next day I got his computer and mouse, and I almost cried in tears, this guy took the mouse and tried to put it inside the goddamn Ethernet hole, he tried so hard that the piece went inside and the Usb of the mouse bent, so we had to send him a new computer and mouse and I had to call him and tell him the correct hole to put it in(No pun intended)*

&amp;nbsp;

Currently we are studying at the University of the Arts Utrecht. With a team that consists out of a programmer, multiple artist and sound and music designers, we are going to create a VR-game prototype over the next year.

&amp;nbsp;

First I like to tell you about our experience with VR. Past year we did a 5 month internship at House of Secrets, this studio is responsible for SURGE (available on steam for free) and the upcoming APEX VR video clip. 
After the internship we did a 5 month project, in which we experimented on the interaction between PC and VIVE players. We created a mini-game, with multiple puzzles that required the PC and VIVE player to work and communicate extensively together. (http://imgur.com/a/zoJzp)
Epic invited us to join a team of VR-talents at the VR-gamejam in Stuttgart - Germany. This was an awesome experience and we've learned a lot from other VR-enthusiasts like ourselves.

&amp;nbsp;

Now onto this project we are going to launch today. Why are we posting this on Reddit you might ask? We want you, the enthusiasts of VR, to help us create this game. We are going to be as transparent as can be. We want to hear your thoughts, your ideas for this project. VR is an unwritten book, and we all can write the future of it.

&amp;nbsp;

The working title of this game is: **Traveler**. 


Traveler is going to be an RPG with co-op in mind. In this game, the world is torn apart by a dark force. You are left with nothing and have to survive in this world of now floating islands. By creating your own weapons, your own amor, you (and eventually your friends) will go down the darkest dungeon’s, the highest mountains to find out what happened to this world, and how to fix it. Also there will be loot….a lot of loot. 
You will be able to create your own gear, or find it in dungeons. You won’t start every game from 0, you will be able to save your progress.

&amp;nbsp;

We are going to post an update every 1st Tuesday of the month, to keep you updated and to answer your questions.

Let us know what you think, and what you would like to see in this game. This was our first thing on our to-do list. Now let’s go make an awesome game!

&amp;nbsp;

**Traveler Team**

- TL;DR - We’re making an RPG in VR. Let us know what you think."

I am an international Masters student in CS. I did my BS in Electrical but got interested in Computer Vision in sophomore year. Back then I used to work hard and got myself into GSoC'14 (Summers junior year) and GSoC'15 (Summers after senior year). Due to these, I was able to change my stream from EE to CS for my Masters program in Univ. of Minnesota. The day I came here, I joined our Robotics lab and worked for the Fall semester without any pay, just because I loved computer vision. The professor gave me RA for the spring(he liked my work, I think) and insisted on providing RA for the summers. But I tried interviewing for internship positions related to computer vision + machine learning for the summers. Somehow, I was always underconfident about these interviews . I eventually screwed up and thought maybe I don't want to go to industry. I provided these details to the professor who then told ""*For a person, going to industry from school is easy but the opposite is very difficult*"". As time was passing by and people were getting various internship positions (I hate the fact that people choose positions which are too monotonous just because it ""pays""), I again agreed to accept the RA for summers thinking, atlest I will be working in Computer Vision.

Now 1.5 months down the summers, presently I feel the urge from the surrounding to decide between a PhD or go for a good job. I think if I spend more time on deciding which way to go, I will end up in a murky situation. I say this since I still have 2 months left for the summers. I am good with the RA work and can spare some time for Data-structure &amp; Algorithmic interview preparation. (Last time, I was so underprepared that it showed on my face.)
The problem is goal setting. If I prepare for my interviews thinking that ""if some opportunity shows up, i should be able to grab it"", my preparation will have loopholes. To have a clear goal, I ultimately have to answer this ""PhD or Job?""

I know deciding whether to go for a PhD is a life decision. I went over to some excellent articles over these present on the web: 

* http://www.cs.unc.edu/~azuma/hitch4.html 
* http://shouldigetaphd.com/ 
* http://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/25136762019/advice-to-prospective-grad-students 
* http://neurochambers.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/tough-love-insensitive-guide-to.html

I ended up understanding that, ---&gt; ""Ph.D. is hard work. Only do it if you MEAN it."" Sometimes, I see my fellow batchmates and envy them for having a clear goal in life. From this post, I hope I was able to propagate the fact that I love Research. But I do feel that the hunger for knowledge that I had in my undergraduate days has decreased.
Currently, I am working on both my RA and interview prep with my goal as ""A computer vision job which has research embedded "". This is too vague.
Any comments, suggestions on how should I use my time will be of great help.

Thanks!"

I haven't smoked weed in 21 days, failing my last home drug test on the 16th day of abstinence. I smoked for about a year and a half. The first year being a couple times a week and the next half year gradually going to a heavy smoker (couple times a day). I mildly exercised/worked-out and drank tons of water on about 70% of the days. I also bought Q Caps, recommended from one of my friends (which has mixed reviews on whether they work or not). The actual test is in 2 days and am looking for any tips. Synthetic urine or a friends urine is not a option. Thanks for any help!

Just to run some more test, I did the ""certo"" method today and I passed the drug test!!! Tomorrow I will take another home drug test to see if it was the certo that did it or if it is just out of my system, then the following day I will have to decide whether to do ""certo"" or ""Q-Caps"" for the real drug test."

Is a secured card my only option?",m137_1,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4rdlf9/21_year_old_student_denied_for_2_credit_cards/,"I have been using a debit card for most transactions for the past 5 or 6 years. After losing my card (thinking it was stolen at the time - later found it), I realized that I should probably look into a credit card for some added security. I figured it's a smart idea to start building credit, too.

I'm a 21 year old student with a paid summer internship and a 15 hr/week minimum wage job when school is in session. I don't have any student loans but I have had a car loan in my name for about 8 months, with all payments being made on time. 

I have a Chase account which I do my primary banking through and a credit union account which I mainly just use for saving money I don't want to touch. I first applied for a Chase Freedom card and was denied due to lack of credit history. After that, I decided to try for a student Visa card through my credit union - which I was also denied for.

-----------------------------------------------------------

The report from the credit union denial letter said I have a Transunion credit score of 672. I was denied for the following reasons:

* Insufficient recent tradeline history
* Too many credit inquiries in the last 3 months
* Insufficient number of satisfactory trades


My score is ""adversely affected"" by the following:

* Insufficient length of credit history
* Insufficient revolving credit history
* Insufficient number of satisfactory accounts
* Too many recent credit checks
* Number of recent inquiries on consumer report

Do I have any other options at this point other than getting a secured card? Should I wait a while before trying to apply for another card?"

I would be greatly appreciative if someone could recommend any improvements. Thanks ahead of time! 


Why do you want to serve?

After reviewing the goals and values of the Student Conservation Association (SCA) I believe this organization is an excellent place for me to grow and develop. I have always been extremely interested in science and nature. I always gravitated towards these topics when given a choice and my career goals quickly oriented in this direction. I pursued this passion in college, and graduated with a Biology Major and Environmental Studies Minor in May of 2014. 

I find that the nuances of working with biological systems easily click with my thought processes. More specifically, I find that ecology and conservation are the fields of biology that I want to study in a professional context. While I was working towards my undergraduate degree I used every opportunity to learn more about the issues that ecology/conservation are currently facing and their proposed sulutions. Since graduation, I have become involved in field-based work at Binghamton University focused on land management and disease ecology. This has shown me that I enjoy jobs relating to improving the quality of the local environment, furthering available scientific knowledge and educating others on the importance of these tasks. 

With all these experiences under my belt, I hope to further hone the skills I have gained while learning ones. After working with the SCA I am interested serving as an employee of the Department of Environmental Conservation or US Fish and Wildlife Service. An SCA internship would give me firsthand knowledge of present and future projects associated with these governmental departments  as well as prime networking opportunities. The SCA would provide a setting where I can follow a long time interest, experience new challenges and be an active contributor to the environmental issues faced in the twenty first century.

What do you hope to gain?

An SCA internship would be beneficial to me, both as a person and as a professional.

 In regards to personal traits, leadershipand , organizational and teamwork abilities are among the most important qualities I have worked to improve upon in the past. These are traits key to success in multiple situations and I hope to further these by dealing with the real-world complexities of active conservation efforts. Whether it is in  the context of a leadership role or otherwise, the ability to work with others and maintain communication are skills that can always be improved upon. I am actively honing these abilities in my present positions at Binghamton University (BU) and know the types of roles within the SCA. 

 The same can be said for the abilities I gained in the realm of research and scientific experience. Prior to my involvement at BU I had extensive lab experience. Since graduating I have been working to expand my field-based skill set.  This has been a successful endeavor and I can now follow through with a suite of field-based techniques (E.g. small animal trapping, vegetation identification and removal) with little to no supervision.  Getting involved in an SCA-based role will allow me to futher expand my abilities as a field technician. 

Using the skills I would acquire while working for the SCA, I hope to get accepted into a graduate program in the area of ecology and conservation. My ultimate goal is to get a job in the field relating to these areas of study, something I have been interested in since I was very young.

We are living in a time of rapid environmental change: many species are struggling to survive habitats are being degraded, and urbanization is rapidly encroaching upon formerly wild areas. The skills I want to gain via the SCA will provide me the opportunity to have a personal stake in the matter of furthering the knowledge on species/habitats that are threatened and how to assure their long term survival.

What makes you a strong candidate?

At Ithaca College I was an officer in numerous student organizations. The mission of each group was highly variable, as were the tasks I was responsible for. I used a core set of duties (E.g. goal setting, event planning, and fund raising) for each of these roles and know that they can easily be applied to the success of any team,         SCA-based or otherwise. In the past I have worked on projects that required communication with the public and exact scientific precision, long and short term planning and other experiences crucial the success of active conservation efforts. For example, one of the clubs I was in a leadership position for had the goal of planning and maintaining a community garden. The end-to-end management included constructing the planting beds, designing the layout, coordinating and supervising volunteers and planning social events after all other work was done. This experience, and others like it, make me a strong candidate for an SCA position. 

The scientific skill set I have acquired is equally robust. In a lab setting I have worked in depth on the on genetics and animal behavior as well as honing a more general skill set in things like data management and learning to adjust to new protocols. Prior to my current positions at Binghamton University I had a broad range of experiences in areas like invasive species removal, water quality analysis and ecological surveys. By working with as a Research Assistant for a disease epidemiology study and Land Stewards I have taken some of these skills (E.g. Small animal trapping, trail maintenance) to the next level and learned to adapt to the highly variable work conditions associated with field-based work. 

I am passionate about the conservation and ecology and know that this will give me the initiative to take full advantage of an SCA internship.  Whenever I am given the opportunity, I work hard t acquiring new skills and experiences. The combination of my leadership experience, scientific experience and passion defines my interest in the SCA and my long term goals. "

So I just recently graduated and have been working at my current position for about 8 months now. I started as an intern. I have been very happy at my current position as it is challenging and they are constantly sending me to training classes.

Several weeks ago, I was contacted by a recruiter at a company I have been dreaming of working for. I knew I'd eventually try applying for a job at this company but not this early in my career. I decided just to give it a shot. I pretty much knew I wouldn't get the job since it required 5-7 years of experience. Well a couple interviews later and it looks like I'm in the running to actually get this job.

My company has decided to send me to a huge conference in Vegas next week. So basically I'd have to pass up on the conference because it wouldn't feel right going to this conference then leaving the company in the following weeks.

I really don't know if I should take it if I am offered the job. This is my dream job and I wouldn't leave my current company for anything else. It is a 30% pay increase and basically all the benefits are better. It just doesn't feel right leaving the company so quickly after they have done so much for me. 

What do you all think?"

I have an Old Navy Credit Card ($1887.24) and I have a Wells Fargo Credit ($2.43) which I should be paying that one this week. So Far I have paid off about $1000. I also have a $500 that I have to give my mom. Not because of money she lended me but because I promised her I would last year after my internship. I don't have an Emergency Fund, and I have about $700 that I should be putting in to my Credit Card. The thing is, I want to move out but if I were to move out, that $700 would be going towards rent of August. I'm not sure If I want to be weeks behind schedule to clear off debt. My parents also want me to refinance my car as soon as my debt is payed off. They want to get a truck but can't since my dad co-signed with me. Another issue is my Budgeting.

For the last 4 days, I've been sick (don't even know how I got a cold) which fucking sucked. So, I did nothing naturally but lay in bed. I told /u/Kairinezz and she was perfeclty fine with knowing this. However, I wasn't. I'm really big on getting things done and creating schedules to base myself upon to make sure I get a lot of things done. I like to just make as much progress when it comes to projects and stuff, as early as possible.

However, I do not think I can actually be a moderator for /r/FazCo. It's not cause I don't think I'm capable, it's cause I don't think I have the time for it. I wouldn't want to waste people's time when I can give it to someone else who can dedicate time to this subreddit with love. It has NOTHING, to do with the chemistry of the team I do not want you to think that. They're all fucking amazing people, shoutout to /u/theretrogamer91 he's been really cool since the first day I met him. He was the first person I told regarding this decision.

The logical reasoning behind me resigning is simple, in 3 weeks I'm going away for 2 weeks. I also run my own blog, which is called [NerdSenses](http://nerdsenses.com/).  I run it with multiple people, however I'm the Co-Leader of that and I have a lot of things which can lead to this being my future. I told Kai about some big news already, so I'll announce it here. I got an internship to do video production for a company in New York. The CEO also looks at my articles and stuff, sends me feedback and so on. So, I'm really taking this serious. 

I wouldn't step down if I knew it was wrong. I know people would understand this and you're all fantastic people for doing so. I hope you guys are fine with this situation, I also gave the 2 choices who I'd prefer to replace me for my position.

It's been quite a while now that I have lost interest in having friends (I'm 23) graduated from college in December and living alone in Spain for an internship. I realized that I don't really like having friends anymore and that I usually enjoy going out alone, I have felt like that for a year now. I do like to go out with friends once in a while but not all the time. Did this happen to anyone at a similar phase in their lives? I was definitely not like that in school when I was younger , I really don't know what's happening!

I'm going to be starting a 7cups internship in a while, but in the meanwhile I've been doing usual chats there. Today I made a big difference to someone whom felt extremely good talking to me and thanked me so much. They said they finally wanted to try going back to therapy and that talking to me made them realise they wanted a change in their life. It made me feel so appreciated, like I had a purpose.

It started getting me thinking about the many people on this sub which have helped me and have pm'd me before (but on a different account) and have given me so much support and kindness in my last depressive episode. The fact that many of those who help are struggling themselves shows how good-hearted and selfless some people are out there, and I'd like to thank those people profusely. 

Thank you, listeners and supporters, for having faith and being there for those who don't have faith in themselves and don't have anyone. You are the good in this world. I think you are such beautiful, wonderful beings who deserve so much more acknowledgement. 

Thank you for having so much humanity.

4rehfn,0,2016-07-05,"Me [22 M] with my long-distance girlfriend [21 F] of two years. We have had a consistently good relationship - other than my infidelity one year ago. We recovered, but recently she has seemed distant to the point where it is affecting my day to day life.",unmatchedd,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4rehfn/me_22_m_with_my_longdistance_girlfriend_21_f_of/,"Hey guys. I met my girlfriend in May of 2014 and we started dating the following July. We met on campus at college and had a great time together, non-stop. We quickly fell in love and the feelings were mutually intense. Unfortunately, November of 2014 I decided to move back home and study part time, due to my poor grades. We agreed to date long term and everything was going amazing. The summer of 2015, she went on an internship across the country for 3 months and even though we didn't see each other, we spoke almost everyday. 

Then, July of 2015, coming up on our one year anniversary and her return home, I made the biggest mistake of my life. I went to a party less than a week before her return and ended up kissing another girl. I immediately regretted it and felt the most immense guilt of my life. I can only imagine how fucking low she felt, considering I was shaking with guilt, regret, and heart break.. I called her and told her that ""I think we should break up, because I kissed another girl."" I was wrong, and even though she wouldn't stop asking me what was wrong with me through texts, we spoke every single day and I drove up to see her every weekend for 4 weeks straight. After the 5th week, she forgave me and our relationship continued to be great. I hate myself for doing what I did, but I can only be better moving forward. I still think of that moment I did what I did to this day. I kissed a girl I have never met to risk this great relationship me and my girlfriend built together. I had no emotions for this girl, completely unlike the deep and intense love I feel for my girlfriend.

Fast forward to July of 2016. We have been doing great, other than the fact that she is graduating this year. I am still a ways a way from graduating because I changed my major and I am part time school. We are currently fretting over her graduation, because we have been unsure of our future. Our communication has been good and we have spoken about it plenty of times, both not sure of what we want to do. At some point, we mutually agreed we weren't ready for marriage or necessarily moving in together. That was in December. In late May, I went out of the country for 2 weeks and then she went out of the country in early June for 2 weeks. 

Since May, I have had overwhelming anxiety about the possibility of losing her. I love this girl to bits. I definitely recognize my own flaws, and I see small things that bother me about her. But those flaws stand no chance for the overwhelming love I feel for her. I can't say with certainty I want to marry her today or even within a couple of years. But I do know I want to be with her indefinitely. I cannot imagine a life without her. We see each other every week to two weeks despite being 3-4 hours apart. I forget about responsibilities when I'm with her because of how much I enjoy spending time with her. Beside that, we both have great, separate social circles and interests. I'm obsessed, but not in a creepy or unproductive way. I'm working 35 hours a week and taking 3 classes a semester while vising her all of the time and maintaining my own friend and family relationships. However, I have been filled with unbearable anxiety in the weeks since May. 

She loves social media (Facebook and Instagram) to the point where there isn't two hours she doesn't use it. I am different there because I hardly use FB and don't have an Instagram. I know she uses her phone every hour of the day because I have seen it, but recently there are more and more times where she takes hours to respond to me. She is more than a little crazy with how she wants to appear on social media, but hardly talks about me on social media.  We have sex no less than 3 times every time we see each other, but I can feel less passion. The way she writes to me has passion that is fleeting compared to how it used to be. I almost feel like she is embarrassed to publicly display me as her boyfriend. Yet she posts about how her sorority sister ""Alexandra"" is the one she loves most and can't wait to see her... the same weekend I'm driving up to see her. I guess I just want to hear her convince me that she thinks I am as great as I think she is. I definitely feel a little pathetic because I know I shower this girl in compliments and love and do my best to make her feel like my queen. But I get this feeling that she is just in the relationship. I have spoken to her about it, but have realized I only talk about how much I love her and care about her, not about how I am feeling. We have spoken to this a few times, and she tells me she loves me and wants to be with me, but I don't feel it like I used to. I have a hard time believing people when say they love me (bad trait of mine) because my step dad used to say the same thing before beating the shit out of me and my mom for 6 years. I have a flaw in the sense that I need reassurance and confidence from my girlfriend more often than most people do. I used to have no doubt about her love and commitment for me, but recently that has faltered and I don't know what to do.

Maybe I am in my own head and I am making things up, but I have had butterflies of anxiety for all of the weeks we have spent apart since May. My gut is telling me something that my mind cannot convince otherwise. I have posted this long ass post here in hopes of finding advice or maybe even a wake up call. I am going to go crazy to the point where I am thinking of breaking up with her because I don't want to live with doubting her feelings for me for who knows how long. 



   
**tl;dr**: Me and my girlfriend have been dating for two years, 15 months of which have been long distance. I cheated a year ago, she forgave me, and we have moved on back to normal. Our paths may go separate ways shortly, and in the last month and a half especially I can feel her feelings fleeing. Or maybe thats just me. Please give me some advice or words of wisdom. I am going crazy."

After first seeing him in Workaholics, I thought he was a funny likeable douchbag, and I enjoyed his character for what it was worth. 

Now though, it seems like I see him in everything. My dad recently fell in love with Modern Family, so I watched some with him, and wouldn't you know, he has a part, albiet not a main character. I recently finished watching Community, and he had a small part in it too. I watched a bit of the movie the Intern, and wouldn't you know, he's in that too. 

It's probably just me happening to watch stuff that he happens to be in, but it just seems like he manages to get in everything. Personally, I'm starting to get a little annoyed of him, because he always seems to play the same character, or at least the characters he does play always have the same mannerisms and are ultimately similar. Whatever his agent is doing, he's doing a great job, because I can't get away from him."

It's a very broad request, but I'm lost here. At the moment, I have two final exams this week and they will be the last ones for this semester (first year). 

I'm a masters student who will be attending the second year, next semester. I'll still have three more subjects and a master thesis to write. The thing is, I've been at this college for about almost 6 years. I've entered college back then to another course (was wronged when applying, it's a long story), changed courses, did the 3 years of bachelor's course and had to attend another year for a subject I did not complete (and to redo my internship, it's also a long story). I've had a long list of ""I got fucked"" in this college and I've had, and have, lots of personal problems (loneliness, narcissistic parents, lack of money, etc.) and sometimes I get in a very low mood when I look at my non-existent personal life. Add to that my age and being late in life, or not having the college experience I wanted. I also got disappointed with the courses I took, not because of not getting a job, but more on the ""I thought I was gonna learn something for real"", and didn't learn that much (I'm in IT).

I just need to try and get over these mood swings and focus on finishing this so I can leave this place and town, and start my personal life from scratch, being that I'll finally start working full-time at 25 (I hope so) and can finally get some peace and rest, so I can focus on the largest scheme of things (professionally and personally).

I'm at the moment also following several ""Stop"" programs (I've been in the past 2/3 years), some more successfully than others. It's just that I can't discipline myself on all of those due to my current situation. It just feels like some days I just don't have the strength anymore to keep fighting. My days are basically only studying, at the weekends I go swimming but hate it (I'm alone and I've swam for years, so it is boring). 

I'm sorry if this feels more like a vent than a proper request. Thanks in advance for the replies."

Some background on me, I'm a rising Junior, I worked as a lab tutor last semester, finished with a high GPA, and currently at a Big 4.

I want to do both because the money would help a lot but I'm not sure if doing both will be too much while being a full time student. I don't really know what goes into being a research assistant and not sure if I'll end up getting burnt out trying to work on both. I usually spend a lot of time working on projects outside of class and at my current internship I usually stay pretty late, so I feel like I would be able to handle the workload. The subjects pertain heavily to machine learning and natural language processing, which are subjects I haven't really dove into yet, just read around and such but they do excite me.

Over the past year, I manage to grow a debt that is around 16k right now. This is due to many bad choices financially, especially my implication in network marketing as well as buying a car on loan.

The car itself was valued at 9k when I bought it last year. Which rises to 13k with taxes and interest rates over 5 years. If I sold the car today, I would still need to pay a balance of 9700$. So I basically lost money with that car but it's not that bad. However, I don't have any money for even a cheap car.

The rest of my debts was contracted in various spendings. Around 4k in network marketing (yes I was stupid enough to spend money in that.) Which required me to pay for initial franchise, a custom tailored suit, and travel expenses to an event in Las Vegas. The rest comes from stupid spending on internet.

I maxed my credit card at 6k with all that. But in november 2015 I made the good move to consolidate my debts to repay that credit card. So at least I will be paying less interest. 12% instead of 19%. But I decided to buy brand new snowboard gear on credit card this winter because I'm retarded. I've been paying this loan + CC ever since but It's gonna take a while considering my income. 

I work full time in a bar and I make 25k CAN (about 19k US). As far as increasing my income, I have a technician degree since 2013 but I never manage to find a job. I when to interviews and everything but it never worked out. I don't know if it's the fact that I suck at interviews, or the fact I never did any internship during school so I basically lack any work experience. Employers asking experience before the experience right? A classic. So that means I wasted 3 years on that degree and I will have to go back to school, which is gonna wait due to my debt.

So say I manage to sell my car and repay my car loan, I'm left with 6500$ in debts and I need 2000$ for a cheap car. I'm confident I can pay that back in one year if I'm tight on my budget. I know my situation is not as bad as some other people but I still surprise myself how stupid I was to manage my finances so badly. The worst thing is I can't make plans right now. I'm young, I want to travel, but my friends are doing it instead of me, spending the summer around the globe while I'm stuck paying bills at home. So yeah, that sucks."

I met him around 2 years ago, and we immediately hit it off and started dating. He let me know he had Aspergers early on in the relationship, and told me a little about what it entails. I got used to his anxiety, lack of eye contact, and his hand flailing when he gets excited, I actually find his hand flailing kind of cute. 

The problem is life skills, it's like he doesn't have them or refuses to learn them. He has a personal hygiene problem, he rarely showers. I see him around once a week or once every 2 weeks, (we live 30 miles apart) and I definitely notice the smell of body odor when I'm around him. I ask him when the last time he showered was, and he usually gets mad and upset when I ask. He once said a week ago, which made me feel uneasy I then explained to him the importance of showering, something I felt like I shouldn't have to do. He agrees with me, but then doesn't actually follow through with showering more.

He's also worn the same dirty ragged smelly old clothes since when I first met him, I don't think he's ever gone shopping for new ones. He can't cook, he just eats out with his student loan money. 

He also doesn't seem to want to be considerate for other people, his mom's birthday was last weekend, I bought her some jewelry which she appreciated, and yet he didn't buy her anything or even call her. When I asked him why, he said he ""didn't know what to do about it"" what does that even mean? He also ended up forgetting to buy me something on valentines day.

Lately he's been depressed about trying to find an internship with an engineering firm, he hasn't been able to get an interview yet. I told him he should go to the college's career center and have them look over his resume and give him tips. He said he didn't want too, after some prying as to why he said he was ""afraid to go."" 

I just don't know what to do, at first I thought he was just lazy and I tried to encourage him to do these basic things, but now I think it might be an aspect of his Aspergers. It's difficult to be with him when he can't take care of his personal hygiene, it's hard to care for him, when he seemingly doesn't care about me. The worst thing is his reluctance for change, I'll talk to him about my concerns he'll agree and follow through at first, but then slowly sink back into his normal self. I really really enjoy being with him otherwise and I don't want to break up with him, but I don't want to go through life having to be his mom. Is there any insight you guys can give? Should he go see a therapist? Thank you for your time, and I'm sorry for the long post."

I'm about to start my 4th year in a DPD program and I'm not hopeful about getting into a dietetic internship any time soon. Personal set-backs are forcing me to extend the program to a fifth year; my GPA is pretty terrible at the moment (and has been consistently so--around the 2.9 range). In addition to that, health issues have interfered with my ability to continue working consistently (I had a retail/food service position for a year and a quarter, followed by a student assistant position in a food safety lab for 10 months). In short, I feel I have neither the grades (no love from professors) nor the experience to apply. 

Nonetheless, I feel I have gone too far (&amp; taken too many loans) to turn back. So, I'm asking you fellow nutrition professionals for advice on how to proceed should I manage to graduate.

I hear that DPD graduates are eligible to take the DTR exam right after acquiring the degree. What are the specific steps I must take to obtain a DTR certification? Is it possible to get certified without completing a specific training program? 

I'd appreciate any help and assessment pertaining to my situation. Please tell me there's still hope!"

4rfhtm,14,2016-07-05,We are holding a potential POTUS candidate to a lower series of standards than an average government employee,Cymdai,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/4rfhtm/we_are_holding_a_potential_potus_candidate_to_a/,"I want to explain my outrage at this decision in a way that people who either don't follow politics/don't care enough to read up can understand.

**TL;DR: A simple explanation of security clearances and why Hilary should no longer be eligible to run for President.**

The President of the United States (the POTUS) is entrusted with one of the highest security clearances in the land. They will know more about covert military operations, stealth intelligence operations, surveillance operations, etc, than nearly anyone else in the world. Security clearances come in different varieties and values, ranging from basic reliability checks, to TS/SCI (Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information), to all sorts of other agency-specific clearances. Numerous positions within the military, the army, and the Federal Government require some degree of trust to gain access to these clearances; positions ranging from the army, to police officers, to the CIA, etc. The testing and such is quite exhaustive, often including a year-long investigation by a personal investigator/team of investigators, polygraphs, background checks, etc. There are literally hundreds of ways to be disqualified or deemed ""ineligible"" for a security clearance, so it is not uncommon for a potential applicant to be rejected.

In the event that you breach that trust, there are consequences. Typically, to be serious enough to be investigated, you'd lose your security clearance. That doesn't mean you'll necessarily be fired (though, a demotion would be likely as a result of the loss of a security clearance) but the chances of you being re-granted security clearance would be substantially lower. There are jobs you wouldn't even suspect that require security clearances (file shredder, for example; a person whose job is to shred confidential files and make sure they are disposed of properly). Breaches aren't always intentional, either; simply failing to lock your computer while leaving it open in, say, a library (thus giving possible public access to confidential information) could count as a security breach.

Moving to the relevant topic of ""What does this mean that Hilary is not being charged by the FBI?"" to the world? There's a few conclusions to draw here.

1) Hilary has effectively demonstrated that it's perfectly acceptable for a person of prestige to supercede the integrity of security clearances in general.

2) There's a double standard for security clearances, as the FBI stated a normal person would likely face consequences.

3) The most supreme power in our land, a candidate for the position of the President of the United states, is allowed to be (at best) willfully negligent and ignorant of security protocols related to the handling, discussion, and transferring of sensitive information pertaining to matters of national security, and (at worst) allowed to circumvent the law where he/she sees fit.

For the record, I at no point suspected Hilary would end up in jail. The justice system has proven, repeatedly, that it simply cannot perform it's duty effectively when it comes to prosecuting powerful/wealthy people. This has been demonstrated repeatedly throughout history; one could simply examine the last decade worth of trials to investigate this for themselves. My outrage, however, comes from the fact that we are holding a person entrusted to make decisions on behalf of the entire country to a lower standard than your average government contract worker. Rest assured, had these actions been carried out by a file shredder, an army corporal, an FBI intern, etc, then there would be significant repercussions faced by that person. Yet we are affording the benefit of the doubt to a position, in my mind, that should be held to the highest standard in the country. If I, for example, show up to work late every day, then my colleagues may think ""My, he's a detriment to the team!"", whereas if Hilary Clinton were to leak classified documents, entire nations may think ""Is this really who they elected to be the President...?""

Furthermore, while the findings may not be prosecuted, charged, or anything of the like, at the very least, Hilary should be ineligible for any security clearances, period, moving forward. Perhaps it was just an honest mistake (even if I personally reject that notion), but feigning ignorance of the law does not work for your average citizen; as such, why should it work for a senior government official? If you were to walk into traffic court with a speeding ticket and go ""Oops, I didn't know I was going 63mph in a 45mph zone"", that does not excuse your negligence; you will still be held accountable for your action. Hilary has effectively stated ""Oops, I made a mistake."", except her mistake was carried out on a far grander stage with a far larger scope than your average speeding ticket. Pressing forward, as a result of her inability to gain a security clearance, she should no longer be eligible to run for POTUS, nor any additional branch of government that requires a security clearance of any kind. This does not restrict her from serving her country politically; it merely protects the integrity of our security protocols set in place by numerous government agencies.


With all that in mind, Hilary is now a candidate who has demonstrated themselves to be above the law, impervious to consequences for their actions. A leader who is not subject to the laws and regulations of the society which they govern is no different than a tyrant. Given that America has gone to war to dispose of said tyrants across the globe in the past, I cannot understand how anyone can look at Hilary Clinton and go ""She's the face of democracy, freedom, and equality."" when everything she stands for is being above and beyond the rules, regulations, and laws of society.

Good day."

In my spare time, I've studied a lot of a computer science syllabus and feel very comfortable with a lot of the more advanced topics taught in a CS degree. 

My problem is, I can't decide what field I want to work in, or even what language I'd like to use most. I've done a couple summer internships at big software companies and that's given me the impression I don't want to work as a full time dev. Also, I've had experience with over a dozen languages and feel comfortable writing at least half of them, with ample time in the next year to bring any of them up to professional standard. I've also spent a lot of time working on reverse engineering tasks and doing loads of CTF's and I really enjoy that kind of work but wouldn't know where to begin moving in that direction.

Really my question is how did any of you choose what field you wanted to work in? Did you know when you graduated or did you end up there through trial and error? Thanks for any advice"

I graduated December 2015 with that BS and have been working on the ""transitional program"" to get into the Master's Program in CS at my local state university which is basically the core CS courses that I would need for the Master's. I will finish this transitional program this fall and will be applying and hopefully being accepted into the Master's program starting spring 2017. My predicament is this, I currently have an internship working on an application development team. It pays well and my boss is hoping to turn it into a full-time position by the end of the year. They know I am pursing my Master's in CS and have said they are more than willing to work with me on a schedule while I am in school. However, when I met with a graduate advisor for the Master's program she talked about me applying to be a GTA. She said she thinks I would be a good candidate and theres about a $1000 monthly stipend and tuition is basically covered for the Master's. My biggest concern was graduating with a Master's degree and having essentially no work experience in this field so I was very happy to land this internship I have. Another thing is that while I am on an ""application development"" team it is mostly just maintaining existing applications or adding features or fixing something wrong in them. They hire outside contractors to come in and do most of the heavy lifting for new applications. I like what I am doing there so far and I am learning .NET since most of their applications are in that but I think long run I would rather be creating new software. Also, if I work full-time during the Master's this could extend my anticipated graduation by a year or so depending on how much I can handle. So, assuming everything goes perfect which could be a long shot but I want to be prepared, if I get an offer to be a GTA and an offer of a full-time position at my current company which do you guys think I should take?

Every day recently I have woken up thinking: ""What the fuck am I supposed to do today"". I'm 18, and I thought everything would change once I graduated High School, it's the worst place ever right? Who wants to do shitty assignments and homework all day? Nothing's changed, except I have absolutely nothing to do now and I don't interact or talk to anyone except for my family and my one friend who doesn't even want to hang out with me or talk about anything except jokes. It's not even worth trying to make plans with anyone anymore, because they either ignore me or we say ""Oh yeah we'll do that"" and it never happens or there's a solid date and it falls through. But they have no trouble hanging out with their other friends every day, on Instagram and Snapchat with all their fun fucking adventures.

I thought: ""Wow, i'll have a High School diploma! I didn't graduate college or anything but people and employers will appreciate that, right?"". Nope. Turns out employers literally do not care about a High School diploma, and this is for shitty minimum wage retail jobs too. I had an internship before I graduated, they say they want me, but it's been almost a fucking month at this point and now they said ""Call on Wednesday, we may have an orientation class soon"". So i'll call tomorrow, after already having called more than 3 times and submitted an application, i'll try to get back into this job that I don't even like, I had so much anxiety while I was there it sucked, but even that is better than sitting on my ass doing absolutely NOTHING all day. I'm not worried about money, I have enough money for everything I need that my parents don't pay for, gas. I don't want to buy anything, nothing will help me feel better, it's just another ineffective distraction. 

Driving? Oh yeah, I thought driving was gonna be the shit. I could go anywhere I want, anytime! I can drive to hang out with my friends and go to the store when I need to, and many other great things. Turns out none of my friends want to do anything with me, let alone talk to me. It's nice being able to drive myself, but all I do is get fast food and just get fatter and feel even worse about myself. Also it just feels like a hassle now because I get out on the road and people drive like retards and I just end up getting anxious. 

I have no hobbies no passions. I like video games but even that is not fun anymore. Sometimes I have to force myself to play a game now, just to do something, but it just ends up pissing me off and doesn't help at all. I tried to buy something i'd like on the Steam sale but I didn't like anything I saw. 

Everyone says at this time in you're life you have so many opportunities, you can literally do anything you want and don't have to worry about paying for a place to live or food, really. I have no idea what to do, all I can do is go to one of two community colleges near me, just like all the other seniors at my school are doing, and pay hundreds of dollars for classes I literally have no interest in for a degree or a transfer (which i'm not even sure I can do because I didn't take all my required subjects in HS so i'd have to take even more useless college classes). What am I going to get a degree in? Like I said I have no passions, no interest in doing anything in particular, I look at all my favorite authors and video game designers and think ""How the fuck did they just decide one day to do this, and were successful, it doesn't make any sense"". 

I don't know what to do about friends, a job, or college. I haven't known for years, I thought the answers would come to me but they haven't. I've tried everything, all my plans fall through. I search for every little tiny moment of happiness and excitement in my life but it is nothing compared to the everyday nothingness that goes on. "

Thought I might get some advice here since this is all new to me. Sorry if this is all over the place, I'm not good at articulating things smoothly. I'll just start from the beginning. Since I was little, my mother always told me to never settle down early and to travel the world. I didn't have a problem with that so thats what I wanted to do, to travel around and enjoy life here and there. My mother started preparing to travel when I was 13. At my middle school, there was a class trip for only selected students to go to Washington DC. I was one of the selected students, so with fundraisers and all that, I was able to go. I had fun, it was my first time traveling to some place new. Then it was my little brother's turn. He got selected again for the same class trip at the same age, and he took the same trip to Washington DC. 

To keep it going, my mom wanted my youngest sister to travel as well, just like her siblings. However, my mother decided to take my sister to a much more sophisticated group. At the age of 10, my sister got to travel all over the UK for 2-3 weeks. 

I was a little jealous but I was happy that my sister got to experience something cool. Well, its been a couple of years since we have traveled. At my university, I was chosen to go abroad to volunteer and/or do internships with my career. I brought it up to my mother since she was the one who was helping me pay for my tuition. My mom shot it down, and said it was too far and too dangerous. I let it go since it was on the pricey range. A couple of months later, my mom calls me to tells me that she's thinking of letting my sister go to Greece. At this point, I started to get annoyed, but I let it go because I didn't want to cause issue. Sometime after that, I was given the option to study abroad in Costa Rica. I asked my mother, and she said no. I let it go because I had no arguments against that. Then sometime later again, my mother calls me and tells me that my sister might go to Nicaragua for a school activity. At this point, I'm annoyed and wondering why. But again, I don't say anything.

My 21st birthday is coming up. I wanted to go travel to California with a friend. I decided I wanted to do this because I don't drink and I always wanted to continue visiting new places. I asked my mother that this is what I wanted to do for my 21st birthday. But, again she shot it down. She told me no because it was too far and dangerous things could happen and I wasn't ready yet. I was upset, and I decided to confront her why she wouldn't let me try new things but she never really answered and just gave me the ""I want whats best for you"" conversation. 

Next summer, I'm going to working(hopefully). My mom is pushing me to get an internship near home instead of out of state. But at the same time, she's telling me that she's going to travel someplace new with my sister that summer. I'm hurt, jealous, and frustrated. My brother doesn't really care about traveling so none of this bothers him. I tried talking to my mother about why she includes my sister and she told me ""what do you want? You don't want me to travel because you're working?"" 

What do I do? How do I deal with the jealousy?



   
tl;dr: Mom lets my sister travels around the world while she keeps shooting down my attempts to travel. I'm jealous as hell."

I was a robotics instructor at 2 highschools and worked at our little after school program thing, within my first month 2 people quit, so I got more hours, around the third month another 2 quit and the owner sold the company to the current CEO, The CEO revised the pay system and made the company a non-profit. At the start of last month we had summer camps and stuff and I was scheduled to be lead instructor for almost all of them (2 a day). There was issues with the new pay system and the fact I was only going to be paid 11 dollars an hour for 4 hours of prep (it takes me about 11-12 hours for each camp, not counting travel and clean up at the facility) as a contractor (meaning I would not be taxed now but will get taxed at the end of the year) I resigned and was taken off the schedule immediately 

I first took that job because I had no other place to go and I did not want to stay will a dying company, it sounded really really cool, and I stayed a total of 4 months, at first I was barley breaking even with travel and stuff but now I was losing money and going into debt (i owe about $2000 in credit cards)

I guess my question is is what should I do? Should I refine my programming skills? Continue the projects I was working on at the company I used to work for (on my own accord).

I've been building my collection for quite some time, but I don't use digital copy or ultraviolet. I have just cleaned out the unwanted inserts in my bluray cases, and I have the following codes available for anyone who wants them.

**A few caveats:**

1. Do not PM me. Post a comment in this thread with what you want, and ***I*** will send ***you*** a message with the code. I will ignore unsolicited PMs.

2. Don't be greedy. Try to stick to just a couple codes you're interested in. Spread the love.

3. First come, first served.

4. I can't guarantee that all of these still work. Many have past the expiration date, and a few are from UK Blurays. All the choices are marked below with the date listed. Dates in bold are past expiration. In many cases, these codes still work even past the listed date, so you are welcome to try.

5. EDIT: I forgot to mention: I will send the code as an imgur link to the image of the insert. It's easier to take a picture and upload to imgur than to retype all the codes.

6. EDIT: I feel a bit unfair adding this, but I don't know any other solution. Please don't create an account just for this post. I want to limit this to just more established accounts (at least 1 month or so) to prevent people from cleaning codes out without giving others a chance.

So I guess my question has three parts: First, how marketable is the major/minor combo above? Btw, if it helps to know, I have had a couple internships at this point, one in online sales and the other as an administrative assistant. I am planning to continue to apply for them and possibly a work study program up until I graduate.

Second, will a certificate in Informatics increase my job marketability enough to be worth the extra time and money it will take to get it?

And finally, what other ways can I make myself more marketable to employers? Aside from networking, I'd love some tips for skills and/or certifications that would be good to add to my resume.

Anyway, any help, feedback, or advice is greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance!

I also want to take my brother along for the ride, as he's looking to branch into heavy PC gaming for his seventeenth birthday, hence another reason for me wanting a physical shop.

So here's the million dollar question.

In Seoul, South Korea, can any member of this subreddit please tell me where I can get some good gaming gear from SteelSeries, Razer, Corsair, Logitech, CoolerMaster etc? We live in the Gangnam district of Seoul and I'd just really like to know if there's any gaming tech shops near here so I can go with my bro and test out keyboards/mice/other gear. Price isn't an issue as I likely will go there to test, maybe have my brother buy a couple peripherals, but I myself will be ordering online.

Thanks in advance, cheers!"

(And yes I do start all my posts like this xD)

This one is going to be a very short one because how stupid it is

So our salesman all have their laptops, some of them have those detachable screens that turn into tablets and the keyboard connects to the tablet using Bluetooth, so this guy calls and says that his tablet/laptop is not working, nor the screen nor the keyboard, I try for like 10 minutes to see if it is his error, and that he is just using it wrong, after that I tell him that he needs to send it to us so we can see whats going on.

The next day I receive his computer and OMG I almost lost fate in humanity that day, the USB into the Ethernet is one thing, but this guy just tough that his normal laptop could be turned into a tablet so he ripped out the screen from the keyboard and there was wires everywhere, it looked like a computer horror movie up in there

My coworkers were just amazed at what they were seeing, one even said that he had been working there for 10 years and never seen something that stupid.

I don't even know how he did it, like its not easy to rip a screen from a laptop, but oh well I called him and had a 20 minute talk explaining that what he did was completely insane and that we would send him a new laptop the next day

*Never heard of him again don't know if he got fired or if his still destroying laptops*

Undergrad is in Electronics &amp; Communication Engineering. 
I want to do my Masters in Computer Science - specializing in Computer Vision (and/or allied fields).

I have just one internship at a small company under my belt.
GPA is 8.48 on a 10 point scale. So 3.39 if we scale it down.
Hoping to get published in a journal before I start applying to grad school in September. Have some small projects that I will finish by then.
My Final year project will be in this field. I'm doing some Coursera courses on the side which are relevant to it.

Haven't written my GRE yet.


1. How competitive is my profile as an international student? (I'm from India) 
2. What do I do to bolster my profile?
3. Is interning for a year after undergrad, and then applying a good idea?
4. If I were to take up a job related to CS, but not related to my field of interest, would that be detrimental to my prospects?

4rhvsp,4,2016-07-06,Undergraduate Abroad or Stateside? Which is the better option for my goals?,PorcTree,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4rhvsp/undergraduate_abroad_or_stateside_which_is_the/,"Looking for some thoughts or advice. Here's the situation.

Real quick background - I'm a USAF vet using my GI bill to go to college. I'm looking to get my degree in Computer Science or a Software Development related field. I'm looking to hopefully get into the video game industry one day, and if that doesn't work out, I'll just use my degree where it's needed. 

I have two options in mind. 

Option 1: Go to San Diego, go to the community college there for a semester while applying to UCSD, hopefully get accepted to UCSD and get my undergraduate there (confident I'd be accepted). This is an option I'm thinking about because they seem to be a very reputable school, with what seems to be a great computer science program. San Diego also appears to have several video game companies in which I would hope to intern at, or try to get my foot in the door while going to college.  

Pros of this option - 

- Apparently 14th best university in the world - Does this really count for anything when it comes to finding work?

- Internships, possible network connections for field I want to work in

- Rigorous Computer Science degree program

- I feel like I Have a clearer vision of my future in this option

Cons:

- Classroom sizes. From what I understand many class sizes are 100+ people.

- Not being in Athens, Greece


Option 2:
I applied to the American College of Greece - Deree in Athens, and was accepted already. This College has an Information Technology - Software Development option as well as a IT - Digital Media Option, in which I would double major. The Program doesn't seem as rigorous as the UCSD program, and there aren't many video game companies in Greece. Those are the two primary concerns.

I should also mention that this school is regionally accredited in the northeast, so it's not much different than earning a degree in the northeast. You also earn UK credits, so you basically walk away with a degree good in the US and the UK.

Pros of this option:

- Athens, Greece. It's an amazing place regardless of the hate it gets from the media.

- Double majoring in Software Development and Digital Media

- International experience - I've read that earning a degree overseas can be beneficial in the eyes of potential employers. Any thoughts? 

- More life experience

- Smaller class sizes

- Earn credits for the US and the UK

Cons:

- Video game industry / lack of internship opportunities in that field

- The school is not well known in the US and I fear employers won't care that I have a degree from some place they have probably never heard of.

- Less rigorous course won't prepare me as well for my work (So I think)

Any thoughts on any of this? What do you guys think the best course of action would be?

Finances wouldn't be an issue in either area.

Side Note:
Is there someone in a Computer Science field that can chime in on the quality of courses. At least the subjects that are listed in the degree program at the Greek school? As in, are they similar to what I need to learn or are the classes garbage?

Thanks for any input!

I'm doing a year long IT internship that started in June and goes until I gradute next May. It's a well known company (not a tech company though) and I really really enjoy working here.

I am currently on the IT infrastructure team, but my manager knows that I am computer science and would like to write some code while I'm here. He and I have spoken to other managers so I will more than likely get to do some programming during my year at this company.

My question to you guys is: how can I turn this IT position into a full time developer position? I am on good terms with many of the previous interns here, some of which hold programming positions. Is there anything I could/should ask them? I've narrowed my future career options down to web development or software engineering. 

So how can I turn my IT intern role into a web dev/SWE position when I graduate? When should I start applying to these open positions, or any job after graduation? Should I start before 2017? 

Also, should I have a different portfolio for when I am applying to software dev. positions versus web dev. positions? Can I use my same personal website to the safe effect? Thanks."
4riix0,9,2016-07-06,[Women's Wednesdays] Why do women leave engineering?,tbri,FeMRADebates,https://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/4riix0/womens_wednesdays_why_do_women_leave_engineering/,"[An article](http://news.mit.edu/2016/why-do-women-leave-engineering-0615) (excerpts):

&gt;Women who go to college intending to become engineers stay in the profession less often than men. Why is this? While multiple reasons have been offered in the past, a new study co-authored by an MIT sociologist develops a novel explanation: The negative group dynamics women tend to experience during team-based work projects makes the profession less appealing.

&gt;More specifically, the study finds, women often feel marginalized, especially during internships, other summer work opportunities, or team-based educational activities. In those situations, gender dynamics seem to generate more opportunities for men to work on the most challenging problems, while women tend to be assigned routine tasks or simple managerial duties.

&gt;As a result of their experiences at these moments, women who have developed high expectations for their profession — expecting to make a positive social impact as engineers — can become disillusioned with their career prospects.

&gt;The current study does not necessarily preclude some of those other explanations, but it adds an additional element to the larger discussion.

&gt;To conduct the study, the researchers asked more than 40 undergraduate engineering students to keep twice-monthly diaries. The students attended four institutions in Massachusetts: MIT, the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering, Smith College, and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. That generated more than 3,000 individual diary entries that the scholars systematically examined.

&gt;What emerges is a picture in which female engineering students are negatively affected at particular moments of their educational terms — especially when they engage in team-based activities outside the classroom, where, in a less structured environment, older gender roles re-emerge.

&gt;This crops up frequently in the diary entries. To take an example, one student named Kimberly described an episode in a design class in which “two girls in a group had been working on the robot we were building in that class for hours, and the guys in their group came in and within minutes had sentenced them to doing menial tasks while the guys went and had all the fun in the machine shop. We heard the girls complaining about it. … ” 

&gt;Or, as the paper puts it, “Informal interactions with peers and everyday sexism in teams and internships are particularly salient building blocks of [gender] segregation.” The researchers add: “For many women, their first encounter with collaboration is to be treated in gender stereotypical ways.” And by contrast, as the researchers note in the paper, “Almost without exception, we find that the men interpret the experience of internships and summer jobs as a positive experience.”

&gt;Such experiences lead to a problem involving what the researchers call “anticipatory socialization.” The women in the study, Silbey and her colleagues observed, are more likely than men to say they are entering the field of engineering with the explicit idea that it will be a “socially responsible” profession that will “make a difference in people’s lives.” But group dynamics seem to affect this specific expectation in two ways: by leading women to question whether other professions could be a better vehicle for affecting positive social change, and by leading them to question if their field has a “commitment to a socially conscious agenda that … was a key motivator for them in the first place.”

&gt;As Silbey observes, the findings suggest that engineering’s gender gap is not precisely rooted in the engineering curriculum or the classroom, which have often been the focus of past scrutiny in this area.

&gt;“We think engineering education is quite successful by its own standards,” Silbey says. Moreover, she adds, “The teaching environment is for the most part very successful.”

We are building an intern corporate web application, which replaces a lot of spreadsheets. As such, we have to deal with tables that can contain about 30+ columns. This is a requirement, because they need to filter and look all the data in one page to do their work.

We started using an open source dashboard project, found on https://github.com/puikinsh/gentelella. With this as a base, then we modified some ideas, add new features, etc., but basically this project + bootstrap styles are the base for colors, forms, typography, etc.

This UI is really an improvement, compared to what currently exists in other Web apps inside the company, but I'm not completely satisfied about the improvement.

Searching for additional guidelines in UI, I have found some companies that are currently working on how to standardize and help the UI deployment process. Examples of this idea are:

- http://rizzo.lonelyplanet.com
- https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/

Do you have any experience with how to improve usability, with some standards? I like how bootstrap shows the features with some code samples, the same with this gentelella dashboard, but I think... is there any way to improve and to maintain a clean UI, considering new UX ideas?"

4rj2b9,35,2016-07-06,"Am I '""paying dues"" or being used?",theplug_,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/4rj2b9/am_i_paying_dues_or_being_used/,"Current situation: I'm trying to come up in the NYC nightlife scene. Now before I go into anything, if you aren't familiar with the NYC nightlife scene, it is in a very corrupt time. So basically there's a handful of promotion groups that handle promotions for all the nightclubs in NYC. Clubs hire out these promo groups to do nights at their clubs and get their DJ's/Promoters to come in. The promo company only has a budget for their headlining DJ (or that's what they want you to believe). They REFUSE to pay their opening and closing DJ's a DJ fee, but instead a promo fee based on how many people they bring. This is a dilemma all over the city. Most of the headlining club DJ's in NYC are signed to a DJ management group and usually have a booking agent. The booking agents at these management groups works with the promotional companies to get their DJ's (which are the headliners) bookings. DJ's who are veterans and have been in the game for years usually go straight through the clubs for their bookings. 

Now there's me. I'm a young kid (early 20's) who has a decent following and can bring people out on a weekly basis, along with spinning exceptionally well. I never like to say I'm a good DJ because I don't want to come off as cocky. I've spun in the city a handful of times under different promoters, all for the same compensation. Either free, or being paid on how many people I bring. It also takes about 2 weeks to get paid the little bit of money I've made off my friends. Apparently according to the last guy who booked me to close for their headlining DJ, I need to ""pay my dues"" in order to become a headlining DJ. That means not getting paid to DJ, doing favors for DJ's such as opening or closing for them, and bringing people out every time I DJ. I'll get an extra $50 if I get a table that buys at least 2 bottles. It's almost like I'm an intern. I also have to provide transportation for myself, make sure the people I bring to the club get in and are satisfied, and DJ. 

I recently got into an argument with the guy who last booked me because I turned down his offer to DJ this weekend, since there was no pay. I asked him what he pays opening DJ's. His answer was ""they don't pay opening DJ's in NYC"". He asked what I'd charge and I gave him a price. He was angry with the price I quoted him, and kept asking me who in NYC pays their opening DJ's. I basically told him if there's money being made I'd like a piece of the action even if it's not a lot of money. Am I right for doing this or should I bend over and ""pay my dues""? In a way, I'd be making an investment and would potentially become a headliner. On the other hand, I'm being used and feel like a slave to the industry. Promoters, bartenders, doormen/doorwomen, bouncers and everyone else is getting paid except for myself. I feel this just isn't fair. Which is why I asked for a DJ fee. I had a DJ friend call me up and tell me that the only way to make it in the city is through paying my dues the way I just explained. He says he pays his dues, and has gotten a few paid gigs through doing so. 

EDIT: The excuse for going this route would be ""if you really love what you do, then you'll do anything it takes to pursue it"". But I'm not sure in this situation this is accurate. I know musicians do this all the time but is this how it will be for DJ's as well?"

My problem is that I am not sure when they are testing and that if I technically don't have a degree yet and I am under 21 that I won't get in. I know that people sometimes wait as much as 5 years for there name on the list,and I have about 3 years of schooling so I am not sure what to do.

Do I apply early right now when I am not in shape yet and talk with a recruiter or do I wait until I finish my degree.

Also what should I do if I have to wait for a long time, like as in a job to look into that is in the law enforcement field that isnt paying minimum wage.

* Worked alongside my dad on and off doing handyman jobs like moving furniture, installing fans/lights, nailing, sawing wood, etc for around 5 years

* And I guess my most unique one is working as a Beekeeper from March - Present. This is my friend's dad's company that he has been starting up and I have been apart of. We started off with a few dozen hives and will be expanding to around 1250 hives by next year and selling honey commercially sometime in the next month or two. I will be taking a sort of management position, leading a group of 4 and training them while my friends manage the other groups of 4. I have helped start/manage the social media page, take pictures/videos for the website and hopefully soon will be able to help with coding for both the website and the app we are developing to keep track of all the hives. 

* Internship during summer and possibly will continue doing for a couple of months learning C# and helping code for a robot that will climb up a field goal posted and record the football field. Also might help with developing the app for statistics and live feed during the football games and maybe with the servers. Hopefully this will be integrated into my very own school and many others sometime this year. The company is trying to compete with others like Hudl and Gamechanger.


Sorry if everything is a bit cluttered, I appreciate any sort of criticism/advice and will answer any question. Thanks

4rk49c,1,2016-07-06,"Me [24 M] and my friend [24 M] of several years in an internship together, becoming increasingly frustrated and I don't know what to do.",procedurethrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4rk49c/me_24_m_and_my_friend_24_m_of_several_years_in_an/,"Hey everyone, so I am in need of help with a friend of mine I am doing my internship with right now. I apologize for the long text.

We are currently working with software development and I have worked before with him before in college with this as well.
In the past, we have worked with pair programming, which I personally don't mind. In fact, it has went very well to work with him smoothly in the past with this programming methodology.

However, I am getting increasingly more agitated working with him. The progress of the current project is good, because I do most of the programming. He is slower at reaction recently and if I don't take initiative to write some code, it will go much slower. 

I have to reminded him to do this and that regarding things in the code, I asked him to pay more attention but he is seemingly not catching up to my speed of programming. My train of thought is faster, simply put.

In addition, I vouched for him for this job, as I believed he would be better than this present performance. He wouldn't have this job without me and it is his first real job as well, so I have to remind him of things that are obvious in the environment we are working (like not swearing, playing games during work and so on).

I can't tell if I have unrealistic expectations of him or not, but to make things worse, I have helped him in the past
with schoolwork. He's not as good as me in English and I haven't explicity told him to try to learn more himself (and as such,
becoming more dependant on me, but he has still improved in comparison to the past). It is to the point where not enough schoolwork can compensate the amount of work I have done and honestly, I don't mind working extra hard with school sometimes, but I am becoming tired of it. 

At the same time, I have a hard time realising some sort of way for him to ""pay me back"" for what I have put into school so far.
Master thesis is around the corner, but I have a feeling that I will put in more work in the end because he does not deliver the same level of quality as I do and I fear that if he does not, it would make things even worse.

As such, I don't know what to do. If I interfere now, there is a risk it will (to some extent) reduce the quality of the project
and/or my current standing in the workplace. But I am putting in more effort because if I do not, the speed of progress will be reduced.

What do you think I should do? I know it's not fair to judge people's differences in characteristics, but I told him
before this started that it has to deliver according to the expectations of what I deliver (as I have worked with this in the past).

TL;DR

Friend of mine is doing internship with me. We work together doing pair programming, friend works slower than I do and I have to take over because he does not perform as fast as I do.

In addition, I have done school work for him in the past as a good gesture, received not anywhere near as much as ""payback"" so far.

I am becoming frustrated by this, especially since a master thesis is planned on doing with him, but seriously contemplating if I should bring him along for the master thesis now.

What should I do?"

I'm heavily looking into the government's scholarship-for-service program (offers full tuition/stipend towards master's degree in exchange for 2 years of government employment post-grad) with the intent of furthering my InfoSec exposure before entering the work force. 

My question is, aside from the pay difference (is it that drastic?), what do typical federal cybersec jobs look like? Is there a major disadvantage to taking this route (master's + gov) to break into InfoSec as opposed to looking for work straight out of undergrad? I'm working on some CompTIA certs and independent projects right now and will try to intern in the Spring, but as of now I don't have much resume fodder so I doubt I'd be able to land a great job off the bat, especially in security. Hence leaning towards the SFS program. Thanks for the input!

Edit: I guess I should clarify, I have many interests in the field as of now, but I'm more interested in the networking side of things as opposed to code, and I'd like to eventually work on the OSCP and get into consulting. "

So thanks in advanced for anyone that takes the time to read this.

Im 21, I still live at home. It hasn’t been the greatest lately. My dad freaks out at me every time I want to leave the house. My boyfriend and I left at 8:30pm one night to go pick up an xbox someone was selling and my dad went apeshit. He is so possessive over me and I can’t take it. I can’t have my own SIN card, passport, birth certificate. He keeps those locked up. I only recently got permission to have my health card. He’s only happy when I’m home like Rapunzel locked away in her castle. He makes my bf feel like shit by constantly telling him that “he’s not living”. My dad has a perfect little idea of what’s the right thing to do. Work, get your doctors, and anyone that strays from that is wrong. 
I’m so much happier when I stay at my boyfriends house. He lives out in the country and beside the lake. Environmentally is so much better there, but also mentally and emotionally. 

I was really debating on whether or not to go back to university after I graduate college. I decided to do so. I accepted my offer and my dad was super happy. I looked into the school more and they said that since i have a diploma in fitness and health that I could be considered for their advanced standing Kinesiology program and only have to complete 3 years. That program is full, so i decided to take the year off and start next year. Im saving myself a year of school and $10,000 and I’ll be graduating at the same time either way. 
I told my parents that I was staying at my boyfriends (3 hours away) during the time I’m off. My dad told me I was stupid and wasn’t leaving the house. Im fortunate enough to have parents who pay for my school. My dad told me that he would pay the $10,000 if it meant i stay at home, which i think is incredibly stupid. I told him and he basically said that it wasn’t the money saving thats making me take a year off… it’s because i want to spend time with my bf. Which isn’t true. I’ve been in school for 4 years out of high school and i think i deserve a break that i’m able to have. 
He told me that if I move for the year that I’m out of his life and I’m not his daughter anymore. I’m absolutely heart broken. Just because my brothers didn’t move out at my age, doesn’t mean I can’t. I’ve always been 100x more independent than them. 

Oh, fun fact as well.. The other month my dad blew up at my bf and I and started saying such horrible things. I told him if it stays this way then I’m not coming back. He then said if i don’t he’ll drive over there and kill me. I asked him yesterday to apologize to me for that and he had absolutely no remorse. 

Now here's the problem: I have one course I’m taking this summer (Thursdays) and an internship that i need 196 hours for. If I leave now, i can always get notes online and just go into school on the exam day. Not a problem.  I just can’t leave and do the internship, and I don’t think i can switch the internship to another location. I have a month and a half left until I finish. I just can’t take it here anymore and I don’t know what to do. I don;t have anyone in this area that i can stay with.

I don't want a really expensive one, but a basic gaming laptop (preferably - Dell, Lenovo or HP) the ones that have presence in India (Asus has very few service centres).

Total budget and country of purchase: -
$800 (don't mind stretching it a little). United States.

Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply. 
-Best specifications, don't really like 2-in-1 laptops and I'll have a power source nearby at most times, so the battery life isn't going to make a huge difference.

How important is weight to you? -Not very, but I will be carrying to my place of internship travelling among huge crowds (in Bombay) and to my library at my University (I live on campus)

Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac. 
Windows

**Do you have a preferred screen size? 
14"" minimum - 15.6""

**Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. 
No heavy duty editing or anything of that sort but I will be playing the recently released games like Batman, GTA, Unchartered, FIFA, etc and those that are yet to come out, like Battlefield

If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want? 
I won't mind playing games on medium settings (or even low)

Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?
The input devices should just be usable (:p). No other such requirements.

Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion. -fill here, remove dashes-
My budget is around 800$, and an SSD would be awesome, if it fits the budget. I'd prefer a matte screen. I also have a 1TB external hard disk. I also wanted to know if I could put games in it and play the after connecting it. He'll buy it online during the Black Friday sale."

We're about to enter our senior year of college (we go to the same school). He plans to look for a job after graduation (computer science), while I plan to go to grad school.

There are about 25 schools that offer the program I'm looking for, and they're spread out all over the country (US). None are in my boyfriend's hometown. My boyfriend has been doing very well at his summer internship (which is at the company his dad has been working for for 20 years) and it is very very likely they will offer him a job. It's a good, stable company for him to work for.

We have discussed the matter at hand and there are a few options.

1. We go long distance for 2.5 years (length of my program), then I move to his hometown.
2. He moves with me for 2.5 years, gets a job somewhere nearby, and then we relocate to his town afterwards.
3. He moves with me for 2.5 years, gets a job somewhere nearby, then we settle in that town or anywhere else (world is our oyster sort of thing).
4. We break up.

Obviously we don't want option 4. My favorite is option 3 because it gives us more possibilities (not guaranteed i could get a job in his town, it's a small market), but it screws BF over. Option 2 seems best to me, but it's still taking him away from his family. He has such a close knit, wonderful family (I met them all for the first time recently) and it would be a shame for him not to see them often.

I've been talking to BF about it and he says he'd like to be with me in person, but he can't guarantee anything until he starts hearing from companies and I start hearing from grad schools. That won't be till March or April, and the worry is eating me up. It's hard to imagine waiting to know what happens for several more months. What do I do to feel better? How do I get over the guilt?

I know we could do long distance, but it's been really hard being long distance every summer and that's only a few months at a time. I love him so much and I want a home and life with him.

tl;dr: My career requires me not living in boyfriend's hometown for at least 2.5 years, possibly more. BF is very tied to his hometown and could live there for the rest of his life if I didn't get in the way. He claims he'd like to stay with me in person but can't guarantee anything till later in the spring."
4rlfbe,10,2016-07-06,I [23F] think my latest partner [24M] is lying to me about being in an open relationship. Advice?,cek2015,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4rlfbe/i_23f_think_my_latest_partner_24m_is_lying_to_me/,"In June, I was swiping on Tinder when I matched with a really cute guy. He messaged me and we hit it off right away. After a couple days of chatting, he invited me to join him for a wine tasting in a week's time, which I immediately agreed to. 

About 2 days before we were scheduled to meet, I decided to look him up on Instagram just to see more pictures and learn a bit more about him. I clicked to see the photos he was tagged in and saw a BUNCH of him and a girl (clearly a girlfriend based on the hashtags and captions), spanning back to 2014. The most recent photo was from May, so I assumed that he and the girl had broken up since then, hence why he was on Tinder. To confirm this, I decided to check out their Facebooks. His seemed clean--no photos of the girl, and his relationship status said ""single."" When I went to the girl's page, I immediately noticed that her cover photo was of the two of them together, and upon further scrolling, I found out that she was currently living with the guy...

I decided not to say anything to him at first. We went out on our wine date and things went wonderfully. We both agreed that we had instant chemistry. We made plans to meet up the following week. At this point, I had discovered that the other girl had a Twitter, and was seeing some pretty damning evidence that she and the guy were definitely not broken up. When I confronted him about her, he immediately responded that she was a friend with benefits he'd started hooking up with 2 years ago; he was allowing her to live with him for the summer while she worked an internship in the area, but she would be moving back across the country in August. According to him, she was aware that he was using Tinder and was cool with him seeing me. He even claimed that she had counter-stalked me on social media. He swore up and down that he was single. 

I did some digging and the story for the most part checked out; the girl did have an internship in the area but was due to go back to school out of state once it ended. The only problem was that for a supposed FWB relationship, the two of them seemed awfully romantic with each other. The girl had been tweeting things about getting married to him one day, posting photos of them kissing, etc. I decided to DM her on Instagram to confirm his story. However, she never responded. When I asked the guy to send me her number, his response was ""she showed me the DM you sent her, and she said she doesn't want to respond because she doesn't want drama or confrontation."" 

I found this to be odd. I hadn't told him that I was going to message her, so the only way he would have known I'd sent her a DM would have been if she'd shown it to him. But I was confused as to why she would be hesitant to say ""yes, we're FWB"" or ""what the fuck, he's lying to you, we're definitely dating."" 

Basically, all I'm left with is the possibility that the two of them have agreed to an open relationship due to the distance that's normally between them, but for some reason he's afraid to admit this to me. I'm not sure what else to think. I really like this guy and we've been having a blast hanging out with each other. He told me the other day that I could ask him anything I wanted about the other girl because he wanted me to trust him. But idk...this whole situation just seems odd to me. What do you redditors think is going on here?


**tl;dr**: I'm seeing a guy who claims to be single, but I have reasons to believe he's lying and is in fact in an open relationship with another girl. His story for the most part checks out, but I'm uneasy about the presence of this other girl. What do you all think is happening?"

And before everything, I used to be a productive guy that studied a lot about everything in my course(comp. Science).

But then I have this problem since I left my first internship in a startup company, which I worked with games. There I used to work 7-9 hours a day, and sometimes 11 hours. After I started to maintain three different games, came the huge responsability and pressure from my bosses to make everything faster. So I started to feel bad and have fear to fail in my tasks.


Since then, I can't hold a job for more than a day, I started a job in a Bank and left in the same day, I felt disgusted there, the ambient, the lack of emotions in the employees, the feeling of working only for money and nothing else... All this together drove me to leave in the first day of job. I felt bad and mediocre, my family and bf judged me because I left a good job. Actually the interview process lasted for 2 weeks and I did not even worked there for more than a day, it was hard for me too....


After that, I tried another internship in a small startup, passed in the interview process and left before the first day, I could not stop thinking about going there and failing on all tasks they would ask me to do. 

So, lately I applied for internships and always give excuses to not go to the presencial interview. It seems that I already gave up the entire job market, it just seems corrupted.

Nowdays, I have only 2 semesters left in university and I can't study anything, having the feeling of wasting time... Maybe I don't like my field of study anymore.... Now I'am very interested in languages... I am learning french and japonese now, and this is the only thing I can keep going with excitement. 

I hope you guys can understand what I mean, maybe I did not explained very well because english is not my native language. Therefore, my situation is a mess, I hate the job market for now, they make us slaves, yell at us and treat our emotions like shit(because you must be a robot, right?). Probably I'm going to be a teacher and help others grow intellectually and personally.

Lots of questions...",WhoOwnsTheNorth,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4rlocg/help_planning_to_return_to_college_how_much/,"**Background:**
 
I'm planning to return to school preferably as quick as possible, but I want to do it right, when I initially went to university, I excelled academically, but failed to adapt in every other way, ended up dropping out and addicted to heroin, defaulting on debt (about 12k), and found myself with no family, friends, money or assets. I grew up in a shitty situation, with a functioning addict for a parent, and no family members who had gone to college to help, I went in to it blind and that contributed a lot to why things didn’t work out, this time around I need to be much more prepared, and have been doing my research, but there are still a few things I’m unsure about/need help with.

I've spent the last few years getting clean and rebuilding, paid off all my debt, started rebuilding my credit (back up to 660s and hopefully maybe 700 by the end of the year)saved up an emergency fund ($5k). And feel like I'm in a generally good position to return to school full time.


**My info:**

- 23 M Florida
- Goal: Attend a state university, hopefully, without working, while minimizing debt as much as possible, with the goal of finding stable employment, paying off my debt as quickly as possible, and then enjoying a middle class life.
- Intended Major: Accounting
- Credit Score: 660 (should be at least a little higher, hopefully 700 by the time I would take out loans – a year from now)
- Emergency fund: $5,000
- Debt: $0
- School left: 3 years (four if I get accepted into the honors/joint - MAcc program). The first year (this fall &amp; spring) I will still be working) so I’ll be attempting to cover 2 years with financial aid.
- Estimated Cost of Attendance: FAU Off-Campus $23,834 (including tuition $5,432).
- EFC: 0
- Pell grant award: $5,815
- Federal Loan Eligibility: $12,500 total (up to $5,500 subsidized)

**Questions:**

1. I’m planning for worst case scenario, if I receive no scholarships/further aid, how much should I be willing to take out in loans for the last two years of school?

2. How much can I take out? My understanding is you can received loans for up to the school’s official cost of attendance, less any grants and scholarships, is this correct? (In this case $23,834 – $5,815, leaving me with 18,019, $12.500 of which would be federal loans, and after that I would need to look at private loans?)

3. If I end up needing private loans, how do I go about looking for those/finding the best deal?



4. ~~If I do keep working while going to school, my goal is to find a job that offers tuition reimbursement for part-time employees, how does tuition reimbursement factor into financial aid? My understanding is it lowers your loan eligibility by counting as financial aid similar to grants and scholarships?~~

5. ~~My Pell grant will cover tuition, does this mean I can’t use tuition reimbursement, or could I just use tuition reimbursement first to cover courses, then apply the remaining Pell grant money to rent/food/etc.?~~


6. How do scholarships, grants, tuition reimbursement and loans affect taxes?

7. With scholarships, I can receive up to the amount of cost of attendance, and apply them for rent/food whatever, unless the scholarship specifically states otherwise?

8. If I receive a scholarship that is say only for tuition, can I apply it too that, and then use Pell grant money for other expenses, or is Pell applied first?

9. Receiving more aid via grants &amp; scholarships affects my financial aid In that it lowers my loan eligibility, but it shouldn’t affect my EFC &amp; Pell aware correct? If I’m wrong, how do I know how any awards will affect EFC/Pell?

10. Is my emergency fund enough? 

11. My understanding that to be successful post-college, I need to participate in school groups, like the Accounting Honor Society, preferably in a leadership role. To network and attend relevant events on campus. To have at least 1 internship. And to take advantage of the school’s career center resources, interviews, resumes, networking, etc. Lastly, to begin applying for jobs, in the fall of senior year?

In june, the two of them worked hard to scare me and manipulate me into moving back home (saying i was alll alone, it's dangerous, its expensive, natural disasters, etc etc)

I was getting really stressed but I kept positive, because this is my life now, and I'm not moving back home EVER. There is no room for failure.

Now it's July, I found a new sublet. My roommate took me out with her and her friends for the holiday weekend I HAD A BLASSSST!

And today I found out that I have a job offer!!!! (I'm going to formally accept on Friday, but I need to figure out how to negotiate for more pay)

Friday night, I am flying back home (to see my cousins, and ship out the rest of my belongings)

Guys. I AM SOOO F*CKING PROUD OF MYSELF. My employment gift to me is to buy a coffee maker for the apartment :D

The first half of this year was really trying, mentally and emotionally. I stayed home for four long emotionally abusive months after I graduated. The only thing keeping my spirits up is knowing that I'm getting out, and I'm going to be far away, living my life and (hopefully) having a good time.

I've had sleeping problems for years, slight insomnia, sometimes anxiety would hit and keep me up throughout the night. But when I went LC/NC and was physically away from them I started sleeping a nice 8 hours and just being well rested like that was amazing. And I realized somehow, they were the reason that I always had trouble sleeping, all these years. Even last summer, the first time I went NC because I did a summer internship states away that was the FIRST time in my life that I was happy and I slept well (I thought it was because I was working a 40hour a week schedule and the structure agreed w/me).But this whole time my fam was messing me up more than I ever knew.

I'm just really happy, that things are going in a positive direction. I'm really excited about my life. I just wanted to share. I know it's hard seeing a future where things will be different, be better. But you can only get there with determination and refusing to give up (soooo sappy but I totally stand by it haha)"
4rlup5,4,2016-07-06,Should we move out?,bnewlin,DaveRamsey,https://www.reddit.com/r/DaveRamsey/comments/4rlup5/should_we_move_out/,"So my wife and I are approaching our 1 year anniversary. We have been living in my parents basement since marriage. It is a self contained apartment on a separate floor from my parents. The reason for this choice is because I am in school. Next August I will graduate with my bachelors in computer engineering. My wife makes about 24k a year working full time and is doing her last internship this year for her degree in pastry arts which will pay an extra $700/month. I have an internship over the fall which will be full-time until January at $18/HR. My spring semester will cost about 13k which I will be saving most of my internship for. My question would be do we move into a cheap apartment and get out of my parents house or hold on until closer to next year? We could just barely do it. And we wouldn't be able to save much for emergencies. It simply feels horrible and degrading being stuck with my parents :/. They do not mind and there is little conflict between them and us but it would feel great to get out on our own. 

Tldr: my wife and I are both in school with internships. She works full time as well. Paying for school in cash. Should we try to move out even if it will be very tight or hold off until closer to my graduation next year?"
4rlygq,1,2016-07-06,"22[F4M] anywhere- I feel like I'm here weekly, but i still haven't found what I am looking for",jjellyxfishh,r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/4rlygq/22f4m_anywhere_i_feel_like_im_here_weekly_but_i/,"Hi! So before I get to describing myself I want to say that there will be a tl;dr at the end as this post will be a bit long, but I would prefer you read the whole post before responding. 

I would also like to describe what I am looking for. I am looking for a guy between 20 and 25 to chat with. I would really like to avoid the whole receiving a dick pic as an intro to someone so I would also like some one that will not do that. So, I am not very picky about looks, but I am picky about personality. If you aren’t looking to talk a lot, and when I say a lot, I mean it, then I am not the person for you. I like a guy that isn’t afraid to make fun of things and keep the conversation light hearted, however, I am always around to be supportive and comforting too, and I would prefer if you do the same. I am also looking for a guy to chat with, with potential of being more than just friends.

 As for me, personality wise, I can be a bit flirty, but I can also be a bit sarcastic and condescending, maybe even insulting (Although once I am told someone is bothered by something I say, I will not say it anymore. It would make me a complete dick if I didn’t stop lol.), but it’s all in good fun. I can also take jokes really well, maybe play a little ‘yes, and’ with them. I am also not past making fun of myself, or pretending to be overconfident and things like that, because if you can’t make fun of yourself, who can you make fun of? One things that puts people off about me is that I have a very morbid, and inappropriate, sense of humor. I can laugh at almost anything, and it has caused me to lose a lot of friendships. With all that being said, I am also really sensitive, and am always around to be a friend to anyone in need of it. My goal is to make everyone I become friends with feel like they are very important and special, because I know what it is like to not have a friend to talk to, and I don’t want anyone else to feel that way.

When it comes to looks, I am a shorter kinda Hispanic woman (I am not really sure what to label myself when it comes to race or ethnicity.) At 5’2, I still stand out a bit, as my sass levels exceed my height. This may not be apparent when looking at a regular pic of just my face, but I am a bit overweight, and am working on my goal to lose a few (or maybe a bit more) pounds. I wear glasses and have almost shoulder length hair. I also almost always wear jeans and a t shirt, I am far more partial to comfort than I am to looking hot. I can provide pictures of myself once we get talking as well. 

As for things that I do and am interested in, there is a lot of things to list. I am almost always talking about my dogs, or dogs and cats I encounter at work, as I am an intern at a vet clinic, and am hoping to get a job at one soon as a vet tech. If you have any questions about how important spaying, neutering, and vaccinations for your pet are, I will be able to tell you, as I am very passionate about those topics. I love movies, I can pretty much watch movies from any genre, but horror will always be my favorite. There is something about being terrified that will always make me feel great once a movie is over. Another thing I absolutely love is music, I listen to a lot of different thing, but most of my favorite bands/artists are things most people I meet don’t know about. I love to read, at the moment my two favorite authors are Chuck Palahniuk and Joe Hill, but I am getting more into Lovecraft and Stephen King. There is a lot of other things I like and am interested in, but those come out in random conversation.

**tl;dr sarcastic, chubby, vet tech, horror fan needs new friends, possibly more. PM me with a description of yourself and your age, and I will only get back to you if you provide those things, at least. I have kik or we can talk here (although I may take a bit to reply here), so add your info for one or more of those to your PM.**

it's the type of sex that's so full of emotional baggage that it pushes your mutual sex to a whole new level.

It's the guy you dated who's a completely asshole and was a mistake from the get go.  You already broke up multiple times but here you are bouncing on his delicious cock.  You can't stand him, you fucking hate his guts but fuck you love his god damn cock buried inside you.

Here's my pitch for a few ideas that I would love to explore further.

---
**The Better Man**:

I heard a lot about you over the years.  First it was the brilliant new junior coworker that's was working with my husband full of potential and promise.  Then slowly over time as you rose in the ranks it turned from what a great new employee we have to what 'that guy' did, to the 'prick' as he fondly referred to you.  You rose faster then anyone at the company.  My husband is a few years older then me, he's 35 years old.  Now, his once former intern of 25 years is the CEO favorite and is likely to be running the company in a few years.  Jason can't fucking stand you and I.. well I barely met you but frankly I'm just fucking tired of hearing him whine about it.  

I just had a fight with Jason and I'm annoyed with him as it is.  I'm wearing a tight fitting little red dress a few inches shorter then what I'd normally wear at work events.  We're all at the work Christmas party as I finally meet 'Marcus'.  A brilliant young man with a radiant smile who bright eyes that seems to take in everything and everyone in the room yet still are able to rapidly roam over my body and leaving me feeling like he's taken in every inch of my body and approves thoroughly of my gym membership and the work I've been putting into it.

At the same time, I can feel the animosity between Jason and Marcus.  

                              . . . 

A few hours later in the VIP lounge that's empty except for the two of us. My dress is in pieces feeling his mouth on my body, roughly handling me and he calls me a little whore and respond in kind.  Our hot sweaty bodies pressed against one another as he finally pins me against the large glass wall over looking the party.  His young powerful cock slamming into my married pussy fucking me as I look down on the large gathering.. somewhere down there my own husband is looking for me as I'm betraying him.....I can feel Marcus hate for Jason....each thrust making me moan and  beg for more.  Each time I hear him call my husband a waste of space, a worthless prick as he's slamming into me again and again.  Pulling my hair, spanking my ass... he's hurting me and the pain is blissful to both of us.

Hours later... several orgasms later I look at Marcus' naked body.... mmmmm, I don't personally hate him...though he's a cocky little fuck.  One thing I know for sure.  I want him to hate Jason as much as he wants especially if he continues to fuck me like that.  I get up on the conference table spreading my legs for him inviting him in for another go.....



-----------
**Father In Law Version**

I've met 'Marcus' several times over the course of my relationship with Jason.  I heard some of the things he'd tell his son but never really directly to me.  I wasn't good enough for his son.  I would destroy his focus, I was a harlot.  Jason studied law and I've met him in my undergrad years.  His father always thought I was a 'distraction' from the vision he had for his son.  The older senator expected his son to follow in his footsteps.  Marcus is a legend in South Carolina.  He's held his seat as Senator for the past 30 years though at this point he's lost the momentum and is far too old to really think of the presidency as an attainable goal.  He was grooming Jason to become just that.

Jason, he adopted son.  He can swing the black votes coming from a proper African american family with strong values.  His hearth felt story of how he never met his real family and such would bring in the soccer moms and in turn a much of the middle class.  

There was a dream damn it 'till that little redheaded whore came into the picture.  Date the girl, fuck the girl... christ gangbang her and her mom and her entire family if you're into it, but don't fucking Marry her!  You marry for power and for politics not for love.

                                  . . .

 I knew how he felt, I knew Marcus hated me....though I'm still trying to piece the events that led me to this... yet here I am my ass red from the spanking he gave me earlier.  I hear him calling me a whore behind me....his cock slamming into me again as all I am able to say in response is letting out a long and loud moan of delight.   I'm on all 4s sitting on the bed like a good little cum puppy feeling Marcus dick slamming into my 'whoring cunt' again and again.  I can feel his hate for me... his distaste at the 'slut'.  I can feel his hands in my hair pulling me back as he uses me again.  ooooooohhhh....yyyessss harder ""Daddy""....

I feel like I am the stupidest intern in my class, from being an all star med student. I feel like I can't do enough and I'm always forgetting something. I feel overwhelmed. 

My cointern is on nights,  I'm all alone managing the service when my upper levels are in surgery. My PA to help the service on Monday and Tuesday is on vacation. Yesterday I didn't even finish discharges until 4 pm. The only reason I got out at 1915 was because the night intern (my partner)  helped with the last few notes. Feel overwhelmed. Even with my great medical students I'm swamped. 

Today my alarm didn't go off. I woke up at 0548 instead of 0400. Rounds start at 0600 and it takes me 20 minutes to get it. Today I have PA coverage to help with all the work. Overall today went much better until afternoon rounds. I missed a few things on patient care. I had to stay to fix my problems, I didn't get out until 8pm. My chief said the service is operating at 70%. I asked my pgy4 for feedback and she I'm doing well, I'm improving rapidly, and clearly care. Keep up the good work. My upper levels and attendings are great, compassionate, and want to see me progress. 

I cried in the elevator, I cried to my car. My emotions got to me. 

We all have bad days, we all have bad weeks. Ebbs and flows. It gets better."

I've been lurking here for a couple months. I can relate to a lot of your issues/posts and am really grateful to live in an age where access to these firsthand stories is possible. 

I've been seeing a therapist since February and have started to accept that my mom had a personality disorder and I will never be able to have a healthy relationship with her. I cycle between feeling sorry for myself, trying to convince myself I'm just like her and being very angry.

Tonight I'm angry. So angry. 
 
I have so few memories of my childhood that when people ask me questions about what I did, what I was like etc I grasp at air to come up with an acceptable answer that doesn't ""out"" my horrible life experiences to people I don't feel comfortable sharing with. 

When I was 10, she took me for a consult for a medical procedure. Sorry if this is TMI, but I think this showcases her disordered thinking. She wanted me to have a cosmetic procedure done for my vagina so that I can have ""better sex"" when I'm older. There's nothing physically wrong with me down there at all - I just don't look like a porn star - and this memory set the stage for my insecurities about that part of my body.

She let so many strange internet men stay with us, our house was a revolving door of these men as well as troubled family members. I was never safe. 

When I was younger (no recollection of age but way too young for this info) she told me that my father, who had never been a part of my life, harassed her and tried to get to miscarry from stress because he didn't want me and wanted her to abort. I should add that most of the child support money from him did not benefit me. It went toward her cigarette addiction and her daily fix of junk food from Dunkin Donuts - the only meal she eats every day. Oh it also went toward the monthly payments for her new and unnecessary hybrid car when I was in college while I was paying her back every dime with my limited work-study income toward my inexpensive civic that she strong armed me into leasing. 

She scapegoated my brother and called him ""horrible"" and ""awful"" regularly. He had anger issues, smoked a lot of weed and recklessly partied. He was 20 years older than me and was immature emotionally, but he showed me the only real love I had in my early life. He died when i was 10 and I was told by my mom that he just fell asleep at the wheel on the highway. That's simply impossible in my mind. I suspect he was driving drunk and/or intentionally set out to hurt himself. And she caused this.

She destroyed my brother's life. 

When I was home for an internship at age 21, she came into my room after doing my taxes (I don't let her touch my finances or know anything about my life anymore) and demanded that I lend her $2k because she needed a bail out for her bills. I told her I didn't feel comfortable with it and felt she was crossing a line and she stormed out, returning shortly after with an Excel spreadsheet detailing the expenses she paid for when I was young. Included were physical therapy for a sprained ankle and basic necessities, tuition for a private school she chose to send me to and other items that indicate she was a parent. Congratulations, you crazy b*tch you're a parent to a child with needs. I vented by writing extremely angry words on paper and later found the paper in the trunk of my car. I didn't place it there so she must have to shame me. 

When I was about 13 years old I got fed up with her verbal abuse of ""you're horrible"" ""you're so nasty"" ""what is wrong with you"" that I screamed back ""then why did you even have sex"" because I was taught by my super strict private school and her that sex was evil and only good for having kids. So in my own immature way I was asking why did you want me. Her response was to humiliate me, making me have a sit down lunch with my basketball coach at school who guilted me into apologizing to my mom for what I said and told me I wouldn't be able to play basketball anymore if I didn't. This sport was the only source of pride and validation I had for myself and she dangled it in front of me with guilt. 

I have so many other stories I could write a novel. 

God I hate her.

First post so here's my attempt at a haiku:

Little paws, you look
At me with your green cat eyes
Kneading me with love

4rm5ia,1,2016-07-06,"Alone, homesick, and scared",GiverOfPotatoes,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4rm5ia/alone_homesick_and_scared/,"First off, I've been diagnosed with depression, and I had been on antidepressants for most of my life, up until a year ago when I stopped taking them. Three weeks ago I went to a doctor and got back on the antidepressants, but I'm not sure if they've been working.

I'm graduating from college next spring, and that terrifies me. I don't think I'm ready to be on my own, away from my parents, or being alone for extended periods of time. This summer I got an internship in another state, about 3.5 hours away, and things have been awful ever since I walked out the front door of my parents' house.

Every day for the first two weeks I would get back to my apartment from work and cry for over an hour, only being able to stop myself by becoming too hungry or because I cried myself out. My parents came up the first weekend to bring me some things I had left at home, and we had fun while they were here. Every time there was a break in conversation or something happening, I would think about how little time I had with them that weekend, counting down the hours until they left. On the drive back to my apartment I broke down and started crying in front of them. That went on for an hour, with my mom trying to help calm me down and my dad not really knowing what to do since he doesn't understand what depression is like or why I'm feeling the way I'm feeling. They both told me that I would be able to come home any weekend I want, and so far there's only been one weekend that I didn't go home (out of 5 weekends).

Every time I would go home, we would do the normal things we do around the house, watch TV, play some games occasionally. Just like when I lived with them for the past few summers. And it was great. I love being around them, even if we're not doing anything. But every Sunday, I would start counting down the hours until I had to leave again. Just before I leave, I always break down and cry. Last weekend, I convinced myself that I should just quit my internship and move back home, as I already have enough money to pay off the last month of rent. The first thing I did when I went downstairs on Monday was tell my mom that I wasn't going back and just curled up on the couch for the rest of the day. Towards dinner time, my dad started telling me that I needed to get up and go take a shower. I kept telling him that I wasn't leaving because I didn't want to go back and suffer more. This discussion ended with me yelling ""screw you, I'm not leaving!"" at him and me storming off to my room. I felt horrible that I had yelled at him, and quickly went back downstairs to apologize. In the end I went back to my job, and I've felt awful ever since. The most recent drive back to my apartment involved me getting really angry at no one in particular and just screaming in my car as I drove. Yelling ""Fuck you"" at anyone who I drove past, because what does it matter? They can't hear me. I felt like I needed to hit something or break something, so I hit my side window. I wanted to keep hitting it, but I didn't know if it could get to the point of breaking, so I went back to screaming.

I'll call my mom a few times a week just to talk to her, and vent about how I've been feeling. Most of these chats I've broken down crying into the phone while she tells me that I'll be fine and that I need to stop. I feel so awful that I'm dumping all of this on her, and apologize every time, but she always says it's ok. I always ask her if I'm stressing her out or bringing her down with me, but she always tells me I'm not. I don't believe her, but I don't know who else to talk to. I've tried going to a therapist a few times, but it just feels like a waste of money to me. I don't want to bring my mom down with me, but I always feel so much better when I'm talking to her, or even just sitting there not talking and holding a silent phone up to my ear, just knowing that she's there if I need to talk. I don't want to keep dumping everything on her, which is why I'm writing this post, but I just need someone to talk to about it.

It's gotten to the point where I'm begging her to let me stay with them after I graduate because I can't stand the thought of not seeing my parents every day after graduation. I've thought about how little I'll get to see them after I graduate and get a job who knows where, and it terrifies me. She always tells me that I can't live with them because they want me to be able to have my own life. I always tell her that I don't want my own life, that I just want to stay with my parents because I don't want to be without them. I don't even know if that's my actual feelings or the depression talking anymore. I've talked about dropping out of school so that I would have no choice but to live with them, and I've thought about different ways that I could get myself in a situation that they'd have no choice but to let me live with them forever. My mom tells me that I can just get a job in the same area, and that I can live in the same town as them, but it wouldn't be the same.

The past few days have been pretty bad. I've had thoughts like ""I hate my life"" or ""I want to die"". I don't think I have any intention of actually hurting myself, because then I would never see my parents again, but it's just as scary as if I was serious. I've been repeatedly snoozing my alarm until it's an hour after I was supposed to get up, and I'm still so tired. Last night I had trouble falling asleep.

Today after talking to my mom (no venting, just talking about what I've been up to and what they've been doing), I got really frustrated again and wanted to break something. I took an empty hanger out of my closet and just snapped it in two. I kept snapping the pieces until they were too small to break any more.

The guy has helped so many people on his show with their problems on and off air. Howard actually called Hank's mother to try and set up a rehab he could go to before deciding it was futile. Artie has repeatedly said Howard gave him the offer to take as much time as he needed to get better and come back whenever he is ready but Artie blew it. Artie kept pretending he wanted to stop. The calls from rehab high off his ass and lying about going to the therapist Howard recommended to him. Robin kept bringing up how Artie was lying and Howard always said he has to believe him, he's his friend and he's naive with people he loves. Howard is a really caring person and there is plenty of stories of interns who said he was nothing but thankful for their work off air. KC is another great example with how much he pushed him to stick with his therapy and taking his medication. Howard even got Dominic to get him some help because they cared about him so much. I mean Howard was completely fine with Stuttering John and his decision to leave with more money he just didn't appreciate how he hid it for so long and wouldn't admit he didn't want to stay. Howard took him out to Vegas to celebrate and SJ was so paranoid he couldn't accept Howard was happy for him but just mad at Leno. It's completely SJ's fault for being resentful. I also know the fact Dominic released the story about Artie's suicide to the press, it became the reason he won't have him back on the show because he cares about Artie. Maybe Howard feels afraid he wished he did more to help Artie and that it scares him he almost lost one of his best friends and partner on radio of ten years. Howard gets burned by so many people he really called his friends: Cabbie, Andy Dick, Bob Levy, BoBo, Dominic, Gilbert (he was caught bad mouthing Howard in the 90s), Jackie, Gange too! The guy must be sensitive and a good person in real life."

They drive me insane. I hate being around other people for 8+ hours straight five days a week.


I always feel like I am under pressure to move faster, and ultimately I end up losing focus after I can't solve problems as fast as I want to.


I am unsure if this is because programming really isn't for me or if I am just weak, but I just hate 8 hour days...


I am sure I'm not alone in this. How do I make it manageable?

He accepted me despite my past, my depression, and my family issues since he also had similar experiences. All this made me confident that our relationship would last a long time, so I was willing to truly commit to him. 


After the semester ended, we were comfortable with our relationship so we decided to try a long distance relationship so we could work at our internships and reunite at the end of the three month summer. Initially we would have at least a quick conversation via some form of social media, but as time wore on, he acted more and more distant until he didn't even read my messages. I began considering asking him about ""seeing others"" until our physical separation ended, just to take the pressure off of our relationship, since he clearly wasn't into keeping up with me anymore. I knew his work excuses were complete bullshit because I worked twice as much as him while I had classes, and he always was posting snapchat stories about parties. His interactions with me didn't seem right, but I didn't react in any way because I believed he would eventually tell me what was wrong. I did however talk to his close friend about my unease over the fact that he hadn't contacted me in so long. Every time I voiced some distaste about the situation to his friend, my ex would get back to me within SECONDS, meaning he clearly kept in touch with other people despite his claims of being ""too busy and tired"" to respond to me. This comforted me despite being proof of his lies because I truly believed he still cared enough about me to try to quell my unease. I kept chalking up his actions to him being a dumb guy who didn't really know what girls needed.  


When he finally talked to me for the first time in a few weeks, he wanted to break up. Being apart forever was not something that even crossed my mind because he was ready for me to meet his parents, and move in with him in August. I don't think we've ever had a serious fight, just silly and short arguments that ended in laughing and sex.


The breakup was over text because ""he was too busy to get somewhere private"". I was understanding while it was happening because he was so apologetic, but in the aftermath I feel so empty. He provided me with no real reasons for leaving me other than ""it wasn't working out as planned"", and he just kept apologizing for ""letting the relationship fall apart"". Afterward, mutual friends told me that he felt really bad about it. Though I don't think that means he feels bad for doing it, just that he had to do it to me. I honestly have no idea why he wanted to break up. He claimed it wasn't about other girls, and that he wasn't seeing anyone at all. I'm absolutely blindsided by this situation. It happened so quickly that I still don't really think it has set it. I was ready to ""take a break"" from the relationship, so I guess in my mind it feels inevitable that we get back together, although clearly that's not what he said at all.


I know we have to meet again in August to figure out our living situation. Is there a chance to rekindle things when we get back to school? I honestly don't even know what event/action spurred this and it's driving me crazy thinking about what I could have done. 


**tl;dr : Ex-boyfriend and I had a very close &amp; strong relationship, but he slowly grew distant over the summer break despite the fact that he was always the one to pursue/want more from me. What can I do when we reunite in August to win him back?**

I want to decide on a path because it is about time to prepare for interviews.

I don't like web dev, QA, devops roles. I had internship in latter two and tried web dev on my own.

My favorite courses were computer architecture, operating systems, somewhat lower level ones. Now, they were also harder and I am not the brightest student but did good enough and enjoyed the challenge. I also am trying to delve into mobile dev and like it a lot more than web dev.

The problem is that my aspiration is to get away from cubicle farms one day. That means freelancing, being a digital nomad working remotely etc. That is impossible without several years of experience in real world and that is fine by me. I found that most remote workers actually do web dev mostly and I don't think that my disdain for it is going to help.

Hence, I'd have to choose between going into something like web dev/mobile to gain experience and then travel and work after a few years, or forget travelling and go for subject areas that interest me and be stuck in a cubicle.

That is the way I see it. Do you have any wise advice? I am young and stupid and know nothing about how real life works in IT world, especially with my aspirations."

I want to play a girl who is 18, give or take a couple years. I want someone else to play a man who is older than that. That's it! But there are so many possibilities! Here are the ones I've been thinking about today (for most of them, I could be the one who comes on to you or you could be the aggressor).

* I'm a babysitter and you're a single guy or married man who drives me home or whose wife is out of town or gets blitzed on their date and passes out.
* We're neighbors and you see me changing through the window or laying out by the pool or working in the garden or walking home.
* You're my mom's new boyfriend or my older sister's boyfriend or husband.
* I'm at a party, maybe a college party, or my parents have a party with their friends and one of them finds me hiding out in my room.
* I'm an exchange student staying at your house for the year.
* I think I want to get into porn and I see your ad.
* I get into a club for the first time with my fake ID and you're there dancing or bartending or bouncing.
* You're my teacher or principal or professor.
* I'm an intern and you're the office Don Juan or the big boss who expects his perks or you're the janitor and catch me misbehaving on company time.
* I go on a college visit and find out what really happens on campus.
* You're the school librarian and catch me fooling around with my boyfriend, which is totally against the rules.
* I'm helping wash cars for the team fundraiser in my new bikini.
* You're the coach and there isn't room for me on the team, or I'm the star and also the last one out of the showers.
* I'm at the city pool with my friends and you're there with your girlfriend or wife , or maybe you're just there to perv out on the girls hanging out at the pool.
* I always walk home from school through your neighborhood in my skirt and tank top, or you own a convenience store that I often stop in.
* I'm a waitress at one of those restaurants that only hires women and advertises skimpy uniforms.
* I'm a stripper and you're the owner I audition with or a regular who takes a shine to me or a new guy with a lot of money to throw around.

Honestly, there are more, but this is getting ridiculous. Like I said, I've been thinking about it all day. I'm definitely open to other ideas too! But I'm not at all into: bondage, pain, incest, and toilet stuff.

I'm not really into celebs, but I do want to make you happy, so pick one from each of the following categories:
* Race: white, hispanic, asian, black, or mixed
* Hair: blonde, brown, black, or purple
* Hair: short or long
* Body: petite, athletic, or plump
* Boobs: strawberries, plums, apples, or small melons
* Attitude: mostly innocent or mostly naughty

I'm already kind of worked up, so for this one I want to know what the situation is, like how we know each other and how we got into this situation, but I want us to start around the time that it's about to get serious. Maybe we just met, or maybe you've been softening me up for a while, let me know.

I know I'm asking a lot from you, and I'm kind of sorry, but I'm also not because I know what I want and I really hope someone can help me come to a shuddering conclusion tonight.

So if your first message could include what our relationship is (from the long list above or your own dirty mind), your choices for what I look like (from the shorter list above), and your character's name and description, that would be lovely! Mwah!"

I've been looking at internships for the fall semesters and had some questions that maybe those of you with more internship experience in the city can help answer:

1) So I have no work experience in the field of my major (econ). I had one previous internship that was completely unrelated and research experience in econ (but I'm not looking to go to graduate school or anything, so looking for internships.) My question is, with only some foundational and intermediate college courses in econ, how does one go about getting that first internship in their field? What do employers look for here?

2) Has anyone ever tried working during the school year? I know this to be one of the benefits of going to college in the city, that school year internships are supposed to be less competitive. But looking at some of the requirements of job postings, some of them are asking for ridiculous hours for part time (at least to me), usually 2 full days per week, or even 3 full days per week. I'm taking 18 credits next semester and I can drop this to 16, but regardless that seems like a pretty huge commitment in addition to academic work. Has anyone tried this? How hectic was your day-to-day, and did your social life suffer/health/sanity at all?

3) Just on the time frame of things, should I be worried if I'm unable to land an internship for next semester? I applied for a bunch for this past summer and did not hear back from any employer, so I'm starting to worry a bit as to whether I will lag behind, especially as I have so far had no related work experience.

4rncbn,1,2016-07-07,Need some advice to keep me on track with college,OriginalWF,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4rncbn/need_some_advice_to_keep_me_on_track_with_college/,"Hey folks, I'm relatively new here to reddit, and from what I've seen on this subreddit A LOT of people ask for advice on what major to choose, so I'm sorry that this is another one of those.

I bounced around a lot. When I first got into college, I started at a community college thinking I would be a police officer. After getting married, I decided I didn't want to endanger myself or my family with my career choice and switched to Business. After working as a tech at Staples, I realized I loved helping people and working with computers, so I switched to CS. After a semester of learning that I like the hardware side of things more, I switched to Computer Engineering. After a semester of realizing I really don't like coding, I switched to Electrical engineering, which is where I am now. 

Shortly after I switched to EE, I was offered an internship at the college I attend basically doing IT for the Civil Engineering. I really love this job. I get to help people and work with computers all day.

I was offered a full-time job at the university to do maintenance on servers and basically do what I've been doing for years but for more money. I have a child now and can't work fulltime while going to school, nor do I have the dedication to do so, so I turned it down. 

I seriously considered taking it though, as I would be comfortable doing this for the rest of my life. This stuff just clicks with me and I find it fun to do for hours on end. The problem I'm having is that I have no experience with EE, only stories from a few ME in my family. I don't know if I will like the profession, and there isn't anywhere near me I could shadow someone. 

My wife advises that I continue with school and graduate, and if I don't like EE, I will be overqualified for an IT job and could probably easily get one. My issue is that if I enjoy what I'm doing, why shouldn't I start working and get going early.

I know what I am giving up, as network engineers and the like make about 45-60k in my area, but I could work up to an IT manager which would net me about 100k depending on where I work. Whereas with EE I would start at about 80k and go up to around 120k.

I would like some discussion about what the ups and downs of each decision may be, as well as some stories if anyone out there is an EE. Thanks a lot in advance!

Sorry about the wall of text, I figured I needed to get the whole story and honestly this just felt good to write out.

tl;dr BS in EE or jump straight into work?"
4rndg8,20,2016-07-07,I got an offer! but I am not here to brag,oh_wow_i_did_it,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/4rndg8/i_got_an_offer_but_i_am_not_here_to_brag/,"everyone in any actuarial group says to maintain a good gpa, have sound technical skills, pass exams, have an internship or two, and great communication skills all while in college. but to some of us, that's not possible. we find out about the profession too late, dont have a good gpa, dont have any technical skills, zero exams, NO mathematical background, and/or no experience. 


i'm posting to say to those who don't think they can land an entry level position that it's ok. just keep working. i didnt have a good gpa, knew little excel, had no exams out of college. just a degree. i found an unrelated job out of school. lost that job. i landed another job in a different industry that had actuaries and from there, developed technical skills while also passing exams. it's been 4 years since i first decided to pursue an actuarial career. there have been bumps and bruises, but damn it feels good. this isn't the final destination, but it's a start to a career as an actuary. 


while i dont have actuarial experience yet, i did notice a few things that may help those looking to break into the profession.

- dont be discouraged if you're not the ideal candidate. not all of us are. acknowledge your weaknesses and work on them. things like gpa if you have already graduated can't be improved. but your technical skills, social skills, etc. can be improved. i have seen people with 5 exams on numerous attempts, low gpa, and minimal social skills land EL jobs. 

- pass exams on the first try with high scores. the verdict on whether a 6 is really the best score seems to be split, but if i had to do it again, i would pass w/ as high of a score as possible. every interview i have had asked for exam scores and number of attempts. try to pass with flying colors on the first try, especially if your gpa is low. 

- looking for an immediate actuarial role may not be the best way to approach the job search. try applying to a different role within the company. ideally, the company would have several actuarial teams with different functions. if you're initially struggling to land an actuarial role, something must be lacking. gpa? technical skills? experience? i found that a lot of that is overlooked when transferring internally within a company. i've been told that gpa is never asked for during an internal transfer candidate. i am not sure if this applies to all companies, but it wouldnt hurt. look for jobs that work with a lot of data. anything to do with reporting, modeling, or finance should be a good start. pass exams while working. 

- network. this isn't to say go out and meet people and tell them you want to be an actuary. that may not be your style. but when you are in a relevant field, you work a lot with others. work hard. talent recognizes talent and when you work hard, it shows. you never know who you might be working with and who they might know. that person you once did a project with a year ago may have a friend at a consulting firm who is hiring. also, working hard never looks bad when it comes to performance reviews and getting recognized. guess what? good performance reviews look good when transferring too. 

- keep at it. you might be discouraged at the lack of responses and all the people bragging on AO and r/actuary that they got jobs, but guess what? you can too. when you've applied to many actuarial positions, a lot of the same jobs come up time and time again. read the job description and see what you can learn. if it's a role in reinsurance, research and learn what it is. that way you can actually have a conversation about it. dont be a downer in interviews, dont be desperate, and dont be discouraged. 


i considered myself a long shot to become an actuary purely based on the questions i had to answer about my background during initial phone interviews. but this is the field i wanted to pursue. i know i can do the work, i just needed to land a position. i've been browsing r/actuary and AO for a while now and anytime someone shares good news about their job offer, it was discouraging. but what can you do? in the words of the famous American musician Rihanna ""work, work, work, work, work""

tl;dr - screw what people say here. if you want to become an actuary, work hard and do it. "
4rogb5,98,2016-07-07,Are you becoming more perverted?,a_namenooneknows,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/4rogb5/are_you_becoming_more_perverted/,"I am. I'm not quite sure if it is because of the lack of sex, but I feel it is. I know that my bedroom is not as dead as most of you, we have sex 3 or 4 times a month, mostly around her ovulation period (that's the only time when she seems like she enjoys sex - she cums fast, sometimes more than once).

But the thing is that I spend most of the month wanting and being rejected, usually a 15 to 20 days of dryspell every month (except a few months where unicorns come alive and we have a lot of sex - my last submission was about that. Spoiler alert: her libido is gone again). So I'm horny all the time. And my mind starts to wander. 

It's like I'm always on the edge, I'm always thinking of sex and I feel like the sex is my mind is getting kinkier and kinkier. And I feel like I'm checking out women around me more and more. In a perverted way that I'm afraid they'll notice.

There's a new intern in the office. Hot as fuck. I look at her walking in her overly tight white jeans and I daydream about sticking my head in that ass tongue first. She smells like sex. She will catch me looking and at her and will smile at me. Her cleavage is pressing hard against her breasts everyday. She wears bright red lipstick, her hair is a fake blonde down to her waist. I know her type, I fucked that type when I was in my early 20's. I want to slap her while we fuck because I know she likes it. But that might be all in my head, because I'm a pervert.

My wife works around here. Yesterday we had lunch together and the hot intern was having lunch in the same place. We went out at the same time and I compared them both. My wife is gorgeous, so much more beautiful than the intern. My wife knows how to wear make up in a way that it looks like she's not wearing any. She has such a classic beaty and dress classy too. She's a woman. The intern is still a girl, even though she's probably past 25. The intern looks like she's fresh out of college and didn't learn yet that looking good doesn't mean showing her body. Showing her body in that white jeans so tight that I can see her underwear. And I wanna bite that ass.

Me and my wife are a few steps behind her and I'm trying my hardest not to look at that ass. My wife is so much more beautiful. But she doesn't like even when I just grab her ass. My wife has the most beautiful smile. But she won't suck me off. The blond intern would. She would swallow all my cum. At least in my perverted mind.

My wife will only do missionary. The intern would ride me and whisper in my ear ""Don't cum yet, I want more."". My wife just says ""Can you finish a little quicker?"".

Most of you in here misses the bond, the affection, the closeness. The intimacy. I'm past that point. I just want to fuck. I just want to bite, to pull her hair down, press her face against my cock, press her breasts against my face, have a quickie in the bathroom, a blowjob in the movies, fingering in the middle of a club, fucking on a dark alley. All these things now I only think about it with strangers, because I know I can't have them at home. And I'm afraid it shows. 

The intern might not even be as slutty as I picture her. But I'm a pervert. Maybe she doesn't even like the attention, maybe she's just too young to know how to be pleasant without flirting. Maybe she's not even flirting (but that tight jeans!). My perverted mind doesn't know the difference anymore.

Maybe now I've become that dirty old man that checks out all women around him and everyone is disgusted by him. The degenerate that knows how easy it would be to make a 25 year old fall for him and thinks that it would be nice to have control over the relationship. I would play with the emotions of someone who's just starting in the ""Real World"" and in my deviant mind this sounds like a good idea.

I don't even know where I was going with this text. Just venting I guess? Maybe reading this will make me ashamed of my thoughts and I can refrain myself from checking out the intern's ass. But each day, I feel more like a pervert."
4rp80c,0,2016-07-07,What to study for Actuarial Science?,joshmo62,AskStatistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/4rp80c/what_to_study_for_actuarial_science/,"Hello all, I have an issue.

I'm currently an undergrad, in my final year at university, double majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. I'm looking at career paths of either becoming an actuary, or a software developer. I'm currently in an IT internship and I've decided that I don't want to take the development route, which means I'm looking at becoming an actuary.

The problem is, the math program doesn't have many courses for statistics, simply a basic overview of it, going as far as t-tests, Chi-Square and Binomial Distribution. From what I've seen in Actuarial certification sample tests, there's much more to Stats than just these simple subjects, meaning I have to teach myself things (not that big of a problem)

So basically, what do I need to study in order to be a competent actuary, and where can I study it? Thank you!"

I know I love everything tech related, but I'm not exactly sure what I want to do in college or for the next 10 years. And I also wanted to know what some stuff (Internships, Jobs, etc) that I could do now to help narrow my path.

FYI, I like math but I suck at it.

4rpnlv,1,2016-07-07,"My [21F] GF broke up with me [20M] while she was out of town for over a month with no communication, and now she's back.",ivebeenjammin,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4rpnlv/my_21f_gf_broke_up_with_me_20m_while_she_was_out/,"Prepare for a long post.

My girlfriend (we'll call her Ann) and I were dating for about three and a half years, and she left at the end of May to go on an exciting internship about five hours away from our college town. She has a dog (we will call him Max) that has taken a liking to me since he was a puppy. So she asked me to dogsit Max for her while she was away.

Her and I were in a bit of a rut recently, and we were arguing more frequently leading up to her departure, except for the very end. We're both hoping to graduate within the next year, we have responsibilities through out student organizations, and we work around around 25 hours a week during the school semester. During summer it could be 30+ hours. Things that her and I have struggled with in the past include **trust**; I had big time trust issues, even though she never gave me a reason to distrust her, and **communication**; she would hardly tell me what was actually on her mind, and would frequently avoid talking things out. We often just handled our tensions through sexual interaction/relief. However, we never doubted (at the time, to my knowledge) the security of our relationship.

During her internship, she had no cell phone service and only occasionally had wifi, so we would talk through iMessage. One night, about halfway through June, her and I have a pointless argument, and she comes to the conclusion that it is best if we just don't talk for a few days. Again, this frustrated me, because she was conditioning herself even further to avoid talking things out. I thought Ann was being unfair, and I became upset and naturally worried. 

Whenever she finally texted me a few days later, I woke up to her saying that she didn't think it would work out. I panicked, cried, and she was apathetic to it all. I was upset with myself for reacting so emotionally, and I had a hard time controlling it. I called in sick to work and spent the day hanging with the dog, and I surprisingly got a call from her later that day. **She said she felt bad, did not know what she actually wanted, said that we were still together, and wanted to work things out when she got back.** I took her at her word, and would occasionally text her to see how she was doing, but she wouldn't respond. I sent her some flowers and a few love letters, since I know she has always liked those kinds of things. A few days later, **she calls me back and says that she is upset that I am still even talking to her, sending her gifts, and goes back to saying that we are not together, and that she does not want me to communicate with her at all until she gets back, when we work things out.** Boy, that was really hard to swallow, especially since she was still going to be gone for another three weeks at that point. 

I figured she needed space, and I fought through the pain. Every moment, I spent thinking of Ann, and I was constantly reminded of her by Max (who is a really sweet dog) and other things. I developed some severe anxiety, and was letting the emotions get the best of me. I sought out a counselor, who has since helped me reflect and reveal certain aspects of my personality to myself. He was very helpful in helping me approach every day's unique challenges. I was also prescribed a medication by a doctor at the same clinic, and it has helped relax me, even though the heartbreak was still there. I began working out at the start of the summer and kicked it into high gear after the breakup. Since the start of June, I have lost 24 pounds and continue to go by a daily routine and diet. I also had some good moral support from close friends. Only very few people knew, since I wanted to respect Ann's privacy.

All of these things - the weight loss, the peace seeking, the medication, the support from my friends, the personal growth - gave me confidence that I was becoming who I needed to be, no matter what the future had in store. I tried to rid myself of every toxic aspect about how I treat others and truly believe that I am a better, stronger person now. The last few days leading up to her return were exciting! I was confident, stronger, and wanted to be prepared for whatever decision Ann eventually would come to. 

She got back into town in the early morning, when she picked up the dog from my apartment. She looked amazing, and still does. I helped her move everything over to her place and then had to leave for a summer class exam. I asked her to lunch so that we could catch up and talk about the internship and what we have been up to. 

Whenever we met up, I was somewhat speechless at being able to see her again. Butterflies were in my stomach, and we caught up and had some laughs together. Whenever we got into talking about the relationship, things took a turn. I was very patient with what she had to say. But I was heartbroken whenever **she admitted that she lied to me whenever she said that she wanted to work things out, and tried to apologize for going back on the promise that she made.** I understood that she was hurt and in a weird place in her life, but she said **she honestly didn't care how I felt, and that she didn't want to risk giving me a chance.** She still wants to be friends, and knows that there is a possibility that things could turn romantic again. She says part of her still loves me, and she likes how much I have grown as a person. She said ""it sucks, because you're a great guy now - the guy that I deserve and wanted to be with. But right now, I don't know how I feel, and I need time. I just know that I am happy being single and independent."" I honestly really like her sense of independence, and I *really* like that she is figuring herself out and finding happiness, *but* I want to show her what we could be. The only thing is, I'm having a hard time doing this friend thing, and I have to suffer in silence. The anxiety and sadness is coming back hard, and even though I am more prepared to fight it, it seems like I am losing a battle right now. It also seems like anything I say is pushing her away. She is unkind now and apathetic towards how I feel. 

I'm in a tough spot right now, and I am willing to compromise and do the friend thing, but what I ultimately want is for us to be in love again. I never expected this to be fixed within a few conversations, and I know that it will take time if it will ever happen again. I don't have anyone I can talk to about it, and I recognize that she is being rude and betraying by going back on her promises. It is hard to believe anything she says now, but despite it all, I still love her, and I love to see her laugh and smile. I love her bubbly side, and her free spirit, *but* **I just feel so bad that I've wronged someone so much to the point that all they can associate me with is negativity, and I want to right my wrongs.** I can't say sorry enough to her. I'm going to try to do the friend thing, but I don't know what else to do. Please help and provide insight. 

**tl;dr**: Girlfriend was out of town for over a month and broke up with me halfway through her trip. I have grown positively as a person in a very healthy direction. She said she promised that we would work things out when she got back, but now that she is here, she says that she lied about all of that and has since changed her mind. She wants to be friends, but she doesn't care how I feel, and has a hard time associating me with anything that could be positive. I want to give her time and space, but I have to worry about my own well-being too."

I've been developing with Java for a few years now and it's what I'm learning in school as well. 


Just last week, the front end developers told me they want me to use PHP now and want me to use a framework called ""laravel"" simply because it's a very popular framework. The only problem with that is I've NEVER used PHP, I've been developing with Java for around 4 years now, and I've already done a lot of development in Java.


I tried to tell them I'd prefer to stick to Java but they insist this is a better path to take. My questions for all of you are:

 * Should I simply scrap my current work, learn PHP and go forth with their preference of PHP?

 * If not, how can I convince them to let me develop the back end using Java? 


I'm simply frustrated as I've already put a lot of effort into the Java back end and looking for some guidance on the situation. I do not mind learning a new language as I love broadening my knowledge as an aspiring developer. I'm simply not comfortable with PHP whatsoever, so attempting to develop using PHP in an enterprise application seems like a recipe for failure.

**EDIT -** This is a startup, so there's no infrastructure in place. We could choose any language to develop in but they're insisting on PHP after already letting me develop for around a month in Java."

A week ago i was supposed to go see my (Now ex)girlfriend who has an internship on Ibiza, three days before i was supposed to go she called me and basically told me that she lost all her feelings for me and didn't want me to come over anymore, i was heartbroken, i didn't really see it coming...

We talked on the phone that night, i got pretty angry because i felt used, i wrote 30 ""Open when"" letters that i sent to her in those 3 months, and just over €600 worth of presents, stayed up late everyday so we could call for a bit, was there when she would call in the middle of the night because everything went shitty over there. so hearing that she basically hasn't felt anything for me since she left (On the internship i even got her) made me pretty sad/mad.

We talked about how we were going to continue, she always told me she wouldn't want to be friends anymore after we broke up, however when we called she said she'd want to stay friends and still see eachother, which i was fine with since i'd rather have a good friend who i can trust than somebody i have to see and basically ignore. However now we're a week down the road and all i got is a text where she said she just wanted to tell me she loves me after i texted her my cat got ran over the day after we broke up (Which was pretty confusing)


I've met a girl at my intership (Kim) who was here for about 2 weeks, we did some things together like bowling and swimming and for that was all innocent and fun, she left and we didn't really keep contact.

Now about 3 weeks ago she came back for someone elses goodbye party, and before that she wanted to go swimming with me, however i talked about it with my girlfriend (Eva) and she didn't like it.

Forward a day later and Kim's boyfriend starts texting me how i hurt her feeling by not going swimming with her, and how i'm a bad influence on her because i smoke pot (He's an ex addict) and made quite a few horrible remarks.

I didn't feel like dealing with this so we compromised and took my 2 roommates with us. Everything went fine until she started asking if her bikini was too small, and i kinda cut it of and left early with one of my roommates.

Then when the actual party started we were sitting in on of the rooms on top of a bunkbed and the guy next to me decided to take a piss and she took his spot, then kept on coming closer and closer to me until i decided i'd just go for a walk.

When i left the house to take a walk she came after me and basically confessed to me that she was in love with me, asked me if i wanted to kiss her, this went on for like an hour before we came back... Then she said she was relieved and asked if i wanted to come over to their house, i said no and just went back to my own house.

Now when my Ex-girlfriend and i broke up, i kinda stayed in contact with Kim and told her about our break up, she ended up asking if she could come over and the emotional wreck i was i said yes. 

She came by yesterday, we got a boat from the park and cruised to this little remote island in the middle of the lake and talked for a while, later we went swimming and ordered pizza. It was all fun but i'm afraid i'm starting to develop feelings for her... And i have no clue if she has them for me.

And now she wants me to come over to her house, meet her parents... I've never been so confused.




   
TLDR: Broke up 3 days before a huge trip, cat got ran over a day later, a girl is trying to use me to cheat on her boyfriend?, how do i even notice if a girl likes me?

English is not my native language so sorry about that, i hope you guys can give me some advice."

4rqmqf,1,2016-07-07,I need help for moving out,Financiallylost01,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4rqmqf/i_need_help_for_moving_out/,"(X-post from personal finances) 

 Before I get started I would like to just ask that you guys dont just comment “move out” or “You're an adult , just move out “ as this is honestly the only advice I seem to get and I am already aware. I’ve been trying to move out for years. This advice only makes me feel worse about my situation.

I’m gonna be 24 in a week. I still live at home despite my attempts to move out. I really really really want to and it’s actually all I really think about. I often have dreams about it but I just cant make it happen. I need advice on how to do this. I’m becoming increasingly desperate to the point where my I feel hopeless and lost .
Now my situation is a little different because I live in New York City. You cannot rent an apartment for under 1k of monthly rent and that’s cheap. These are also in bad neighborhoods (Which I was born and raised in so I dont have a problem living in it for a year or two more). I want to move out of NYC , I hate it here and it’s my ultimate goal to move out but the problem is that I still havent finished college. I work in IT and my major is psychology . Yes I know it’ll probably be useless but I’ve put more then 4 years into my education and I dont want it to go to waste. I feel like having a B.A will be a good “fall back” job.

Now my passion isnt IT. I dont love it . The reason I went into it was so I could get a job to afford to move out . My passion is animals and although I wanted to be a vet, it’s just not possible for me to become one and I ended up getting kicked out of college because I kept trying to force myself to stay a biology major so I could apply to vet school. It was too late when I changed my major to psychology because I had already been on probation and then kicked out .

Heres my living situation :
 I live with my mother and 2 brothers in a small 2 bed room apartment. Before my dad and sister lived with us but my dad passed away and my sister got married and moved. I spent most of my life sharing a room with my brothers but my older brother (35) isnt mentally stable so I decided to move over to my mother's room when my father passed away. I’ve been sharing a bed with her for about 2 years since.
I’m currently working in as an IT intern for $10/hr I’ve been dismissed from college but have reapplied (there's like an %80 ill be let back in) for next semester. I am 15-17 credits away (not including classes I may have to take to raise my GPA over a 2.0 ) I have one IT certification that I got from a program that helps those in poverty find work in IT. They find me jobs that I otherwise wouldn't get on my own. I am working on two additional certifications (Which will be tough) I have an associates in liberal arts.

Heres what I will have when I’m ready to go
6-1 year of IT experience 7 months of customer service as a pet stylist 10k + in savings No debt A job that pays at least 15/hr or 30 k (I dont think I can make more ) An associates with 17 credits missing for a B.A in psychology

Heres what I want advice on
I keep seeing apartments want 30k-40k in salary to let you rent. How do poorer people rent then? I know I should get roommates but I’m having a hard time finding any as I dont have many girlfriends who are willing to move out . How can I even rent an apartment if I dont make at least 45k? Even low income apartments , given out via lottery, sometimes needs this much. I will be applying the the lesser ones though. Also do I need a full year of work to rent? I wont have that either so I wont have taxes to show , just pay stubs.
I have a boyfriend but the problem is that he is turning 21 next month (will be 21 when I move out) and I’ve explained to him the situation with time and time again. Although I can see he has had his doubts, he has offered to move in with me but I’ve rejected him because of these factors -He is young - He works a min wage paying job (well almost ,10/hr) - He wouldnt be able to work fulltime as he has applied to nursing school and I wouldnt want that load on him as his studies will be rigorous - He lives in a three story house with his family. His own room, free food, no bills paid, car. Wouldn't it be unfair to ask him to leave all this behind to work part time , have almost his whole check go into rent (I’ll cover all our other expenses ) while he studies?
I mean having him as my roommate will def help , he could pay half the rent and ill pay everything else which I think is possible if we budget correctly.

I really only want to stay in the city until I finish college ,then move away somewhere where the cost of living is cheaper . For now im desperate . I dont want to rent a room with strangers and I dont have much willing friends. I feel really trapped in the mess I’ve made of my life and I am ashamed . How can I afford to move out? How does anyone actually do this? Any advice for any part of my life is greatly appreciated"

We talked about how we were going to continue, she always told me she wouldn't want to be friends anymore after we broke up, however when we called she said she'd want to stay friends and still see eachother, which i was fine with since i'd rather have a good friend who i can trust than somebody i have to see and basically ignore. However now we're a week down the road and all i got is a text where she said she just wanted to tell me she loves me after i texted her my cat got ran over the day after we broke up (Which was pretty confusing)

I've met a girl at my intership (Kim) who was here for about 2 weeks, we did some things together like bowling and swimming and for that was all innocent and fun, she left and we didn't really keep contact.

Now about 3 weeks ago she came back for someone elses goodbye party, and before that she wanted to go swimming with me, however i talked about it with my girlfriend (Eva) and she didn't like it.

Forward a day later and Kim's boyfriend starts texting me how i hurt her feeling by not going swimming with her, and how i'm a bad influence on her because i smoke pot (He's an ex addict) and made quite a few horrible remarks.

I didn't feel like dealing with this so we compromised and took my 2 roommates with us. Everything went fine until she started asking if her bikini was too small, and i kinda cut it of and left early with one of my roommates.

Then when the actual party started we were sitting in on of the rooms on top of a bunkbed and the guy next to me decided to take a piss and she took his spot, then kept on coming closer and closer to me until i decided i'd just go for a walk.

When i left the house to take a walk she came after me and basically confessed to me that she was in love with me, asked me if i wanted to kiss her, this went on for like an hour before we came back... Then she said she was relieved and asked if i wanted to come over to their house, i said no and just went back to my own house.

Now when my Ex-girlfriend and i broke up, i kinda stayed in contact with Kim and told her about our break up, she ended up asking if she could come over and the emotional wreck i was i said yes.

She came by yesterday, we got a boat from the park and cruised to this little remote island in the middle of the lake and talked for a while, later we went swimming and ordered pizza. It was all fun but i'm afraid i'm starting to develop feelings for her... And i have no clue if she has them for me.

And now she wants me to come over to her house, meet her parents... I've never been so confused.




TLDR: Broke up 3 days before a huge trip, cat got ran over a day later, a girl is trying to use me to cheat on her boyfriend?, how do i even notice if a girl likes me?


English is not my native language so sorry about that, i hope you guys can give me some good advice."

My sneaking intuition is that I often use the old email address I used years back and got rejected with and maybe that login developed a 'low score', is this a realistic possibility?

Another problem is that without face-to-face recruitment, I doubt I will get a fair chance online. It's just too competitive for just one spot

We get along really great when things are good and have little spats but usually when we fight we are able to communicate through it and resolve issues. 

However, we have had a reoccurring issue which I have a huge problem with since we first became a couple, which is the amount of time we spend together. We sleep together about 3 nights a week, but if you exclude the sleeping hours, we spend around 6 hours together in a week. Now, understand we are both college students and I am involved in many things and am very busy. Still I make and find time for my boyfriend. 

He however, has no commitments besides school. I have a manager work position, a time-consuming internship, I volunteer, and I am a STEM major. He also is a STEM major and spends his off-time playing league, basketball, and video games with his housemates. None of these things bother me, I understand that he finds a relief and enjoyment during these activities and playing basketball allows him to be active, which is great.

I don't understand however, why he wants to spend such little amounts of time with me. He always tells me how he needs alone time and needs time to play his video games and basketball, and I try to respect that, but a lot of the time he is passing up time to spend with me and instead spending more time with people he lives with and sees all the time. 

I love this man a lot and we get along really well. If he spent more time with me I would be completely satisfied. Thats all I want is more quality time. I want to do activities with him, cook dinner together, or just watch a movie. Our only time together is before we go to sleep and after we wake up, and that feels more like a FWB situation than a relationship. I have asked him if we could go to the beach or just hang out, but he always chooses to go home to play basketball, which he plays everyday. 

I have had countless times where for once I would have a couple of hours free, which is very rare for me, and he still would choose to go home to play basketball. And when we are waking up in the morning or going to bed at night he is on his phone playing games and not even paying attention to me besides when we are having sex. 

I have brought this issue up to him time and time again and every time he feels bad. He used to smoke a lot of weed and since cutting back he has improved in the amount of attention he gives me, but it still doesn't feel like enough. In our last argument he just said ""he sees why I think that."" You think it would be simple for someone who loves you to spend time with you.

And we also have discussed different capacities for love and how I have a bigger capacity to love than he does, and maybe thats a deal breaker? I mean shouldn't I receive the same love back that I put out. 
I have had low low days too and I always have to really ask him to come help me out and be there for me whereas when he was depressed I always dropped whatever I was doing and would be there for him. 

My mind has circled this issue so many times and I just really need help to try to figure out what to do at this point. 



   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend is reluctant to spend time with me, not sure what to do at this point. "

4rrm9j,1,2016-07-07,"[Rant] Feel like I was unnaturally molded into ""perfection""",ketta_myrsyr,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/4rrm9j/rant_feel_like_i_was_unnaturally_molded_into/,"Warning: this post is very long and circuitous, at times attacking the school system and sometimes lamenting my current situation.

I don't have any particular goals with this post, other than to just release some thoughts that I've been holding onto for a while. Basically, I feel like I have been molded into what society defines as a perfect person during my formative/schooling years. My family does not have very strong roots in the area that I live, but evidently we were not foreign enough for me to attend an international school, so I was instead sent to endure the horrors of the local schooling system, which places a heavy emphasis on results from exams, and thus a subjects pupils to an inordinate amount of stress, even from early on in their academic careers. Case in point, I took the leaving exam for primary school when I was around 11 or 12 years old. During the school year leading up to the exam, my school gave mountains of schoolwork and I attended additional classes on the weekends (commonly referred to as ""tuition""). A lot of my classmates were pushed even harder by their parents, some having tuition on the weekdays after school, but needless to say, it seems almost cruel to subject these 11 or 12 year old students to such an immense amount of work. However, when you are at that age, the score you receive on your leaving exam determines what secondary school you will be allowed to attend, and under these circumstances, it requires little imagination to understand why so many parents eagerly push their children beyond their limits and enroll them in countless supplementary academic activities, especially when everyone else is doing the same to their children, adding pressure to not ""fall behind"" of everyone else.

Eleven year old me received a decent score on my primary school exams and was thus enrolled in a fairly respectable secondary school. In secondary schools, students are placed into various ""streams"" based on their academic performance (read: score on the primary school leaving exam), and the students in the more academically challenging streams are given the best shot at proceeding to post-secondary education. That's right, your chances at post-secondary education are significantly influenced by one exam that you take as a primary school pupil. That being said, there are a few ways for exceptionally hard-working students in lower streams to gain equivalent opportunities as their upper stream counterparts, but this is rare.

Secondary school was a veritable struggle. I was always haunted by the specter of the secondary school leaving exam and, given my experiences with the primary school exam, I knew to take it seriously. Towards the end of secondary school, it was not uncommon for my peers and I to pull all-nighters as we struggled to memorize all the information necessary for our school assessments as well as the looming leaving exam. My favorite spot to spend extended periods of time studying was the airport, which had AC and was reasonably quiet in some parts. Also, the last train departing from the airport and going all the way to my home left at around 2-ish am, leaving me no choice but to stay at the airport and study throughout the night.

A sidenote: if someone rented out an office unit and set up comfortable long-term study cubicles to rent out, with AC, power outlets, and wifi provided, he would make a tidy profit year-round, as there is a shortage of study spaces and there is never a shortage of people needing to cram for some upcoming exam.

Also, most of the ""learning"" is just memorizing and regurgitating, even the essays, which really failed to teach me essential skills such as how to think critically and creatively.

There is this notion of ""wellroundedness"" that gets tosses around occasionally. Well, there was a way to ameliorate your results from the secondary school leaving exams by participating in an outside-of-class activity (such as joining a school sports team, student government, doing something in the arts, etc). Well, I joined the soccer team, not because I cared any bit about the sport, but because I wanted a better exam score. I went to practices and actually liked it a little. My team won some local tournaments and I became somewhat athletic, so I guess that's a benefit to my life, but it really saddens me that most people are only doing these activities for the sake of getting a boost to their exam scores.

Sidenote: the lower the exam score, the better it is. So if you scored a total of 4 on your exams but did marginally okay in your outside-of-class activity, you could maybe shave a point or two off your exam score and end up with a _very_ respectable score of 2.

I passed the secondary school exams with fairly decent results (not stellar, but still very respectable), and was at a crossroads. I could either go to a university-preparatory-like school where I would learn more conceptual stuff and eventually enter university, or I could go to a polytechnic school with more hands-on learning and graduate with a recognized technical diploma (with optional university afterwards). I ended up going for a course in electrical engineering at a polytechnic, mainly because I didn't want to endure more years of hellish memorization. The first few months of polytechnic were rough because I was entrusted with way too much responsibility, and because the work was mainly project-based work, as opposed to the format of traditional exams that I was familiar with. Anyways, I got good results in my course, continued playing soccer, had internships with local companies, and graduated with a diploma in EE. I feel satisfied with how my life turned out, and I think I really could not have achieved any more. But I feel amazed when I think about how there are thousands of students who went to university-preparatory schools, endured more memorization, supplementary classes, all-nighters, and high-stakes exams, and still managed to keep on playing a sport or participating in some other students' organization. What kind of world am I living in? In fact, I did not even want to become the person I am today. Sure, I get good grades and have a polytechnic diploma and play soccer, but that seems so..trite and boring, because that is the baseline for students in my country. I would have wanted to study something else, such as art or writing, but alas, those subjects are not really what society in my country defines as success. In fact, I think they are becoming more and more rare. We have so many people vying for medicine, law, and engineering positions that I think we will soon become so engrossed in those narrow fields that we will lose our perspective. We'll have a nation of lawyers and engineers who played soccer in secondary school, but now they are too bogged down by their responsibilities to keep playing. Indeed, many university students just quit their outside-of-class activities because they can no longer gain any advantages, such as a better exam score or better chances of university admission. The ministry of education has tried so hard to instill this ""wellroundedness"" into students, but it has been done artificially, by means of incentives regarding exam scores and uni admissions, and having nothing to do with actually enjoying whatever activity you're doing, so this plan fails when everyone just quits their activities once they're in university and can't derive any more extrinsic motivation.

I live in a small country that is home to branches of the Big Four financial companies in the world, so finance is viewed as possibly the most lucrative career you could have. After serving in the military for a bit more than a year (this is mandatory), I am going to enter university soon, to study finance. This is not really my choice..when my parents/relatives found out that my results were decent enough to apply for a finance course in uni, they encouraged me to do it ""just to see if you can get in or not"". Well, I shrugged and submitted my application, but when I was offered a position in a finance course, they basically pushed me to accept it. So now, I'm going to experience more years of being molded into an even more perfect human being, in the eyes of society. I could not have declined to go to university: I live with my parents, as is common in my country due to an acute shortage of housing, and I would prefer not to create an awkward situation in the house if I were to decline such a lucrative opportunity (yes, I have to admit that, from a financial and societal standpoint, going to uni for finance would make sense). Plus, if I didn't go to uni, I would be stuck with my EE diploma, which is widely recognized (and polytechnic graduates aren't really required to go to university), but I don't really have much of an affinity to engineering or finance, so I just decided to comply. I'm not sure if it's the correct decision for me. Financially, I would be fine either way, but finance graduates make bank (no...pun...intended...) and it's easier to marry (because those jobs are so prestigious, so your spouse's parents will have no problem) and I guess society respects you a tad bit more than if you were an electrical engineer. But at the same time, I don't really want to spend more years in an academic setting, which invariably means more memorization and all-nighters. But if I have done it for my entire life, I might as well tough it out for a few years. I mean, it's the only thing I know."

I first got into power lifting and have made some massive strength gains for myself.

19/M 5'9"" SW: 200 CW: 180 GW: 165-170 10% BF or lower. Currently a teacher so I am on my feet very often. I workout 5 days a week minimum.

I am a physical education major so I am familiar with exercise, it just the cutting that I am having a difficult time with. I do have a solid base of muscle on my body that I would like to remove the roughly 18-20% BF off of to around 10% or lower. I was previously doing a power building routine by CoolSincada from BodyBuilding.com. But do to an internship I am currently apart of my gym has changed as I have changed states. So I switched to the Buff Dudes 12 week program for the time being. Open to any suggestions here as well.

Starting and current maxes over a years time on my main 4 lifts are listed below:

* Squat-
* Beginning: 1x225 Current: 1x405
* Flat Bench Press-
* Beginning 1x205 Current: 1x300
* Conventional Deadlift-
* Beginning 1x225 Current: 1x485
* Overhead Press-
* Beginning 1x115 Current: 1x185

Based on myFitnessPal I am consuming roughly 1940 calories a day.
166/67/198 (C/F/P)
I am eating nearly entirely chicken, salad, carrots, peanut butter, whey protein, and milk throughout the day. 

I would desperately like any feedback on what I can do to improve my fat lose based on my current routine. My TDEE is roughly 2,800 calories. Thank you so much in advance."

I don't know what I expected when I followed NGI on their deployment to New York. Perhaps more research in what documents they passed to me, only this time closer to the point of origin. Certainly being called into a surprise meeting with the Watcher alongside NGI head Jasper was nowhere on the list. ""Jasper"" was what the vaguely rotund man I was walking in with insisted on being called by. I'm sure as the head of a so-called intelligence department he thought it added an air of mystery to him. Although I thought such an effort fell short when I managed to learn his real name within a week of my arrival in New Golgotha. He had written it on his application for membership in C.K.D.O. after all, what did he expect, that everyone would simply ignore that? We each took our seat. Jasper, me, and the sentinel that Jasper kept as a body guard at all times. I admit he certainly had the paranoia I suppose someone needed to excel in his work, but it was never married with any common sense. For instance he have the sentinels under his command mine air vents to apparently prevent infiltrators but leave everyday exits and entrances virtually unguarded. He'd have spikes placed on the ceiling of the headquarters to prevent daring infiltrators from running along the rooftops and somehow forget to install security cameras around said rooftops so that he'd know if anyone so much as tried. 

He turned and gave me a forced smile as we sat across from each other in a boardroom the Free Republic had been kind enough to allow for NG use. As if I were a small child that had bumped into him. While I might not appreciate such treatment I could certainly understand its motivation. Our conversation over the train ride here had been... animated. At first he seemed overjoyed that I wanted to spend time with him in his private train compartment. But then I began asking about some of the reports he had passed down to me, how they seemed to be missing key bits of intel, he brushed off my complaints, saying I had no experience in the matter. It was alright, he forgave me, but I was a, and I quote, ""country girl"" and he had worked for the famous CIA in his day. I pressed my questioning (and yes, perhaps I was telling him how to do his job slightly, but my suggestions only seemed to be common sense. Why only focus on imitating scenes old-world spy movies and completely ignore the more mundane aspects?) and he had started to get defensive, telling me that unless I kept my nose out of NGI he'd have me arrested. I pointed out that Mr. Davey had given me expressed permission to go through his declassified files, and half by accident I called him by his real name. That was when the yelling started. It got to the point where I had to feign a breakdown and run teary-eyed out of the room to avoid things escalating further. My apologies to anyone who happened to have been listening in. 

Now I was apparently his assistant, or I believe that's how he saw it. In his mind he had already established his dominance and there was no further need for harshness. He felt terrible about telling me off earlier. He really was a good person. It wasn't his fault. I had heard all of these half-hearted apologies and more since we arrived as I sorted his personal files and generally acted as his secretary. Not much else to do until I met with Davey, and to be honest he needed the organization. Getting the Watcher's personal guard out of Albany's jail and setting the tesla suite free from military impound had created a mess of paperwork I don't think either of us were prepared for entirely. But perhaps more on that later. 

When Davey entered the boardroom, it was in somewhat of a commotion. He had spent an uneasy night in jail and had apparently just come off from the latest round of ""war talks"". Nevertheless he still seemed to find energy to address us with his traditional respectful disrespect. 

""Jasper, just the man I wanted to see! And Ms. Nomere too, lovely as always."" I nodded slightly in acknowledgement of the complement, false though it was. He was technically my employer after all. Jasper also nodded, smiling. 

Davey sat down in the chair nearest NGI's leader rather than at the head. ""Here, I like to be personal with the people under me, so-"" he clapped his hands together. ""How... are... things in good old NGI huh?""

""Nothing to report so far sir! I mean brother Watcher. I can proudly say that we've had no sightings of covert activity in the holy city and have been gathering intel on the other nations of the wild lands slowly but surly.""

""Well that's good news to hear Jasper, damn good news. And who is this here?"" He leaned over to get a better look at Jasper's body guard, who now looked up from the laptop he was typing at. 

""Wha-? Oh! Well this is sentinel Orpheus, Watcher. He's kind of my go-to guy in all matters of protection. Don't worry, after a while you won't even realize he's here."" 

""Oh, I'm sure I wouldn't, I'm sure I wouldn't. Sentinel... Orpheus? May Kane guide your hand brother."" He gave the sentinel the Kanite solute, who returned it silently in kind. ""There, now that formalities have been established we can get down to some serious business. I'll require a computer for my next trick."" Jasper paused for a moment, then elbowed Orpheus to hand over his laptop. ""Much obliged brother. Orpheus, grecko name... would you happen to be of the blood moon clan by any chance? They're fond on classical names I've heard."" Davey began clicking and typing at the computer, looking up at us as he talked. 

""Yes honored Watcher, my parents and their parents were of the bloody moon.""

""It is an honorable clan. You commend your ancestors to Kane with your service to us.""

""Many thanks, Watcher.""

""Aaaaand here we are."" Davey stopped typing and spun the computer for us to see. ""Brother Jasper, look here and tell me what you see, won't you?"" Jasper leaned in and narrowed his eyes. He had not been expecting having to read in this meeting and usually required rare medicinal glasses to do it efficiently. 

""I believe that's a Reddit post, Watcher."" 

""A reddit post you say? Well go ahead and read it, won't you? All the way through if you'd be so kind.""

""Well... see I'm kind of far sighted. I- Charlotte darling, would you be a dear and help me with this?"" He smiled patristically. I took the computer as Davey offered it and read the post aloud. It wasn't long. Although when I finished Jasper looked noticeably shaken. In a way I sympathized with him I suppose. What a terrible position to be in. ""S-sir. This message. It has to be fake sir. I swear to Kane that there's no possible way that anybody could be blackmailing the AMR woman. We've received no chatter on it whatsoever-""

""Yes, well it seems 'chatter' is not a necessity to infiltrate our city sadly. Brother sentinel?"" Orpheus once again looked up. ""Honored brother, how much time have you spent with this man here?"" There was... danger in Davey's voice now. It made me uneasy. I had never seen this side to the Watcher. 

""...Since he was appointed to his position, brother."" Orpheus looked at Jasper. ""I have guarded him while he sleeps and watched for his enemies while he relieved himself.""

""Goodness! And you do your clan and people proud with your sacrifice. Now brother, take this man and hold him against the wall. I assume you've brought a knife of some sort?"" 

""Yes Watcher, at once."" Jasper had gotten up out of his chair by now, which made it all the easier for the sentinel to bowl him over and slam him against the conference room wall. A wicked looking knife appeared in his hand, hovering just centimeters above Jasper's throat. 

""Oh dear oh me oh my, what a mess we've found ourselves in this time, eh Jasper? Can I call you Jasper? I know it's not your real name, but Kane take me as a hypocrite if I deny men the right to choose their own names.""

""W-why are you d-doing this? Even if it is real... it was one slip up, mistakes h-happen."" 

""Hmmm, I don't know Jasper. Psycho's being threatened by foreign agents my crack team of intelligence gatherers seems to have no power to stop, the Borsons managing to cart away a whole damn city under the Synods's nose, the Free Republic's apparent infiltration of our ranks to the point of learning some of our most sacred rituals. Case in point."" Davey almost tore the arm off his robe in his hurry to uncover himself. My eyebrows lifted. [His entire arm was covered in strangely patterned scars, twisting and coiling toward his palm. It must have been done recently, the cuts still bled slightly in some areas. I could see Jasper's eyes widen Orpheus's too, though I'm only guessing given his skull mask. ""Yes brother's, it's a blood bond, newly dedicated to the good President Michael Trockle after he demonstrated a remarkable knowledge of the inner workings of our order.""](/s)

""I-I'm so sorry sir. Watcher, brother Watcher. It won't happen again I promise."" Orpheus's knife pressed a bit deeper after seeing what Davey had revealed. Blood started to trickle out of Jasper's throat thinly. Davey pointed. 

""Brother Orpheus has done right by the Children of Kane, serving an incompetent liar such as yourself as ordered. But you..."" His voice turned bitter, as if he'd just eaten something he disliked. ""You have failed us brother. This... I won't use the term 'man', it's too charitable, has telegraphed his easy penetration of our defenses to the world. Now others will come, smelling our blood in the water like opportunistic sharks. But I would not be half as disappointed... actually no, I'm not disappointed. I'm pissed. We're officially upgraded to pissed now, I hope your happy. And I would not be half as pissed if I, if we had not been betrayed by our director of intelligence."" 

Jasper stared at him pleadingly. The pain of having his throat pricked was driving him wild but he dared not try and buck the stronger sentinel off, lest he deepen the wound.""And it is a betrayal Jasper, haven no illusions to the contrary. When you first came to us we asked you if you had any experience in espionage. You replied you had done years of work in the old American intelligence community. What you left out and later admitted to a brother while you were undergoing your initiation, was that you had in fact spent about three months at the pentagon... at a desk job.... as an out of college intern."" Davey moved toward him until he was at eye-level with the panting man. ""My own brother. The man I swore to die to defend and who I thought reciprocated that vow, has betrayed me, and worse he has tried to corrupt a fellow child of Kane. That was what you wanted didn't you? You thought that if you had Orpheus here spend all his waking hours at your side that you'd just gradually win him over with your natural charisma, and suddenly he'd be willing to follow you to hell and back? Well thankfully the bonds of kin and country aren't as easily severed for others."" Orpheus growled deeply in assent, hoisting Jasper higher against the wall. Davey turned away and chuckled wickedly. ""Ohhh my brother, I can taste the axle of the bus you've thrown me under. I can feel my leg warm as the hot piss of your disrespect to me and your brother's and sisters laps against it. Ahh, but I'm not going to kill you. Oh no. I'm merely going to hurt you. That's right Jano Slynt, you will feel pain. You will feel all the pain that young boy could quite possible be feeling under the care of /u/the_shrouded, and all the pain I felt as I [payed for your incompetence by carving ritual sigils into my own arm](/s), and all the pain you have caused the mother who birthed one as untrustworthy as you. You will feel all of these things, but you will not die. Instead you'll be cast out of the city and banished from the children, scarred, beaten, penniless, perhaps mad. I wish you well in the new life you'll have to make for yourself. Take this man away and report him to the heathen jail, brother. Tell them he is a traitor and lock him in with my personal guard. They already have their orders what to do with him. Glory to Kane."" 

""Glory to Kane my brother."" Orpheus replied sternly. He led Jasper out of the conference room and out of my life at knife point, tears streaming from his captives face. As for myself, I had no tears. I was far to petrified to cry. Or do much of anything besides keep my hands folded really. 

Once they were gone, Davey fell back into his chair and messaged his eyelids. ""I... apologize for exposing you to that. I had meant to only have him removed from office when I first found out about the Borsons scrapping Duluth without warning from NGI. But then this... happened,"" he gestured to the laptop, ""and I had to take more drastic actions... Anyway congratulations on the promotion."" I stared at him. 

""You can't be serious.""

""I brought you in here and made you see this. You think I just do that sort of thing for giggles? Come on. You had to have seen this coming a mile away."" I... had perhaps. But I had always been taught not to pine for such things. Now I wasn't certain I wanted to be promoted at all. 

""You have the man I'd replace tortured and exiled and you expect me to take his position? You must think I'm a fool.""

""Well if I thought you were, then I probably wouldn't be doing this. And your technically not taking his position, seeing as it no longer exists. I'm offering you the status as Holy Spymaster, overseer of New Golgotha Intelligence and accountable to nobody but the Synod or me until my emergency powers expire. You have intellect clearly, a drive to succeed alla gathering enough information to piece together your brother's trail, and I hear tell that you pretty much walked into his train car earlier and told him strait up why he was an incompetent buffoon."" He chortled. ""That must have been orgasmic.""

""You seem to enjoy the suffering of others well enough, why not make yourself Spymaster?""

""Too much to do already. And too little time to do it. We're in a war whether we like it or not. I can't possibly deal with covert ops, the day to day runnings of the city, and battle strategy. I need people I can trust to keep a level head and [not let that,"" he pointed to where Orpheus had been sitting, ""get the better of you. Fanaticism I mean.](/s) You're not even technically a member of the Children yet, are you?""

""When you offered me my current position you said I had the freedom to believe whatever I chose. After seeing what you went through I don't think I'll be joining your group any time soon."" He held up his hands defensively. 

""Alright, alright. Just checking. What's got you upset all the sudden?""

""Up-Upset? Upset!? You scared the living shit out of me! You practically condemned that man to a slow death, if not in body than in mind and spirit. And then you turn around like a sociopath and offer me his job as if nothing happened?! You're a vicious bastard and if I didn't need your money and resources I'd quit right now!"" My voice was somewhat more elevated in tone than I had originally intended. Until then I took pride in not living up to the female stereotype of being easily driven to hysterics. Not that I was hysterical then, I just still wasn't used to that sort of violence and well... Well it was bloody disturbing seeing the way these people acted toward each other. Was it like this all across the wild lands? 

Davey looked sad. ""Yeah, well, I appreciate your staying here against your will. I... can't say that that wasn't who I am just now. Or really promise that it won't happen again ever. But I can promise that it won't be you if and when it does happen. Your not a sister, so for you to fail would be just that. Not a full blown spit-in-your-face betrayal. Does that make it any better? It doesn't does it? I get it. It's alright, seriously. I'll find someone else to run NGI and you can of course keep searching through their files to-"" The image of my twin brother flashed in my head like a gunshot at night, followed by the image of him being dragged down by a ravenous horde of undead. He was as much a stranger to this strange land as I was. Did it terrify him too? Did he wish I was there with him, or was he glad that he left. I at least had to know which. He and the world owed me that much... If Davey ever tried to do to me what he did to Jano, I'd yank the knife away and bite his throat out if it meant finding Vivac. 

""I'll take the title."" I cut him off mid-apology. ""Although you realize I have virtually no experience beyond mystery novels and the occasional spy film, yes? Also that I'm in debt to Anabel June."" He recovered quickly. 

[Well then I guess I'll just have to trust that you won't suddenly turn on us and feed that witch critical information over some computations then. You're indebted to her as a pilot,](/s) nothing more nothing less.""

""And there's another thing. Am I still contracted as the Synod's pilot? And if so how am I to fulfill those duties as well as run NGI?"" Davey got up and spun the laptop towards me. 

""You're a clever woman I think. Figure it out, Spymistress. And that's an order."" When he left, I let out a sigh of relief and thought of Vivac once more. Wherever you are, my brother, I promise never to treat you as the Kanites do their brothers and sisters. It wasn't long before I leaned over the laptop, reading the post over again...

4rst35,1,2016-07-08,I'm screwing everything up,raycho_bird,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4rst35/im_screwing_everything_up/,"I'm juggling a 9-5 internship that I despise along with a summer Calculus II course. I'm stressed as hell. I gained weight from sitting on my ass in front of a computer all day, and I'm already not a tiny person, which I'm super self conscious about. My rent is a good chunk of my paycheck, so I stress about money, yet I feel the need to buy new things because of the tiny high it gives me of having something new. I ate an entire pint of Ben and Jerry's today and promptly felt ashamed and disgusted with myself. I don't find joy in anything anymore.

My boyfriend came in today to talk about how he's been trying to be more helpful around the apartment, which is a huge deal to me, and I've been trying to thank him for everything, but he feels like it's not enough for me. When I tried to tell him about how stressed I am about my weight, my finances, my class, and my job, he doesn't know what to say, so instead he ends up telling me things I already know: maybe I shouldn't have eaten the entire pint of ice cream, maybe I shouldn't buy things so much, we can sit down and figure out a budget, etc... I'm resentful of this, obviously, but more ashamed of myself. I feel like an awful girlfriend. I don't know how to tell him how terrified I'm going to be when he graduated at the end of this month and leaves, after we've practically been joined at the hip since before my diagnosis three years ago.

I just feel like a terrible person with no self control, who isn't good enough for anything or grateful enough when it matters, and I just feel like a fuck up. I can't keep doing this."

Also, I've found, in the UK, not as many applicants are going for ""sandwich years""(Degree with a work experience year):

[Re-posted to: http://www.asstr.org/~Dayvid/]

***

He didn't even realize he was doing it.  At least, not until she moved, causing his own eyes to move, and he realized she was looking at him - *straight* at him.  That was when he realized that he'd been staring straight at the little girl's panties for... well far longer than he *should* have been, that was sure!  Ten seconds?  Twenty?

His face flushed with embarrassment, all the more so when he saw that hers didn't.  If anything, hers seemed *pleased*.  As if she'd accomplished a goal.  And perhaps she had.  The skirt was really pretty small for so young a girl, though he knew they were wearing them short these days.  Still, she couldn't have been more than what, eight?  Nine perhaps?  And she sure has *hell* shouldn't have had the fabric of her panties tucked so deeply between what must have been quite puffy labia!  That was what had really caught his eye.  He'd always been a sucker for cameltoes - pun notwithstanding, and when the little girl had plopped down into one of the chairs in the waiting area, her legs splaying wide, she'd shot him a view his eyes had shot to automatically.

The reason for her moving became apparent as she got up, grabbing her bag, and heading for the boarding gate.  The chime had sounded, and now the announcer was telling them to begin boarding.  Clark grabbed his own carry-on - a satchel filled mostly with papers and his tablet, and made his way to the crowd as his hand sought out the ticket in the side pocket.

He was tired - exhausted really.  The week-long seminar had taken its toll.  He was really too old for this sort of thing.  Even at forty he'd been able to party and whore with the younger crowd, but it seemed like once he'd hit fifty, he'd lost interest.  Not so much in the girls - they were always young, attractive, and willing to do some really interesting things - but the partying no longer appealed, and really, to get seminar groupies, you had to do the seminar parties.  So in recent years, he'd generally satisfied himself with calling an ""escort"" to his room for some good - and less rowdy - exercise on a more intimate level.

This time though, the last few days of his schedule hadn't really allowed, and he could feel himself growing restless for some sex.  He was looking forward to getting home to that cute little intern Emily, who had some sort of ""Boss Crush"" on him.  She was only seventeen - far, *far* too young for him.  But as long as she was willing to give it out, he sure as hell wasn't going to turn it down!

After getting his ticket scanned by the conductor, he made his way to his cabin.  It'd cost far too much.  Every year the rates went up and it seemed like the cabins got harder to find.  But he'd managed to get a single-solo this time, and was looking forward to a good meal followed by several hours of uninterrupted sleep.  He wasn't so much physically exhausted as *emotionally*.  It'd been a harried trip so far, and the seminar hadn't gone according to plan.  They never did, but this time had been particularly bad, and he'd had a ton of stress.  As he opened his cabin door, he felt eyes on him, and saw down at the end of the car, the same little girl he'd locked eyes with in the waiting area.  He stumbled hurriedly into his cabin.

After the train had got up to speed and the utilities were available, he spent a productive time washing up.  It was refreshing, and he felt more human as he made his way to the dining car.  This particular line, though modern, had some old-fashioned ideas about their trains, and still had dining at tables available - to those who could afford it.  The rest generally ate at the counter or in their seats or cabins.  Clark took an empty booth and was tucking into a wonderful veggie lasagna.  Part of the reason he liked this line was the cooking.

He was almost finished when the same little girl slid into the seat across from him.  ""I'm Julie,"" she said as if he'd asked.

Clark frowned.  It was bad enough she'd caught him staring at - well, where he shouldn't have been staring.  But now apparently she thought that had made them friends somehow.  It wasn't that he didn't like kids, it was just that he didn't really *like* them much.  They were typically loud, rude, and far too energetic.  Still, common courtesy pretty much dictated that when one met someone on a train, one was as pleasant to them as one could manage.

""Clark,"" he said gruffly.

""Nice to meet you Mr. Clark,"" she said politely, extending her hand.  It surprised him both because the tone was so polite and cultured, but more because her hand wasn't angled for shaking.  She expected him to *kiss* it - or he was grossly mistaken.  He took her fingers between his fingers and thumb, and as expected, she didn't even flinch as he brought it to his lips.  He was surprised to find that she smelled of lightly-scented soap - she'd clearly washed up before dinner, unlike most people did these days, and his estimation of her went up a notch.  She apparently wasn't one of ""the great unwashed"", in either the literal or figurative sense.  His smile was actually sincere as he released her hand, and he was again surprised to see that hers was both sincere *and* calmly accepting of the kiss just above her knuckles, as if it happened to her every day.

He released her hand, and she spoke again, her voice calm, measured, and yet still bright and fresh with her youth.  ""I'm *terribly* sorry to intrude, but I was hoping you could help me out,"" she said.  It sounded like something out of an old movie.

""Sounds like something out of an old movie,"" he accused.

It elicited a merry laugh, almost a giggle, that brought a smile to his own lips.  ""Busted!"" she said.  Then in a lower voice, ""But you seemed like such a gentleman that I didn't want to come across as some dumb kid.""  She had a conspiratorial look to her eyes, like they had some sort of shared secret.  It was probably some silly kid-game, he figured, but she *was* a charming little thing.  

Her eyes were huge and deep golden-brown, high-quality caramel while it's still in the hot, liquid phase.  Her hair was a deeper brown, though with highlights of a similar deep golden-brown tone, and not curled, but more curly than wavy.  It covered her shoulders in a beautiful mane and fell half-way down her back.  Straight, it probably reached the vee of her behind.

Her face was too pink to be called tan, but too tanned to be called pale, with a brief scattering of freckles which were already fading.  By the time she hit mid-teens, they'd likely be gone.  *Pity,* he thought.  They added something to her appearance which while pretty enough, was otherwise fairly standard in terms of what ""pretty"" meant.  She still had a bit of childhood roundness, and it was clear that she'd end up with laugh-lines early in life - her demeanor was far too happy for it to be otherwise.

Naturally she had nothing to speak of in the way of curves yet, though when he'd seen her walking ahead of him in the station, he saw enough to know that under that little skirt was a very nicely-rounded behind - not big, like the kids liked them these days - but *round*.  Her legs were nice enough as well, for a kid, and her posture was far better than most girls.  She must go to an excellent school.  Or perhaps she was a model or something.  At any rate, she carried herself well, which did wonderful things for her appearance.  Even though he knew she couldn't have anything under her top to speak of, her *bearing* made it seem as if she might.

The outfit likewise spoke of culture and class.  It was simple linen for the most part, snow-white and with only enough embellishment to actually *embellish*, without overpowering.  The skirt was some sort of blend, a dark beige that went well with her hair and eyes, and light enough to flow, even though it was short enough to reveal - as he'd discovered at the station.  The thigh-high white socks and tan Mary-Janes completed the ensemble, making the whole greater than the sum of its parts.  The only jewelry was a gold chain which fell into the opening in her top, hiding whatever the pendant was, and a pair of gold studs in her ears.  All-in-all, she was very pretty, as well as damned cute, though in a somewhat subdued manner.

""So what am I rescuing you from,"" he asked, his tour of her form and fashion complete.  ""Highwaymen?  Some sort of dragon?  A plague of locust?""

""I *wish!*"" she rolled her eyes.  ""Try utter and complete boredom!  My parents are schmoozing - daddy is hoping for a promotion - and they expect me to completely disappear after making a good first impression.""  She took a sip of his untouched water and Clark noticed for the first time that she was wearing lipstick.  It was so subtle and well-matched, that he hadn't realized it until he saw it on the rim of the glass.

Clark's patience had suddenly run its course.  He was *not* about to stick around an entertain a child, no matter *how* charming she might be.  He'd nearly finished his supper, and was looking forward to that nap, though at the moment he didn't feel the least bit tired.  ""I'm very sorry Julie,"" he said, managing to keep the irritation from his voice, ""but I won't be staying long.  Now that I've finished,"" he tossed his napkin on his plate indicating he was done, ""I'll be returning to my cabin for a much-earned rest.  Now if you'll excuse me...""

He was starting to slide out of the booth when he felt her foot on his leg, stopping him more in surprise than anything else.  She leaned forward and whispered, ""Did you like the view in the bus station?""

Suddenly he got it.  She was going to *blackmail* him into keeping her entertained!  Why, of all the low-down, sneaky, underhanded... he could feel his face reddening, more in anger than embarrassment.

But she'd read him well, and spoke again before he could attack.  ""Don't worry Mr. Clark,"" she said mildly, ""I'm not going to make any fuss.  I just wanted to know if you enjoyed looking at my panties as much as I enjoyed showing them to you.  Was the fabric tucked deeply enough?  It was hard to tell by touch, but you seemed to think it interesting enough to keep looking.""

""I... er... uh..."" he said, fumbling, caught completely off-guard by her admission of setting him up that way, as well as her claim to *enjoy* showing him.  ""I guess,"" he finally got out, ""it was fine.  I mean, not that I...""

Her smile lit up her face, and the foot on his calf slid upward.  ""Oh good, so you *did* like looking between my legs!  I tell you, if the chime hadn't sounded, I'd have given you a lot *more* to look at!""  In an even lower voice, she added, ""It makes me really horny when men look at my naughty bits - or when I look at theirs!""

Clark was beside himself.  How the *hell* was he supposed to respond to that?  He tried to think, but that attempt was cut off by the feel of her foot on his crotch, where he could feel his manhood swelling at an alarming rate.  Apparently she'd slipped her shoe off, as she was lightly kneading him and, he though, ""feeling him up"" with her toes!

Like a deer, Clark fled.  He went from the table to his cabin door with no recollection whatsoever of having traversed the distance.  He didn't *think* he'd run the distance, but the way his heart was pounding as he leaned against the cabin door, closed behind him, it wasn't impossible.  After a moment to calm himself, he shook his head.  *Was he having some sort of hallucination?*  Thinks like that didn't happen in real life!  Or maybe she was having some sport with him - probably laughing her arse off back in the dining car.  Yes, that was probably it.  She'd seen him looking at the station and really *was* bored by her parents' inattention.  So she'd availed herself of a ready target for some entertainment.

Well he'd brought it on himself, he thought after the searing heat of anger had dissipated.  He shouldn't have been looking at the gusset of a preteen in the first place!  By the time he'd washed his face and brushed his teeth, his hands had stopped shaking and the pounding of his heart had subsided.

But what *hadn't* subsided was his painfully-hard erection.  Truly, it *had* been too long since he'd been laid, if that tiny bit of stimulation had so aroused him!  He couldn't recall that last time a little footsy-under-the-table had increased his heart rate!

He still needed the nap though, so he folded down the bed and stripped down to his underwear, smiling at the reflection in the mirror.  His erection looked *huge* the way it was sticking his underwear out!  Laying down in the bed, he reached for his tablet, dimmed the lights, and turned it on.  A little porn was always nice, though he didn't think he'd need it.

None of his usual porn sites were appealing to him tonight though, which irritated him.  He started four videos in succession, lightly stroking himself as each started, but none appealed.  The fifth had just finished buffering when the door to his cabin clicked open - in his confusion and haste, he'd forgotten to lock it!

Julie slipped in, closing the door quickly behind her, and he barely got the blanket to cover himself before she turned around.  Her eyes were bright with mischievous excitement as she giggled.  ""Made it without anyone seeing me!""  Seeing the look of shock and fear on his face, she calmed down and tried to calm him too.

""Oh, stop fretting, Clark!  I'm here for you, honest!""  She began to undo the buttons on her top as if it were the most normal, natural thing in the world to be doing while standing in an adult's cabin on a train while he tried to hide his erection.

""What?"" he asked, quickly replacing it with, ""How?"" followed briefly by ""Why?""  

She grinned at him.  ""Slow down old-timer.  One question at a time.""  The top came off, exposing her braless bare chest to him.  As he'd expected, there was little enough there in the breast department, but like all men since time began, his eyes automatically locked on her nipples, which seemed to him to be large, ripe, and tightening even as he watched.  ""What - That's easy.  I want to make love with you.  How - I'm pretty sure you know how.  And Why?  That's easiest of all.  You're a nice guy.  I could tell that immediately by the way you blushed when I caught you looking.  You're clean, smell nice, and have been very nice to me even after I interrupted your dinner for no good reason.  I think you'll make a great lover.  I'm *sure* you'll keep my secret.  And I *know* your cock is large and hard for me.""  With one swift motion, she slid her skirt down onto the floor, and stood before him in nothing but panties - still tucked into the crease to exaggerate her cameltoe, her socks and shoes.

Despite years of conditioning, Clark's basic nature was asserting itself.  A lovely young lady was standing before him, offering herself to him, and his libido was all in favor of taking her up on the offer.  His cock sent shocks down his spin with every slight movement of the blanket against it, and he couldn't have torn his eyes off her with a jackhammer.  Then she dropped the bomb.

""Don't you think I'm pretty?"" she said, her eyes full of sadness at his implied rejection.  Of course, he *hadn't* rejected her - yet - and it was unlikely she could actually bring the tears her expression indicated to bear, but the male conditioning runs deep, and he couldn't help but reply immediately, ""Of course I think you're pretty - hell, you're *beautiful!*""

Her face lit up, and he realized how he'd been played.  Clearly this little girl knew enough how to manipulate him!  One of his married-with-children friends had once told him that his daughter had been *born* with the knowledge of how to wrap daddy around her finger.  Clark was getting a taste of that now, and wondered if *all* girls are born with that knowledge.

It was too late to do anything about it though.  Julie had already hopped up onto the bed, jostling the blanked against his pecker enough to make him shiver with pleasure, and was quickly divesting herself of shoes and socks.  In a few seconds she turned to him, flipped over, and crawled to him on hands and knees wearing nothing but her panties.  ""Don't worry Clark,"" she said in a voice that should have belonged to a much older woman.  ""I'll be gentle,"" she grinned, then, reaching him, pressed her lips to his.

The sensation was like an avalanche.  Her lips were soft, warm, and opened immediately, her tongue slipping into his mouth before he could even think, and then it was too late - his own tongue responded and he was lost in the deep, sweet, and very, *very* adult kiss.  Her mouth was fresh, warm, liquid, and much smaller than he expected.  When he realized that, it drove home the realization that he was tongue-kissing a *child*, and it was an odd sensation to realize that *it didn't matter*.  Or rather, it mattered - but in the exact opposite way it *should* matter.  Instead of being turned *off* by the fact, instead it seemed enormously stimulating!

Somehow he'd gone from sitting up to laying down with this sexy little girl atop him.  Clark had always had a particular fondness for the woman-superior position, and his hands automatically moved up to caress her, once again finding the *smallness* of her body to be exciting rather than the opposite.  Her skin was smooth, her body lacking the curves that would be there later to soften the bones beneath.  He could feel the muscles of her tummy, the ribs of her chest, and the rock-hard nipples with little behind them.  His hands ran down her back, feeling the muscles, the dimples above her behind, and that exquisitely rounded and quite firm behind.  Gliding over her panties, he continued his exploration, finding her calf-like legs, sans the rounder musculature of maturity, also exciting, and when he touched her feet, she jerked and giggled like a ticklish little girl - because she was one.  Granted, many grown women have ticklish feet too, but their reaction isn't nearly as *sharp* - she almost bit his tongue!

For her part, Julie was busy getting the sheets and blanket out of the way.  She wanted to be pressed *against* Clark, and soon she was.  With practiced motion, she positioned herself so that her cameltoe pressed down on his shaft, and pressed his cock firmly against his tummy.  Then, as she continued to kiss him, she grinded on him gently, the warmth and dampness within her panties transmitting though the fabric to his cock, sending the clear message of her arousal, leaving no doubt whatsoever of her desire and intention.

""God, but you're a sexy little... thing,"" Clark said as their lips finally parted.

""Slut,"" she corrected.  ""You meant to say it, so say it.""  She shrugged, then dipped her head, shaking her hair down on his chest to tickle him then flipping it back.  ""It's true too.  I am!  And I'm *proud* of it!  Don't be a fraidy-cat Clark, we're in bed together.  Treat me like a *woman!*""

It was all the permission he needed.  She gasped with pleasure as he grabbed a handful of hair, pulled her head back, and attacked her chest with his mouth.  Clark quickly found out that while she might not have much actual *mass* there, the nerve endings were there in plenty, and she was soon gasping and panting at his licking, sucking, and biting her nipples and the surrounding tiny mounds.

He could feel the warm wetness seeping through her panties to soak his cock, and suddenly he *had* to sample her.  Flipping her over onto her back like a little girl - because she was one, he knelt between her small, thin legs, and whipped her panties off.  An instant later he was lifting and parting her legs and shoving his nose deeply into her cleft.  She was so *smooth!*  And she smelled delicious - and tasted even better.  She didn't resist at all, moving *with* him as he thrust his tongue deep into her encountering no resistance other than that caused by the narrowness of the passage.  But the quantity of juice made it easy to push in, and her body adapted quickly, stretching to accommodate his eager, thrusting tongue.

To his amazement, the little girl's juices increased, and in a remarkably short time, she was mounting the final rise to her first climax.  Clark was good at this sort of thing, but he'd *never* seen a girl cum so easily, and it was invigorating!  He increased his tonguing of her cunny, not even focusing on her clit, and marveled at how her body quaked and shook as her pussy milked his tongue, coating it again and again with her sweet nectar!

Her second climax followed the first even quicker, and though not quite as intense, led into a third and fourth almost before the prior ones had subsided.  It buzzed in his brain, *this child was multi-orgasmic!*  He'd heard of such things before, but he'd never actually seen it - at least not to *this* degree.

After several more - it was hard to say how many as they flowed one-into-another, she pushed his head away.  He looked down at her, his face shiny with her juices, as she panted at him, grinning hugely.  ""Wow Mr. Clark, you eat pussy like a champion!""

""Julie dear,"" he said with complete sincerity, ""I have to tell you, I have *never* had a finer meal than this exquisite - and quite beautiful - pussy of yours!""  It was true too.  Now that he took a moment to look her pussy was a work of art, pure and simple.  He could have gazed at it for hours, save for the fact that Julie had other plans.

""Can I suck your cock now?"" she asked in the direct manner of children, never mind that question was one no child should ever ask.  He wasn't going to argue though.  Her words brought his attention to his cock, now so hard it actually *ached*, though in a pleasant way.

Still, he needed a moment to regain his composure, so he delayed with playful banter.  ""I don't know little girl, do you think you can *handle* a full-grown cock like mine?""

To his surprise, she grinned and shot back, giving as good as she got.  ""I don't know Mr. Clark.  I *think* so, but it's hard to tell, since you've been keeping it from me!""  She made the *cutest* little pouty-face as she added, ""Mean ol' Mr. Clark won't even let me suck his dick - and I'm sooo huuungry!""

He fell down beside her, laughing.  ""Awww you poor thing!"" he said, letting his hands fondle her.  She looked *so small!*  Hell, she *felt* so small.  Hell, she *was* so small!  One hand could almost completely cover her chest, and he was pretty sure he could circle her waist with both!  And yet, she was so *vibrant* and *alive* - she seemed completely capable of using him up and tossing his husk to the winds.  And he was of a mind to let her do exactly that.

Rolling onto his back, he gestured invitation, and gasped in shocked pleasure as she made good on the invite, flipping over and engulfing his cock with astonishing eagerness.  ""Holy *fuck* Julie!  Go easy girl, or you'll make me blast off before you even get started!""  She popped it out, looked over at him, and stuck her tongue out like a kid.  ""Too bad!  It's *mine* now!"" she said, and that was completely true.  She had both hands on it, and even without the warm, wet mouth, he felt she could make him cum in seconds!

But she didn't.  The girl had talent.  Using her hands and her mouth, she brought him lovely waves of pleasure, stopping shy of climax several times.  The exercise made his precum flow more readily than he'd ever known, and the girl lapped it up greedily, as if it were the nectar of the gods, often looking him straight in the eye as if to thank him for the gift.  Not only was it erotic as hell, it was also an amazing tonic for his ego, making him swell with pride to be able to provide such a *beautiful* girl the thing she so obviously adored!

It was on the seventh - eighth? - such cycle that, just as he expected her to ease off and lick, she instead dropped her head, engulfing his cock and shoving it straight down her thought with only the slightest hesitation to control her reflex.  His fat cock felt like it must be stretching her throat mercilessly, and he was *certain* he could see the shape of it!  But she didn't slow one bit.  She sunk to the root, then beyond, pushing her cute little nose hard into his balls.  Then she backed up and he could see it vacating her throat - but she only went about half-way before shoving it back to the root!

The first couple such strokes were slow, but she quickly increased her pace, fucking his cock with her mouth and throat, her skills on par with the best full-age ""escorts"" he'd ever employed.  He didn't have a chance of preventing the inevitable, nor did he want to.  Julie knew what she was doing, and what would happen.  And Clark was learning that she was going to get what she wanted, so he best just enjoy the ride.

Still, it would be rude not to warn her.  The pleasure she was giving him was interfering with his power of speech, but he did manage to finally gasp out, ""Gonna.  Cum.  Soon!""  Without breaking stride, she managed somehow to nod, and changed her position slightly so that she could look up at him as she bobbed her head up and down his turgid shaft.  Her big, beautiful brown eyes, framed by her lovely mane, bouncing with her exertions, was the most lovely, sexy thing he'd ever seen.  Their eyes locked, and after a few more strokes, he erupted.

It was unlike any climax he'd ever had.  Her throat was so hot and tight, it was like fucking a virgin.  Her eyes were so sweetly expressive, screaming of her joy in making him cum, like it was the completeness of her existence, that it ratcheted up his pleasure many times.  And the sight-and-knowledge that he was firing his cum into the mouth and throat of a nine-year-old girl inflamed his climax as if someone shoved a firecracker up his ass.  He literally *exploded* into her, his cum shooting so hot and fast it felt like it was searing the inside of his cock, and in such rapid succession he felt like his balls had been replaced by machine guns!

Despite it all, the intensity and the sheer *violence* of his climax, the little girl took it all.  Steadily, *greedily* she sucked his cum out, shot after shot power-driving down her throat.  After the first several shots, she backed up, her hands working his shaft as she sucked the fat head, catching his cum in her warm mouth, building up a reservoir of the fluid, swirling it over his cock head with her wild tongue, and swallowing hungrily when her mouth got too full.

Clark couldn't even blink, it was all too sexy, too *beautiful* to miss an instant.  When she'd sucked out the last drop, the girl grinned - quite a trick with a fat cock stretching your lips, but she managed it - and let the cum leak out from her lips to drool down his shaft and over his balls.  She then played a cute-and-sexy game of catch-the-cum, her tongue dashing all over his cock and balls to seek and slurp every drop of his seed.

Finally finished, she gave the head of his cock one last kiss, then slid up into his warm embrace with an air of complete satisfaction, resting her head on his shoulder as if they were old lovers who'd done this a thousand times.

Clark held her, caressing her as he slowly came down from the rush of his orgasm.  He wanted to tell her how amazing she was, but just couldn't find the words.  Hell, there *were* no words for what he was feeling.  Sated, confused, blissful, scared, contented, and a whole range of other feelings were playing through him.  Eventually though, he figured it out.  She'd understand, though the actual words could be misunderstood by anyone else.  *She* would know what he meant.

Tilting his head, he kissed the top of her forehead, squeezed her shoulders, and said softly, ""Honey, if you were nine years older, I'd totally fucking *marry* you!""

It was right.  She giggled happily, not taking it as a proposal, but rather as intended - as the highest compliment he could think of.  He was of a different generation, where that was the best he could give a woman.  So she accepted it that way, snuggling closer, then lifting her head up to kiss his cheek.

""Take that nap you wanted Mr. Clark,"" she said gently-but-playfully.  ""You're going to need your strength for round two!""

I'm a 20 year old trans guy and I've been dating my girlfriend for a few months now. I like her a whole lot, and we get along really well (although this might be the honeymoon phase talking) She's a super supportive person. I was initially worried that me being trans would be a deal breaker for her, but not only does she not care, but she's bisexual. 

We don't live very near each other during this summer, but we'll both have apartments after this summer. Since we get to see each other around twice a month, we've been going at it like bunnies when we're together. But the problem is that I get absolutely no pleasure from having sex. I absolutely love making her feel good, but I can't help but feel kind of unsatisfied. 

When we have sex it usually goes making out and grinding, me using my fingers, then me using my tongue for about an hour. Then one of us gets tired and we stop and cuddle until we go to sleep. The problem isn't that I don't find her attractive, because she's super sexy and I really feel it at the beginning but while I'm down there I get over it pretty quickly? That sounds really terrible, I know. 

Part of my problem is probably that I get really uncomfortable with my bottom half. I have to keep my shirt, binder, and underwear on almost all the time or I feel mildly panicky. So she doesn't touch me. And when we do grind, I can't feel anything on any part that gives me stimulation at all. I'm also super broke right now, due to not being able to have a job because I have an internship, so I can't buy a hard packer (which is basically a strap on, but they usually look more realistic to help with the mental part of it) until I get back to work in a month or so. 

Is there anything I can do? I still want to go down on her, but I really want to get stimulation."

I have recently gone back to school to finish my degree and after this fall I will have achieved that goal.  I anticipate achieving that goal but my entire life I've been known as someone who rarely finishes what he started.  I'm overweight, I live with my parents, I do not currently have a job (starting a non paid internship soon) and I now have about 25k in student loan debt.   

I know plenty about not comparing myself to others, and various self help ""knowledge"" (Tim ferriss, power of habit, power of now, Dale Carnegie, etc.), but I constantly find myself in a reverse snowball as if everytime I start something the motivation to continue falls off tremendously. Even now after my school reboot I started with 9 straight A's, then last semester 3 A's and 3 B's, now this small summer semester I catch myself skipping homework assignments.  I distract myself with whatever i can find on the Internet, or video games, and make excuses until the deadline passes. 

It is this fall off that is most concerning because I've seen it so many times before and i rarely overcome it. I start many projects and goals (like diets and exercise) and I seem to never complete or last very long.  I just really could use some advice with how to stay motivated and get out of this lazy mindset that has essentially been a part of me my entire life. How do you avoid self deceit, laziness, and find the motivation to reach your goals to completion and beyond? "

I love programming. I have some cool side projects. After going on a trip to South East Asia where I met a lot of people who had been on the road for an year I wondered how they did what they are doing. Most of them were teaching English, some were helping agencies there make films while others were living off what they had saved. After working in an office for a two months for my internship I am even more inclined to freelance while traveling for at least an year after graduation.

I don't do front end so well, I do front end because no other person in my group of programmers wants to do front end. I have worked on cli-apps, extensions where I have developed everything(front and back), webapps(front end and back end) and other software. I have a decent blog and a decent GitHub but I don't have a portfolio like designers do.

Enough about me. I am looking for advice on how to get started as a freelancer. I am not aiming at Northern Europe, even if I start with enough to live in South East Asia + Some Savings(for a rainy day) I'll be happy. So a few questions.

1. How did you get started?
2. What do you do?
3. How do you get clients?
4. What is your schedule like?
5. Is there any growth?
6. How easy/tough is it for you to shift to a permanent gig?

Other people, who are working at or know about companies with great work from home/anywhere opportunities please comment about such companies!
People selling leads, please stay away."

4rtnj1,3,2016-07-08,The Bird Island Raptor,Hack_Shuck,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4rtnj1/the_bird_island_raptor/,"This didn’t happen to myself; it happened to my close friend Gillian about 12 years ago. I was previously aware of the bare bones of the story, but not all of the details, as she never liked to talk about it. However I recently told her about this subreddit and how awesome and addictive it is, and (don’t ask me how) I’ve persuaded her to spill the beans. She does not want me to reveal the exact location of the place where these events took place, as she knows a few people who still work around there; in her field of work, everyone sort of knows everyone else, and she doesn’t want to ruffle any feathers. So I will refer to this place as ‘Bird Island’.


She told me all of this last night over a bottle of wine, believe me I have never felt more in need of a drink in my life. I made notes and have tried to present her testimony as accurately as possible. Over to Gillian:


“When I was studying for a biology degree, specializing in ‘habitat diversity’, I had the opportunity to obtain some rare work experience conducting daily wildlife surveys on an uninhabited island off the coast of the UK. For a single week, in mid-August, I would take a boat out to Bird Island and spend most of the day counting the numbers of various species of birds which nested there, as well as collecting data on the breeding numbers of a particular species, known as the black guillemot, which had only recently re-established a breeding colony there, must to the excitement of ornithologists.


These surveys were undertaken literally every week of the year, six days a week, by a team of three professional conservationists who took turns visiting the island, but on that particular week, no-one was available. I jumped at the chance, as this entire field of work is insanely competitive, and anything of this nature looks great on your CV. I know of some great guys who have doctorates in biology and biodiversity and similar disciplines, and they are literally begging for work as unpaid interns just to gain some crucial experience.


So anyway, I accompanied one of the regular staff to Bird Island for three days, so he could show me the ropes. To be honest, he was quite an eccentric guy who made repeated clumsy attempts to hit on me, but I never felt uncomfortable in his presence, as he seemed pretty harmless, and I doubt he is linked to the strange events that followed. I just got the impression he was very lonely, and to be fair, it is lonely work. He taught me how to count large numbers of birds, which isn’t as tricky as it sounds, and of course to identify the different species on the island, including razorbills, kittiwakes and cormorants, which are also known as “shags”, which is hilarious if you are British and immature, like I am.


He told me the history of the island, which is classed as a ‘Special Protection Area’, which basically means that no-one is allowed to visit without a damn good reason. Nobody has lived there for over a thousand years. There used to be a monastery there but all that remains of it is a few scattered stones. Local legend has it that a terrible plague of rats devoured all of the monks food one winter, but they refused to leave the island, believing that God would provide for them. So every day they prayed for sustenance in their increasingly weakened states, but I guess God expects you to have a little bit more common sense than that, as every monk except one starved to death. Or so the story goes.


The rats returned about 100 years ago, accidentally reintroduced, probably due to Victorian sight-seers taking pleasure trips out to the Island. It is located about three miles from the mainland but only about 300 yards from a much larger, inhabited island, which would be my home for this unusual summer holiday job. Bird Island is less than half a mile long, and about 200 feet high at it’s highest point, with extremely steep sides which can only safely be scaled by the use of an ancient set of steps, allegedly carved by the monks over many centuries, which wind their way gradually up to an uneven grassy plateau. It’s similar to the island at the end of the most recent Star Wars film in that it is rugged, untamed and breathtaking.


There is no fresh water except rainwater, and nothing much ever grew there, food-wise. There is only one way to access the island and that is via a small wooden jetty built within a natural harbor. All around the rest of the island there is nothing but sheer cliff faces, and shallow sea-caves. Apart from the grass on top, the island is grayish-black, very craggy, and on literally every ledge and outcrop there sits a bird or two. So how do you count literally thousands of birds? By guessing, is the short answer. You sort of count the birds in an imaginary “block” in your head, and then extrapolate that figure over the whole island. I could go into more detail, but I will spare you that.


The other main part of my job was to play a recording of a black guillemots mating call into the entrance of every tunnel and cave on the top of the island, and wait to hear if there was a response. These babies were the real reason we were there. The rats had completely wiped them out very quickly a century ago by first stealing their eggs, and then when that supply ran out, by grabbing and devouring the birds themselves. The other species were decimated too, but managed to cling on in smaller numbers, until finally a couple of years before I came to Bird Island, the rats were systematically poisoned. And et voila, the black guillemots returned. But rats are great survivors, and so our job was to ensure that the bird numbers were increasing and breeding future colonies, free from predatory eyes.


The first time I approached the island by myself, in a little motor boat on very calm water, I felt a sense of anxiety due to the sheer isolation of the place. I remember deeply regretting my decision to accept the job, and my hands were shaking so badly that it took several attempts for me to tie the boat’s rope to a post on the jetty. But I shook off these feelings of unease as I began ascending the hundreds of stone steps, stopping several times to make my counts of the different bird species, at the vantage points which my associate had shown me. Despite him being a bit of a creep, I wished he was still there with me that day, especially when I reached the plateau to find a pathway trodden down in the long dry grass, snaking off into the distance, in an area which I was sure neither of us had walked through. But I dismissed this as my mistake, and besides, I couldn’t exactly abandon the job on day one just because of a bit of crushed grass.


My mood improved as I began the task of playing the bird calls on my little tape recorder, as I heard the distinctive response of a black guillemot from about half of the small cave entrances, a sure sign that they were nesting there in good numbers. It took me about five hours to check every cave and tunnel; some of these stretched all the way down to the ocean below, and were just about wide enough for a person to fit through. Or fall through. I had to watch my footing with great care. Another danger was a huge number of small potholes scattered about, hidden by the grass, which could have easily led to a broken ankle. I had no way to contact anyone from up there, as my only means of communication was an old-fashioned radio on the boat. If I didn’t return to the small hotel on the larger nearby island, the staff there would have eventually noticed my absence and sent help, but I still could have faced several hours alone and in pain.


Things went well for the first couple of days, and I soon fell in love with the place. I will never forget eating my sandwiches with my feet dangling over the edge of a 200-foot drop, with nothing ahead of me except the midday sun and several thousand miles of Atlantic ocean, with sea-birds circling and suddenly diving for fish. But soon my edginess began to creep back. Doubts began to surface about me having the island all to myself. On the third or fourth day, I dropped the practice of eating lunch with my back the island, as when I stood and turned around, I saw what looked like more trampled grass than one set of feet would have made. I called out “who’s there?” And immediately felt stupid when only five thousand cormorants answered.


I began to work faster, looking forward to Saturday, my last day of the job. But still I took great care to be as accurate as possible, as I take a huge pride in any work such as this. I had seen no evidence of rats so far, and found more black guillemot nests than expected, which was all cause for celebration. However, I was starting to find some strange discrepancies in my recorded notes, as some of the caves and narrow passageways had seemingly contained birds one day but not the next, which made no sense, unless they were perhaps becoming wise to my presence.


Things started to go badly wrong on the Friday. The sea became a little bit choppier, not so much to be dangerous but enough to put my nerves on edge. It had rained in the night, and the steps were treacherously slippery, with nothing much to hold onto as I climbed. The birds were not co-operating so much in my counts, constantly taking off, circling, and landing again in a different place, making any degree of accuracy impossible. To make things worse, the feelings I had of being watched seemed to magnify that day, and I felt jumpy and unsafe, constantly looking back over my shoulder. And when I reached the plateau I was greeted by a dead black guillemot, clearly left for me to find. I turned the bird over in my hand, it was beautiful and surprisingly heavy, it’s feathers soft and smooth. There were no bite-marks, no blood. I couldn’t say for sure, but thought the thing had been throttled to death.


I angrily cried out “If you have a problem with me, fine, but don’t take it out on a bird, you freak!” and this disturbance made several hundred birds of all kinds take to the air and begin to call out deafeningly. The pandemonium still hadn’t subsided when I left for the day, and I was in a terrible mood and unable to concentrate on my work. I could barely hear the calls from inside the caves and crevices, and they seemed to be far fewer in number than the previous day.


So Saturday came around at last, and it rained hard all day, but the sea wasn’t too bad. And I had gotten pretty good at handling the boat by then. As I tied the boat to the post on the jetty I felt good in spite of everything. I think I was buoyed by the thought that soon my experience here would be over, and I could get back to the mainland that night and sink a few pints of beer and reflect. The birds more cooperative that day as I counted them; in fact they seemed subdued, perhaps due to the bad weather. The steps were a nightmare again, but I took my time and great care, as I was determined not to rush that day and make a mess of everything. I was startled though to hear a commotion from up on the plateau, which consisted of the unmistakable sounds of many black guillemots, normally very quiet birds. I finished my counts for the final time, and as I placed my notebook away, I remember keeping the pen firmly gripped in my fist, in case I needed a weapon.


I approached the summit in a state of fear, and was not surprised to find another black guillemot lying on the ground, this one still flapping a wing as if only recently attacked. I could tell pretty quickly that both its wings had been broken. This cemented my resolve, though. Whatever was going on, I was going to finish the job I been sent there to do. And besides, I told myself, this could all just be a bunch of weird coincidences, combined with my mind playing tricks. Who wouldn’t be a little spooked, spending their first week on their own private island?


I made my way around the same dark cave entrances, playing the recording on my cassette player and hearing even less responses than previously. Hardly a surprise, I thought, if some jerk was indeed going around murdering all the birds. A few times, as I crouched down to listen, I thought I heard dull footsteps, near the top of the steps, but due to the sound of the increasingly heavy rain, I couldn’t be sure what I was hearing. When I was on the very far side of the island, near where I had sat and ate lunch on more carefree days, I thought I glimpsed something moving, then ducking down into the long grass as I stood up and stared in it’s direction. But by the time I had raised my binoculars, there was nothing to see. It had seemed big, maybe six feet tall, and very thin. But it could have been nothing. The lenses were already hazy from the rain, anyway. I might have seen it again a little later, but again I couldn’t be sure. I was cursing my luck to be so isolated and drenched on such a miserable rock. But soon I had finished recording my data, and i hurried back across the island, not taking as much care to avoid the holes in the rocky ground as I should have.


But as I passed one of the larger caves, not far from the steps which led down to the jetty, I was stopped in my tracks by the sound of a black guillemots mating call, more loud and clear than any I had heard before. It should only have made this call in response to the prompt either from my cassette or a potential mate. I leaned down, and listened carefully. This opening was maybe three feet across, and like all of these caves it was absolutely pitch dark inside. I slowly reached for my tape recorder, but before I pressed the ‘play’ button, I heard the call again. And again. And again.


Followed by a cough. A human cough.


I backed away, in a state of shock, and very nearly put my foot into a deep, nasty pothole. “Who is there?” I demanded, then repeated. There was nothing for a long time, then the call again, but different. Deeper, more masculine. I ran, taking no care at all with the steps but literally leaping down, several at a time. I looked back up the hill whenever I could, but the steps meandered so much that you couldn’t always see very far up. I had almost reached the jetty when I saw to my horror, over a cliff edge, that my little boat had been untied, and was bobbing in the sea about forty feet away from the island. I hurried to the end of the wooden platform and wasted no time in lowering myself into the freezing British sea. Even in the summertime, it is horrendous.


The boat was clearly accelerating away with each wave, but I have always been a strong swimmer and soon I managed to grab onto the loose rope which I was sure I had tied firmly to the post a few hours previously, and with a considerable struggle I clambered aboard and started the engine, emitting curse-words with every breath. I steered the boat around in an arc and was soon speeding away, with fury in my eyes. I scanned the top of the island for the final time, but saw nothing. No-one. I cannot begin to tell you how much easier my nights would have been ever since that wretched week, if I had just been given indisputable confirmation that some utter arsehole had been on that island with me. Instead I am left to endlessly replay the events in my head, to try to convince myself that I didn’t lose my mind. Though I rarely replay the voice from that cave. When I am awake, anyway.


What happened next? Nothing much. The police found no trace of anyone in their half-hour search of the island. I complained to my university, who had arranged the work experience on my behalf, but there wasn’t much that they could do beyond recommend that in future, all surveys on similar islands are conducted in pairs. However, I know for a fact that in the years since, female students have gone back there alone.


The environmental organisation which managed the island were very nice to me, but I sensed from the beginning that they didn’t believe my claims. Their logic was that no-one could have spent a week living on the island without leaving more and clearer signs of their presence, so if anyone had been there, it must have been local kids messing around. Even though the island is meant to be off-limits, they told me that they were aware of quite a few people sneaking onto it, and that unofficially, one of the reasons they conduct such regular surveys there was so that trespassers might thusly be discouraged. Great! So I was an unpaid security guard. They also suggested that perhaps I hadn’t tied the boat’s rope securely enough on that last day, or perhaps the rain had somehow loosened the knot, which seems ridiculous to me.


What’s especially unsettling is a thought which didn’t occur to me until much later: how did the creep know that Saturday was to be my last day on the island, and save his meanest tricks for that day? Had he been watching the other surveyors come and go, knowing that they always had Sundays off? And had he been waiting for a female to be there all alone?”"

Just like the title says - I'm a self-taught web developer, aiming to find my first dev job (currently working in an unrelated role). I've mainly worked so far with HTML, CSS and JS (inc. touching on Node), but am now focusing more on Python and Java, since Java in particular seems to be in pretty big demand in the local market.

So any advice at all would be greatly appreciated! E.g. are there any companies in particular that are particularly open to taking on self-taught devs as interns, juniors?

And what are your experiences with the local job market? I'm finding it a bit tough to get attention from recruiters - are they the best way to go since they can spin your prev experience and enthusiasm, or would you be better speculatively emailing specific firms directly?

Thanks in advance guys, appreciated!"

4rugms,133,2016-07-08,The real reason why I lost weight - I want to get far in life and I realized I couldn't do that while fat.,sweetjesusonastick,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/4rugms/the_real_reason_why_i_lost_weight_i_want_to_get/,"This is a thought that I've been chewing on for a while and can comfortably say that this is exactly why I decided to lose weight in the first place despite trying to rationalize other reasons earlier in the process. It's a shallow reason, but unfortunately true. 
&amp;nbsp;

I don't live in the US, I actually attend uni in a foreign country where obesity and being overweight is not normal. The program I am doing is stressful, highly competitive and has a high drop-out rate and I'm quite proud to say that I will be entering the final year. However, the last three years was a struggle. I struggled with being respected by teachers, I was mostly ignored by classmates, and I noticed I had to defend myself and my work more than others during presentations. I made a few good friends, but it was usually after they got to know me. My self-worth and confidence has gone incredibly down as a result, and it has caused me to become anxious and have panic attacks before presentations. It felt like the teachers were especially critical and sometimes even cruel in their feedback. There's even one teacher that has been absolutely horrible towards me, a downright bully, and I can't escape him because he teaches classes in multiple years. This teacher would either completely ignore me, even when I would be directly talking to him, he would disparage my work, then some weeks be very supportive and excited about my project, then smack me down the next week and tell me my work was shit. I am not exaggerating here. He would use the word ""shit"" a number of times. There would be no apparent reason for this bullying, and classmates that would normally not associate with me would come up and ask if I were ok, and wondered why he was especially rude to me. 
&amp;nbsp;

So, this is the realization: I was the only fat person in the *entire program*. In the entire four year program with approximately 120 students, I was the only one who was not just overweight, but obese. 
&amp;nbsp;

This epiphany happened when I remember the time I had lost some weight in the second year due to a stomach ulcer, and people were suddenly nicer to me. I actually received the highest grades I had achieved to date and teachers were more attentive. However, I gained that weight back over the next semester, and the same people were back to being disrespectful. I was at my highest weight, and the same awful teacher was even more horrible towards me. Other teachers took a cue from him, and treated me in a similar fashion. It was an absolute nightmare, and I barely passed through. To add to this, we had a new classmate who was about 50 lbs heavier than I was. She was treated so badly, that she quit! So, I had enough. I realized that if my teachers and classmates treated me like this, in a supposedly ""safe place"", how would future employers treat me? Would I be rejected for a job because of my weight? If I were to become employed, would I get the same opportunities, promotions and raises as my thinner colleagues? I'm not in America where obesity is commonly accepted. I'm going into a field that is competitive, male-dominated, stressful, and look-centric. My life in Europe as a fat woman would be negatively impacted **because of the way I looked**. So the answer to my questions were all in the negative. That is what really prompted my weight loss. I want to be successful, make a load of money, and get my name out there. I do good work; I've received numerous awards and have had my work published in several magazines. But the way I was being treated in person was not matching to the way I was treated when my appearance was unknown. I couldn't take it anymore, and that was when something ripped open in my mind and I finally decided that I had to lose weight to be accepted. It was depressing but also a huge reality check. The US has completely normalized obesity and people absolutely do not realize how much of a problem it is until they live in a different country. It definitely took me way too long for me to come to this realization. 
&amp;nbsp;

As a side note, in the third year we have a semester off for internships. So, I haven't seen my classmates, friends or teachers since January. I started my weight loss a year ago, but the 20 lbs I had lost while at school went unnoticed. But I've now lost a total of 55 lbs (25 kg), and plan on losing another ten before school starts again in September bringing me to 140 lbs. My weight loss will definitely not be so unnoticeable then. I'm very curious to see how the school year pans out, see if my realization had any merit and if my work and myself are treated with more respect. Maybe the awful teacher might be nicer? Wouldn't that be a laugh. However, if nothing changes, then I'll just have to suck it up and get through the year, but at least I'll be in better health while doing it."
4rurku,72,2016-07-08,Is it normal to be 6+ out from a CS degree and unable to find gainful employment?,DisassembledObject,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4rurku/is_it_normal_to_be_6_out_from_a_cs_degree_and/,"Title says it all. Throwaway account because I don't really want to reveal information about myself. I recently got my CS degree. Have a 3.296 final GPA. Have trouble translating what exactly a CS degree qualifies me for. It's hard even getting companies to even respond and I don't know what to do. I feel comfortable with the idea of technical interviews, but I haven't been able to secure them. 

I had an internship in QA automation, but to be honest, I hated every second of doing it. I didn't push myself through school just to be put in a corner and fix broken tests in a department with high turnover. Said company was only hiring for these positions and the pay was really low for my area. Since then I had a remote contract doing swe/consulting but said client stopped responding/paying after hitting a major deliverable. 

Is it normal for a CS grad to have seemingly no stable prospects? 

Is there some secret to finding actual salaried positions? 


edit: Missed a word in the title. '6+ Months out from a CS degree' is what I meant to say.
This just feels like a big bait and switch to go from doing well in school(and leaving another career to pursue school), to teetering on poverty now due to unemployment and no means to even begin paying off loans. 

Sorry if this seems like a rant, it probably is.

I previously worked with Drake &amp; G-Eazy’s manager and most recently, I was working as the intern for LOUDPVCK. I’ve been involved in the music scene for quite a while and I’ve been a consistent r/trap visitor for such a long time now…you guys are dope. Anyways, I’ve been making a lot of moves lately and have decided to start my own collective. (Examples: Soulection, Moving Castle, Daruma, etc.)

There’s so much good music out there that I feel doesn’t get the recognition it deserves. I’m constantly on Soundcloud digging for gems and have found so many low-key artists that I think would be huge if they had the right team behind them and a good platform to release their tunes on. So I’ve been actively watching the way a lot of these collectives have been doing their thing and I have a lot of respect for what they’ve accomplished but what it made me realize is that I can start one as well, especially with my connections and the team I have behind me. I’ve been formulating this idea for a while so I think now is the perfect time to start.

With that being said, I’ve found so many bangers and amazing music on r/trap that I figured I’d reach out to you guys as well. So much talent on here! If any of ya’ll are interested in releasing something thru the collective or just simply want to get involved somehow, please let me know! Right now, I’m currently in the process of recruiting artists for the team so that I can plan out the first few releases so if you’re interested, send me an email with your tunes to LEVWHATSNEVER@GMAIL.COM or send me a message on soundcloud -- https://soundcloud.com/levtheboy [Any kind of music, doesn’t necessarily have to be trap]

I’m also simultaneously working on the branding, artwork, social media, etc… there’s a lot of things involved to this but me and my team are definitely putting in work. If you aren’t a musician but feel like you can still help out somehow, feel free to email me as well because there may be something you can do! This is a big project and I’m strategically taking steps towards making this a reality so receiving any kind of help is always appreciated.

I want to create something legendary and leave a positive legacy on this music scene so I’m gonna really give it my all and see where this goes. I just want to bring quality music to the world and with the amount of incredible tunes that go under the radar these days, I think it’s totally possible to make this happen. Send me an email/SC message and I’ll be checking them all out ASAP! I’ll be listening/reading everything you guys send me and will be sure to reply to the people who show potential. I already have a few well-recognized artists who are down so I’m just adding on to the team and expanding the roster. 

Let’s make history and give this music industry something fresh.

I decided since I was going to be living in a new state for that amount of time I should attempt to meet people and enjoy myself, so, my roommate suggested that I try tinder. She told me it was a good way to meet people and have fun, nothing too serious. I took her word for it and started an account, this was my first experience with the app. I was super-liked by a guy (25) and we started talking, we decided to hang out and we hit it off immediately. 



Fast forward 2 months, we are together basically every waking moment that I am not at work. We do everything together and have started this amazing bond that I have never had before. It has moved so fast, I should add that I have not been serious with anyone in almost 3 years and usually don't form relationships with people so rapidly. I was certainly not expecting to meet someone that I have so much in common with and generally care for. Just last night we both downloaded the pokemon go app and walked around downtown Santa Fe for hours, laughed, talked, and had an amazing night, he makes dinner for me almost every night, we have taken numerous random road trips together, everything we do together is just so relaxed and fun, not to mention the sex is some of the best I have ever experienced. 



So here's where it gets tough, I have to go back home, a few states away at the end of August. I have been up front about this information from the very beginning. We have talked about possible options for us a few times but often we try to avoid the topic because it is hard for us to talk about and none of the options are what we want. Should we continue the relationship, getting closer and closer, just to be heartbroken when I have to go home? I certainly don't want to end the relationship. I don't know exactly why I'm posting, I guess I'm hoping someone might have some advice, maybe a scenario I haven't thought of, or maybe someone has been in a similar situation, or maybe I just need someone to tell me how stupid and childish I am being. Well, I'd love to hear your thoughts. 


TL;DR He (25M) and I (21F) have gotten very close in a short amount of time and I don't know what to do since I am moving soon. "

For my last two internships I've worked at the same company in Waterloo. I intend to return here when I graduate and I was wondering how much I can negotiate when I start full-time, or if its even possible to negotiate?

My previous intern salaries were roughly $44K $52K yearly, I know some of the full-times are in the 80K-90K range for similar positions that I will be working.

I enjoy what I do but does it make sense to look for competing offers? How early should I start?

Thanks!"

-Experience with MS Office, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook.
-Prior experience working in an office setting, including answering phones and emails.
-Social media proficiency.
-Experience in community engagement, corporate citizenship &amp; social responsibility, event planning, urban development, or social media/branding a plus

I've been searching since then for a ""real job"" without luck. I studied Communications focused on film and TV production. It was a state school, so the film/TV program was not of any renown, nor did it allow me to get hands-on experience with real, professional equipment. I had at first been searching for film and television production jobs, at big companies like ESPN and ABC, as well as production assistant jobs at local news channels. No such luck. I ended up working retail, spent a few months in LA working as a production assistant, and now I'm back working retail and trying to be a production assistant on the side. I'm living in a state (MA) where the film/TV industry is not very active so it's difficult to find jobs in that vein.

At this point, I'm trying to find a ""real job"" AKA a 9-5 M-F professional-type job that pays better than retail. Preferably, it'd be something still in-state or not far away as my girlfriend has another year left of college and I'd like to be close to her. The big problem I'm having though is finding the ""right"" job. The ones I have applied to I haven't even made it to the interview round.

We have free coffee in the place we ‘work’ we are both students.
I am moving cities in about 2 months and leaving but he is staying. I don’t know if that has anything to do with this.

I have been away for an internship I came back for a weekend. He rarely goes out but he came out to see me because I returned to the city. At the party he was awkward and I said “I’m cold” and another guy put his coat on me and held my waist but I pushed him off. Then when I tried to talk to the guy of interest he was more cold and didn’t even ask me how I was doing. He kept checking his watch and then he left. I followed him and hugged him and said I don’t want you to go he said I know. I let go I asked “what did I do wrong” he responded “don’t worry about it” then he slammed his door and drove off.

Then I sent a message basically comparing myself to his ex saying I am not pretty enough good enough or maybe he hated my hair. It was one of those annoyingly lengthy texts to which he only responded “I am just don’t feel the same way about you that you feel about me” Then I responded I am not infatuated with you I am just insecure and I was just very candid in my comparison but you know me well enough. Then I basically said he was being kind of arrogant to which he basically claimed “I’m sorry you wanted to be more—I didn’t I thought I made myself clear” then I said you had ample opportunity over the past few months and then he made a comment about coffee being a euphemism for dating.

So after I helped him in January out I jokingly asked in French “when are you asking me out for coffee” he said “pardon your French”. Why was he so visibly upset now then? I have been repeating the fact that I like him he had months to set me straight—why yesterday then? Now he is making it seem like that coffee interaction was basically him saying no we could only be friends. When that interaction was not clear in any sense of the word since it was a pun. But if we were only friends then WHY does he really care about me, why did we go on dates, why did he apologize every time it seemed like I was sad for not spending time with him, why did he want to spend time with me? I have been very candid with my feelings. So why did it take him until after the party to be that succinct.

NOTE: I sent the self-deprecating texts AFTER he was rude NOT BEFORE
So please don't paint me out to be someone who he was annoyed by that was hanging around because that's not the reality of the situation. 

**He had ample time to make statements, we went out, went to the movies etc. this has all been in public. I have flirted with him publicly before and he never made anything 'clear' like he claims. There's no way I would have continued if he made his disinterest crystal clear. So why ruin the 4th of July and act like an asshole to me when he was never going to see me again anyways?**"

I'm currently interning at a startup where I'm primarily doing backend web development with .NET and a bit of React on the front-end. 

I'm definitely learning a lot in the internship, but I'm wondering what I should learn in my free time, especially after the internship ends.

I want to get better at web development, so I was thinking about learning and doing more projects in React and getting really good at JavaScript (currently I'm not). To do this I would probably work on some full-stack web app projects. 

On the other hand, I'm much more interested in actual Computer Science over development - I'd prefer reading CLRS and studying machine learning/AI, and doing ML/neural network related projects. 

What does reddit think I should focus on this summer, and what would overall be better for my career (aspiring to be a high-ranking engineer at a startup)? Learning webdev and a lot of front end, or focusing on core CS concepts and ML (an area that I enjoy the most)?

tl;dr = Manager doesn't think I've achieved project MVP goals, even though I have. Stuck on project I feel is done. Manager gives vibe that he thinks I'm dumb.

Personally, no, I do not think the internship has been going badly. I was given an intern specific project to do with another department. I've achieved all the 'milestones' that were outlined in the MVP plan. I started out with no knowledge of what I was doing, and got no output the first 2.5 weeks. But I'm done way ahead of schedule. There were some stretch goals in the MVP, which we didn't think we would achieve during the internship. I started and finished all of those this afternoon after lunch. I feel like after all this time,  I know what I'm doing and I'm very comfortable with frameworks, and the codebase.

However, I think my manager thinks I'm an idiot. He is a really nice guy, and I respect his leadership, so it's not that I have any personal issue with him. He has never looked at my code, or commits (even commit messages). I think he was under the impression that the hardest part of the project could be done by using a library (it can't, there isn't a library that could do that). He mentioned 2.5 weeks ago that maybe it was time for me to get my modularized code into the framework. I told him I had done that more than a month before. I'm not sure now if believed me then.

I gave a mini-presentation to him and 10 other devs (apparently it's the halfway point of the project?). And I made the app really simple and straightforward to use. So I was done walking through the app in a couple of minutes.  He asked a number of questions about features in the app he thought should be there, and my answers were either 
1. I already have that feature, here let me show you, OR 
2. I have that feature built already, but it's not supposed to be shown in the UI, I'm waiting on the other department to provide analytics which would dynamically change the UI, but everything is set to go.

The questions other devs asked were all related to design decisions, which were all decided by my manager, and I basically just spend 15 mins defending his design and his reasoning. And some really weird moments where some devs suggested ""you know what would be really cool, if you could....."" and these were followed by me answering ""it already does that, i showed it to you, lemme show it again"", or ""that would not be possible, due to other department""

After the meeting, he mentioned that there were still milestones to achieve for the MVP, and mentioned all the things he had asked about (which I had already talked to him about and showed those were there already). I don't know how I could explain it any better to him. To be honest, I had been getting a weird vibe that there must be something I'm missing, but I asked my mentor(who's seen all my code) about milestones, and he said my app achieves all of them. I want to move on from this project and work on some production apps with them, but it doesn't look like I'm going to be allowed to move on from this project until I achieve those ""goals""...

I was extremely downcast after the mini-presentation, and I don't feel some of the good work I've done or progress I've made have been genuinely looked at by anyone other than my mentor.


Genuine question: How do improve interpersonal skills so that this kind of situation does not happen? I feel like this internship is fucked now anyways (in terms of chances of getting hired full time), so I'm just asking for future.

Everything has been fantastic and games have been played on high settings without lag etc. However, it has now changed as newer games are released (getting back to it after three years of being a casual) and it forces me to play with low settings, yet they may still lag. This is not the way I want it. I want good looking games to be able to look the way they are supposed to, even if I've got 20 reddit tabs and several other applications running in the background.

What do you recommend me doing? What is worth spending money on? Should I try to find another 5870, or just a new card? If so, what card? Should I buy something else? I'm not a very rich man of any kind, but some money might be worth spending.

My current build is:
Socket 1366 ATX Intel X58 (ASUS)
ATI Radeon HD 5870 1GB (ASUS)
OCZ Intern SSD 120GB agility 3 series SATA 3. (added later than the rest)
800W PSU (cooler master silent pro gold)
GT 6GB (3x2gb) DDR3 2000MHz (corsair)
3x 1TB hard drives, one internal. None of which runs the OS.
Intel Core i7 930 2,8GHz, 8MB, 4,8GT
ASUS Xonar Essence STX
To cool I use a Noctua somethingsomething big and quiet and a few smaller fans.
I use 2 modern 24"" monitors and run windows 7, 64bit.

I did some basic testing just now, by running black ops 3 (settings at lowest possible, still some lags) (first time playing! Not impressed):
The GPU got up to 83 celsius, and was said to have 96% activity. Its fan ran at 50% or close to it.
The CPU really bounced up and down from 20% to almost a 100. Temperature at 50-60 Celsius.
My RAM was at 5.75GB or more, out of the 6GB I've got.
No, the SSD is not full or almost there.
Worst thing is windows telling me every component is high end, just like when it was bought.

We live in Australia in the same capital city. Charlotte lives in Paris as a French to English translator and married a Frenchman 3 years ago that she first met on a study abroad/internship trip about 6 or 7 years ago. 

Mother has been diagnosed with terminal cancer in April. She's not expected to live more than 12 months. 

I'm the youngest of 2 kids and have an older sister who we'll call Charlotte. Charlotte has always been my parents favourite kid and always been on the spoiled side, ESPECIALLY by my father. Whatever Charlotte wanted, my father made happen. Charlotte always got the biggest room in the house, Charlotte always had more stuff, Charlotte always got the expensive extra activities and mine had to fit around hers. Charlotte always got to pick what was on TV in the playroom. You get the idea. She got amazing grades in school and was the golden child. I moved out of home by 18, didn't finish school, married and had kids early. Haven't been back since. Work as a plumber. Wife does admin work. Academics aren't our thing. Haven't always liked work but whatever. My life is alright. Working class, but we have a home, great kids, life is good. Love my wife to death. 

Charlotte went to University, got mediocre grades in a history degree with a minor in French cultural studies after dropping the law half of her degree, blamed depression on the grades and dropping law. Graduated anyway, my parents acted like it was the biggest deal anyway. She then worked in a call centre which she said made her 'suicidal'. She would dramatically say she wanted to die so she never had to work her job again. Father convinced Charlotte to quit because it was 'heartbreaking' to see her so miserable (she's always been a bit lazy). She did that, moved home, they coddled her for a couple of years, she saved and went overseas for a holiday (I've never left Australia) and they encouraged her to go back to University to study French and translation since she's always been interested in French culture. They'd have never let me get away with this. But it's ok when it is Charlotte. She was 28 by this. She did a BA and a Masters. Charlotte managed to learn both near fluent French and Spanish. My parents gave Charlotte a LOT of financial help to do this. Got a job in Paris following an internship, graduated at 34, and now lives in Paris with her well off husband. They have chosen not to have kids. Charlotte is always banging on on Facebook about how much she loves France and is forever instagramming it. 

Parents still act like Charlotte is the bees knees after all this. They love my kids, but it's like I don't matter as much. I imagine any child of Charlotte's would be the instant favourite. 

Now my mother has terminal cancer and despite having 3 kids of my own to look after, the responsibility of looking after her has fallen on the shoulder of my wife and I while Charlotte continues living in Paris. It really bothers me but my mother has just said 'well, that's where her job is'. I asked my mother about changing the inheritance to be for just my kids since we are doing all the work of looking after her and my mother just said that it should be equal and I can't demand more because I chose to have kids. 

When I pointed out all the money they gave Charlotte for 2 degrees and a masters, she said we have always said we will help with education for kid. I pointed out I have 3 kids and she said my wife and I can use our half to help them. She meant me and Charlotte. 

Charlotte doesn't need the money. We do. We are looking after our dying mother/MIL, Charlotte continues to live in Paris. 

It feels unfair and I think my mother should change her mind. I've asked Charlotte to move back and help and she just says she 'can't' because she 'needs her job in the future' even though her husband can more than afford to support her. We're making sacrifices to help with mum. Charlotte is doing nothing. Charlotte is planning to come at Christmas, but said she can't just quit her job and move back here for a 'ton of reasons'. My wife and I are doing *everything* while Charlotte carries on as normal in France. 

It's really bothering me. 
   
**tl;dr**: Sister moved to Paris after getting our parents to pay her living expenses for 2 degrees and a masters now won't come home to help care for her. Mother still wants to split inheritance half even though Charlotte isn't helping to care for her and Charlotte has been given more financially over the years. "

I am already taking the intro to computer science course(free) from Udacity. I would like to apply for internships as soon as I'm a freshman and I was thinking that having these certs could help me.

Front End Web Developer Nanodegree.(4-6 months)  
Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.(4-6 months)&amp;nbsp;
  
I am not looking for a full time job until I graduate from CS but an internship is really important to me and I don't know if I should pay for the degrees or just take the free courses (money is not that big of an issue and I don't think I would take that long to complete each course).&amp;nbsp;

4ry4t7,0,2016-07-08,[CO] How do I go about reporting my landlord's tax evasion to the IRS?,labelsaredumb,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4ry4t7/co_how_do_i_go_about_reporting_my_landlords_tax/,"My current landlord makes around $5,000 per month from rent. She is a single woman who's never been married and has never had kids. She owns (totally paid off) a 4 bedroom home in the suburbs of Longmont, CO. She's been renting out the 3 rooms she doesn't use to people who want to stay long term and people who are just here for weekends for concerts, festivals, conventions, etc. Her fee ranges from $30 per night to $49 per night (depending on how much business there is). However, her primary tenants are those who rent for about 3 months (usually for a summer internship). She has an Airbnb listing which is used to make the initial payment. I personally asked her to let me pay for a full 3 months on Airbnb right away since it was available and I had no intention of hopping around all summer while I worked full time. However, she insisted on me simply paying for one month. I agreed because she seemed like she knew what she was talking about when she said that, ""perhaps you should do a trial month and see how you like it."" So I only paid the first month via Airbnb. When it was time to pay for another month, she asked me to pay cash so she could, ""avoid Uncle Sam."" So at this point, I realized that I was already in her trap. She's clearly trying to pocket as much as possible by not paying taxes. This week, she gave me a 1 month notice. She is kicking me out. I work full time, I come home, watch netflix on my laptop, then sleep. I have zero presence here. And just so you know, the place is actually super gross and she micro-manages her tenants and does not allow them to have any privacy... so for $900 per month, I've been without privacy and living in a place similar to Section 8 housing in terms of cleanliness/spatial quality. I've woken up in the middle of the night with bugs crawling on me multiple times (this is one of many examples of the lack of cleanliness here). I'm definitely going to report this. Many people who have passed through have expressed their disdain. We aren't even allowed to do our own laundry because the laundry room is located in such a way that you'd have to pass through her personal space. So if she's allowed to literally go through our dirty laundry in order to preserve her privacy, why does she have a rule stating that we should leave our doors open when we leave the house so she knows we aren't home? That's just sketchy. I've come home to find many of my things rearranged and various sticky notes saying that she wants certain windows open and saying that when I brush my teeth, I should turn on the the hot and cold water at the same time. Of course, none of this was listed on Airbnb. She just put all the good stuff on there and then when we arrive, like a new born with no clue about the fresh environment around us, she lays on these rules before we have time to truly assess the situation and know what's actually going on. So how does she have 5 stars on Airbnb? Well, let me tell you about how she approaches her tenants (including myself) saying that we should both give each other 5 stars. This woman's ability to manipulate others is the only thing that's 5 stars about her. So that's my rant. Yes, I've reported the inaccuracy of her listing to Airbnb. Now, I'm here wondering how I would go about reporting this. Perhaps the fire department would do something about how she's managed to create a physical embodiment of a fire hazard. Perhaps the city and their tenancy laws have rules about renting your spaces and the number of people you rent out to and reporting that on taxes. And finally, speaking of taxes, since she's making around $5,000 per month of pure profit from these renters (that's about $60,000 per year....higher than the average american income) I'm sure the IRS would deem this worthy of their time. I want to make sure I report this in the most efficient, most successful way possible. Any advice on how to start? I definitely want to get this right the first time around."

This past week I have taken stock of my life and have realized that I have been overweight and self-concious about it since I was a teenager. This negative perception of myself has cost me so many social opportunities and I've had enough. I'm 24 years old and am so embarrassed of my weight that I have my facebook set to pre-approve tags before they are shared on my wall... so I can filter out the ones that I look too fat in! I also have confidence issues and have never had any kind of serious girlfriend. I'm sick and tired of being the ""chubby one"" in my friends group. I'm sick and tired of looking in the mirror and being disappointed. It's time. It's time to make a change for good. I will be reporting my progress on this subreddit as a way to keep myself accountable. I'll be counting calories and going to the gym 6 days per week. I'm ready to begin a new chapter!



My abbreviated life story, in case anyone is interested or can relate:

I was pretty skinny in my early childhood, but around 4th grade I started putting on weight. My childhood hobbies included Pokemon, soda, and junk food... No sports :(. I was very overweight by the time I reached junior high. About the time I started to be interested in girls I got really self-concious about my weight and image. I was quiet and shy all through junior high and high school, never asked a girl to any dances, never had a girlfriend. Senior year I made some major changes and took up jogging (or any kind of physical activity) for the first time in my life. I went from 200 to 169 lbs over my senior year and unsurprisingly it was by far the best year I had. I tried to keep up my good habits in college but stress from classes and some majorly crappy life events made it easy for me to slip back up to 189lbs. I have yo-yo'd around this weight ever since.

The other aspects of my life are pretty great. I have a really good family situation and a really great group of friends back home. I was always a great student and am currently working on my Masters in Mechanical Engineering. I'm getting great feedback at the internship I'm at right now and will probably return to school with a high-paying job offer.

But.. all these accomplishments don't mean much if you don't have anyone to share them with. My body confidence issues (and other confidence issues) have made it EXTREMELY difficult to make friends outside of my group at home I grew up with. My school and internship are far from home and this past year has been pretty lonely. I'm ready to change that. I know losing weight won't solve all my problems, and I plan to make an effort to be more friendly and outgoing during my transformation.

It's time. It's my time to make a change. I'm done feeling crappy about myself and sitting on the sidelines socially. I'm ready to do what I've been putting off for 10 years. I'm ready to be fit and love life. Today is Day 1, the first day of the rest of my life."
4ry8ns,0,2016-07-08,My [19/m] girlfriend [21/f] has been manipulated into fundamentally changing our relationship,extremedumbass,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ry8ns/my_19m_girlfriend_21f_has_been_manipulated_into/,"I've been dating a girl I met at college for four months now. We are deeply in love, but because of a number of influences, things are changing drastically. Let me give you some background.



&amp;nbsp;

Four months ago I started dating this girl. We'll call her Carly. I quickly found out that she is very religious. I found out that:

* her father is a youth pastor at a church in our hometown.
* she is a group leader at said church and leads small groups on intense mission trips to foreign countries.
* she was a chairmember for a christian sorority.

Needless to say, she is very sexually reserved and was a virgin when we started dating.

&amp;nbsp;

Toward the end of this past spring semester she was informed that an elected officer position was open at her sorority and that no one was in the running. She decided to pursue the opportunity.

This was around April, and we had been ""official"" since late February. As of that April, we finally began to frequently spend the night together, either at her apartment or my dorm, and we were participating in every normal sexual activity short of intercourse. She was very adamant about remaining abstinent, and I respected her wishes.

&amp;nbsp;

During this same time frame, a dramatic situation involving Carly, her best friend Beth, and Carly's two other roommates exploded. Beth and Carly had been self described best friends since the fall, and when I first saw the two together I joked how they seemed much more a couple than Carly and I did. They were very close. But with my increasing involvement in Carly's life, her increasing responsibilities at her sorority, and Beth's own personal problems, their relationship fell apart very quickly.

This started when Beth claimed to be suddenly experiencing absence seizures, although Carly and I never saw a single one. Soon after, Beth visited a doctor who could not determine what was happening. He prescribed medications and referred her to a neurologist, but could not determine the cause. According to Carly, Beth was also suffering anxiety and depression. Unfortunately, Beth claimed that her medications for these conflicted with the epilepsy medications, and would be unable to legally drive.

&amp;nbsp;

From this point on, Carly often provided Beth with transportation. She drove her to school when she could. She drove Beth to her Doctor's appointments, some in town, some as far as sixty miles away.

&amp;nbsp;

Despite Carly's efforts to be there for Beth during this, Beth began treating her very poorly. She drew away from Carly. She stopped answering her texts and calls, started ignoring her and spending more and more time with their other roommate, a woman who I had already determined to be gossipy, rude, and belligerent, an opinion shared by Carly. Beth was deliberately isolating Carly from the other girls at the apartment and was slandering both of us.

Numerous confrontations ensued between the three and I often found myself comforting Carly. During the period of three weeks, I tried to comfort her, in person and through texts. On numerous occasions she was reduced to uncontrollable sobbing that lasted anywhere from five minutes to two hours.

When talking about this recently with a counselor at the hospital Carly interns at, the counselor described Beth's behavior as abusive and manipulative, and likely the result of jealousy. Beth was jealous of me.

By the second time I found Carly crying in my arms I had concluded the same thing. All of this drama began when Carly began spending more time with me and less with Beth. And Carly had by no means abandoned Beth. She frequently canceled plans with me to drive Beth somewhere, or to spend more time with her, etc. Beth was lashing out against Carly by trying to make her jealous herself. But her methods were vicious and were employed solely because of the pain they would inflict.

&amp;nbsp;

During this situation, Beth's school life fell apart and she stopped attending work. By the end of the semester she had failed all of her classes and was out of a job.

&amp;nbsp;

Through all of this, Carly hoped that distance would ease both their wounds. After the semester ended, Beth flew to Europe for a month to be with her boyfriend who had been living abroad since Winter.

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, before their relationship went to shit, Carly and Beth signed a lease on a different apartment for June through next year. So they're now stuck together.

&amp;nbsp;

This brings us to the present. If you're still reading, thanks for coming this far.

&amp;nbsp;

Since returning from Europe, Beth has been actively avoiding Carly. Beth still holds the lease for her previous apartment and will until the end of July. She has spent most of her time there, and despite her insistence that shes trying to move all her stuff over, her room at the new is virtually empty with the exception of a bed and a few of her boxes. According to Carly, Beth has been spending most of her time sleeping lately. A noticeable symptom of depression.

&amp;nbsp;

Now this next part is why I've spent an hour typing this up today.

&amp;nbsp;

Remember that officer position available at the sorority? Carly got it. She ran unopposed, and was elected in the spring. But the only problem is that when she accepted the position, she swore to obey a covenant that among other things, decrees that she will not:

* Have overnight sleepovers with members of the opposite sex
* Engage in premarital sex
* Consume alcohol

Before she even knew she would be elected, she confided in me that the first of those three things was ridiculous and that she would not obey it. And she hasn't. We've still been having sleepovers since then, although only on weekends on account of her schedule and the fact that I'm living at home this summer, and hour and a half away from her. still, I've been there nearly every weekend to stay with her.

&amp;nbsp;

But a few weeks ago something unexpected happened.

&amp;nbsp;

We had sex. 

&amp;nbsp;

It was one of those spur of the moment things. She just decided all of the sudden to put me in, so to speak. Even days afterword she was still processing what had happened. She was understandably upset. She intended to wait for marriage, and then all of the sudden, a huge part of her expectations for the future changed. Something about her was fundamentally altered.

&amp;nbsp;

Since then shes expressed to me her guilt for having done this. She has felt guilty for violating the covenant and breaking her abstinence. But also she told me that because of the Bible's vague definition of sexual immorality, she did not think this was a serious spiritual mistake or a sin. 


&amp;nbsp;

Since the first time we had sex, I've been very clear with her that her wishes are paramount and I will do my best to respect them. If that means that we stop having sex, so be it. Up until yesterday, we had decided to continue.

&amp;nbsp;

If you've stuck around this long, THIS is where it gets interesting.

&amp;nbsp;

On Wednesday I drove to her apartment for the night. At one point that afternoon, we had sex. Afterword I tied the condom up, placed it inside a discarded cardboard toilet paper roll at the bottom of the bathroom trashcan, and covered it with a decent amount of toilet paper. She asked me if I had covered it well and I assured her I did.

&amp;nbsp;

Then yesterday around two p.m. I received a message reading ""BABY WHY DIDNT YOU WRAP UP THE CONDOM YOU PUT IN THE TRASHCAN?!!!! BETH FOUND IT!""

&amp;nbsp;

And we were being so careful to keep this a secret.

&amp;nbsp;

And so Beth found out. She said something along the lines of ""I know your new to this, but next time try to hide your Condom better. Thanks."" Carly called me. I explained how well I hid the condom, and she mentioned she checked the trashcan to see if it was visible, and it wasn't. We still don't know how she found it in the first place. We both agreed that Beth's tone and even the fact that she would bring it up instead of ignore it, well, belligerent. After talking for a few minutes, we hung up while she walked to her car. She texted me that she responded to Beth with something like ""Im not new at this, but I'm sorry, it wont happen again."" Apparently this wasn't the best answer.

&amp;nbsp;

Carly called again, and when I answered, my eardrum was assaulted by her screaming ""SHE JUST CROSSED THE FUCKING LINE"".
Beth had texted her this, verbatim: ""I mean if it doesn't have to do with you being new at this then I'm guessing that means you've been fucking for long enough that you couldn't break the addiction when you signed the code of conduct.""

Too fucking far.

&amp;nbsp;

Carly burst into tears. She tried to call Beth five times, with no answer, and sent her two texts asking why she say something so vicious. It wasn't until ten or so minutes later that she got a reply.

&amp;nbsp;

Beth basically lamented Carly for being a sinful, dishonest officer. She went on about how people like Carly were ruining the Sorority, and how breaking the covenant made her lose all respect for her. She went on about how it made her sick and how her sin was corrupting their Sorority, and that because of it, she was seriously thinking about quitting.

&amp;nbsp;

I'll tell you right now, this hurt Carly. Bad. Before she received this text I made her promise me that she would pull over onto the shoulder of the highway before she looked at it, and she did.

&amp;nbsp;

She sad and wept for ten minutes. Beth hit her right where she felt the weakest. She was already struggling with the guilt of breaking the covenant before Beth brought this up. I concluded right away that this message was engineered with the specific intent of hitting Carly as hard as it could. And it did.


&amp;nbsp;

Carly cried the whole way home and said the her guilt for breaking the covenant almost made her puke. I explained to her that I was certain that Beth's claim that she was upset and disgusted on behalf of the other Sorority members was only a guise, and that her message was a vehicle for hurting Carly and pushing her and I apart. But she wouldn't have it. She interrupted me multiple times saying ""SHES RIGHT. WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING IS WRONG!""

She took this as a wake up call to start following the rules.

&amp;nbsp;

I told her that I accepted the fact that this could be a wake up call to put herself on the right path. I didn't want to argue that then. Somewhere during our phone conversation we determined that Beth would certainly tell someone else that Carly and I were having sex, if not multiple people. At this point her guilt was so great that she intended to tell the President of the sorority about what she had done. At the same time, she was terrified this would get out and not only ruin her reputation, but the reputation of the entire sorority. I even thought the former was certainly possible. So I thought about it and asked her if she'd rather the President and other officers hear this from her or from other people. She decided to tell the President.

&amp;nbsp;

So they talked for hours and somewhere in there Beth called and apologized for going too far, but the damage was done.
Now Carly wants to set herself back on the right path and adhere to the covenant. This pretty much means that from a physical perspective we will go back to where we were one month in. No sex. No sexual touching. Not even fucking sleepovers. She sees Beth's message as a sign that what shes been doing is wrong.

&amp;nbsp;


Now I will understand and accept whatever choices she makes here, but I just have to add how fucking infuriating this is. I'm not mad at Carly, I'm mad at Beth and their sorority. They are literally pushing me away from her. Its hard for me to express in words how angry this makes me. I've realized now that I have a deep and furious hatred for Beth. On one hand I have a group of young women who are imposing what I see as an arbitrary set of rules on my Girlfriend, leaving no room for opinion or interpretation. What they say about intimacy is the law. And if people find out, it could ruin Carly's reputation.
On another, I'm pitted against this parasitic piece of shit who has never done anything other than try to hurt Carly and I. Shes vicious, deceptive, and completely willing to cause as much emotional pain as it takes to get what she wants.

&amp;nbsp;

I've already expressed my feelings about Beth to Carly. So far, shes only said that Beth has helped her see the error in her ways. She sees this blatant act of intentional emotional abuse as a blessing. And this horrifies me.

&amp;nbsp;

As a christian I can completely understand Carly's decision to cut ourselves off from close contact. But that doesn't mean I like it. I fucking hate it. I hate the reason it happened and I hate that other people are basically forcing us to behave in a certain way.

I was calm writing most of this, but now my hearts racing and my muscles are tensing. I'm so fucking livid about this. I feel so trapped here. Thank you for reading this far.

&amp;nbsp;

**tl;dr**: My GF's jealous roommate and former friend is systematically abusing her and trying to pull our relationship apart through emotional manipulation. Has basically caused my GF to go back on her word that her christian sorority oath wouldn't prevent us from being close. Im being forced by third and fourth parties to fundamentally change my relationship with the woman I love.
Somebody please help me. "

I was wondering if anyone can offer me any advice? Basically, I messed up during high school. I did not care to learn, and my parents were fine with me getting horrible grades. I never got into trouble or anything like that. School was just the last thing that was on my mind.

Since I have been out of high school I have worked a few different jobs, but I always felt like I was wasting my time. I finally had the realization that my life was going nowhere, and I needed to figure out something quickly. I decided to start taking online courses from my community college when was 24. I have completed 2 years of general education courses and electives so far. The biggest thing that is holding me back right now is math. I started at the very bottom. I just finished college algebra in the spring, and I am doing trigonometry over the summer. I will finally be able to get into CS classes this fall (college algebra was a pre-requisite). Starting over in math has been a tremendous help though. Math was always my worst subject in high school, and my overall grade from last semester was a 99%.

Sometimes I feel discouraged because I have such a long ways to go before graduating college. I might be 29 or 30 by the time I am done. Is anyone going to take me seriously when I am looking for a job? I see people on here that are way younger than me getting insane job offers. I would love to have a great career working for a big company someday, but I think I'd be perfectly happy with getting an average job.

What can I do while I am in school to give me an edge? I am trying to get the most out of every single class I take, especially math. I have been trying to teach myself as much as I can, but it is hard knowing what to learn. I am building a website to demonstrate my abilities and host my projects. I am keeping my gpa at a 4.0 right now, and I'm hoping that this will help me get an internship next summer.

I would appreciate any advice."

4s050d,29,2016-07-09,Mdisbrow 10x3 Bench Program Review,spellstrikerOTK,powerlifting,https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/4s050d/mdisbrow_10x3_bench_program_review/,"Hey guys, I just finished Mdisbrows 10x3 bench program that he posted a while back and thought I should do a review of it.

NOTE: I made some slight modifications because of time/lack of equipment. For example, the bench variation on day 1 right after the 10 sets varies between CG/Sling Shot. I did knees up bench press instead and did a kind of linear progression for that 5x5. Also on week 9, I messed up and did week 8 weights by mistake. I then did week 10 the next week and just did some doubles instead of triples.

About Me:
Male/19/167lbs

I started lifting for swimming back in grade 9. Not seriously and not intelligently (never did legs/only did dumbbell bench). Started taking benching seriously in grade 11. By February of grade 12, I hit 225 at 148 following essentially a 3x5 twice a week with some 4 week periods of rep work at like 3x10 as a break from heavy weights. I ended up getting tendinitis in both elbows at this time. Probably from a combination of training sprint swimming, benching heavy, and playing dodgeball intramural. 

Ended up taking my time and ensuring that my elbow heals correctly and would never get hurt again. By taking my time, I mean a lot of time --&gt; I didn't bench heavier than 200 until next February when I got 235 at around 168 BW. That was essentially a 1 year plateau which sucked. But I did it pain free. After that, I basically did 3x5 on one day and followed a 5 lb increase every few workouts and a 3x10 on the other day. This got me to 245 at 166 BW. 

Progress:

BW: 163 --&gt; 167 

Bench: 240 --&gt; 265

My attempts were 245, 265 (miss), 255, 265, 275 (missed twice). I think I should take smaller jumps next time I max out.

The BW increase is pretty nice but it wasn't a solid 4 lbs since I weighed myself right after exams which is when I usually lose weight. I have definitely been up in the 169 range before the program. 

I am really happy about the bench increase. 25 lbs in 10 weeks seems like great progress for me.


What I liked about the program:


I really liked the progression in the 10 main sets of bench. Having to do 2 heavy doubles after 8 triples was hard but definitely increased my work capacity for future training. Having 10 sets of triples or doubles also improved my form on heavier weights. I used to do a generic 3x5 and always found reps 4 and 5 to be grinds with tilted movement and inconsistent rep quality. This program forced me to have quality reps on every set or else I would just hurt myself.

The boatload of accessory volume was quite nice as well, although really hard. Next time I do this program or something like it, I want to make sure I actually bulk properly. 



What I would change:


My first change for next time would be to actually do the accessories laid out in the program. 

My second change would probably make it a 5 to 6 week program just because I found 10 weeks of heavy weight was almost leading to elbow pains. Luckily I made sure I was rolling that tendon with a lacrosse ball and doing banded tricep extensions for that blood flow. Those 2 exercises helped avoid any serious pain along with curls. But I think just for me, taking a slight deload or just doing high rep work for a week and then continuing on with the program would help me. (This is mostly a preference IMO and not something everyone would agree with. Its just with my past experience with tendinitis, I get very wary of pains in my elbows)


A note about the volume:


I know someone commented about the high volume saying only an enhanced lifter could do it. Most people disagreed but I just wanted to say, most lifters can get through this program. You just need to be smart with accessories and know when to back off. Its important to know when aches and pains are actual injuries and a time to back off or when those pains are just normal pains from training and you just gotta push through. I'm definitely not enhanced, and apart from the first 2 weeks, the volume was definitely fine. 


My training split during the program:

Monday: Bench 1

Tuesday: Back/Biceps/Light Shoulders

Wednesday: Legs (Cleans/Front Squats/Accessories)

Thursday: Bench 2

Friday: Legs (Cleans/Front Squats/Accessories)

Saturday: Snatches and just general messing around. More of a fun workout for me.

I really only do 6 days/week because I am on an internship and not in school for this term so I have a lot of time.


If anyone has any question, feel free to ask! And if anyone has any suggestions on what other similar programs there are to try, I would love to hear them!

Also just wanted to say thanks to u/mdisbrow his content is great and his program really helped me improve my 1RM as well as rep quality."

&gt; The company sent an email inviting interns to a party, using a cringy version of how kids today speak, then issued an apology within hours of the invites going viral on social networks.

&gt; &amp;quot;In the gamut of things Microsoft has had to apologize for lately, including a racist chatbot and sexy dancers, this might be one of the strangest: The company sent an email inviting interns to a party that begins:&amp;quot;Hey Bae Intern! &amp;lt;3&amp;#039;&amp;#039; and gets worse from there, offering &amp;quot;Lots of dranks&amp;#039;&amp;#039; and the ability to&amp;quot;get lit on a Monday night.

&gt; Since taking over as chief executive officer in 2014, Satya Nadella has been working to update and revitalize Microsoft for the new generation of computing, but this may not be exactly what he had in mind.

&gt; The company issued an apology within hours of the invites going viral on social networks, noting that &amp;quot;The email was poorly worded and not in keeping with our values as a company.&amp;quot; The statement promised an investigation into what happened and appropriate steps to address it.

&gt; Microsoft&amp;#039;s last attempt to target this demographic, the Tay chatbot, also forced an apology in March after internet denizens hijacked it, teaching it to spew racist, sexist and offensive remarks.

&gt; It&amp;#039;s not clear whether the email will help Microsoft get recruits to the event, a multi-company shindig in San Francisco called &amp;quot;Internapalooza.&amp;quot; But if they do show up, perhaps they can be put to work programming Skype Translator to produce a less cringy version of how kids today speak.

4s0i62,2,2016-07-09,Opportunity to move to the Cloud Team,sysadmin75,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/4s0i62/opportunity_to_move_to_the_cloud_team/,"I have been presented with a really awesome opportunity and I wanted to get some more experienced redditors opinion on what they think of this.

Personal Backstory: I'm a millennial in my early 20's and I work in HealthIT for a very large company. I initially started on the Systems Administration team as a intern and was lucky enough to get hired on as a FTE. I have been a FTE for 2 years now and I love my job. Especially the people on my team.

Cloud Teams Backstory: The cloud team was initially brought in because the company wanted to do HCM (Human Capital Management) as all the good HCM products were cloud only, but that project has never taken off as it has been delayed for over a year. They had another large project to push all of our administrative staff to O365, exchange was configured for a hybrid mode and our MDM has been configured to work with it and our governance committee had initially approved the O365 cost, but now they have backed out while not officially saying no.

Company Politics: We are public and used to love CapEx and hate OpEx, we don't do charge backs so currently if a team requests a server they wait about 1-1.5 weeks and they never see a bill for it even if it is a physical server that barely gets used. Whipe the cloud team will be doing charge backs to the correct department and they plan on letting existing teams do alot of the Systems management. We can all tell we are about to get bought as well as our stock has depreciated over the past year when we made a very large acquisition.

Earlier this week I was approached by our company's cloud team to come and join them, I have worked with one of them several times and I enjoy working with them on some smaller scale projects. Though I haven't been previously involved in any of their larger projects like O365 etc. They approached me because of my ability to grasp concepts and my PowerShell scripting skills which are some of the best at the company. 

When I asked what the job would entail I was told that they are not interested in IaaS but more SaaS, specifically with integrating SaaS services in with a product called Okta we bought but failed to make work yet. They have successfully pushed our company's website based on SiteCore to AWS and it is much better than it was when it was hosted on premise.


I am going to be meeting with the cloud team manager here next week to discuss some of the finer points of the job but my current thoughts on it right now like this. In my current position I do entirely on premise work and i almost never have the chance to make anything redundant even though we have a true data center owned by the company and a tier 3 Colo that we use for our DR site. Our operations VP had mandated that our DR site is warm and not active active even though we have a 1Gb WAN circuit and a 10Gb PtP circuit between the sites. I also currently have to work with aged technology due to our current operations VP, we have no distribution layer, our core at the DC is a pair of 6500s and our server access layer is 2960G closest switches without dual power supplies. I also am banned from working with blades or even Hyper Converged as the operations VP micro manages about everything.


I have mentioned what the cloud teams vision is earlier in this post, but my personal opinions are with the current state of the company it seems a bit Rocky but I feel like it would be a move in the right direction considering where I am in my career. As well as some of the larger companies have big cloud initiatives as the future seems to be going to large auto scaling systems.


TLDR; Got approached by our companies cloud team, I think I know what I should do but I want some more opinions from people who are more experienced and it been in the same boat as me.


Also yes this is my Systems throwaway account.

Edit: Added some more information about the cloud team and the financials."

Any advice for oshawa?,Gabbynelly,ontario,https://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/4s0zpj/terminated_g1_exit_test_metro_east_any_advice_for/,"Hi, so I did my first attempt for g1 exit at metro east toronto this past thursday at around 2:15pm. Story short it got TERMINATED after 5 mins. It was pouring mad and I had never driven in the rain once during my 20 lessons with my driving instructor (lucky me the one time I had to drive in the rain all summer was on the test day $#@/^#^#^!!!). When I came to the testing centre i came 30 mins early with my driving instructor in his car. We registered right away (no line) and my driving instructor tried to wipe my side mirrors they had so many driplets i couldnt see them at all. 3 mins after registering the testing guy comes out, my appointment was at 2:45pm he came out like 2:15pm why is he coming out so early ?? my instructor was still giving me advice and wiping my mirrors. This made me more nervous the fact he came in so early i didnt have time to breathe and was still half wet from all the rain. I pull up my windows then move out and approach the two stop signs when exiting out of that damn downhill parking lot exit (keep in mind ive never driven in a parking lot like that that was like on a freaking mountain whenever my instructor took me out for lessons we were always on a flat parking lot i blame my instructor for not preparing me. I also was not allowed to drive on the test route in metro east with my instructor since he would get fined. Since my parents cant drive and everyone i knew who can was on vacation i was not able to practise in that area/parking lot. The only way i could practise was with my instructor and he told me i could do metro east so he booked it for me there -well that was worst thing he ever did for me.) There was a truck coming from left stop sign as i was exitung that downhill parking lot at the corner making a right. It was a tight spot to turn and when i made the turn i end up driving over the curb a bit I COULD HEAR the bump and omg that moment my mind shattered. NOT ONCE in my 20 lessons did i go over curb -in any manouver or driving. I was always aware of my sides using the side mirrors but since it was pouring mad rain i could barely see my side mirrors and anticipated the turn incorrectly. That tripped me so bad that when i went i finally finished that right and then approached the red light he told me to make a right exiting out of the parking lot and i end up driving in the bus lane that was about to end (my driving instructor never told me you werent supposed to drive there i live downtown and we dont have lanes like that i was always told to keep right and then change to left lane if i cant proceed right). I kept going and at that point he tells me to make another right and we go back to the parking lot through the back. Test lasted 5 mins i didnt get to do any manouvers the examiner told me test was terminated due to safety and left. 

The worst part is when i was leaving with my instructor at 2:45 the hard rain pretty much stopped. I think had i driven on the route before/ had practise on a similar tight downhill parking exit with two stop signs or had it not rained HARD and mess up my visibility i wouldnt have done so ***** . I wasnt given a chance to do any manoueveur test was terminated. 

So now my plan is to take my next driving test in oshawa aug 30 where the driving instructor is allowed to let students practise drive on the route and the parking lot is FLAT. I fired my driving instructor he basically ruined my test by not preparing me to drive in testmode in that kind of lot without practise wasted my money. He told me there is reference points when driving i dont need mirrors if i know reference points WELL WHy didnt u tell me that sooner! 

Long rant but yehh just so disappointed in myself. I am an over achiever (16 month internship right now almost done my business degree ). I never failed at anything in my life let alone fail so hard like my g1 exit test . im not stupid i thought i was really prepared based on my lesson performance. I blame my instructor who thought i was ready when i was not. 

Any advice for oshawa driving test?? Im going to do 3 hours driving in oshawa with a new school (milennium driving school in scarborough 150 dollar car rental for oshawa road test cheapest one i found!) before my test doing practise tests on route for the full 3 hour. And maybe 2 or more hours in toronto between now and aug 30 before test so im familiar with their car/instructor and get my reference points down. I google earth the route and the roads/parking lot seem similar to the lessons i have with my old instructor.

Good luck me wish me luck!!! Advice pls and thanks!"
4s140j,142,2016-07-09,Family made my law school graduation a nightmare [Rant],larry_appleton420,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4s140j/family_made_my_law_school_graduation_a_nightmare/,"This happened a while ago, but I'm still pretty burned about it. I guess I never really came to terms with it because I've never talked about it to anyone.

My family wasn't supportive at all of me going to law school. My mom would insult me any time she could, challenging me with obscure legal questions and calling me an idiot if I didn't know them; if I did know something she would say ""Huh, surprised you knew that!"" My two older brothers would constantly call me a loser and an idiot. My grandfather seemed seriously pissed off that I went.

When my graduation was coming up my mom emailed everyone telling them that she wasn't going to my graduation. I remember reading that email in one of my classes trying to hold back my tears. My grandfather then responded that he was cancelling my graduation party, which wasn't even going to happen. My family didn't plan a party for me, but he took it as an opportunity to get that dig in at me. They never celebrated anything for me, not my college graduation or anything like that, despite having parties for everyone else in my family on their graduations. Later on my older brother rubbed it in my face about the party they threw for one of my cousin's graduations, that I wasn't invited to or knew about.

So on the day of my commencement they scheduled a lunch an hour before the ceremony, so I was only able to go there for about 15 minutes while I was rushing to get ready for it. I didn't even have time to eat.

My dad showed up for about 15 minutes. He was in town for the week and never visited me in the city, so I was excited about that. I invited him to a Mets game, and he's absolutely obsessed with the Mets, and he said ""Yeah, I'll give you a call!"" But he never called. He just disappeared. I didn't hear from him again for a few months. Of course my mom didn't show up like she said.

I didn't get any presents, or any kind-of acknowledgement that I had accomplished anything, except that I was somehow a loser, a piece of garbage, etc. I visited my grandfather a few months later at his house with my two older brothers. I shook his hand and he mimed throwing up (like, sticking his tongue out and going ""bleehhh!"") right in front of my two older brothers. 

This was like a ""release the hounds"" moment or something because after that my two older brothers started harassing me like crazy. Normally I would only talk to them maybe once or twice a year. After that they started calling me up several times a month just ... bullying me and acting like real dicks to me. 

This crushed me and I spiraled into a depression. Law school seriously burned me out because I had received no help or preparation for anything in my life, and it was a huge challenge for me considering I raised myself alone in a world where my life was constantly in danger by my family. I did pretty well, too, got good grades, scored a few As, won all the cases I argued in my volunteer work and internships, got some high praise from esteemed professors and such. Good stuff! But I've never acknowledged it because I'm still so burned about how they reacted. 

I'm no contact with them now, but it was real hell going through the process. I've talked about this before on here, but my aunt tracked me down at my job and threatened me for trying to distance myself from them. My brother tricked me into revealing I had depression when he asked me about it, not telling me that 1) he was visiting my family and 2) that he had me on speaker phone with my whole family around him. He also threatened to spread a rumor I was on drugs or something like that. 

My family's rewarded him for doing stuff like that to me, and the rewards are nice; my family's rich and well-established so they're a solid group to have backing from. They paid for his private art school education, while I had to work 3 jobs to put myself through a no-name state school. So on and so forth. 

This whole experience crushed my self-esteem and self-confidence and sent me into a deep depression that led me to taking a job below my education and skill level working for an absolutely nasty corporation where I got tormented and bullied, because I was just ... a total wreck of a person. And my family, who pressured me and threatened me and tortured me my whole life, they bullied me into staying that job longer than I should have, even knowing the dire consequences it was having on my health. ""So you almost ended up hospitalized, I think you should stay there!"" Ya know? And when I've tried to distance myself from them, they'd hunt me down like quarry, tracking my activity on Facebook (which I had to delete), tracking me down at my job, getting old abusive friends to email me to get me back into the ""family"". 

For example, my grandfather texted me a few times over the course of the past few months. Saying how I'm breaking everyone's hearts by cutting them out of my life. How I should be ashamed of myself. How much he and my family love me. How he felt like a ""shepherd who lost one of his flock."" The guy who has done nothing but torment me, who helped my parents cover up my abuse, who's treated me like his enemy and encouraged my brothers to bully me and exclude me from the family.

I'm never going to speak to these people again. It sucks how much I let these people destroy me. I'm in my early 30s now, a total wreck, my legal career irreparably destroyed, depressed, unemployed, and trying to pick up the pieces of my life. They had traumatized me so badly as a kid it's taken me 4 years of excruciating mental work just to sort things out. I wouldn't have a chance in hell if I didn't invest so much time and pain in trying to sort it all out. 

I have no family whatsoever in the world. It's a strange thing to face and accept. I feel adrift in the world with no roots, no home, no place to belong to, and the fact is, I've never had that. I've been rootless and drifting since the day I was born, and now I'm finally seeing the truth for what it really is. 

It's fucking freaky! Thanks for reading.

Edit: I just wanted to thank everyone for your outreach, support, and good words. This is exactly what I needed right now. You people are awesome."

I've got an internship, so I'm planning on learning as much as I can in my spare time, and I figured that OSCP might be the way to go. I've got basic programming skills, such as MATLAB, and I've dabbled quite a bit in C and Python as well. The material covered by OSCP sounds really interesting, but I'm a complete noob when it comes to pentesting, and I've seen reports that it's a challenging course even for industry experienced professionals. With that in mind, will I be jumping into the deep end of the pool by committing to OSCP? Is there other material that I should check out first before moving on to the OSCP? If anyone was in the same boat or can offer some advice/experiences, it'd be awesome if you can share them. Thanks a lot guys!


P.S - regardless of what your advice is on OSCP, I'm thinking of downloading a Linux distro (probably Mint or Arch) for my 128 GB Macbook Air. Would you recommend a dual boot approach, VM solution, or USB stick installation?  "

Better to just wait it out, then get everything from new host?",EulersMeth,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/4s285q/question_id_like_to_migrate_hosts_for_my_personal/,"Background:

- going into my senior year, studying CS+Math. Haven't learned much networking on the back end on an academic level but I'm picking up bits and pieces from my web development internship when I get to touch that side of things.

- my own personal website, {{firstname}}{{lastname}}.com is just a static page (only raw CSS with Bootstrap via CDN + some extra JQuery to make things do stuff).

- I did everything (hosting, DNS, all of the checkboxes that I clicked about a year ago) with Namecheap because it was simple enough, but I've decided that I want more flexibility to do what I want so I'd like to get everything on AWS (Since it's static, I'll just throw it on S3 for now, but I can get an EC2 instance up and running if I ever opt to go for more web app functionalities tied into it).

- Everything expires on July 11th. But, as I'm going through the process of transferring hosts (using [this page](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-transfer-to-route-53.html) as a guide for the movement of the domain itself, I'm seeing that lots of things may take 1-2 days to take effect. I hardly get any traffic whatsoever so I'm wondering if it may be worth just letting everything expire and then just repurchasing the domain through avenues afforded to me by the new host, or if these 1-2 day things won't affect anything if I get the transfer done today.

Now, I am currently stuck in suspense. At the beginning of this summer (around June 10th) I was sent an email from Intel that said along the lines that they were ""impressed with my coursework and academic experience"" and stated that ""[they] have the following internship that matches your qualifications"" and gave me a detailed overview of the Internship. Great! I was brewing with excitement and sent back the appropriate response (they asked a few questions about start times, locations, etc.) and then they sent me an email stating that I would be contacted by a hiring manager soon to follow up on the selection process. I waited. Fast forward to last week, I was sent another email from Intel, and they sent me another internship opportunity that was almost identical to the first, but at a different location and sooner time (which was great and what I wanted). Same thing again. However, I am still waiting on that first follow up...

**tl;dr: Got sent a potential internship possibility, waited for nearly a month, got sent another internship possibility, unsure about wait times for hiring managers contact**

... and so right now, I am lost. Does that second email imply that they are restarting the selection process for me? Do hiring managers typically take a long time to get back to prospective interns? How would they contact me? I am worried that I may have missed something and will miss the opportunity to intern at a very reputable company. This is my first *potential* internship possibility, and I just finished my first year of college (19 years old, upcoming Sophomore). Sorry for the superfluous text, I felt that the details were necessary.

I'll be entering into my senior year of college as a Management of Information Systems (MIS) major. For those who may not be familiar with this major, it focuses on solving business problems with technology and is a popular choice for people looking to break into an IT-related field.

That being said, I don't particularly enjoy the technical IT classes as much as I do the ones related to business analytics, programming, and digital marketing. My major also offers classes related to subjects such as ecommerce and other similar niches that I'll be taking.

So I have been considering this for awhile, but I have decided I do want to in fact pursue a career in digital marketing. My long-term career goals are to be self-employed some day and release my own products/services, and in my mind digital marketing is one of the best career tracks for someone with these sorts of ambitions. I am a creator at heart so to speak.

Part of my issue is I have no internship experience whatsoever. I simply dropped the ball and got caught up in doubts about my original major. Is it possible to get an internship related to digital marketing somewhere during the fall or spring semesters and if so, how would I go about doing this? Would I be able to balance this with my 5 major courses?

I also have 2 months before school starts to learn anything and everything related to digital marketing while I work part-time. What do you suggest I start learning? I have basic coding skills in java, C++, HTML and CSS, and have basic Wordpress design capabilities. I have also been reading up on Adwords and I'll be looking to get certified at some point.

Some other things that come to mind are learning copywriting, conversion optimization, email marketing, SEM, SEO, social media and basic graphic design skills. Am I on the right track here? Can I practice this stuff by starting my own side projects? That sounds like a lot of fun to me and could allow me to differentiate myself from all the other marketing majors. It may even be a better option than an internship.

What do you guys think? Thanks!

I discovered this subreddit some weeks ago and I've been checking in daily, reading and trying to gain knowledge from all you guys. I've learned quite a lot, but as I am from Norway sometimes I feel like the more specific talk goes over my head. IRA's, Roth, I feel quite lost.  

I was wondering if anyone had good advice for how to speed up retirement plans here in this lovely country of Norway? I've been looking into investing in index-funds, but our options here are limited, with few offerers and no Vanguard. Are there someone out there who knows if DNB Global Indeks or the equivalent from kip or sparebanken is the best? 

And since I have your attention as of now, maybe there is some other advice you could offer?

Since I'm asking for advice and one of the top-posts right now is about how you should not give advice without knowing specifics I think i should provide some information about myself.

I'm a young engineering student in Norway and my financials are like this:

60 000 NOK (8000 USD) in student loans

120 000 NOK (16 000 USD) in cash

75 000 NOK (9200 USD) in an account specifically designed for buying a house

30 000 NOK (4000 USD) in my emergency account

20 000 NOK  (2500 USD) in another account which will be available for me in another month

75 000 NOK (9200 USD) which I will receive after I'm done with my summer internship


I would be very happy if anyone had something to share."

4s2prr,6,2016-07-09,"Migraine? Idk, here's my story.",ttfiwly,migraine,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/4s2prr/migraine_idk_heres_my_story/,"I don't even know if what I have is a true migraine. After reading people's symptoms and reading online about them, I always feel like a wimp to describe my headaches and migraines, but I'm here today because I'm curious if others have shared a similar experience.
  
I started getting whatever these are, headaches/migraines, in college. At the beginning, I did feel like they were just headaches and they would go away, but that's not the case anymore. They come and they stay for hours. I can feel them coming. They all start as a dull pain always on the right side behind my eye. I can still move around and talk with the dull pain. It usually lasts four hours or so before the real pain hits, and then it's pretty much over for me. I end up sitting in the darkest room I can find with my hands over my right eye. Sometimes I hit my brow bone or put pressure on the bone right above my eye because it seems to pull the pain away from its source (I know this sounds crazy, but it helps just a bit). Ice packs also work to an extent. They numb where the bone/skin is but don't seem to draw the pain from the source. Medicine started off small, I had Tylenol extra strength when I first got to college. When that stopped working, I tried Excedrin migraine. It worked once, maybe twice. So I went to the doctor on campus. He gave me dissolvable Maxalt. Again, worked once. The second time yielded nothing and after the third, I gave up. I found some old prescription Ibuprofen(800mg) and tried that. It seemed to work, so I started taking 4 OTC Ibuprofens(200mg) when I ran out. Again, once or twice and after that, they seemed to not work anymore either.  
  
So, I gave up altogether on medicine and decided that I would just be able to handle them. I was wrong. One night I was curled up into a ball in complete darkness having no medicine or anything just crying. I tried to take sleeping tablets just to get through it but that didn't work. I woke up 3 hours in the same pain. So, I went to the hospital and felt like I had all of my prayers answered. The doctor gave me a shot of phenergen/prednisone. I felt the pain subside quickly and don't remember much else after that. He sent me home with a prescription for Fioricet. Honestly, I was happy because it contained a sedative and I thought that meant I could sleep the pain away. And it worked for longer than the others. At first, it put me to sleep and I woke up and the pain was gone. The next couple of times, it didn't put me to sleep, but if I took some diphenhydramine to go to sleep it would do the trick. And then, it was beat. I went out of state for an internship and it did nothing. I laid on the floor for hours before deciding to visit the ER, thinking the process would be the same.  
  
It wasn't. This time, I was given a migraine cocktail. I'm not sure what was in it, I just remember there being three drugs, one including Benadryl. One of the drugs had the worst side effects I've experienced. For a very long 5 minutes, I was shivering and felt completely uncomfortable in my skin. I felt like I needed to get up and run out of the hospital although I knew that would be crazy. For five minutes I rocked back and forth scratching my skin begging for the nurse to take the IV out as I told her I'd rather have the migraine.

I'm currently going into my senior year of undergrad, psych major, and I've been looking into HCI. It seems to be a great way to combine my strengths with my interests/passions (computers, tech, people, design, etc). I'm also interning in a graduate lab and im conducting research on team mental models which I've heard are important in HCI. 

Anyways, my main question is whether or not the GRE is necessary when applying to HCI masters programs. Ive been researching various schools and I either don't even see the GRE mentioned (I.e. Depaul's program just says transcript, letters of rec, personal statement) or I see something like the University of Washington where they say that you can submit it if you took it but if you don't take it it doesn't affect your application. 

How many of you did/didn't take the GRE? Is it really a big deal? Id rather spend the summer focused on my internship and learning some front end development rather than studying for the GRE and spending $250 more than I have to."

However, it's not just about the money. I have never really been taken seriously my whole life., I want to feel like I have a voice. I want to feel like I'm making a difference. I have a very deep core desire for the world around me to make sense. I constantly look at what things are, and what they could be. 

For example, my company is shifting their core technology stack to a much more manageable platform. I raised this exact same concern with the exact same solution three years earlier as an intern and was completely ignored by the leadership, and was even told that I should pipe down and not challenge the status quo. Three years later, a new senior VP is hired, and he brings up the same thing I said, and all of a sudden everyone is totally on board. 

I want to be an executive. I want to be a CIO/CTO. I want to be able to bring my forward looking ideas under consideration and not merely be brushed off as a junior app developer. This is my end goal. I am restless trying to figure out how to achieve it. I don't want to climb the ladder and not deserve it though. I want to put in the work. I want to be that good. I just don't know how where to start to begin to realize this ambition.

EDIT: Just so you all know, I have mostly let go of the frustration I felt when I was ignored three years ago.  I am no longer on that team. "

I am a rising Senior.

Cost is not really a factor to be perfectly honest, and I would prefer the private route than the public one. California, of course, has one of the best public university systems in the world so it is a great fallback plan for me.

**Intended Major:** Either Economics/Business or Political Science

**Academics:** My GPA is 3.56 UW/3.83W (3.25 Freshman year, 3.5 Sophomore year, 3.92 Junior year - health issues brought me down in Freshman year that my counselor/teachers will probably mention). 

I took mostly all honors courses my Freshman and Sophomore years (no APs allowed first two years) and took 4 weighted classes (maximum allowed) my Junior year. I will take 3 weighted classes next year.

I have taken the SAT once and got a 2170 (770M, 730CR, 670W). I also scored 1500 on the PSAT, so National Merit is likely. As for Subject Tests, I got a 790 in Korean and I am awaiting results for US History which I took in June. I will take Literature and possibly World in the fall.

**Extracurriculars: (probably strongest part of application)** I have participated in DECA since freshman year and have won (1st place) at the state level twice. I have qualified for the International level twice as well, and placed 2nd and 8th there. I also participated in National History Day (Documentary) and was a Regional Champion twice and 2nd place at States. I have been a part of my school newspaper (nationally accredited), where I have held the positions of Advertising Manager and Web Editor. Also related to journalism, I  interned for Stanford's newspaper for two years. I interned for my local State Senator for two years (doing voter analysis, data collection, etc), and gained 180+ volunteer hours. My last internship was (probably the most impressive one) at a Sand Hill venture capital firm. I also did one year of Public Forum debate (third place at a low-level tournament - not that impressive, I know), and one year of Junior State of America. Lastly, I have been a varsity member of the golf team since my Freshman year.

That being said, please chance me for Notre Dame (both College of Arts and Sciences and Mendoza), Emory (both Atlanta and Oxford), Boston College (College of Arts and Sciences), and Claremont McKenna.

I will (likely) be applying Early Decision to Emory (Atlanta) or Restrictive Early Action to Notre Dame and Boston College.

Thank you for reading this far and I **will** chance back!"

My [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/4s33m2/chance_me_for_notre_dame_emory_boston_college_and/) on /r/chanceme has some more information.

My test scores, course rigor, ECs, recs, and essays are fine, but my Freshman and Sophomore year GPA hold me back (largely due to health problems that led to missing quite a bit of school).

My top 3 schools are Notre Dame, Boston College, and Emory. I visited and fell in love with all 3, and would gladly attend any of them. That being said, Notre Dame is probably my #1 choice.

Would I have a better chance of getting in through REA to Notre Dame/Boston College, or ED1 to Emory (Atlanta)? If I do go the REA route, I would apply ED2 to Emory if I do not get into either of my REA schools. I would be applying to the College of Arts and Sciences for all 3 schools (with a preference for Mendoza pre-admit at Notre Dame).

I go to a fairly expensive university and so after financial aid (~$33000) and money I am making this summer from an internship (~$10000 after taxes) I need to come up with about $15000 for the year. All of this money just pays for housing, tuition, and other small fees that the university tacks on. I am doing nothing extravagant like getting a meal plan to jack up the price of attendance. Through my first three years I have taken out the maximum in Federal unsubsidized loans and will be doing the same this year, resulting is around $31000 in federal loan debt total upon graduation.

My parents have helped me pay for my education up to this point but are going through a divorce. They both expect the other to pay, resulting in grid lock with any money that is available, and outright refuse to cosign a loan. The latter of which is especially frustrating as I have approached them numerous times completely willing to take out a private loan for my Senior year but have been shot down every time. Their refusal is not because of me but because they feel it would be too damaging to them if say they need to take out a new mortgage in a years time.

I can sit here an hope that they come to some agreement with a small amount of money that was earmarked for education before the divorce, but this divorce has been going on for 15 months now so a positive resolution to their situation seems unlikely. Coming to an agreement to aid myself, and a sister who is also in college, last year was a terrible experience. So I am trying to prepare for the worst and determine my options.

As I see it I can talk to my grandparents who will most likely be willing to help cosign a private loan. But it would be very difficult to uphold some unrealistic goal of fairness between both sides of my family. I however do not want to have this conversation with them until absolutely necessary as I feel bad having to resort to their aid.

I have been applying to private scholarships but I see that as an unlikely means of paying for all of school, maybe it can reduce the ~$15000 I need by a bit.

The other option I have considered is trying to take out a loan on my own. They last thing I am worried about it my ability to pay off my debt once I graduate as I have never had a problem finding employment in my field in the past and will likely have a job lined up before my senior year even begins. I have over a year of credit built up in my own name, I have always payed off my credit card balance in full and on time. I work a part time job during the year but it is minimum wage and only results in a few hundred dollars a month, it is enough for food and other minor conveniences. I do not have any significant assents in my own name, nor any built up savings as 100% of the money I have made every summer has gone right to school. Is there any chance I can take out a loan on my own?

Any and all advice/guidance is appreciated."

This has been a long time coming. I'm within commuting distance to NYC (live in Long Island) so I know opportunities are plentiful. My mind is open to any type of dev work, but I have realistic expectations. I'm a lifelong PC/Tech enthusiast, been programming as a hobby for a few years. I've got a lot to set me apart from other recent grads, but I'm not sure how to present it all. In no particular order:

* A recent bachelors in computer information systems - a self paced online degree from an accredited state university that I banged out in 6 months in my spare time. (not sure if that'll be seen positively or negatively) More of an IT degree, but it contains some software development and its probably enough to not get my resume immediately tossed.

* 10+ years as a medical laboratory professional, working with a team, high pressure/responsibility, literally making life and death decisions, not just minding machines. I'm not some punk kid straight out of school (no offense guys), a software dev job is like a step down in responsibility because no one will die if I screw up. 

* A variety of trivial to relatively complex personal projects in languages such as C#, VB and Python. 

* One notable project is a program that automated a ton of the rote tasks in my day job, saving me a solid hour or two every day. Completely self conceived and created. It's a several hundred line script written in autohotkey that scans the screen and acts appropriately, automatically carrying out the dozens of little rules and exceptions that all my colleagues have to manually do (if they even remember). It's my dirty little secret, but its a unique solution to a real problem. Its impossible to demonstrate outside the context of our internal system though.

* A self-coded portfolio site in progress to display prior and future projects (my next goal after finishing the BS this month)

* Some collaboration with a professional dev (personal friend) on the most ambitious project 

* Two other BS degrees, one in psychology, the other Cytotechnology

* A genuine passion for programming - I already have a solid career. I'm applying cause I want to, not because I have to. 

* If they'll take my word for it, I'm a very quick learner and highly adaptable. I'm primarily switching because I want a new challenge and I'm completely confident in my ability to figure stuff out. Throw me in the deep end and I'll learn to swim. 

I know employers will stop reading a resume or cover letter if they're not sold in the first few sentences. The number one thing they are all looking for is experience and I don't even have an internship under my belt. I know all of these qualities are meaningful, but if you were me, in what order would you present them? "

I've only taken one computer science class where I learned MATLAB, and I used it for a project at one of my internships.  I have enjoyed those experiences much more than I have enjoyed my ""mechanically-focused"" activities at work.  If there is a problem with the code, I can make adjustments immediately, rather than sitting around waiting for things to be manufactured and shipped.

Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up (would love her to look like Madison Ivy)

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S also looking to role play Marvel/DC, Game Of Thrones, The Witcher and Mass Effect

When I got home for 4th of July I knew he was nervous and avoiding something important. And then bam out of the blue a young girl shows up at the house and she's his girlfriend. Yay!! Oh and not only that they've been dating since January and the cherry of everything...she's due in October. 

Once my dad relaxed and I caught my breath and the week settled in (my dad was very respectful of my opinion and pre-arranged for her to stay with her family---who apparently approve of this situation) I could tell he was very happy and excited, in fact more so than I'd seen him in years. When I discussed the details he said that she worked as an intern at one of his suppliers and thier age difference actually gave them something to talk about as opposed to it being an obstacle. She's in college, she comes from a good family and she's made it clear that prior to them getting marrried, we all meet with a lawyer so my dad's estate is fair to all of us. So at least by her word she's a decent person who is not after my Dads money.

All of this would be awesome if she were 45, 40 or even 35...but she's 23. And it just seems weird. And it makes me sad and it makes me feel like I'm losing him. I'm having a hard time forgiving him for taking ""him"" away from me.

I'm currently enrolled as a Chemical Engineering major, but plan on switching to Geography with a concentration in Geospatial Information Systems. I would switch to Computer Science, but I would essentially have to graduate in five years and don't want to pay the costs of an additional year to go through the freshman CS series courses. I recently received my financial aid notice and noticed I only received about $6200 in grants for the year down from $14k in 2015/16. My family's income decreased from $70k to $50k between 2014/15 and 2015/16. My parents own their own business and their expenses increased for the year. When my financial aid office noticed the difference in income on my fafsa they placed a hold which required a few weeks to get the additional forms and numbers to be resubmitted. I believe as a result I received no federal grants/scholarships and only received UCLA's additional grant for lower-middle class income families due to the postponement despite my on-time submitted fafsa estimates. Essentially my costs from UCLA came to about $16k for the 2015/16 year and have increased to $22k for the 2016/17 year. My parents are willing to pay for the increased costs, but I'd rather they not shell out $40k for essentially my first two years and possibly another $40k for my last two years. They are in a financial position to do so (already have their two houses paid off and expect to retire once I graduate and set-up a small shop for their business). My other alternative is to transfer to a local CC for about $3k for two years to finish off GEs and CS courses and transfer to Cal Poly Pomona for a Computer Science degree which would take an additional two years (possibly 3 due to impacted major) while I commute from home. While I could benefit more from the opportunities, internships, networking, and prestige of UCLA I'm unsure of whether it's worth the financial cost this would have on my parents. Saying this, I realize I'm very blessed to have my parents willing to cover my higher educational costs and if my parents weren't willing to cover costs I would've chosen the no debt CC/CSU route. I greatly appreciate any advice from this community."

I'm 27. I got my master's degree almost three years ago (library &amp; information science), and it's a field that's notoriously difficult to get your foot in the door. When I was in school, our professors wild tell us, ""expect to start working part time or volunteering without benefits, and be prepared to move somewhere across the country if you're really serious about it.""


They were right. Only one of my friends got a job straight out of grad school, and without any options, I had to move back in with my mom and dad back in northern Virginia. I spent the next year applying to jobs left and right. Submitted over 100 applications across the country, got maybe 10 interviews. 


To make money and give me something to do in the meantime, I started temping and got a long-term position at a small, shady government contractor, and after six months, I was hired permanently. These types of companies are a dime a dozen in the DC area, and the government agency we contracted for was HUD, servicing home loans--specifically, reverse mortgages for low-income seniors. It was horrible, soul-killing work where no one was really all that competent. The company relied on temps to handle their work because they were too cheap to pay for actual experienced workers  (didn't stop the CEO from skimming a healthy chunk of that contract money so she could live in a $2 million palatial mansion, though).


I was assigned to work doing deed-in-lieu of foreclosures (if someone was unable to live in their home anymore or if they died, they or their estate could simply convey the deed over to HUD, who would then auction the property). I spent my day calling delirious, infirm, destitute old folks or their grieving families demanding necessary documents or else reassuring them that I was trying to make the process for them as easy as possible. I lost count of how many times I was cursed at or harassed over the phone. The work atmosphere was horrible. My boss was fired for doing nothing all day, and the CEO of the company would spend her day yelling and screaming into the phone, meanwhile bringing her horrible kids into work, where they would make a mess, run around shrieking, and generally be a huge nuisance. Meanwhile, I would keep applying to new jobs and hear nothing back. I fell into a very deep depression. I'd get in my car and just break down nearly every day.


The one salvation at work were the other employees (fellow coworkers on my same level, not the senior staff). We were all kind of in the same boat: recent grads who were temping, trying to figure our lives out. All of us got along great. We'd have silly prank wars and a Facebook chat we'd constantly talk on to vent our frustrations and keep us sane. One guy in particular and I became really good friends--I'll call him Josh. I'm shy and he's super outgoing, and he was able to quickly break through my shell. Josh and I are still really close friends to this day. He introduced me to his girlfriend and his friend group, who quickly accepted me as one of their own. It was really great to have a dedicated group of friends again. Most of my grad school friends had scattered to the winds and all I have to contact them now is Facebook. Same goes for high school friends (those I still keep in contact with, anyway, which were very few in the first place).


I'm pretty sure this group of people are what got me through life for the entirety of working at this shitty company. I managed to last a year and a half there, somehow. And *finally*, I had an interview that actually came through. It wasn't a library position (at this point, anyway, I had more or less given up on libraries), but it was at a small-ish local bank's headquarters, managing their file room, which was at that time a disorganized, horrible wreck. My library experience was actually what caught their eye. I found out later that I was the only one who agreed to take it on, even though I was ""clearly overqualified"". They offered me the highest pay possible for the job, which was the same as my pay at ShitCo®. Whatever, though, even if it wasn't exactly a step up, it got me out of that horrible company. About a month after I left, too, Josh got a job at another company that's literally across the street from my building! We still get lunch together most days, so it's cool he's so close.


It was a huge change for me. It was almost weird seeing people actually happy to come to work, to have bosses who gave feedback and actively looked to solve problems (and didn't take cigarette breaks every half hour because they ""[couldn't] take it anymore""), to have a workplace staffed by actual competent employees who worked hard and knew what they were doing. I resolved to be work hard at my new job, even though, yes, I was in fact overqualified for it. I'm happy to say that, yes, I managed to pull the file room into an effective, organized mini-department unto itself. I had a part-time assistant and interns to help, which gave me some management experience, too.


Things were looking up. I started dating my boyfriend, who I love to death. I was getting lots and lots of praise from everyone at the bank, including the CEO. I also finally managed to move out of my parents' house after two years (I love them, but I had no privacy and things were getting a little tense between us. Plus, living with mom and dad isn't exactly cool). But then things started getting downhill again.


I got bored fast with the new job. Filing stuff and getting files for people all day isn't stimulating work. Once I got the place physically cleaned up, cleared out, and had gotten things on the right track, there was a whole lot to actually do. Sometimes it would be hours between emails, and there's only so many times you can straighten up the files. Also, the file room had no windows, so during the winter, there were some days where I would get maybe a half hour of sunlight if I was lucky.


Money has been an issue, too. The DC area is notoriously expensive. Now that I'm living on my own, rent alone takes a huge chunk out of my savings. While I was living at home, I got to splurge on things because I was saving so much money. I got a personal trainer and got the fittest I've ever been my whole life. I got LASIK. When I had a two-week break between the shit company and my new job, I splurged on a solo vacation to Italy. But I can't afford those things now, not even close. While I love my apartment and living on my own, I'm constantly worrying about finances. I live in a tiny, tiny 350 square foot studio apartment with no air conditioning and a kitchen so small I can't even use it, but because it's in the DC area, I still pay more in rent per month than my sister and brother-in-law do for their mortgage for their entire *house* in Pittsburgh. I have student loans, too, and while I'm hoping to have it paid off in the next few years, they're still a goddamn drag, especially since I haven't been able to put my degree to any real use.


At work, although I kept up with my stuff, my bosses could tell I was unhappy with how things were going. My bank is really antiquated in that their entire records system is paper-based and that there is no electronic records system in place, which slows everyone down in having to dig through huge, thick paper files. They were hoping I could help spearhead a major project for them in creating that electonic records system and initiating an imaging department (finally, I could actually use my degree!), but unfortunately, as of now, nothing has come of it. Nowhere close, it's still ""in talks"" after over a year and a half. So in an effort to keep me happy, they gave me a promotion back in April.


It's definitely helped, I can't lie. I got a very nice pay bump of $5,000 more a year, which is awesome. I'm out of the file room and even though I'm in a cubicle, I have a view of a window and can actually interact and talk with my coworkers. I'm certainly busier now, too.


Still, it's not what I was exactly hoping for. I'm part of the bank's credit admin department, which as allegedly turned itself compared to around a few years ago. There are only a few weak areas, though: the file room, which I was able to turn around, and what I do now. My job consists processing loan payoffs and releasing collaterals. My bank is an entire *year* behind on this, so I'm handling payoffs from loans that paid off back in 2015 and prior. It can get complex at times, but there's no doubt that it's still just a routine. It's all I'm going to be doing for the foreseeable future, and that fucking depresses me. There's no room for creativity or originality (as it should be, banks should absolutely follow strict procedures in their operations). I'm terrified of ending up like my coworkers: doing the same job and same work for 20+ years. I don't want to turn 40 and find that I'm still doing the same tedious, repetitive job I have now.


That, and I still have to oversee the file room, which, on top of having an entire new job still to learn, takes up a huge part of my time and makes me stressed. They made my assistant full time and put him in charge of the day-to-day tasks in the file room, but he spends a lot of his day on his cell phone and slacking off. After only a few months, the file room is getting disorganized and cluttered again. It fees like all the time and effort I spent in there was for nothing, and I have to do a lot of my assistant's work for him on top of my own job.


I also feel like I'm not fitting in with my coworkers. I'm the youngest person in my department by far, and one of the very few who isn't married and has kids. I don't even like kids. At all. I don't let my coworkers know how much I dislike children so I don't upset them, but it seems like that's all I can talk about. I don't care about their kids, I just doooon't. And as I've mentioned, I'm pretty shy and quiet in the first place, so it's not like I get a whole lot of people seeking to talk to me in the first place.


There's also the fact that I'm gay. I don't go shouting about it, but I've casually mentioned my boyfriend in passing a few times and I don't know if I'm just being paranoid, but I feel like I've noticed a change in attitude towards me since I first brought him up. Some coworkers stopped talking to me, and I stopped getting invited to happy hours and lunch. DC and NoVA in general are pretty liberal and I've never felt discriminated otherwise, but my bank is a *very* conservative place--it's actually a source of pride and is part of our unofficial motto. And that's fine, people are entitled to their opinions and beliefs, plus with the age difference and all, it's not like I should have expected whole-hearted acceptance. But it still sucks.


And then, there's DC in general. It's a city that's certainly turned itself around from 20 years ago. It's now SUPER trendy and cool to live here. The population is exploding and the suburbs keep sprawling further and further out each day. It attracts some of the hardest-working, brightest people in the country, and there is serious, deep deep deep deep money here. It was a shock from paying $425 a month for a room in a two-bedroom apartment in undergrad and grad school to being unable to find a decent and conveniently-located one-bedroom for anything less than $1500 a month in the DC area. My parents' house has almost tripled in value from when they bought it in 2000. It's a great area to live in if you're making six figures and don't mind the horrible, infamously abysmal traffic (I don't, and I do--since I'm in the suburbs I have to drive *everywhere* and the traffic makes me homicidal).


DC, as you can guess, is full of incredibly driven and success-oriented people. Everyone seems to be solely focused on getting ahead and climbing the corporate/government ladder. Working a 60+ work week isn't just common, it's a bragging right. I find myself falling into that attitude as well sometimes but it gets old *fast*. My friends are all like this. As much I love Josh and my friends, to them, if you make anything less than $60K a year, you're automatically considered ""a loser"". Nice to know where I stand in their eyes, I guess. They're all successful and I wish I could tap into their success a little. They always seem to jetting off to Vegas or Cancun every other weekend, getting really dressed up and constantly going out every weekend, buying new cars and moving into new fancy apartments. They have a compulsive need to one-up you constantly; when I got my raise and I excitedly told them, one of them just said, ""that's cool. But I just got a $10,000 raise."" It seems there's no point in sharing things with them if all they try and do is shit on your accomplishments.


I'm unhappy here. Location-wise, job-wise. Me and my boyfriend have had really serious conversations about leaving the area, since he's more or less in the situation as me. Leaving our family and friends would *suck*. It really would. But the the thought of settling down here any longer than I already have fills me with fucking dread.


I have some ideas about some cities I love and could potentially see myself living in. Philly. Denver. Pittsburgh. Austin. Richmond, VA. My boyfriend is focused on Seattle and Portland (hey, they're sweet, too). And my boyfriend is good with computers and wants to be a technical writer, which gives him a lot of employable options. But that leaves the question of what I want to do. 


I'm not going to lie, I'm seriously burned out trying to figure it out. I still have my master's degree in library science, but I'm just done with libraries--admittedly, mostly out of spite. I really, really, reeeeaaaaallllly don't want to apply to another 100+ jobs for something I don't even know I would really even enjoy. I have experience in loan servicing from working at that shitty company and at the bank, but as I'm sure you can deduce by now, I don't find it interesting or necessarily rewarding work. Besides, the only way to really gain traction and move up in the banking world is to have a finance degree or an MBA (I don't have it in me to get another degree, I just don't). I have competent basic computer skills, but nothing technical like programming, coding, IT, or design.


I may sound overly-dramatic, but I feel like I'm being suffocated. Every day my soul and spirit feel a little more crushed. It's difficult looking back on what I've accomplished so far and see... nothing much. Two fancy pieces of paper.


I don't even know where to start. Every time I try looking for new jobs now, I get so frustrated and exhausted that I just give up after five minutes. I try to take things one day at a time, but I absolutely dread having those days turn into weeks, then months, then years. I still suffer from depression so even mustering the energy to get out of bed some days can be challenging.


I just don't know what to do."

This is the first time I am open about my problem, and I need to do this now, and in English, because it feels less 'real'.

I am 24, and I have always felt a little 'chubby', not fat, just a little bit plump. 4 years ago I decided to lose some weight. It quickly became addictive. I started with a healthy diet and regular exercise, and then, in an effort to ""make it better, make it faster"", I switched to a restrictive regime, where I would count calories and have panic attacks if the total daily intake exceeded a very small number. I also binged once a week, at night, and cried myself to sleep.

This had effects on every single aspect of my life. I started experiencing short memory losses. I was acting resentful and sour all the time. I started to stare at people's bodies and to mentally calculate their size, and then to compare it to mine. I remember one and a half year after I started, I looked myself in the mirror, passed my finger my ribs and thought ""I looked like Christian Bale in the Machinist"", and I was proud. I was proud of it.

I avoided many social events, either because they could be related to food, or because I was 'too fat' to be seen by people. Everybody suspected I had problems, but I always strongly denied, even if I recognized it myself from the beginning. It felt like I was ""beating the dieting system"", somehow.

Last year, I was selected for an internship experience abroad. Somehow, this triggered me a complete reversal. At first, I tried to stick with my habits, but in an effort to integrate with coworkers and to build a social net, I had to compromise. And I ""remembered"" how I loved to eat: long story short, I started to binge. To think constantly about food, to hope I'd end my working hours just to run to the first supermarket.

I gained most of my weight back, and didn't care about it in the process. But now... Now I am stuck into a spiral of self loathing and anxiety. I have all the drawbacks of an ED, but I am also fat now.

I hate myself for having failed. I hate myself for having thrown away all my effort. I hate myself because I used to be attractive.

And, I don't know what to do. I start my old routine, but then I am weak, and I binge. I hate it. I have daily suicidal thoughts but at the same time I don't want to die 'fat'. Really. I really have this thought.

I am sorry again for the long post. I needed to say it out loud, I needed to know I am not the only one. I need help.

4s57me,1,2016-07-10,"Mutual breakup, but I [21 F] am still in love with my ex [19 F].",oCmon,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4s57me/mutual_breakup_but_i_21_f_am_still_in_love_with/,"So we ended our relationship of almost 13 months yesterday, but we just met today to talk because I requested it so that I could have a bit of closure. Some background first. 

I'm a student in university, my course is relatively lax and I do have a lot of time on my hands that I spend either gaming, relaxing or going out with my girlfriend (now ex). I was friends with my ex for 3 years before we started falling for each other and eventually decided to get together. She is a student in another college, and also an athlete. This means that she has trainings to attend and these trainings increase in frequency closer to competition dates. 

We originally arranged for her to skip her Saturday trainings and spend the day with me because she has internship and trainings on weekdays, and the only time we can meet is a day with training so that she can skip a training to meet me because her mother disapproves of the relationship intensely (homophobic) and doesn't want her to meet me at all. 

In the past 2 weeks, my ex has been cancelling on me for a variety of reasons like injuries (which is real), and additional trainings. The last straw came yesterday when she lied to me that her dentist requested for her to return in the afternoon for additional dental work done when she already had an appointment in the morning. It was a very obvious lie, and I got enraged and after arguing for an hour over the phone, I brought up breaking up and she agreed without hesitation. 

Note that it wasn't the first time we broke up. A month prior, she told me that she wanted a breakup out of the blue because ""she no longer loved me"" and she didn't want to do LDR since she plans on going to the UK for her university once she graduates mid of next year. A day after the first breakup, she called me and told me that she basically lied to me because she wanted me to find someone better and be in a healthier relationship because she was busy with her trainings and she couldn't guarantee that the relationship could change because of her mother, but she wanted me back because she realized she couldn't live without me. I felt like she still loved me then, so I decided to give the relationship another chance (I usually don't get back together with my exes). 

She proposed that she would not compete so that we could spend more time together, but I knew that she desperately wanted to, so I told her that we could work something out where we met once or twice a week and she could train the rest of the days. She agreed, and we got over the first breakup. 

Now, since we were talking about our relationship to give me closure, she confessed that she no longer has any feelings for me at all. She told me that even during the first breakup, she only had 60% of her original feelings for me and she felt that she could try again and try to grow the feelings, but in that one month since the first breakup, her feelings basically dropped to 0% and she says that she only loves me as a friend now. I basically agreed to the breakup because she doesn't love me anymore, and I will not ask her to stay with me if she's happier being single.

I had also been noticing that my feelings for her weren't as strong as they were before the breakup, but I still love her a lot and it tore my heart apart when she said that nothing I do would be able to change anything between us. She still wants us to be friends, and I promised her as well that if she wanted me to stay a friend after we breakup, I would stay for as long as she wanted me around. I intend to fulfill that promise, but I don't see her as just a friend and I don't know if I can ever put aside my feelings for her to be ""just a friend"". I know the concept of soulmates are clichéd as hell and I don't really believe in it either, but if they do exist, I feel like she would be mine.

I don't really have a question, I just wanted to write all this out and read other people's advice for me because I've had to put up a strong front to my family and my friends when I'm just dying inside. I guess that if I have to ask a question, it would be: Have you ever dated someone that you felt was so right for you, but ended up getting demoted to being just a friend again because she fell out of love with you? And how am I supposed to get over her?

   
tl;dr: Fell for a friend, dated, now demoted back to being just a friend. Struggling to try and set aside my feelings so that I can fulfill my promise to stay with her as a friend.

Edit: Yes I'm young, but I've dated around when I was younger (kind of like serial dating, one after another) and before this girl, I dated someone else for 3 years, but had no issue letting go of her after the relationship was over. I've never had an issue letting go of relationships except for my very first girlfriend and this girl. "

I'm single, but in a long distance friends with benefits thing with a girl who likes me a hell of a lot more than I like her and I just don't have the heart to break it off.

Everybody used to tell me how funny I am (was even voted class clown in high school and dabbled in stand up), but I can't remember the last time I made somebody laugh or thought of something remotely clever whereas in the past it was effortless. Generally, there's just an air of hopelessness around everything I do. Even when I do something great, like score this amazing new internship I have, there's just a sense of ""whatever"" around it, even though I know I should be excited. I'm 20 now and I've been suffering from depression since I was 12 years old, but lately it's been getting worse, as if my depression is growing up with me, like its evolving... I used to feel agony all of the time, but now I just feel empty, like I can't feel anything anymore. I already lost what some consider the best years of your life to this shit and I don't wanna waste the rest of my youth on it. But I'm afraid the depression has already won. "

4s5ltz,1,2016-07-10,Advice on changing jobs,_toomanyjobs_,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4s5ltz/advice_on_changing_jobs/,"Ok Reddit - hoping you can help me out here. Im currently at a smallish private company that is doing very well and enjoy it for the most part. Great culture, decent benefits, and doing work related to my degree / background. Pay is okay - right at market value for the most part. Downside is that I am my bosses only direct report and as of late it seems like there is little to no upward mobility or opportunity for promotions / significant raises / training. I've been there full time 3.5 yrs, if you include my 2nd internship it has been over 4 years of continuous service in my current position. All total over that time it has amounted to roughly 15% in raises despite the company's financial success and my continuous excellent performance reviews. I am also paid hourly despite having my Masters in a directly related field. Yes I asked about salary/ promotion and got a non-answer. 

I was recently approached by another company that I do side work for (main job is aware of and ok with it) and they offered me a full time position that would pay 35% more than my current position in a more technical role. Benefits are as good if not better, culture may be a slight step back because of the nature of the industry the company is in but I would be insulated from this in this position. It appears there would be significant opportunity for growth as well through projects and continual training. 

Would love your thoughts on this. It feels like I'm chasing the dollar signs a bit and if I were to get the salary the second company offered at my main job, I would stay. However, I know from experience this is extremely unlikely. Am I trying to stay loyal to the company despite greener grass I can see? I wasn't seeking a new job and was pretty happy in my current position despite being a tad bored and unchallenged day-to-day but this offer has made me see quite a few things I don't care for. Still, this is difficult because I used to (until recently) think of this company somewhere that I could work for quite a while. It has a long history of 25+ year employees. 

Any and all advice would be appreciated. "

The last two years, he has been traveling for work. This summer I applied for internships and he suggested I look in the town he lives in now. So I moved to Nashville so we could temporarily live and spend time together. I still have a year left in school.

His work has him travel mostly on weekends so we spend the week together. However, he sleeps all through the day. He says its probably because of his work. He's a roadie so he gets up early to set up like 6 am, sleeps during the day 12 pm-5 pm, then wakes up and stays awake till they leave the venue between 1-2 am. Then he sleeps from 2 am-6 am and repeats at the next venue. My internship is during the day so I usually go to bed early and get up early even on my days off. 

I moved here to spend time with him and I realize his sleep is messed up because of work. However, I can't help but be somewhat mad at him because there's a lot of things I want to do during the day with him. I've tried to talk to him about it and he just says ""I know it's bad"" or ""I've always had messed up sleep"" but he never actually tries to do anything to fix it. He went to bed at 7:30 am the past 3 nights.

I guess this is more of a rant but is there anything I can do to help him get a more normal sleep schedule? Do I just accept his sleep schedule? Then how to I not get mad at him?
   
**tl;dr**: BF sleeps during the day and is awake all night while I sleep at night and am awake during the day. I want to spend time with him but its hard when we are both only awake together for a few hours. I'm moving back home in a month and I'm frustrated with our opposite sleep schedules."

In an attempt to block that out, I started hooking up with my resident. who I thought liked me, turns out he just wanted a piece of me and now I have to see his face everyday out of no choice and it fucking sucks.

This has taken a toll on my health, I've lost weight, I can't sleep or eat. I've been working to the bone in my internship and I have no time to prepare for my upcoming exams. I get to eat a meal just once a day because my residents are inconsiderate assholes. I'm not even being paid for this shit but I don't like doing my work half assed. 

Got really sick and went to a mentor who has taught me for 3 years. He took advantage of me and molested me. I'm still in shock and he's a well known doctor. Saying something would turn my world upside down and all I want to do is run away from everything and be alone. And I can't because I have work and responsibilities. 

It's so hard to care for patients and look out for them when you feel like you're barely holding your shit together. 

I know I'm supposed to be angry and hurt. But I don't know how to feel anymore. "
4s6z91,8,2016-07-10,I [21F] need advice for dealing with my [17F] sister while living at home for the summer.,iyjnn,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4s6z91/i_21f_need_advice_for_dealing_with_my_17f_sister/,"Long story short, I'm a upcoming senior in college who chose to live at home with my parents for the summer instead of back in my college town due to my internship being closer. I figured it was a small price to pay in order to save money and not have to pay rent, but I'm finding I was very wrong.

My sister and I were always very close, and even when her relationships with our other family members deteriorated we still remained close. However, that has changed over the past year. 

She smokes weed almost every day, drinks frequently, and has started smoking cigarettes. She is out partying constantly, and when she is home she's too hungover to function. My parents know about all this, yet every boundary and rule they have tried to set for her has never worked out. She's out of control, and I think they've given up. 

Even before I moved out of the house to go to college, she had a habit of stealing things from my room without asking. I know this sounds trivial and something that all sisters do, but it is constant. I cannot begin to explain how many items of clothing and pieces of jewelry I've ""lost."" But it's not even the belongings aspect that gets me, it's that even when I confront her and ask if she took something from me, she lies about it. This has been going on for years now, and it's even worse since I've been back. Instead of just lying to my face when I ask if she took something, it results in a complete screaming fight. I guess an example of this and what led me to make this post is what just happened, when I saw a picture of her posted on Facebook of her wearing one of my favorite necklaces. I asked her calmly if she had it, and lied and said no. I knew if I continued to press the issue it would result in a screaming fight, but this necklace is special to me for reasons I won't get into, so I continued to ask her.

What happens is the fight completely deviates from the necklace, and turned into her screaming at me about how I'm the worst person she has ever met and everybody hates me. Just now, she also brought up that she hates me because when I was in high school she would try to ""hang out"" with me, but I was always sitting in my room. For some reason she resents me for this even though she knew I struggled with mental health issues while I was in high school. Then she hit me as I walked away.

So that's a glimpse into what happens, and it's very similar to what happens when anybody else gets into a fight with her. My parents tell her she can't go somewhere, and it results in her screaming about how much she hates them until they give in and let her go. She has tried to hit my mom as well in the past. She lies about everything and seems to live to put other people down. 

I just don't know what to do. I'm very sensitive to yelling and fighting already but this is messing with my head. I've struggled with anxiety and depression for a long time, and while I am doing a lot better now I feel like I regress so much from hearing how terrible I am from my own sister. I'm starting to believe the things she tells me about how horrible I am and how much better things would be if I moved out, and I am absolutely miserable whenever I'm home from work. It would be easy to just ignore her since she is barely home herself, but then she takes something from me that I need and I have no choice but to go and get it back. This is really taking a toll on me emotionally, because I really do love my sister and I want to have a relationship with her but she has made it very clear that she does not. Now, I'm discovering this resentment from the past and I don't know how to think or feel.

tldr I'm home for the summer and really having a hard time dealing with my sister, who steals, lies, and screams at everyone."
4s72lh,0,2016-07-10,18 [M4F] Here's my story and current situation.,wazzupyall,VirginityExchange,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginityExchange/comments/4s72lh/18_m4f_heres_my_story_and_current_situation/,"So unlike many people here I've had a few experiences just short of sex. This is gonna be a long one.

Be me, 11 years old, I don't even know how sex works.
During one of my breaks from school me and this girl have a sleepover. She's 1 or 2 years younger than me, but we sorta got along.

Goddamn this is really hard to write. I know reddit is one big fucking hugbox but it's still hard to type out this story.

Anyways, one night we're on an air mattress downstairs and we both stay up for awhile talking to each other. We talk about the times we've been naked with other people close to our age. I talk about how my sister and I both got naked just for the fun of it. We called them naked parties and thought they were the funniest shit. Eventually one of us asked if we wanted to have a ""naked party"" for ourselves. So we did. 

We both got naked, and it was super fun to see each other without anything on and touch each other's private bits. We would end up touching each other whenever we got the chance. One time we even tried kissing each other, which we both found kinda gross. All this time we were making sure no one else found out what we were doing, who knows what our parents would do. Surely they would at least separate us. We never got caught. 

One day we decided to have another sleepover. Really I just wanted to have another ""naked party."" I didn't really care about anything else. During our time we started to get along less and less with each other. Eventually I snapped and said the only reason I wanted to sleep over was for the ""naked parties."" She cried because of it, and she told her father. 

I was never confronted by her father about it. And my Dad wanted me to say sorry to her, he didn't talk about the reason why, he assumed I knew what I did. At the time I wasn't sure if they both knew exactly what went down. Ever since, I never talked to her again until around a year or two later when I called her and finally said ""sorry."" It was awkward. At the time I still wasn't sure what exactly I had done wrong.

Halfway through meeting her I was introduced to porn by one of my other friends. To me, it was the most awesome thing ever. Naked women! I never get to see that. I eventually would only look forward to getting into bed and fapping. It got to the point where I could only fall asleep if I fapped. This continued until college where I made an effort to quit.

Fast forward to 11th grade.
I knew I was weird, diagnosed with Asperger's but no one would notice really. I found smalltalk to be boring and stupid. I only wanted to talk about whatever I was interested in. Of course I still wanted to have sex but I thought I was being smarter than everyone else by waiting to have sex with somebody that actually loved me. If somebody didn't like me for who I was then they could just fuck off. I was not settling for less than that. Although I had this in mind, no one seemed interested in me. I eventually got so lonely that I sought to change every aspect of myself.

I discovered pickup and the Red Pill in the summer before 12th grade and decided to change myself. I got bored of anime and video games. I spent effort on making friends with cooler kids. I got the numbers of a couple different girls I met. This was one of the first big steps. I used to be nervous to just speak to a cute girl. Acne didn't help with confidence either. Eventually I got the courage to tell random girls I liked them. One even wrote in my yearbook that she hoped I would get to know a lot of girls during college.

Now fast forward to the second weekend of my first semester of college. At this point I'd already went to my first frat party and loved it. The crowded sweaty atmosphere and pumping loud music was perfect and I would dance without a care of how dumb I looked. I thought I had pulled a 180 in my personality, going from introvert to extrovert. 

So this is the second night I go out. I get into the frat house, it's pretty nice. It had a wide open dance floor, a shot bar, tons of lights, and a garage where people could chill and smoke. So I went on the dance floor and it was super loud. I already had a couple things of punch so I decide to ask a girl if she wants to dance. She agrees. We say our names in each others ears as the music is super loud. So we dance and I slowly move my hands lower. 

We then start making out. I was still in a bit of disbelief. ""Is this happening right now? Holy shit this is happening right now. This feels amazing! I feel like a god."" We start grinding on each other which also feels awesome. I move my hands closer to her crotch and she says ""We're not having sex tonight."" She gives no resistance though and is smiling so I smile and say ""yeah?"" and slide my hand down her jeans. I was amazed at how smoothly everything was going. 

She kept saying ""we're not having sex tonight"" with a smile on her face. I knew exactly what to do, just play it cool because this is obviously a shit test. So I'm fingering her and she's moaning. One of my friends that I came with tapped me on the back and said ""Yo I was looking for you"" and I responded ""I'm a little bit busy right now!"" I was really trying to make her cum. She tapped me on the shoulder and told me ""I'm good."" I have no idea whether she came that night. I thought she did at the time though. Who knows. Anyways she goes back to her friends and word gets out that the cops are here so we all hurry out. As I walk out I'm holding up my fingers to all the guy's noses and bragging saying ""yo smell this!"" and I eventually regroup with my friends. We get water at a gas station and head home in a cab. 

Since I was so under the influence I wasn't sure I'd done the right thing so I found her Facebook and contacted her the next day. I wanted to actually learn more about her, but she said she was not interested and ""acted out of character."" She wasn't interested in me anymore but I decided to go out another night figuring since I was so close the last time I just had to do it again. Every party afterwards just got worse and worse. Nothing like that ever happened again.

Right now I work an unpaid internship in NYC Monday-Friday 10am-6pm. I don't know any guys in the city and none of the girls I know have wanted to hang out. They must only have kept me around as an orbiter or were initially attracted by social proof. In college I would hang out with these really alpha guys with whom I would do hoodrat shit with and I'd invite them to smoke weed. I don't have either of those things now so I guess they lost interest.

Right now I'm still a virgin. I don't really know what's holding me back anymore. I started lifting this summer and got a new haircut hoping that would make me more attractive, but something about me is making me repulsive. I don't know what it is, but it can't be my body or my face, and definitely not my hair. Even I love my hair. It must be my mind, which in turn affects my whole demeanor. I could have any number of problems, be it anxiety, depression, insecurity, or mild autism. I hope by getting this off my chest I'll begin to heal myself.

I hope that maybe if I lose my virginity, I can use that as a stepping stone. I could use that confidence to start many more relationships in the future and overall it would raise a huge weight off my shoulders. I know many girls who need some love in their life but never got it. I've just been too nervous to suggest I could give them the intimacy they desire. I'm 100% confident in my ability to give great pleasure to someone else, I just haven't has the chance yet.

Anyways, I hope you had fun. Thanks for reading.

Edit: To the girl I met all those years ago, if you're reading this, I'm really sorry. I had no idea how hurtful I was to you and now I realize how much of an asshole I was. I hope you can forgive me."
4s74rt,2,2016-07-10,What's wrong with me?,LittleBrownDevil,Anxietyhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/4s74rt/whats_wrong_with_me/,"Ok so, for a long while now ( basically the whole of my life) I've been able to establish a 'basic' level connection with people in my class, lectures...

However, I've always struggled to develop relationships with friends or even have the balls to ask any girls out.

I have faced bullying in the past for my weight and my early obsession with filmmaking in Secondary school ( That's changed now - I'm a committed long distance runner with a marathon time of 3:40) but.... It's really hard to articulate...

So I'll just splurge random facts in the hope that someone can make sense of it...

I don't really like drinking alcohol or going on nights out. I don't why it's a mental block I seem to have. I assume that I'm not wanted or would probably be a buzz kill ( not sure why I think this) so it kind of becomes a self-fulfilling thought. I worked hard to get in shape and also feel that drinking will negatively deter the hard work I continue to invest into myself.

Yet, I know it's not because of the alcohol. I've met some amazing people who don't drink and yet are extremely extroverted and succeed on nights out - I even asked them - ""What's your secret?"" haha

I value time. I feel like going out, drinking etc.. represents an opportunity cost from the day afterward. I don't hold anything against going out, in fact, I wish I was normally able to enjoy these things so I wouldn't be such a fucking social outcast.

Like I said, no structure, just me sharing my thoughts as I write so far...

But, i feel that when I run, I am literally running away from my problems... I hide behind this facade of being dedicated to my health when really I can't help but wonder if the reason I run is to have an excuse from social events. Running is an isolating sport during training and when I run, I also feel that I am outrunning the dark thoughts that come to my mind.

How else do I avoid my introversion, anxiety and social stupidity?

I do the exact opposite expected of an introvert. I take up positions of responsibility that often land me in positions where I present in public and to large audiences. I seem to do this without a sweat ( as mentioned, I don't do well in building long lasting relationships) because I feel like I have nothing to lose. Why can't I have this mentality for developing close friends or even getting a girlfriend?

Another thing - I'm obsessed with improving the world. I feel like I need to do something to help humanity and alleviate poverty all around. I feel so fucking guilty that I have 2 parents, was born in the UK and benefitted from free education. I feel like I'm just that lucky sperm cell that ended up on this planet and, based on the way i treated my parents when I was younger, I lived a very privileged life and it's fucking killing me on the inside. I don't deserve what's been offered to me and I feel like to balance it out, I need to find ways to elevate everyone else around me. I'm driven by guilt essentially.

I write this post because history, no matter how hard I have tried to change it, continues to repeat itself. My ""friendships"" last around 3 years after which point I never seem to keep in touch with people again which is why i never even attempt to get close to people. I've started an internship in Reading (UK) and the new interns had a night out planned. I was ready. I had tons of beer in my car, I had planned to stay at an intern's house... I was parked outside his house for a good 20 minutes frozen. That mental block re-emerged, anxiety crept in and I drove off back home.. giving some shitty excuse, but I felt deep down, my absence wouldn't have made an impact anyway...


What the fuck is wrong with me? I can't keep living like this, it's driving me to some seriously fucked up thoughts about life....

4s76n1,1,2016-07-10,Young adult looking to get a head start on money,G0Tnutmeg,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4s76n1/young_adult_looking_to_get_a_head_start_on_money/,"Like the title says, I am simply a young adult trying to wrap my head around personal finance. I have been a 'lurker' on this subreddit for a while and as such have read a number of posts similar to this (including the archived and sidebar posts). However, my situation is a little different than the posts I have read, so I figured I start a topic to get y'alls feedback. Sorry in advance if this is information given out frequently as I am sure some of it will be. This is my first post, so mods feel free to move it if it is place in the wrong section. Lastly, this may be a bit varied in nature, so I will try to organize the post in a fashion that makes it understood.

I. Brief Background
* Age: I am a 20 years old (male)

* Housing: Currently live at home with my parents, and get along great with them. No rush to move out, but do not plan on staying with them till I am 30+ either. No Room &amp; Board (current or foreseen) until I move out. 

* Transportation: 2006 Audi A3 2.0T Hatchback. I paid cash for this and got it at a really good deal; Runs Great; Decent Gas Mileage; I put 3~4K miles on it year, and it should last me for a while. I pay all things car related (gas, repairs, insurance, taxes, etc). Two other things that may be worth noting. First, I am mechanically inclined, so most minor repairs are doable. Second, I have my parent co-listed on the insurance so I can get the insurance through their account as it is much cheaper this way. Please don't pick this one apart, I am happy with my decision here

* Educational Status: I will be a junior this fall majoring in Biology - looking towards bio-statistics in conjunction with marine biology. Currently, I to school in my hometown and am able to live at home during the semester as well. This lowers the cost significantly. I went to private school for my high school education and my parents have said that they would contribute what they did for high school towards college. Between living at home, and the amount of scholarships I have received (and maintain each year), it is actually significantly cheaper to go to college then it was to go the private high school, so I end up paying nothing for college each year. 

* Employment: Currently I work during the summers and focus on maintaining academic scholarships during the school year (amounts to over 5k a year). I make around 4k every summer and put almost all of into the bank. This summer, I put in around 43 hours a week (minimum wage job) and then I am doing two internships (one paid, one unpaid) that take another 35 hours a week. During the semester I have several side jobs that don't take much time, let me focus on academics, and still have some gas/spending money. 

* Assets: Car - $5-6k; Bank - $2k (will increase as the summer progresses)

* Debt: None



II. Specific Questions

1. I have never had a credit card or taken a loan out for anything. This means I have no credit history right now, correct? Is this something I should be concerned about? If so, what should I do about it?

2. In relation to the above question, what credit cards should I consider? What do I need to look for in this area? What about the cards offered by the store I frequent (or would) with my disposable income? Are these worse than the one I see advertised on TV or just slightly different? If it makes any difference, I shop almost exclusively online and wait for/find good deals. 

3. I intend to go to grad school... I am sure this will be very expensive! That's about all I know about the finance side of this. Are there any scholarships I should be aware of in the next year to be ready to apply for? I have heard about assistant-ships and intend to apply for one of those. Any other financial advice about this area? 

4. Anything else you feel would be helpful within my circumstances? 


Thanks in advance for any comments/constructive criticisms!

I graduated from a masters degree in Computer Science at the end of last year. I then started interning at a small company since January of this year. It's been 6 months now, and feel confident with taking my coding skills to the next level. The company I work for is a Microsoft stack based shop. I am asking the company to convert my internship to a full-time position. If they do that, I will have to stick with them for a year. The pay is very less, but there is not much work pressure except for during release dates, which is fine with me. I am not OK with the pay though. I have student debt to clear.  

Like most people, my dream job is to work for hot companies like google, fb, airbnb, uber etc. And of course to get into them I must have an awesome resume.

Should I invest my time in writing a personal project, and then start practicing coding questions or should I start practicing coding questions right away? It should take me about 6 months to practice all questions on leetcode or interviewbit. It might take me a month to write a personal project. The career-fair at my college would be at the beginning of September and February next year. 

Does having a personal project have any advantage over professional experience?

4s7lmm,103,2016-07-10,LDR Bf [28M] is being cold and dismissive to me after i [23F] asked him to talk less about his coworker [20sF],lessiknowthebetter1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4s7lmm/ldr_bf_28m_is_being_cold_and_dismissive_to_me/,"Hello guys, I thought i had a fantastic relationship up until recently, but now im not so sure.. For some background, i met ""Chris"" [28] during an exchange to his country two years ago, we had eight months of pure love and decided to remain together and work it out as i returned to finish my studies. I graduate next month and we took care of the immigration process these past few months and are just waiting on their decision. Chances are ill be back in 2-3 months.

Everything seemed great. Until now we havent had any major bumps, would call/text nearly everyday and have remained 1000% faithful. He visited me twice last year and i visited him earlier this year. I made some crazy sacrifices to be back to him as soon as possible, such as graduating one year earlier than i was supposed to, which means i did the last ~12 disciplines of the course along with the internship and my thesis project. It was hell but i managed and unfortunately these days ive been wondering if it was all worth it.

The problem: ""Chris"" has a new coworker this semester, a subordinate of him in his department, who thankfully leaves in a few weeks. For the past few months, he was complimenting her performance very often during our calls, and i was chill and happy for him. And then he started to bring up how they relate a lot on personal stuff, like music taste, aspirations, perspectives on life and eventually he even let it slip that he dissed me to her. I have no idea what he said, but he told me he mentioned me to her and i said ""was it something good?"", and he responded ""...no...?"". (And he does have a history of throwing me under the bus, to which i called him out on it and he recognized and said he'd try to stop).

One day i got fed up with the frequency and manner he would bring this girl up, in a moment where i really crave his attention and intimacy, and when we've been getting more and more done with calling/skyping. He said quite a few times he feels like calling became a chore now. So i asked him to take it down a notch how much he tells me about this girl, because it makes me feel insecure and im not there with him everyday to ease up and reconnect with him as much as i would like, while she gets to spend at least six hours around him daily. For reference, Ive met her in person briefly and for those maybe wondering, i think she is attractive, while the only not positive thing he says about her is that he isnt attracted to her.

Well, he didnt have any of it. He assumed i was accusing him of cheating, when all i really wanted was for him to quit blabbing and fixating on this girl who he spends several hours everyday together. Eventually he said he'd quit talking about her but was very huffy puffy about it, cutting the conversation short and making me feel like the crazy jealous gf, when i really just wanted some reassurance and to feel that all his attention is/was on me.

Things were fine for a few weeks until he started to talk about this girl AGAIN last week, inserting unnecessary facts about her in our conversations. And then i pointed it out AGAIN that i didnt want to hear anything about her, and tried to explain once more that i am sure theres nothing going on between them, but id still like him not to mention this person during this tough time of our relationship (almost done with the distance / worn out /done with calling or spending time together virtually / no intimacy / about to graduate). And then he got super pissy, kinda passive aggressive and just cutting the call short because he just didnt want to hear my point and change one small thing to acommodate me. For me, it seems hes dead set that he isnt doing anything wrong, so he leaves it for me to get over it and deal with this on my own. He just says stuff like ""there is nothing to worry about"" / ""this is ri di cu lous"" / ""youre overreacting"". I feel that if the tables were turned, he wouldnt like the situation at all. As a partner, i feel that he should be more considerate and less dismissive when i try to work this out, because i know its not that huge of a deal in itself, but the fact that he closes himself up whenever i try to address it is making it escalate into a bigger thing and making me feel resentful of his attitude. I feel that I've made so many sacrifices for us to be together so far and now with this apparently small thing he cannot be bothered to hear me out and talk things over.

I tried to address it a couple times, but everytime he shuts down, so then i just decided not to press it anymore, because i dont want to get more disappointed. I called/texted less the past week and this weekend I travelled with my friends to try to decompress. I texted him a short and straight message on friday to let him know i couldnt talk for the weekend. I just got home to see that his last message was simply ""i hope youll have a good time"" on friday and that was it. I just dont know what to do.. I love him so fucking much but i cant move past this issue if he isnt open to it.. I cant believe that after all the effort ive put on us, i no longer feel like the girlfriend he loves, cherishes, and cares about how she feels. Im very sad and I wish you guys could give me a heads up on how i can address this... Thanks in advance..

**TLDR: long distance bf [28M] is inconsiderate and dismissive when i [23F] ask him to talk less about a new coworker [20?F]. Whenever i try to discuss the topic, he gets mad at me and says im overreacting. He's now cold and short.. How to deal with this?

I have over  3.5/4.0 GPA and almost everyone in my class who had over a 3.0 got an internship except for me and I fell it's largely because of my felony charge.  I explained my felony to interviewers (they were going to run background check anyways) and no one seemed to want to take a chance hiring me.  So am I screwed?  Does anyone know of any engineers who are convicted felons or companies that would hire me? Am I destined to stay in academia?  
4s7tml,1,2016-07-10,How to approach FT recruiting at other banks?,IBthrowaway16,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/4s7tml/how_to_approach_ft_recruiting_at_other_banks/,"Hi,

I'm currently a summer analyst at a top MM bank in the Midwest (Blair, Piper, Baird). Although I don't have an offer at the moment, I'm pretty positive that I'll get one and am hoping to make a jump for full time to BB/EB in NYC. I know it's tough but I may as well try.

I have a few questions:

1.) What should I tell people when I introduce myself? Should I tell them explicitly that I'm trying to make a jump or be more indirect and say that I'm exploring my options? I'm a little worried I'll contact the wrong person and they'll tell someone at my bank that I'm trying to jump.

And is it better to cold email bankers or HR at these banks?

2.) Which banks are recruiting more for FT? I know the market is a little tough right now so I don't want to direct much effort to places that will fill their whole analyst class with interns.

Thanks in advance for the help."

A message to ALL in a rough situation due to their parents.",theSTEMpush,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4s7tn0/the_one_main_positive_we_can_all_take_away_from/,"I did not grow up with good circumstances and my parents are horrible people, especially a man I am unfortunate enough to call my father. Lots of moving around, tons of verbal abuse growing up, lots of fear mongering by parents, and that was just the tip of the iceberg. In my teens, I never thought of the idea of having my own dad (hurts me to call him dad) as my worst enemy but it happened. My own dad schemed to ruin my college transcript and my career path by forcing me down the biology major, which is unemployable and no good unless you get into med school (which I never wanted in the first place).

It was painful for me to realize but after truly thinking about it, I am 100% sure this is the case. I wanted to study finance or accounting, get a job in a big city after college, but not so fast. Out of nowhere, my dad started blackmailing, fear mongering, and guilt tripping me into a major he *knew* I would fail in. I never thought it was intentional or evil but that is because at 18, no one thinks of their own father as their own worst enemy. Society is too busy shoving this stupid idea down your throat that all parents are good parents.

I did not want to realize it, my dad played it nice and *promised* me a career, said that I can *always* rely on him. I was depressed, failing, and yet my dad was in a very happy mood, I wonder what kept him so happy huh. Then after finishing a horrible college experience with a measly 2.1 GPA and poor career options, I moved back home a couple of months ago.

What do I get?

""Those accounting kids are getting jobs? Why the hell don't you have a job?""

""You can't blame your life problems on us!"" (After he made me major in a useless subject)

Can you believe it? Force me into an unemployable major against my own will and then get mad at me for not being able to find a job?

WHOA! I had to literally hear it to believe it. I was out of options and I was out of choices but I ended up submitting. I managed to get an internship for a lab tech job, unfortunately living at home for it while I do so and miserable at that. One other thing that sucks is that the professor who gave me the internship has worked with my dad before which kinda worries me but I am out of options right now. Now I live at home (for the time being, hopefully that time ends fast) with my parents as I try to get the training needed for a lab tech job. It will pay 30-40k but it will get me out of the house, that is all I can ask for.

I realized what had happened, my dad made me major in a horrible subject because he knew I would not be able to find a lucrative career. My dad knew that I would fail and as a result be forced to live at home after college. I am sick of calling him my dad after realizing what had happened. After realizing that I could have been independent of that demon spawn, he played me and forced me into a rough situation to where independence is hard to get because no one wants to employ a biology major.

As my friends move to big city to work and get their independence, I am stuck at home after college.

**Then it hit me, and it literally saved me from thinking about suicide.**

You know how they say your teens and 20s are the best years of your life?

That hardly applies to people like us, especially those of us with domineering parents. No, that applies to the rich kids and kids with good normal parents heavily involved in their lives. For people in our situation, the teens are hell and early 20s slightly less so.

For people like us, I truly feel that we are going through the grinder and will appreciate life more in the future as we have to deal with our parents (in my case the equivalent of demons) less. People will good parents are going to cry and break down when their parents pass away but when mines do, I hate to admit it but I am going to feel so happy and free in life.

Whatever comes after this is going to be a cakewalk if we learn to deal with our god awful parents.

Horrible bosses?
Manipulative people?
Domineering personalities?

All of them are going to be cakewalk because we had an unfortunate fate the day we were born, we were born to the kinds of personalities that are willing to manipulate and lie to their very own kids in order to get ahead in life. I mean what kind of rotten personalities do that? The kind that belong in hell and will likely burn there for eternity after they are dead.

We're going to be happy, we are going to make it, and we are going to appreciate our lives. While the rest of the normal kids are whining about having a job after college and not having anymore good friends to hang out with, we are going to be happy as we are free of the heavy weight that fate put behind our backs the day we were born. Life is going to get good for us because no matter what kind of an issue we have to face, it is going to be a cakewalk compared to being born to cold blooded sociopaths as parents."
4s82je,43,2016-07-10,[CA] Update on unpaid internship and small start up company.,akarinrin,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4s82je/ca_update_on_unpaid_internship_and_small_start_up/,"[See this post for context.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4rxmsc/ca_became_a_virtual_intern_at_a_small_start_up/) - **TL;DR for that post:** *my internship at a small start up online company consists of only unpaid interns and not employees. I could negotiate wages or file a complaint with the DLSE.* 

I emailed the CEO on July 8th to negotiate wages since I felt that I was being treated like an employee, rather than reporting to the DLSE. I presented my case fairly and in a non-threatening manner. My plan was, if he did not respond within 24 hours, I would email the other interns to let them know that I planned to pursue legal action that they could opt-in to, asking them to contact me.

The night of 7/9 after hearing nothing, I sent out that email, and he was ""alerted"" by an intern that the email was sent (he claimed to not have been at the computer), and this prompted him to call me. When we spoke on the phone, I learned a lot of disturbing things. 

* I negotiated for pay, and then if that weren't possible, a small signing bonus of $500. His response was the company does not have enough profits to pay any of its employees, and that is why everyone is an unpaid intern. I suggested as low as $200, but he resisted.

* Everyone else such as those on the board (Chief Marketing Officer, etc) is a shareholder (equity?). 

* He tried to justify not paying interns by saying he was a small start up company. All of the company's profits go straight into marketing. 

* A majority of the interns ARE getting college credit, but from what I see, they still displace regular employees, which is the problem.

* Towards the end, he agreed that I was overqualified for the job and should pursue employment elsewhere where my skills could be utilized. BUT, I was welcome to come back to the company and he would let me know when funding was available because he really wanted me on the team.

A former intern later that evening sent me an email wishing to disclose what he knew, and we communicated on the phone. He told me that:

* He was basically in charge of translating, marketing and networking in a specific foreign country. 

* While he was an intern, towards the end of the internship he was asked to stay with the company for longer. He refused to do so unless he would be compensated, and that he had to negotiate intensely before the CEO relented and paid him. 

* After a certain period of time, the CEO claimed they had run out of money and wouldn't be able to pay, so this intern left the company because he didn't feel it was going to be successful. 

* He had no direct supervisors besides a VP in marketing, and he worked with another unpaid interns. 

* He did receive college credit for his time there. 

* The CEO tried to lure him into staying with a false promise of pay again in the future by saying something along the lines of, ""If the company is successful, you will be successful."" 

* The CEO likes to hire lots of international interns, and the intern said he felt that perhaps this was done because they wouldn't be familiar with the law. 

* Lastly, he had received an email shortly after the CEO called me that basically slandered my whole intentions and went something along these lines: 

*""I have forsaken my own family finances in order to keep the business afloat.* 

*“I hope you are not tainted by the unhappiness of one individual who did not think to call me to convey her concern, but decided to blast an email to all of the interns.”*

*“Please take this as a lesson to surround yourself with positive people.”*

**UPDATE 7/11:** Another intern got in touch with me and stated the following. 

* The company has a $500000 budget plan for when they receive their venture funding. In that budget proposal, they only made room to pay 6 employees. The remaining interns would have to stay interns. 

* He said he knew that the developers were unpaid interns, doing the work by themselves. 

* He currently works there, and feels that he replaces the role of an employee. 

**UPDATE 7/12:** A third intern emailed me today. This is what they had to say:

* The CEO did this weekly video contest for the website's video library, and promised a prize for the winner. Nobody ever received any prizes. They said that on their contract, creating videos was not a part of it, and that this stressed them out especially during exam periods. They frequently reminded the CEO that they were too busy for it.

* They were unpaid, and in charge of recruiting MORE unpaid interns from another certain country. 

~~**New question**: Should I pursue a class action law suit? What are my chances?~~

Looks like I'm planning to file a suit. Wish me luck!"
4s8adk,1,2016-07-10,where to begin with starting a power systems animation tool similar to physics ones?,ladyee,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/4s8adk/where_to_begin_with_starting_a_power_systems/,"Hi everyone! 

TL;DR at the bottom of the text wall. *THANK YOU ahead of time since this is a lot of text!!!!*

I could really use some help and direction for work on an interactive learning tool (similar to physics ones, but about power system dynamics), and I am not sure where to begin. I have read the FAQ in webdev and web_design and have gotten some ideas of where to go, but am still a bit unsure. I think this can be done with HTML/CSS/JavaScript and without a web server (??) because all it needs to do is take some inputs and provide moving dots on graphs.  


For background, this is a [potential] assignment for an intern working for me this summer. He has a bit of experience with python, (no HTML/CSS/JS), but has shown to be a quick learner. In terms of my ability to help him, I’m proficient in python, but have no experience with HTML/CSS/JS or anything web related (at all)…and the last GUI I developed was for an MP3 player with java…12 years ago.  So, I’m not a lot of help, but I’d be excited to learn and work with him if you guys think this may be possible. Also, I’ve discussed with him, and he is quite interested in the idea because it’s something he could have ownership over in a way that is uncommon for interns.  The rest of this explains more of what I’m looking for requirements-wise.

As a part of my work designing a stability analysis tool for use in the control center at a utility, I also have to figure out how to train the operators and engineers who will be using it. I’m working on gathering materials so I will have a sort of tutorial. As I was putting together a ""guinea pig"" presentation for some of my colleagues, I realized that it would be useful to have an interactive visualization kind of like what they do in physics forums.  If anyone is interested or if it’s helpful to know, the animation would be a take on the equal area criterion and power angle graph (I did check and nothing like this exists for this concept).  I have an example of a physics interactive animation that sort of is the gist of what I’m going for here:


http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Physics-Interactives/Momentum-and-Collisions/Collision-Carts/Collision-Carts-Interactive



Basically, I would like for the user to be able to have a few fields where they can input variables for the swing equation to determine how the graph should be drawn and then use a small dot to show how the system oscillates as it returns to a new operating point. Originally, I had thought to have the variables be individual text editable boxes, but it may be interesting for learning purposes to have them be scalable markers like what the above animation does for car speed? As the animation plays, a little dot will move up and down some upside down parabolas to represent what the system power is doing and what the angle spread between busses is. Anyway, I’m not sure what is easier/harder to do here, so I wanted to say either would be okay if that affects any advice.

I would really appreciate any feedback on what could be done here. I don’t want to give my intern an undo amount of work, but I really like the idea (as does he) that this is a project he could have total ownership over and would be SUPER helpful in the long run. I have other non-bull shit jobs for him to do this summer, but I just thought this was a cool idea. He and I will meet and I’ll show him the thread responses as well to get this all started if it seems like it can be done.


**TL;DR:**  *Advice needed on whether my smart intern (some python skills, no HTML/CSS/JS knowledge -- but quite interested in this project) could put together an interactive visualization tool similar to the physics one linked above, but about power systems. I am decent w/ python, but have never done anything web related (he knows this and is still game). Can it be done in 4 weeks? And if so, where should he (and I) start?*"
4s8dk3,0,2016-07-10,Here's a story of my past.,wazzupyall,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/4s8dk3/heres_a_story_of_my_past/,"Maybe you guys will have some insights or maybe just get a laugh or a cringe out of it. This is gonna be a long one.

Be me, 11 years old, I don't even know how sex works. During one of my breaks from school me and this girl have a sleepover. She's 1 or 2 years younger than me, but we sorta got along.

Anyways, one night we're on an air mattress downstairs and we both stay up for awhile talking to each other. We talk about the times we've been naked with other people close to our age. I talk about how my sister and I both got naked just for the fun of it. We called them naked parties and thought they were the funniest shit. Eventually one of us asked if we wanted to have a ""naked party"" for ourselves. So we did.

We both got naked, and it was super fun to see each other without anything on and touch each other's private bits. We would end up touching each other whenever we got the chance. One time we even tried kissing each other, which we both found kinda gross. All this time we were making sure no one else found out what we were doing, who knows what our parents would do. Surely they would at least separate us. We never got caught.

One day we decided to have another sleepover. Really I just wanted to have another ""naked party."" I didn't really care about anything else. During our time we started to get along less and less with each other. Eventually I snapped and said the only reason I wanted to sleep over was for the ""naked parties."" She cried because of it, and she told her father.

I was never confronted by her father about it. And my Dad wanted me to say sorry to her, he didn't talk about the reason why, he assumed I knew what I did. At the time I wasn't sure if they both knew exactly what went down. Ever since, I never talked to her again until around a year or two later when I called her and finally said ""sorry."" It was awkward. At the time I still wasn't sure what exactly I had done wrong.

Halfway through meeting her I was introduced to porn by one of my other friends. To me, it was the most awesome thing ever. Naked women! I never get to see that. I eventually would only look forward to getting into bed and fapping. It got to the point where I could only fall asleep if I fapped. This continued until college where I made an effort to quit.

Fast forward to 11th grade. I knew I was weird, diagnosed with Asperger's but no one would notice really. I found smalltalk to be boring and stupid. I only wanted to talk about whatever I was interested in. Of course I still wanted to have sex but I thought I was being smarter than everyone else by waiting to have sex with somebody that actually loved me. If somebody didn't like me for who I was then they could just fuck off. I was not settling for less than that. Although I had this in mind, no one seemed interested in me. I eventually got so lonely that I sought to change every aspect of myself.

I discovered pickup and the Red Pill in the summer before 12th grade and decided to change myself. I got bored of anime and video games. I spent effort on making friends with cooler kids. I got the numbers of a couple different girls I met. This was one of the first big steps. I used to be nervous to just speak to a cute girl. Acne didn't help with confidence either. Eventually I got the courage to tell random girls I liked them. One even wrote in my yearbook that she hoped I would get to know a lot of girls during college.

Now fast forward to the second weekend of my first semester of college. At this point I'd already went to my first frat party and loved it. The crowded sweaty atmosphere and pumping loud music was perfect and I would dance without a care of how dumb I looked. I thought I had pulled a 180 in my personality, going from introvert to extrovert.

So this is the second night I go out. I get into the frat house, it's pretty nice. It had a wide open dance floor, a shot bar, tons of lights, and a garage where people could chill and smoke. So I went on the dance floor and it was super loud. I already had a couple things of punch so I decide to ask a girl if she wants to dance. She agrees. We say our names in each others ears as the music is super loud. So we dance and I slowly move my hands lower.

We then start making out. I was still in a bit of disbelief. ""Is this happening right now? Holy shit this is happening right now. This feels amazing! I feel like a god."" We start grinding on each other which also feels awesome. I move my hands closer to her crotch and she says ""We're not having sex tonight."" She gives no resistance though and is smiling so I smile and say ""yeah?"" and slide my hand down her jeans. I was amazed at how smoothly everything was going.

She kept saying ""we're not having sex tonight"" with a smile on her face. I knew exactly what to do, just play it cool because this is obviously a shit test. So I'm fingering her and she's moaning. One of my friends that I came with tapped me on the back and said ""Yo I was looking for you"" and I responded ""I'm a little bit busy right now!"" I was really trying to make her cum. She tapped me on the shoulder and told me ""I'm good."" I have no idea whether she came that night. I thought she did at the time though. Who knows. Anyways she goes back to her friends and word gets out that the cops are here so we all hurry out. As I walk out I'm holding up my fingers to all the guy's noses and bragging saying ""yo smell this!"" and I eventually regroup with my friends. We get water at a gas station and head home in a cab.

Since I was so under the influence I wasn't sure I'd done the right thing so I found her Facebook and contacted her the next day. I wanted to actually learn more about her, but she said she was not interested and ""acted out of character."" She wasn't interested in me anymore but I decided to go out another night figuring since I was so close the last time I just had to do it again. Every party afterwards just got worse and worse. Nothing like that ever happened again.

Right now I work an unpaid internship in NYC Monday-Friday 10am-6pm. I don't know any guys in the city and none of the girls I know have wanted to hang out. They must only have kept me around as an orbiter or were initially attracted by social proof. In college I would hang out with these really alpha guys with whom I would do hoodrat shit with and I'd invite them to smoke weed. I don't have either of those things now so I guess they lost interest.

Right now I'm still a virgin. I don't really know what's holding me back anymore. I started lifting this summer and got a new haircut hoping that would make me more attractive, but something about me is making me repulsive. I don't know what it is, but it can't be my body or my face, and definitely not my hair. Even I love my hair. It must be my mind, which in turn affects my whole demeanor. I hope by getting this off my chest I'll begin to heal myself.

I hope that maybe if I lose my virginity, I can use that as a stepping stone. I could use that confidence to start many more relationships in the future and overall it would raise a huge weight off my shoulders.

Anyways, thanks for reading. Hope you got something out of it.

Also, to the girl I met all those years ago, on the off chance you find this, I'm really sorry. I had no idea how hurtful I was to you and now I realize how much of an asshole I was. I hope you can forgive me."
4s8sj5,137,2016-07-10,"[Security] Wait, he did WHAT?",Seatown93,TalesFromTheSquadCar,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/4s8sj5/security_wait_he_did_what/,"Yep, I've got another!

Background: Security intern at a small college campus. Volunteered for night shift as it paid more and was generally a bit more fun. Most of our calls were stuff like alcohol offenses, traffic accidents, parties, the usual fair for a college.

Our school contracted out to the local PD for after-hours security as well, since we couldn't carry any fun toys like tazers and the like. Liability clauses are a bitch. They would generally stay on until about 0200, and then I'd have the place to myself until the boss came in at 0630 and I could sleep.

This particular evening, I was working with [Officer Shitmagnet](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/41ax4z/friend_officer_shitmagnet_or_how_i_learned_to/?ref=search_posts). It had been quiet the whole night save for a couple parking tickets. Of course, that luck didn't last long.

Twenty minutes before he was supposed to leave, he gets a call over the radio.

""Unit 19, dispatch.""

*Groan* ""Dispatch, 19, go for it.""

""We've got two units dispatched to the college, reports of an intoxicated individual who fell and hit his head on the sidewalk by the auditorium. EMS is en-route, but you were closer so...""

He looked at me like someone had just shit in his coffee before keying up. ""Roger...heading over there now."" 

I hop in the passenger seat of his old Tahoe, laughing as the twenty-year old engine sputters to life. ""You're cursed, admit it.""

""Nope, this is totally all your fault."" He grumbles, turning towards the road that would take us up to the theater. ""I'm fucking magical, you're the one who's messing around with sorcery or some shit.""

Before we can decide who summoned the dark lord, his searchlight finds our client for the evening; older gentleman with messy hair, tattered beard, and stained clothes. We stopped a few yards short of him as he was crawling along the grass, but even from there I could smell the sickening combination of vomit and alcohol.

I paint him with my flashlight first, calling out from a few feet away in case things were about to turn ugly. ""Evening sir, campus security and the police here, you doing okay?""

He was on all fours, dry-heaving and trying vainly to get up onto his feet. Turning towards us, he mumbled something and actually managed to get vertical briefly before falling over again. ""F-fug off! I'mmm f-fine!""

The officer couldn't help chuckling quietly, circling around to his left while pulling on a pair of gloves. ""That nasty cut on your forehead says otherwise, why don't you let me give you a hand?""

I looked up the streets as two more patrol units pulled up, lights flashing. By now everyone else was wearing gloves, and in our industry we call that a clue. Slipping on a pair myself, I helped Sgt Shitmagnet haul him into a sitting position on the side of the curb.

This poor bastard couldn't get out a full sentence without gagging and dry-heaving, head wobbling around like a newborn giraffe. One of the other units knelt down and flashed a penlight in his eyes. ""I'm just going to check you out for a concussion, sir. Do you know what day it is?""

He swatted at the light, missing it by a mile. ""I dun f-fuggin' know, f-fuggin- *hrrrrrk*...""

""What's your name?""

""A-are you arrestin' me you fugging pi- *Hrrrrrrk*""

We were almost in tears with silent laughter as EMS showed up. The medics took one look at him before pulling out the gurney with included restraints. At first drunky struggled a bit when the officers tried hauling him onto it, but whatever he had drunk didn't give him much motivation or hand-eye coordination. 

The medics finally load him up, and we get a one-finger salute before they shut the doors and start driving to the hospital. After carefully discarding of my now tainted gloves, I climbed back into the car with the Sgt. 

""Well, that was fun.""

He laughed, popping it into drive. ""Hey, could've been a lot worse. He could've stabbed you instead.""

""Huh?""

""Oh yeah, that guy just got out of prison a year ago for stabbing his brother like sixteen times. Violent son of a bitch, we were lucky he was drunk.""

I was flabbergasted. ""Wait...he's more violent when he's SOBER?""

The Sgt. nodded. ""Oh yeah, he's a mad man. He's a lot easier to deal with when he's shit-faced. Weird, right?"""

I've noticed that my excel, MS access, and tableau skills are more indispensable than I thought since I started and my team has expressed that if I can find a role to fit in in their team, they can make a position open to me if they see the need for it.

Right now I'm working on analyzing raw data to find specific cases where freight consolidation would be a cost-saving measure to take in the company I'm working at, and quite frankly, I'm eating it up and I love it. I kind of think that it would be awesome if I can convince my department to take me on as a permanent member of their team to do this kind of work.

What do you, as a logistics analyst do? Does this role describe what I'm currently doing in my internship? What sorts of projects have you worked on? Do you have any advice for me as an intern?

I will try to keep it short!

Some background so you can understand:

* I live in a country that ppl usually move out when they get married. It's not common and it's a bit weird when ppl leave to live with roomates or bf/gf.

* **Important:** when I was a kid, my parents used to fight a lot! I never saw my father hitting my mother, but he was really agressive with his words until my mom loses her mind.

* In High School (17yrs old), I started dating an amazing guy (17M), but my father was so protective that I couldn't hang out with him a lot, had to get home early, I couldn't be with him alone at home, etc. When I finished school and started my graduation and started working, I really thought it would change. Wrong! Same rules, same shit! 

I never slept over his house and my father only let me travel with him once, with his family. I couldn't stay at his house after 10p.m. even if it's his birthday or his grandmother's. I stayed after 10p.m. those two days and he got abusive on the phone saying he would pick me up and humiliate me. I'm talking about a 2 yrs and a half relationship!

* So I met this amazing guy(20M) in the beggining of the year. We started dating since then and my family never heard about him. He has been so patient with my issue. He said I can take the time I need to introduce him. Never told about him because I knew they would stand harder.

* Also, this guy introduced me in the political world. Since March, I have been part of this group, I told my parents I was going to a feminism group. My father hates this thing because he thinks we girls get together to protest with our boobs out, I told him we don't do that, but he doesn't believe. I get REALLY anxious when we have a meeting because I'm afraid my father won't let me go or will call me saying I must come home.

* In October we will have a trip to another state to meet others to debate our things. It's really really important that I go there, but I know he won't let me travel with them. He won't believe me. I don't know if I tell them about my boyfriend will make it easier or harder for my parents to let me go.

* I'm also planing to leave home when I finish the graduation in the end of 2017. I would live with my bf (if we still get together and I think we will) and another couple, our friends.

I don't know how to talk to him anymore, I'm sick of this thing. I've been trying to stand my opinions, he fights back anyway. If he can't control me, he says it's my moms fault and keeps saying things to her.. I can't be a ""rebel"" knowing my mom will suffer.

I'm a great girl, never used drugs or did anything wrong. I have great grades in college, I'm part of a professional internship in the best university in my country and I also have a job as a teacher.

I'm not sure what I'm asking you.. I guess I need some advices about how to talk to my parents, how to handle this situation, how to tell them I'm dating, how to make them let me have this trip and how to make it easier to leave home.

**TL;DR:** I'm sick of being my father's baby girl. He is possessive with me and my mother and he doesn't let me do the things I want to and I'm afraid of ""fighting back"". In October I will have a trip that I really need and want to go but I'm sure he won't let me go. Plus I have a boyfriend for 6 months and my family doesn't know about him."

He also was Creative Director for Bioshock 2,  a designer and writer in Bio 1 and Infinite respectively and Designed the famous level ""The Shalebridge Cradle"" for Thief 3.
I also made other interviews but since this is one of the best, I decided to share it first to see if /r/Games is interested in this kind of thing. This wasn't published anywhere except an old blog I kept as an archive for these things. Instead of letting it gather digital dust I thought someone around here might find it enjoyable and wanted to share. Hope you enjoy it!* 

**1 – Let’s start with the definition of game. What do you define as a “game”? Also when designing one, you try to make it fit your definition of what constitutes a game or you take a more open approach? For example you have an idea for an adventure game but it isn’t viable to use puzzles, do you adapt the idea to fit the standard of adventure games with puzzles, or you go along with the idea?**


To be honest, I find the semantic debate about the formal designation “game” to be academic at best, toxic at worst. Even reading a book or watching a show has an element of interactivity – it is just less physical than what interests me. But, on the spectrum of participation (with, say – an aesop’s fable on one end, with the moral spelled out … and Minecraft on the other), I tend to favor interactive art which invites the player to perform a duet with the designer. To exercise some editorial privilege, ideally to imbue it with personal meaning.

 

That’s not to say I want to build a procedural “meaning machine” – my work tends to have a reasonably strong authorial voice that slowly tries to seduce the player into taking more control of the story, once some context for choice has been established. That, to me, is a sweet spot.

 

Your second question seems to be more related to genre tropes – generally, genre as a top-down creative constraint seems clumsy to me, so when a project idea occurs, I’m not hugely interested in trying to filter it artificially.

 

**2 – I’ve been curious about your jump from games journalism to game dev. It was always the plan to be a game developer or something you grew fond of as you worked as a journalist? Where and what roles did you perform before being lead designer on Thief Deadly Shadows?**

 

It was always the plan. As a teenager, I somehow managed to con some 30 year old artists into helping me make a game in Visual Basic. I’m still not sure why they took me seriously – I was definitely not ready to lead anyone across the finish line. Before Deadly Shadows, I worked on Drakan in a strange hybrid function where Psygnosis was paying me very well to review &amp; edit the script – and yet I was also a design intern receiving college credit, so they had me build desks, et cetera. Arrogance and humility at the same time. It was wild. I then moved on to Amaze Entertainment, briefly, where I worked on a licensed Harry Potter title and learned Unreal from a quietly brilliant fellow named Ben Golus.

 

**3 – Going to the level design aspect, specifically your work in The Cradle for Thief 3. I like how the level “breaks” some of the game design rules (example: Shadows being equal to safety and in that level equal to fear). The idea for the level originated from experimentation with the rules or from something else? There was a moment when designing it, that you or Randy Smith felt that breaking these rules wouldn’t make it feel like Thief or that the level wouldn’t feel satisfying for the stealth player?**

 

It originated from Randy’s desire to build “the scariest game level of all time” – a goal I was very much aligned with. (Spoilers… but hey, it’s pretty old now.) We definitely both took a lot of heat for the decision not to feature any enemies whatsoever for the first half. We wanted to wage strictly psychological warfare on you through sound, scripted cues, etc – so that by the time you were being hunted by AIs of any kind, the Cradle would be a character to you, this patient, malevolent intelligence – and the enemies would seem like organs in a malevolent body.

 

**4 – One thing that has changed in level design has been the use of a map to navigate the different scenarios. Now in game markers for your objectives is the norm. Why has this changed? If the player has to use a map to navigate a level is considered the fault of the designer? Do you believe that this limits the complexity (in a good way) of what a level designer can craft?**

 

Well, in part that tumbled out of a hunger for mainstream accessibility – this notion that to be lost is to be confused, and “confusion” became the kiss of death in certain design circles. The conventional wisdom was that the average gamer would simply reject the experience in favor of something that — phrased as charitably as I can — had more respect for their time.

 

There was a false dichotomy being created, I think, between two straw men – this Hardcore Gamer who could overcome anything and had infinite patience  – and this “hit buyer” casual gamer who had the attention span of, well, the marketing droids who manufactured that myth.

 

In fact, there are many paths to engagement and how openly you disclose the physical location of an objective comes down to your experiential goals. Is the act of locating, that sense of searching – important to the story you want the player telling themselves? Or is it actually just window dressing for the deep combat or social mechanics you want them to focus on?

 

**5 – Do you see procedural generated levels being used for games like Thief a possibility? Or for games that rely heavily on its level design it isn’t viable to implement?**

 

Thief had a lot of dimensionality. On the one hand, you had these strongly authored human structures which were telling a very specific story through architecture. On the other, you had these ruins and tombs which sometimes defied spatial rules to a deeply unsettling effect. If you play Eldritch, which is a procedural 1st person roguelike by David Pittman, you can begin to see where the latter strain of Thief’s DNA might go. So in short, yes, I do – they won’t have everything that Thief did, but that wide open exploration, that tango with the unknown – they can take to places that literally no one else will ever go.

 

**6 – Since you worked as a game writer. What do you consider fundamental aspects of the discipline and common mistakes that you see across games? Some literary works that inspired you or you consider essential for a game writer?**

 

I think the big issues I see most commonly are – inelegant handling of the amnesia problem, meaning, in another medium, the protagonist’s expertise is obvious. When the player must embody that force in the world and literally may not know how to walk yet – there’s a gap in expectations that must be handled deftly. Another, which I fell into early on and often still do – is the need to brutally simplify any dialogue which affects the player’s ability to comprehend what they’re being asked to do. If you have a “Guide” or companion who talks like a Pynchon character, the player may simply stall out. They have less mental “bandwidth” available to decode language, period. And if your solution is to simply bolt them to the floor and make them listen to a lecture, every time this problem surfaces – again, you’re misunderstanding a lot of why people come to interactive art at all.

 

**7 – Being also a designer, when starting a game do you begin with the story you want to tell, or the mechanics you want the player to experience? Do you feel the one you don’t start with suffers during the creation of the game or both can be adapted to fit one another?**

 

It’s different from game to game. As a narrative-biased designer, I start with “core fantasy” – some desire for an experience the real world can’t offer. There are usually some satellite story concepts, but then — reflexively now, having been trained for many years by mechanically-minded systems guys to whom I owe a great deal — I put that aside and start asking myself what the player can actually do. And then much later I begin to unify the narrative with that. Your mileage may vary, but it’s easier for me to adapt world-oriented narrative to some mechanics that work – than it is to try and finish a story and then develop the game on top of that.

 

**8 – There has been somewhat of an exodus from the studios to indie development. 2k Marin being a prime example. While I can guess some motives, which are the ones you consider the main ones for this switch to indie? And which are the ones that motivated you to go indie?**

 

There’s no great mystery to this, from my point of view. Large scale game projects have become such complex endeavors requiring too many people to know by name. Maintaining any personal creative investment in that environment is dicey at best – often, even for the leads. Further, your personal compensation for a successful project gets split so many ways. Past that, the availability of new paths to funding and extremely cheap and powerful game development middleware has decreased the freefall fears that a lot of people had about independent work. All of these were factors for me.

 

**9 – I have noticed in some recent stealth games, a switch to a more fast paced stealth. Splinter Cell Blacklist and Dishonored come to mind. Why do you think some games are adopting this style? Do you think stealth games like Thief are too slow for today audience? Do you prefer this faster style or the slow one?**

 

Happily, no, I think there’s plenty of room for both — and they offer such contrasting stimulation that I don’t see a need for one to win. Slower paced games may need to scale their budget according to the number of people who are interested &amp; will regularly pay for that kind of experience. In terms of preference – I buy both, but I’ve always preferred games that give me time to think, whether that’s a turn-based strategy game like Card Hunter – which I will play against the grim reaper if he’s up for it … or Hitman: Blood Money, say – which allows you to take a deliberate approach if you wish it.

 

My reflexes aren’t too embarrassing – I think I need time to tell myself the internal story that makes the experience mine. This touches on that note above about the amount of free brainpower that a player has when the bulk of their forebrain is screaming “GRENADE!”

 

**10 – As a designer what genres do you find to be (or think) the more challenging to make? And as a writer?**

 

Honestly, I think this is more a function of what you’re taking on in terms of creative promise. An adventure game might seem like an easier environment for a writer, but if it’s about a person with receptive aphasia — all of a sudden you have to figure out how to convey that terrifying scramble that happens to all incoming language.

 

**11 – And a simple question to close this. Some games that you recently played that you enjoyed? (New or old)**

 

Well, let’s see – I’ve mentioned Card Hunter and Eldritch. I’ve also been playing the Borderlands 2 DLC “Tiny Tina’s Assault on Dragon Keep”, The Novelist, The Stanley Parable, and Day Z. I recommend them all.

*That's all, I hope someone liked it. If enough people like it I can search some other old and interesting interviews I have.*"

But I never bothered responding because I wasn't comfortable sharing my transcript. My transcript is now *slightly* better than it was then but it's still atrocious, mostly because I wasn't even diagnosed until a year and a half ago.

A lot has happened to me within the past few months and I want to move away and start a new life. Late Friday afternoon, they called me, emailed me (again), and sent me a message on LinkedIn. They seem almost as interested in me as I am in them. To work for them would be the perfect reason to move away. So I figure that I might as well furnish my transcript. My expectations are low but my hopes are high.

My question is how I should submit the transcript. Should I explain what I've explained in this post and hope that they're understanding? Should I simply stress that my résumé is more indicative of my capabilities (which it definitely is)? Or should I not saying anything at all (unless asked)?

**TL;DR**: My dream employer wants to see my battle-scarred academic transcript but I'm not sure whether or not I should send an explanation with it."

I'm still trying to decide if medical school would be the right move for me and getting a feel for my prospects.

If I do choose to go, I'll have to do a post-bacc program. I'm much more disciplined in my habits since I attended college. I performed very well in a rigorous MPH program and I currently work as an epidemiologist.

**Year in school:** Out of school and in my mid/late-twenties. Currently employed as an epidemiologist

**Country/state of residence:** New England (keeping it vague for privacy...epi is a small world)

**Schools to which you are applying:** Unsure at this time. Considering Duke, UNC, Wake Forest, Vanderbilt, Tulane, Yale, Brown, UMass

**Cumulative GPA:** undergrad 3.3 (if I earn a 4.0 in a post-bacc program, I believe that would be added into this; I also made good grades in college courses in high school and study abroad that my undergrad institution did not count towards my GPA despite their being on my transcript [sigh]); MPH 3.7

**Science GPA:** I will need to complete post-bacc (my bachelor's is within the humanities) If I do a post-bacc, I'll have the time and dedication to earn a very high GPA. I wouldn't be leaving a solid, full-time salaried position for nothing :)

**MCAT Scores:** have not yet taken the MCAT. 

**Research:** 3 publications in public health (not first author); about to submit my MPH thesis for publication as first author. I intend to publish more as I continue in my work in epidemiology

**Volunteering (clinical)** – plan to accumulate ~100 hours over the next year at a local hospital (interview for volunteer opportunity is on the books)

**Physician shadowing** – planning to do about 20-40 hours over the next year or two, at least. I also work with physicians and nurses on a daily basis.

**Non-clinical volunteering:** ~500 hours in college at Red Cross, taught ESL, Habitat for Humanity

**Extracurricular activities:** in college, I was heavily involved in outdoor education and community service; currently  involved in recreational sports and community service events around my town, guitar, cycling.

**Employment history:** 7 years including internships in public health and research organizations, outdoor education, health care IT and informatics, and currently as an epidemiologist

**Immediate family members in medicine? (y/n):** No

 **Specialty of interest:** family medicine, pediatrics, infectious disease, possibly pathology; I am interested in continuing to emphasize epidemiology in my work 

**Shadowing experience:** planning to do at least 40 hours before I begin a post-bacc program

**Graduate degrees:** MPH w/ concentration in epidemiology from prestigious program

**Interest in rural health (y/n):** Possibly. I've lived in rural areas and would not be opposed to exploring the option.

**Other Skills:** Spanish fluency; computer programming

If you could play along with some of the assumptions I would be banking on (e.g. a solid if not excellent MCAT score) and please help me gauge my chances at a good medical school as a non-traditional student, I would greatly appreciate it. I believe my work experience in public health will give me a bit of an edge, although I don't want to overestimate it. Any advice you might have would be very helpful.

I've been programming since early highschool/ late middle school. Although I'm self taught I have skills in C#, JavaScript, HTML/Asp.net, CSS, Sql, and Java. I have had an internship before and my reference will confirm my skills. 
I started an internship under contract for a stipend for 5 weeks. I worked 30 hours a week and the pay per hour ended up being less than 7$ an hour. My company is a hardware startup at which I was the only real programmer. I wrote them an android app almost completely from scratch (another person on the team got some of the basic functions setup). It was a pretty complex one as well since it had to interface with their hardware via Bluetooth which also required some data manipulation based on strange physics properties that I hardly understand. Surprisingly, I got all the functionality and design done. My last week ended before I could hook them together and complete the app. 
Now they want to rehire me for a few more weeks this summer. I did all this 5 week high quality work for low pay as resume padding and for experience. They want to pay me 13$ an hour for 24 hours a week with 4 days of labor which includes one day of me working at home per week. I'm not sure if that's negotiable. I think I should get higher pay. Partially because I think I'm worth more. I also know coders in the area who get paid ~16$ an hour. It's in the city as well so gas costs 6-8$ a day to and fro (my parents drive me so they pay that bill). I love the area because there are a lot of startups in the building and that's what I aspire to do. At the same time, I could just sit at home and get a job on my campus or get a job somewhere else where the net income to our family would be better. I'm not sure exactly how this works with startups. Is there reason to believe I would get a raise in the near future? Future opportunities etc. 
TLDR: I like the area where I work. The work is kinda meh. I also believe I might be underpaid. Does it make sense to continue?
Edit. I'm sorry for the block of text but I'm on mobile
UPDATE: I tried negotiating but they can't go any higher than that so I'll be free for the rest of the summer and work on campus at the front desk of my dorm during the school year. It won't be high paying but it will be closer and more fun. Next summer I'll get another internship. "

I graduated from a university with bachelor of science in electrical engineering in December of 2015. I have been looking for jobs in the field, and, long story short, I came to realize that I don't really like what EE job market has to offer. 

Anyways, I had a privilege of talking to a family friend's dad who happens to be a network engineer a few days ago, and told me that I should consider it as a career option. And... it seemed really cool! I really liked that it's a constantly evolving field where I can always learn something new. I also liked that I can be more hands on to create something that works, rather than validate/test some silicon chip or hardware for rest of my life.

I have 1.5 year experience in operating and maintaining surveillance cameras and its network within my school campus.

I also have 9 month internship experience with a startup company that had a lot of electrical engineering aspects, but I also had the following IT-ish experience.

- Create FTP server of apt-mirror repository for Ubuntu OS.

- Scripts for facilitating tests and setup using python, bash, and Powershell

- Helped to deploy Maas (Machine as a service) for one of our 'server' boards.

- Exposure to AWS and VMware

- International business trip for a week to represent my company.

I also have some school courses related to ""network engineering"" such as Data Networks (layered networks, multiple access systems, and data link protocols.), computer architecture, computer interfacing... etc...

I am planning to spend the next 2-3 months studying the CCNA. Do you think it's realistic for me to expect a junior network engineer position after I get my CCNA certification? If not, then what kind of career path should I expect?

I am currently residing in San Francisco Bay area and my GPA is slightly below 3.0.

Thank you for reading my post. "

But this report is due by 5, you just don't have time for their shenanigans...",BlindGuardian117,BlindGuardian117,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlindGuardian117/comments/4sb7n4/wp_your_office_is_hunted_by_ghosts_who_constantly/,"**3:32PM**

I looked over the walls of my cubicle, but only saw the various hair colors of my office mates.  Good, hopefully the ghosts are distracted by the new intern.  I looked down at the dregs of my coffee and took one last sip.  No time to loose; I have a report to finish!

**3:49PM**

Shit, my lack of coffee was killing me.  I rubbed my eyes and sighed.  I really am coffee's bitch. I looked around the office again before standing up and making a beeline for the side door.  As I powerwalked down the hallway, I began to hear them.  Son of a *bitch*; they're in the break room.  I peeked around the corner.  The terrified intern was cowering in the corner of the room, completely *drenched* in white paint and sparkles.  That'd be a bitch to clean up.  The four ghosts giggled as they flew around him.  I looked at the bottom of my empty coffee cup and grimaced.  Confront the ghosts or finish this report without coffee?  I turned the corner...

Walked over to the coffee machine...

Picked up the pot...

The ghosts turned around with large smiles on their old faces.  They thought they had a new person to terrorize.  Their smiles faded when they saw me.  

I rocked the coffee pot, spinning the coffee in a circle.  I knew their weakness.  

As I poured myself a cup of coffee, the intern took advantage of the ghosts' distraction and ran out of the break room screaming.  

""Management isn't going to be happy.""  I put the coffee pot back and walked out.  

Grumpy, the leader of their ring, spit profanities at me as I walked back to my office.  He know that I had heard the ghosts' conversation the other day during the rain storm.  He knew that I wasn't afraid of them anymore.

My office mates were looking around the corner of our shared office.  Marrissa was examining the interns' footprints in the sterile white paint color that the building manager used to paint all of the walls in this bloody place.  

""Honestly, this place would be nicer if *all* of the walls were glittery,"" she said.

""Did you...did you start a war with...*them*?"" Becky whispered at me.

I didn't reply.  I went straight back to my desk, reached into my backpack and pulled out...the supersoaker 9000.  Only the best water gun in existence.  

Becky wasn't amused.  ""A water gun?""

I just nodded, laid it down on my desk and went back to my report.


**4:05PM**

*Clickity click click*

I had momentarily forgotten about our crazy friends until a spider landed on my desk.  I jumped backwards, momentarily freaked out.  Jester giggled as he sped away.  I picked up the heaviest book I had and slammed it down on the desk and cleaned up the remains with a tissue.  

The boss wants this report at 5PM and, ghosts be damned, I intend to give it to him.


**4:28PM**

A bone chilling scream came from right in front of me as an old lady flew through my computer screen.  She stopped, nose-to-nose with me.  I stuck my tongue out and went *pptttt*.  

She growled and disappeared back into the screen.


**4:38PM**

Send to Printer: Office_01

*Enter*

I looked around.  No ghosts.  Nonetheless, I grabbed my water gun and headed to the printer.  As I got there, the printer spun on and paper, and glitter, came pouring out.  Where the hell do these ghosts get glitter from??  I looked down at my shirt and brushed the glitter off watching as it piled up on the floor.  *It's like a unicorn is shitting all over the office*, I thought.

Suddenly, a cackling from behind me.  I spun around the fired the supersoaker 9000 blindly.  Bullseye!  Old Headless screeched and fell down, his normally weightless and translucent white body being becoming sticky and heavy.  

""Aggghhhh!!!"" He screeched again as he ran - yes *ran* - from the room, clenching his severed head.  I brushed the glitter off my paper and headed to my boss's office.  My officemates stared at me, mouths open and eyes wide.  

*So this is how it feels to be god*, I thought.

I knocked on the door, waited for the ""Come in"" and entered.  My boss sat behind his oversize mahogany desk, his hair slicked back with too much gel.  *Over compensating for something?* I thought to myself.

I put on a sweet, happy voice and handed him the report.  ""Here you go, sir.""

He grunted and took the report from me. 

**BBBBBBZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ**

I damn near jumped out of my skin. 

**BBBBBBZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ**

""The fire alarm?"" My boss roared as he ran around his desk.  

He yanked open the office door and stopped in his tracks as he was hit in the face with water.

**BBBBBBZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ**

""GET THOSE FUCKERS!""  

My officemates were tearing the place to pieces.  A fire burned on top of a desk, smoking profusely.  People with burning paper stood on chairs near the smoke alarms.  Marrissa threw a bucket of water on the Old Lady and the bucket landed on another co-workers head.  Becky dumped a bottle of red wine on Old Headless.  Her hair was no longer *good*.  Someone threw a whole fucking CRT screen at Grumpy, who became pinned underneath it.  Various office supplies flew through the air; one went straight out the window.  The over head sprinklers were drenching everything in sight.  

My boss turned to me, the person with the professional looking water gun, with Hell's fire burning in his eyes.  There was nothing to do but smile and walk away.

&gt; When programmers at the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory set out to develop the flight software for the Apollo 11 space program in the mid-1960s, the necessary technology did not exist.

&gt; They came up with a new way to store computer programs, called &amp;quot;Rope memory,&amp;quot; and created a special version of the assembly programming language.

&gt; The software has been available to the public for quite a while-it was first uploaded by tech researcher Ron Burkey in 2003, after he&amp;#039;d transcribed it from scanned images of the original hardcopies MIT had put online.

&gt; That was until last Thursday, when former NASA intern Chris Garry uploaded the software in its entirety to GitHub, the code-sharing site where millions of programmers hang out these days.

&gt; In the same file, there&amp;#039;s also code that appears to instruct an astronaut to &amp;quot;Crank the silly thing around.""

Girls always try to *milk* me and have them buy something, or get them discounts on the products, to which I respond with ""may be. what do I get on return?"" which leads to an easy lay within next hour or so, if not a sure number close.

But I have also had 3 girls who have tried to get in a realtionship with me, kinda just implying we are together because we made out (but no sex), and have do boyfriend shit for them or take them out on dates. (Don't worry, I hold my frame)

4sbr92,21,2016-07-11,How do you get a job with SA and a non-existent network?,hawlenc,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/4sbr92/how_do_you_get_a_job_with_sa_and_a_nonexistent/,"I'm 23, about 1.5 years out of college, majoring in Computer Science. The last ""job"" I held was a summer internship right before my final year. I haven't had any interviews since then (about 2.5 years).

I've been pretty anti-social for most of my life. I made a few ""close"" friends in high school, but haven't maintained contact with them and it's probably been at least 5 years since I last spoke to them. I made only one or two friends in college, but the closest we've ever gotten was just discussing about homework and related hobbies - we never did anything beyond that. Never went to parties or even drank a single beer. I never spoke up in class or went to my professor for extra help... so my professional network is pretty much non-existent.

There are plenty of jobs available in CS, but all I've been doing is applying on job board sites to a select few - jobs that I feel, as an entry-level programmer, would be able to do (usually requiring 0-2 years of experience).

Because my resume has a lot of ""buzzwords"", I get contacted by a fair number of recruiters by email and phone each week. A lot of their ""positions"" are either out of my comfort zone of experience, or too far away, and so I don't bother responding to them by email if that's the case. However, even if the job does fit what I'm looking for, I don't respond to them at all if it was by phone.

Basically, I'm missing a lot of opportunities because SA keeps me constantly worried about what they might ask during a phone (yuck!) screen or in an interview, and how I'd screw myself over by saying something that makes me look like an idiot.

I've also read that only about 15% of people find jobs through job boards and 70% do it through networking... but my SA has prevented from establishing a significant network.

At this rate, I'm still going to be jobless after 2 years, which will signal even worse red flags to employers than now.

How do you guys handle job seeking and networking?"

4sbyxh,205,2016-07-11,Is it wrong that I want to get my PhD just for the sake of getting my PhD?,quantum_mechanicAL,Physics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/4sbyxh/is_it_wrong_that_i_want_to_get_my_phd_just_for/,"So this is a rant as well as maybe looking for advice from others who are/have been in my situation.

 

I'm a 3rd year grad student studying theoretical physics. I joined the string theory group at my university because I was very interested in studying string theory and quantum gravity. Now, I've been told time and time again ""there are no jobs in string theory/quantum gravity"", ""there is no money there"", etc. etc. But i really don't care. Maybe I should care, but I don't. I came to get my PhD not because of some delusion that I was going to make loads of money when I graduate, but because I genuinely wanted to study physics at a deeper level.

 

Anyways, my adviser recently has switched his research focus towards quantum information, because there's funding there. Of course everyone who has ""warned"" me about studying ST/QG before rejoiced to hear this because there's so much opportunity to make money when I graduate!

 

I have an open mind, so I went with it... I've tried it out, I've done a summer internship where I made ridiculously good money (about $6k/month), and the people I work for have been trying really hard to get me to commit to finishing my PhD at their research site and take a job with them when I graduate.

 

I hate it though. This isn't what I want to do. I don't care how much money there is. Again, maybe I should care. Maybe someday I'll regret not taking the opportunity. But how I feel right now, I don't need to make a ton of money to be happy, so long as I have enough money to live my quiet little life, I'm happy.

  

The reason I wanted to do a PhD in physics was because I was genuinely interested in studying physics at a deeper level, because I enjoy it. But now I don't even get to enjoy that aspect of it because I feel as though I'm being forced to study something I have very little interest in.

  
There are some mathematical aspects that are of some interest in quantum information that I do find interesting, such as the study of topological quantum field theories and homotopy quantum field theories. But even these I feel as though I am being encouraged not to pursue because I will have an easier time finding a job if I stick to just pure computational work.
  

I am thinking of just asking for my masters and leaving. Maybe try to go teach some classes at local community colleges or something. I already have plans to go talk to the director of graduate studies in my department to see what she thinks. I really value her opinion. First I need to get my thoughts straight and figure out what I am going to say.

  

Am I being crazy? I know I'm being offered a pretty great deal as far as job prospects and making good money goes. Is it insane of me to resist so much?"

Korea. I just got fired and my last day is July 28th.

I graduated college late May and I was a double major in theatre, and women, gender, and sexuality studies. I lived in Wollongong and studied abroad at UOW  for five months last year. I also interned at a highly recognized non-profit.

I'm thinking of making the move and my old boss may help me find some non-profits that are hiring (because hers isn't). I would also consider theatre/performance arts jobs. I know the non-profit I'll be applying to has positions in Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane. I have friends in Sydney/Wollongong, so I would prefer that but I know cost of living is way more. I want to move to a hipster liberal young 20 neighborhood (lol I know Melbourne is very hipster but didn't feel very city-esque).

Anyways my question is: I know there is a holiday visa, but what kind of visa would I need to work for a non-profit or theatre? How expensive? Can I use the holiday visa for this? Or am I better off checking out NZ bc the visa to AU is a lot and I just graduated college and moved to SK and it isn't working out.

Can I just fly at the end of this month to Sydney? I'm pretty sure I don't need a visa prior to arrival. I get 30 days on arrival (that's how NZ works). I know if I can't find non-profit work, I could bartend and intern (or volunteer) at my old company or a new one. So if I do get a holiday visa, could I get it prior to arriving?

I've lived Down Under and I know Sydney is expensive, so I guess I could commute from the outer suburbs. I commuted from Wollongong to North Sydney once a week and it was a nightmare. My only concern is $$$.

I'm only familiar with the student visa. Am I better off taking a class or two at some uni (as a non-degree student) and going that route? Not sure if it works the same as the States..

Edit: Okay I forgot AU isn't like NZ. I need to apply for a visa prior to going. Could I enter with a one way ticket? If not, can I buy a cheap ticket to like NZ to ""leave"", etc?

I majored in Public Relations and minored in English Writing.

I started applying for jobs and internships a few months before graduation came around. Nothing came of it and so I kept applying to as many PR boutiques and marketing/advertising firms as I could find in my area. Very few got back to me. One of them brought me in for an interview but I guess they ended up choosing another candidate. It has been two months since I graduated and I have done no work at all related to my field. The only job I've had so far was a test scorer position I got through a temp agency. The entire time I was at the job I did nothing but search online for positions and emailing my resume and other materials to businesses and their recruiters. No luck at all.

I got fed up with waiting for emails and so I went downtown and visited with as many of these places as I could to introduce myself in person. Most of these places would not even let me get past the front desk, where the secretaries would do nothing for me other than say ""go online and look for jobs there"". I did manage to get some contact information for a few of these places' recruiters but they simply do not reply to my emails. At all. And I have sent more than one. One woman I talked to seemed very interested in me and my resume. She told me to email her within a week to give her time to look over my materials and she would let me know if I looked good for a spot on her team. I did so, twice, and nothing. I never heard from her again. Not even a ""I'm sorry but your qualifications do not meet our standards.""

I have gone though dozens and dozens of PR/Marketing/Advertising/Communications companies here in Downtown Minneapolis. I honestly feel like I have gone through them all. I am at a complete loss and I do not know what to do now.

I realize that these places I send emails to do not owe me a thing. They do not have to reply to me just to tell me that I do not meet their qualifications. I get that. But it still feels shitty to be stonewalled by damn near every single fucking company in the city. Especially the woman who I talked about earlier. She ASKED me to email her. I did and not one reply from her at all.

Now I'm doing nothing but sitting here waiting for the temp agencies I have signed up for to give me a call and offer me another spot doing menial work for some obscure company that has nothing to do with what I studied for. Of course I check LinkedIn and Indeed and Monster and even fucking Craigslist every single damn day hoping against hope that something pops up but 99% of the postings ask for people with either years and years of experience or want interns to work for free, to which I say fuck that, not out of pride but out or necessity.

I do not want to tell you guys a sob story and share my life with you all here but suffice to say that I need to start working somewhere steady ASAP. I was lucky enough to get through college with a full scholarship and I know this already puts me ahead of most graduates.... hell, most PEOPLE. But this does not change how I feel at the moment.

Is it because my resume, experience, and skills are not as good as I thought they were? I have worked for Medtronic, US Bancorp, U.S. Commodities, Volunteers of America, Mall of America corporate, and lots of other office jobs. Not too mention the 6+ summers I spent in the hell that is retail jobs. I'm bilingual. My GPA is good, not great but nothing to sneeze at either. I know Adobe, Microsoft Office, SEO, social media sites of all kinds, and many many computer programs. I get results and my resume, personal webpage, LinkedIn page, and references all attest to that. I got a full scholarship to a private university and those don't just get handed out willy nilly (is that how you spell that phrase?). I know my worth as an employee and a professional.

Or am I just striking out and having bad luck? I could wait until next year to apply for internships once more but, again, I cannot wait that long.

I need to work, for my finances, my sanity, my family, and my self confidence.

Thanks for reading."

I don't want anyone to tell me what's best, just what options may be available to me. 

I go to a large school, 3.4 total gpa going into my senior year. I did a summer leadership conference last summer (as a rising junior) with a fortune 100 firm but I did not do an internship this summer as I took (am taking) three classes. And I have a part time job. 

I took Tax 1, taking Tax 2 in fall, and Audit in spring. I'm at 94 hours after this summer and could/will graduate with my 120 hours after spring semester if I take 9 classes over fall &amp; spring. 

Things I'm unsure of:

1. At the upcoming fall career fair, will recruiters frown upon not having taken audit yet? I have no clue whether I want to go into tax or audit and realize that is a decision I'll have to make. 

2. I'm not exactly sure what I should try to be recruited for. At this point (going into senior year and no internship experience) do I shoot for an internship (if so, when? Spring? Next summer?) or for a full time position post undergrad?

3. My university has a Macc program that I'm not sure if I should go for. Ignore loan/$ issue. I realize that many firms will (may?) pay for schooling towards getting my cpa (or do they just pay for the test?)

4. If I worked towards the Macc program and the 150 hours required for the cpa exam, what does that do to my timeline?

I'm not sure when to take the 5th year (30 hours), whether to try and intern this summer and then start class again or if that's not even a thing as many internships lead to full time positions?


I know I'm all over the place, but I'm just looking for some time-related guidance. Did I mess up by not getting an internship this summer? 

Thanks

I'm about to be a senior in college in a STEM field. Right now, I'm working as an intern at a really great company, good pay, laid-back culture. My family is a little tight on money, but we get by just fine. I get paid well at my job. 


Last year, when I was a Junior, I was seeing a guy, let’s call him Mark. We met in my Sophomore year, and had a lot of tension between us, but both of us had SOs. After a year of flirting, crossing some lines, me breaking up with my boyfriend, getting another boyfriend, breaking up with him too, Mark and I got together. He was a graduating senior, and lives in a different state than I do. So we were just FWB, and he made it fairly clear that we would have to part ways when he left. I convinced myself that I would be ok with that—he would be a bad boyfriend anyways, he cheated on his girlfriend at the time with me. 


But I was crazy about this guy. I put the thought of him leaving out of my mind. Then summer came quicker than I expected, and he moved back home. So did I; I started my internship the next week.

Now, I still go to visit him and his friends every other weekend or so. They’re all amazing, I love spending time with them and I seem to fit in really well. I like to go visit them not just to see Mark, but because I don’t have many friends in the city where I work. Most of my friends from the area have moved away, so when I don’t spend the weekend at Mark’s, I’m just sitting at my dad’s house all weekend doing nothing.


So, here’s my problem. I’m desperately in love with Mark. I don’t want anything more than to be with him. His friends and family (who I’ve met and they really like me) all are under the impression that I’m his girlfriend. But really I’m just like a long distance FWB. Mark says he can’t be with me because we’re too far apart and it just wouldn’t work. He says he doesn’t want to be responsible for someone else’s happiness. I was under the impression that he was struggling with depression and wanted to try to be happy with himself before he was with someone else, but in a conversation we had today, he said he’s pretty happy most of the time. That hit me really hard, and made me think that he’s just trying to spare my feelings, and the real reason he doesn’t want to be with me is because he just doesn’t like me that much.


I feel awful every day, I’m crying all the time. Some days I feel a bit better, and I think that I don’t need him and I’ll find someone else. And I know I will, I’m only 20. 


I guess what I need is reassurance. I frequent this sub a lot, so I know what the advice will probably be. I should go to therapy, I should cut Mark out of my life so I can heal. I’ll be ok, I’ll find someone else, I’m so young. But it’s really hard for me to stop talking to him, I feel like I want to spend as much time as I can with him before I start my senior year and I really won’t ever see him again. It’s just so hard to feel like I’m giving him so much, opening my heart up to him, and he can’t or won’t do the same. 


Please help me do something about this, I’m really scared that I’m slipping into some heavy depression.


TL;DR I’m in love with a guy who can’t/won’t be with me. It’s making me miserable. How do I cope?"

Sorry for the hiatus, long weekend. And recalling these events has been both easier and harder than I had thought. So please, bear with me.


The strange event where I seemed to go from crossing my bedroom to crossing the backyard was not isolated to that first night. For the next three nights the pattern continued: as the sun went down my anxiety and restlessness would increase, culminating in a sudden fugue where I would go from my bedroom or pacing my hall or making hot chocolate, to suddenly standing or walking across my back yard. To me the events seemed instantaneous, but it turns out each event had me missing a significant chunk of time. 


Twenty minutes disappeared that first night. The next night, eleven minutes had. Then fourteen, then nine. 


You might wonder why I didn’t leave the house or call the doctor about these occurrences. The truth of the matter is, I don’t know why I didn’t. The doctor never occurred to me. I wondered if I was going crazy, of course, or if there was some medical issue wrong with my brain, but the actual connection from ‘something might be wrong with my health’ to ‘call a doctor’ simply refused to form in my conscious mind. 


The same with leaving the house. In the light of day, the house was fine. I actually quite liked it, and it was astonishingly easy to- if not ‘forget’ these events were occurring, to at least forget their oddity, if that makes sense. 


Simply put, during nights in this house I was not myself. There is no other way to describe it. During the light of day they were as distant to me as if they were happening to someone across the country, or on another planet. 


After three or four nights, however, exhaustion won out, and I realized I had to at least talk to someone about this. Carla wouldn’t be back for two more days, and this wasn’t exactly something that chatting about over long distance lines would do justice. 


I had no family to speak of at the time, other than the dogs. No friends other than a few scattered back in California and I strongly suspected any of them would seek to have me committed if I started talking about my strange nocturnal wanderings.


That fourth day I managed to leave the house, finding a diner in town. I was doodling on a napkin while waiting for my food. Just circles and smiley faces and cartoon dogs- or so I thought before a voice asked me if I was an artist.


A man was seated on the stool beside me. I hadn’t noticed him sit down. For all I knew, he’d been sitting there since I came in. He appeared to be my age, in a button shirt but no tie, and wearing jeans. He looked at me with kind interest which spoke volumes about him, because I was certain I was quite a sight by then- rumpled clothes, barely brushed hair, raccoon eyes from lack of sleep. 


Thinking he was teasing me because of my smiley faces I gave a fake chuckle and played along. “Yeah, I’ll be the next Van Gogh with my doodles.”


He gave me an odd look, but smiled. “You might be,” he said. “That’s very good. That’s Sutton House, isn’t it?”


I looked down at my napkin and stared. For a moment, I could see those cute cartoon dogs and pointless smileys I had been sketching. Then I blinked and they were gone. Covering almost all my napkin was an astonishingly lifelike drawing of that house in the woods- oak tree and all.


I stared at it, feeling as if I was floating away in my own head. I must have repeated the name because he nodded and tapped the picture. 


“Yeah, Sutton House. In the woods off 41st. I used to throw rocks at the windows down there when I was a kid.”


The last thing I wanted this stranger to know was that I was apparently going mad- though the worse secret seemed to be that I was aware of it just then and yet apathetic toward it. “Yeah, that’s it,” I said. “Sorry, I’m a little distracted.”


“It’s all right,” he said, and introduced himself as Travis. 


“Mary,” I said in return. Clinging to the social graces seemed to help ground me a little.


“So you’ve been to Sutton House?” he asked. “Creepy place.”


“Yes,” I told him. “I live just up the path.”


Then he said, “Oh, you bought the daughter’s house?” and I just froze.


“Daughter’s house?”


“Yeah, Sutton’s daughter? Her husband built that house for her, and they moved there after they got married. Before she went insane and disappeared, anyway.”


As he said that, suddenly my mind cleared and everything that was going on came into focus. For the first time since that first black-out, I was suddenly very aware that something seriously wrong was happening to me. With that awareness came fear. It must have shown on my face because he suddenly looked concerned.


“Are you ok?”


“I thought all his children died,” I heard myself say. “Smallpox…?”


“Not the way I heard it,” he said. “All the younger kids did, but his eldest daughter had already married and moved out when they got sick.”


Sutton’s daughter had lived in my house. That was all I could think of. Sutton’s daughter had lived in *my* house…and she’d gone insane. 


I didn’t want to be there in that diner any more. I suddenly wanted…no, needed…answers. For the first time in days my mind was clear. The only place I could think of that might have them was the town’s small library.


I made my excuses- I don’t even remember what they were- and tried not to run as I left the diner. The library was just across the street, and for the next four or five hours I devoured everything I could find on Sutton House.


Here’s a quick rundown of what I discovered:


Sutton House was built by Heinrich Sutton shortly after he and his wife had immigrated through Ellis Island over a hundred years ago. It started as a small cabin, but they expanded on it as their family grew. They immigrated with eight children- in the end, they had fifteen.


The youngest of the fifteen was only a few months old when Mrs. Sutton caught pneumonia. She died ten miles away in the new hospital two weeks later. A few days after that, the newborn also died- this time, the culprit was smallpox.


The disease swept through the family and soon every child still at the house was sickened. They were quarantined and that was when Heinrich started to claim he heard voices telling him how to build his house, so that his children would not leave him.


His eldest daughter was no longer at the house when her mother died- she had married at age fifteen. Her husband had built her a house near her parents’ place. That was the house I lived in now, or the beginning of it. The girl was close with her family and her father’s madness frightened her. She was prevented from going to help him and her siblings by the quarantine and by her father’s increasing violence and ravings.


Shortly after the last child in the house died from the smallpox, Heinrich hung himself on the big oak tree out front. At some indeterminable point anywhere from a few months to a few years later, the eldest girl reportedly left town and her husband and went back to live with an aunt in Germany.


As I was trying to find out more about this eldest girl, the librarian directed me to a book she warned me not to take seriously. It was one of those books about the paranormal and urban legends, and it mentioned Sutton House and some of its history. Then it went on to talk about the older daughter. What it said I normally would not have considered as real, if it weren’t for what was happening to me. It seemed like one of those usual urban legends that just kind of grow up over time and become part of a town’s lore, but really have no basis in fact.


According to this book, after Heinrich hung himself and the house lay abandoned, the husband told his friends that his wife was starting to bother him. He told them that he would wake up repeatedly in the night to find she had left the house to go to her father’s abandoned one. Many times, he had to go after her to bring her home and each time, she was standing in front of the house, staring at it. She would give no explanation and despite his demands she stop doing so, her nightly excursions continued.


Then, the daughter disappeared. It was the husband’s claim that she went back to an aunt in Germany but persistent rumor said that the husband had actually locked her in her father’s old abandoned house, keeping her there as a prisoner for many years, before murdering her and boarding up her body in a closet. 


It was the daughter- whose name was Maria- who had worn the path between the houses with her night-time journeys. It was Maria who followed some impulse to go out night after night to visit the house where her family had died. 


But it was *me* who kept ‘waking up’ to find myself standing in the backyard, or walking toward that path in the middle of the night. And it was me who was scared to death.


Carla was back two days later, and of course she had to come see me in my new house before she even went home herself. She took one look at me and assumed something horrible had happened to one of the dogs. I suppose I looked like shit. I certainly felt like it.


I told her that Joe was asleep under the dining room table and refused to budge, and that Nell was barking at the old stone wall in the back of my house as she’d been doing pretty much non-stop for two days now- ever since I’d come home from the library.


I’d come home meaning to get the dogs and take them to a motel- I had not wanted to spend another night in that damn house. But Joe absolutely refused to move and he was much too big for me to drag or carry. Nell had started barking at that wall and all but screamed as if I were skinning her alive each time I tried to draw her away from it. By the time I realized it was useless trying to get the dogs out of there, I was sunk in that apathetic, anxious fog yet again. 


Trapped.


Part of me was shocked that the neighbors hadn’t called the cops on Nell’s non-stop barking, but none of them had so much as looked over my fence to see what the noise was about. I was starting to wonder if they even heard it.


I took Carla into the kitchen, made her a cup of coffee, and told her the whole damn story. I didn’t even care if she believed me or not. I had to sick it up, like it was a poison that was stuck inside me. Maybe it was the only way I could think of to ask for help getting me out of the trap I’d found myself in. A lot was hazy in those days and it was hard to think.


Carla did end up helping me get out of the trap, but not the way I or even she intended.


Nell barked through the whole story, which Carla listened to with shock. When I finished she asked just how long it was that I had gone without sleep, and if I had gone to a doctor about my sleepwalking.


When I reminded her what had happened with Sutton’s daughter she interrupted me by suggesting I was just under too much stress with the move, and that the dogs could sense it and that’s why they were acting weird.


It was too much. This was the only shot I had at getting out of this trap I couldn’t seem to save myself from and Carla didn’t believe me. I couldn’t blame her, but she was my only hope and I could see that salvation flitting away from me. 


I’m ashamed to admit it, but I started to cry. That seemed to alarm her a little bit, and after she calmed me down a little she said, “Ok, so let’s go see it then.”


“See what?” I asked. 


“See the house, Sutton’s place,” she said. “Honey, that house is creeping you out so much you aren’t sleeping. You’re spooked silly. We’re going to go down to that house and I’m going to show you it’s nothing more than a big empty ruin, ok?”


That was the last thing I wanted to do, but at the same time it was all I wanted to do. It was as if there was a low current between that house and me and when she said she wanted to go see it, that current was switched up to maddening levels, pulling everything about me in that direction.   When she stood up to go I all but sprang up from my chair to follow her.


Nell’s voice sounded hoarse when we got into the back yard. The dish of food and water I’d set out for was untouched. 


Every time I’d tried to draw her away she’d freaked out and started screaming, but the moment Carla approached her Nell abruptly stopped barking as if a wire had been cut. She whipped around and looked at us as if she’d never seen us before, then bolted into the house. Feeling separated from my own body, I carefully shut and latched the door behind her.


I did feel better as we headed through the gap and down the path. My mind felt like it was clearing again, the trap of apathy around me starting to melt away. The further we went the better I felt, but when we reached the clearing and caught sight of the house again, all that snuffed out and vanished. Terror filled me and I grabbed Carla’s hand and begged her to go back.


But once Carla got it in her head to do something she did it- she was as stubborn as an old mule. And she was determined to show me that Sutton House was just an old ruin and there wasn’t anything to fear about it. 


She had a grip on my hand and tried to pull me across the clearing but I was in such a state of terror I refused to move. It felt like a hundred eyes were watching me, like the sky was pressing down, like unseen monsters were surrounding me. I was in the grip of a full-on panic attack and I could neither help it nor stop it. I had never before been so afraid in my life.


Carla clearly couldn’t feel it herself- she was trying to be firm but gentle, and I could see the exasperation and concern growing on her face. Finally, probably in worry that she was going to cause me harm, she stopped trying to pull me into the clearing.


“It’s ok, you stay here then,” she said. “But I’m going to show you there’s nothing to be afraid of.”


The boarded up windows seemed to gape blindly at us, as if the house itself were seeing us somehow. Carla started across the clearing and I wasn’t able to hold myself upright. I fell down to my knees. I can still feel the faint damp of the grass soaking into the knees of my jeans.


She kept repeating that there was nothing to be afraid of, while at the same time the very air around me seemed lit with unseen hostility and violence and oppressiveness so thick I could hardly breathe- but she remained unaffected.


She was about two thirds of the way across the clearing when she looked over her shoulder at me that last time and insisted that ‘there’s nothing to be scared of! It’s going to be all right-“


And that was it. She was gone.


 Just as quick as a light switching off, right in the middle of the wide open grass and still forty feet from the house, she vanished. 
I ran back home.


The apathy had cleared away enough that once I reached home I had enough presence of mind left to know I had to do something. My first impulse was to call the police, but I also knew that would be a bad idea. What were the police going to do? The moment I started talking about this and told them my best friend had literally disappeared in front of my eyes, they’d be committing me. That would help neither me nor Carla.


Joe was still asleep and Nell had stopped barking, and I knew if I stayed in the house that mind fog would come back. I needed to stay as clear as I could. I was still terrified but the blind panic had gone away. Doing little more than making sure the dogs couldn’t get out of the house I went out again and got into my car. 


At first I just drove into town, trying to get distance between me and the house. I went to the library because that was the only place so far that had given any answers. It wasn’t really answers I needed now, but help.


Sitting in my locked car outside the library I forced myself to think.


I couldn’t call the cops. I needed to find someone that would believe me and have the resources needed to find Carla and get her back safely- if Carla could still be found. 


Hmm. Someone who would not only believe me but be able to act. Where was I going to find this mythological rainbow unicorn of a person?


I broke down again then, at least for a moment, before I suddenly remembered.


For a brief period during the end of High School I had a friend who had been big into those paranormal ‘ghost hunting’ shows. I knew those shows were probably bunk but…weren’t their people who seriously studied this kind of thing? 


Massachusetts had more than one acclaimed university, surely one of them had a professor or something that was at least open minded about this sort of thing. They may not be able to help me, but they might be able to put me in touch with someone who could.


I went into the library to look up contact info and ended up calling easily a dozen departments at three or four universities. I gave them a roundabout story, pretending to be a journalism student doing research so that no one would actually hang up on me. Finally, I was given a name and a number to call to get a hold of a ‘group who does that sort of thing as a semi-serious hobby.’


I won’t tell you which university this group called ‘home’- suffice it to say that just about everyone would know the name if they heard it. I’m changing the names of everyone involved in this- I don’t want the ones that are left harassed any more than I want to be harassed myself.


The man I finally got hold of, I’ll call ‘Jacob’. Jacob had been at the University for six years but not as a student. He was the unofficial spokesperson of what were affectionately called the ‘University Alum Weirdos’.  There was an official name of course but I won’t share that here- it’d be too easy to look up.


They dealt with things that more conventional psychologists and scientists wouldn’t touch, such as psychic phenomenon, out of body experiences, reincarnation, near death experiences, thoughtgraphy, and various unexplained happenings. 


He told me all this later of course, not on that first call. I was still a bit too distracted on that call with my own ‘unexplained happening’.


He didn’t make fun of me when I told him Carla vanished right in front of me. He took it very seriously, but was sure to ask if there was any natural reason it could have happened- a sinkhole, for example. I told him there was no sinkhole. I was frantic at the time but even I couldn’t have missed a sinkhole appearing large enough to swallow a human being. Besides, Carla had just vanished- she hadn’t dropped downward.


He told me that it wasn’t the first time something like that had happened. He told me about a man in Gallatin Tennessee who had vanished in front of five witnesses, in broad day light. Just poof!


I told him a bit more about what was going on and he said that he would talk to his department head and arrange a trip down to see me and Sutton House. This nearly threw me into hysterics again. 

Carla was missing and I couldn’t go back to that house, not if I wanted to maintain a clear mind. To me, his words meant it could be days or even weeks before they would arrive. By then I’d be mad or dead myself, I had no doubt.


I told him this and refused to hang up until he could assure me when they would be there. He put me on hold for quite a while, but when he got back on he was able to reassure me they could be there by morning of the next day. 


One more night in the house. I couldn’t leave the dogs alone and locked up all night, after all. If I tried to get them out to go to a hotel I had no doubt they’d resist me again, and no doubt the apathy would take hold again if I just spent a few minutes there trying. If I left them there alone anything might happen to them. 

If I went back…anything might happen to *me.* 


Just talking to Jacob made me feel better, however. Someone was coming. Maybe I could get the dogs out, but if I couldn’t, I could down enough coffee to make even a sloth run laps.


You may be thinking I was nuts to go back, that you wouldn’t have done the same, and who cares what happened to the dogs? The thing is, the dogs were all I had, and I was responsible for them. More, I can’t describe to you what having that numbing apathy felt like- nor can I describe to you what the lack of it felt like. I will try, however.


When I was in the house it was as if a wet towel were wrapped around my thoughts. I couldn’t think, I couldn’t care, I couldn’t concentrate. I felt like an observer going through certain actions- controlling them from a distance or separated from them completely. 


When I was away, outside the house, my mind cleared up and I realized that what was going on at the house was in no way normal or healthy, but at the same time it kind of got- smaller. Like remembering a nightmare you had a week ago in the middle of a bright and clear day. I kept thinking ‘ok, what happened is strange but it couldn’t have been that strange, I’m just tired is what it is, it’s not that bad. I’m making a mountain out of a molehill’ and a lot of stuff like that. I knew I needed help but I also overinflated my ability to handle things on my own for ‘just a bit longer’. 


So I went back to the house with a game plan in mind. I’d lock all the doors, make myself enough coffee to kill a grown man, turn the TV up full volume and just stay focused on something until the next morning when help would arrive.


Looking back I can see how stupid going back was and how it could have gone very wrong. The dogs would have been fine for a night- at most I would have come home to some accidents on the rug. 


I’m very lucky that things didn’t go wrong that night. Almost as soon as I got back that apathy and restless anxiety started in again. I made my coffee and went through my routine and paced the house, listening to the TV blaring as I tried to drown out my own disconcertion. I kept telling myself help was coming but I no longer really cared if it was. I knew Carla was missing but it seemed unimportant. 


Nell whined and paced with me but didn’t bother scratching the door, which was good. And I didn’t have a moment where I blacked out and found myself in the yard, which was better. Maybe taking Carla had satisfied…whatever this was…for the time being?


Dawn finally came and just after nine am, so did help.


They came in a beaten up old van with squeaky hinges. I came out on the front porch to meet them. It was freezing outside but I barely felt it.


The first one out was a lanky man with an easy smile who introduced himself as Jacob, the one I’d talked to on the phone. Besides Jacob there were three others- two he introduced as Dan and Lucy and described as departmental interns. The third he introduced as Candace. 


Candace, I was told, was a psychic who occasionally worked with the police department on violent crimes. She certainly didn’t look to me like I pictured a psychic would; instead, she looked like someone who should be *in* prison instead of helping to put people there. She was thickly patterned with tattoos, and what hair she had was bright green.


She was wearing a windbreaker. After Jacob introduced us Dan asked Candace if she felt anything.


She gave him a look that reminded me of a look my mother used to get when I’d done something adorable but incredibly stupid, and said ‘Yes. I feel cold.’


I invited them in. Nell was out back barking again. Hearing her, I suddenly remembered I had let her out before coming to the front door. I went to make coffee and Candace asked if she could just wander about the house a moment. 


The others followed me into the kitchen. Lucy asked if the barking was my dog. I told her yes, that was Nell and she was probably barking at the wall. I told them the last time she’d done it she’d gone two days straight.


They went to the back door and looked out the window next to it. Jacob asked if the dog had been standing in the same place the last time. I said yes. Dan and Lucy asked if they could go and take some pictures outside in the back, and I said yes to that too. Every time they asked me something I just said yes- I didn’t care what they did or what they said.


I gave Jacob some coffee and I’m pretty sure he asked me more questions. I was aware of little but how he was looking more and more concerned every time I answered. He told me later I just kept answering in monotone, and looked like I hadn’t slept in years. 


Then Candace came back in and suggested we go and talk in the back yard. Despite the cold we went. Dan and Lucy were still wandering about taking pictures and we sat down out there. Candace said she wanted to talk but for the first twenty minutes or so all we did was chat about unimportant things like the weather and how I liked town, while we watched the dog bark and the photos being shot. 


As I write this, I’ve just realized what Candace was doing. The longer I was outside the house the better and clearer I felt. I think she knew this, and I think she took me outside and gave me time to clear my head a bit before she said anything important. 


I didn’t put that together before now; back then I was just grateful help was there and that the cold air was making it easier to stay awake and focus.


She started the serious talk rather abruptly. We’d been quiet a moment, watching the dog, when she suddenly turned to me and said ‘there are two spirits in your house. A man and a woman. Both are pretty weak, but one is really restless. I think that’s the female spirit. The man is frustrated and angry. I think he was abusive in life.”


Before I could say anything Jacob pulled out some folders from a small leather satchel he was carrying and nodded. “I think that’s Maria Sutton and her husband. It’d fit in with the research I pulled about them.”


“Maria’s the one that wore the path,” I said. “She kept visiting the house at night, and it made her husband angry.”


Candace looked at me just then, and it was the kind of look that feels like it goes right through your skin and xrays your brain. 


“Mary, I think what you’re feeling is Maria’s restlessness and her desire to go to that house. Jacob says you told him you pace at night? You feel restless, and occasionally you have episodes of missing time and find yourself out in the back, heading toward that path?”


I nodded, feeling sick. “I want it to stop, I told her. If Maria wants to go to that house so badly she can go, but I want her to leave me out of it.”


Candace told me that Maria’s spirit and that of her husband were both pretty weak. I suppose she said that to make me feel better but it only made me feel worse. If they were weak but still able to affect me as horribly as they were doing so, what would a strong spirit do to me?


“Ok. Let’s see if we can figure out what the dog is barking at,” she said. We headed toward Nell. Like before, as soon as we got close she stopped barking. Instead of bolting into the house again this time, instead she ran toward the rock wall and began digging at it again, like she had the first time. Jacob told Dan to take some pictures of the wall where Nell was digging- he had something that Jacob called a Kirlian camera, and he specifically wanted pictures taken with that one. As he took shots, Candace went over and put her hands on the wall and closed her eyes. 


“He threw her here,” she said after a moment. “He was tired of her going out at night and having to fetch her back. That last time he caught her before she got through the gate. He threw her against this wall and beat her. She was afraid he was going to kill her.”


“Did he?” Jacob asked.


“Not here,” Candace said. “I can just feel the beating here. She dropped something.”


She touched her neck, the motion like an old lady seeking to touch a cross or something on a chain around her neck. Then she crouched down and fished in the cracks of the stone wall near where Nell was digging. She peeled some moss aside and after a moment, she pulled out an old chain. On the end was a little pentagram.


I knew what a pentagram was, and to me it meant something Satanic, something always used in those demon movies. I said as much, and Candace shook her head. 


“It’s actually an old symbol of protection. Maria probably wore it for comfort. I sense many owners- likely it was handed down through her family. It’s been blessed a couple of times.”


She handed it to me. At first I didn’t want to take it- it was grimy and no matter what they said, to me pentagrams meant evil. The moment it was in my hand, however, I felt…better. Clear minded again, almost relieved. 


Then Dan asked when they could go down and see the house in the clearing, and my relief disappeared again.


“I’m not going,” I told them. “You all can go but I’m staying here.”


There wasn’t a protest. Jacob and Candace seemed to understand and sympathize, and Dan didn’t seem to care who went as long as he got to go.


Just at that moment, Nell suddenly whirled around and ran into the house, as if something in the woods had suddenly startled her or frightened her. The reaction was so pronounced that Dan and Lucy immediately took shots of the trees and the gap in the wall. 
I felt cold again, afraid…but this time the fear was behind me, in the house with the two dogs. The idea of staying there alone suddenly scared me much more than the path and Sutton House did. 


I decided I was going along after all. 


Dan and Lucy lead the way, with Jacob and Candace dawdling along beside me. Being on the path again made me feel better, like it had before, but I still was not eager to be near Sutton House again. I just hoped they’d be able to find where Carla went, or that something would happen to prove that I wasn’t crazy- that something supernatural really was going on.


I was both hopeful and terrified that once we reached the house something would happen. I never considered that something would happen before we were even in sight of it.

4sdbvi,216,2016-07-11,Shame is Good (Embrace It &amp; Become More),Ronin11A,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4sdbvi/shame_is_good_embrace_it_become_more/,"**Summary:** Some of you think you are delicate fucking snowflake **Tone Police** and need to unfuck yourselves.

This is The Red Pill. TRP is an overarching strategy which seeks to correct decades of false information surrounding the sexual dynamics of men and women. TRP is about maximizing each man's sexual achievement. Regardless of whether your objective is to spin plates, find a high quality LTR, or embrace your masochistic tendencies and get married (though we don't recommend it), TRP offers tactics to help you achieve your goals with women. Game techniques like Amused Mastery, improving SMV through strength and conditioning, establishing outcome independence with a high quality life, and so forth are all means to a specific end: sexual interaction with women on your terms.

We don't want to be nicer to you. We don't want to ""spread the message"" and help the men of the world. Why? Because you haven't done anything to deserve it, and those men are not yet ready to be unplugged. **When students are ready, the masters appear.** Until, they are card-carrying members of the Blue Pill Party, and will neither understand nor accept the strategy we have embraced.

**We don't care** if you feel we're ""setting the bar a bit high.""

**We don't care** if calling you a pussy makes you want to quit and leave.

**We don't care** if Endorsed Contributers, and the status they hold within the community, makes you feel unwelcome, inferior, or intimidated.

You want respect? Then log-in, shut the fuck up, read the sidebar, and learn. You're not entitled to a voice or an opinion just because you have testicles here. **You're not entitled to respect here just because you're ""trying to improve"" yourself.** You don't get flair just for being here. This is not Planet Fatness. This is not a ""No Judgement Zone"". 

**Respect is fucking earned, not given, here.**

&gt; Can you agree we shouldn't shame men who are trying to improve themselves? I'd really like to see you stop doing that. It doesn't help anyone and it hurts this community as a whole.

**Fuck you.**  Shame is good.  Shame works.  **Shame is was lights that fire, the one that burns deep inside you and hurts until you get off your ass and make something happen.**  How do I know this?  From real-world experience.

Ten years ago, I was at the Fort Benning School for Boys (also known as Sand Hill).  We did a timed five-mile run, and I bombed out a turd of a run time.  My senior drill sergeant pulled me into his office immediately following breakfast chow.  He ripped into me in a way only few men have experienced, as he was ashamed to see my name next to it listed under his name in his platoon.  He put me on full blast, shaming me for my pathetic performance.  He told me he knew I was an officer candidate, and he told me he would kill me before he allowed a sub-standard soldier to graduate from his platoon and go on to Officer Candidate School and become a sub-standard Army officer.  He expected me to meet a higher standard, and I had two choices: Meet the higher standard, or the kid gloves came off.  Three weeks later, we did another timed 5-miler, and I was almost 8 minutes faster.

Last week, I returned from a family wedding overseas.  My cousin, who is one year younger than I am, showed up in an Aston Martin Vantage V8.  It was not a rental.  At first, I felt jealous, bitter.  Then the hamster started to spin, and started telling myself I had better things to spend my money on than a sexy car.  Then, **I stopped lying to myself.** I remembered that my cousin took an unpaid internship in university, used that to network with a major international bank, and ended up living in Hong Kong for several years working his ass off before moving back home and buying the Aston.  I realized that envy and shame I felt was less the result of him having the nicer car and more the result of me having wasted wasted similar opportunities in the past.  He outshone me not because of some delicate special snowflakeness, but simply better fucking financial decisions.  Within 24 hours of getting back, I was back on the network grind to create opportunities instead of waiting for them like a chump, because, **""Oh well,"" is not a satisfactory answer.**

**Shame is useful, and will drive the strong man to do great things.**  Many great bodies were built after many tough breakups, because men take action when shit get's tough.  So get the fuck out of here with your Tone Police, ""better for the community"" bullshit. **What the fuck gives you the audacity to join a community of your own free will, a community that has helped thousands of men take back their lives from our bullshit feminist, participation trophy society, and then question the manner in which we deliver our fucking message?**

TRP is amoral and harsh, and it's on purpose.** TRP isn't tea, but shots of whiskey, sharp truths that burn on the way down. In order to break through the lies and social conditioning that cause you to believe in fucking unicorns and seek instant gratification and convenience over quality and purpose, aggressive, abrasive verbiage is required. **Discomfort is required.** There's a reason we don't police our tone. There's a reason we savage weakness, crush feelings, and don't hold your hand. 

TRP is an [intellectual shark attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_bL8rqqvbc) on the Nice Guy, Blue Pill beta conditioning that's been ingrained into your psyche by everything around you. We're not here to nurture you; we're here to snap you out of your apathy, violently if need be.

**If that bothers you, leave.**

**Conclusions:**

* The Red Pill does not give out participation trophies; simply being here is not enough.

* Shame is a powerful motivating tool, and if it makes you want to quit or crawl up into a ball, you should look long and hard in the mirror at yourself.

* Men are tribal by nature, and our tribe demands more."

4sdcvn,3,2016-07-11,Question regarding potential internship,slapthefrenchman,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4sdcvn/question_regarding_potential_internship/,"Quick question for you all. 

I just transferred from a CC to a 4-year school and I'm starting to put out some feelers regarding internships. As I'm searching I found out that my dad knows one of the hiring managers at a very large engineering firm, and mentioned to him that I'm looking for an internship for next summer. The friend said to go ahead and email him my resume. 

So my question is this: the company hasn't posted any info for next years internships yet. Should I include in the email/on my resume what kind of job I'm looking for? I'm most interested in structural, but I won't turn up my nose at pretty much anything; I guess I want to indicate my interest in structural without limiting my chances at other openings they may have. Also, should I include a cover letter?

I've never applied for a job through a connection like this so I'm not sure what the etiquette is. 

Thanks for the help!"

4sdn3g,349,2016-07-11,"Salad Dressing Ham, Part IX",ms_hyde_is_back,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/4sdn3g/salad_dressing_ham_part_ix/,"It’s Monday, FPS, and I just *know* ya’ll need a sugary snack to keep your glorious curves. Fortunately for you, Hyde is here with another Salad Dressing Ham tale, as promised. 

It’s been awhile since I saw her around, so when I spotted her waddling across the courtyard the other day I was simultaneously sad Jim and Co. still had to endure her, and happy that there was likely some FPS-worthy madness to tattle about in my future. I was correct.

Before I begin, I would like to inform you all that Tito, though thoroughly traumatized, is ok. He reported the incident to his superiors, who contacted hers. He does not know what will be/has been done, but she has not accosted him since. Tito thanked me profusely for my “divine timing and intervention” (that’s me, an angel whose battery-operated halo is held up by her horns). He gave me a cringeworthy story tidbit about SDH that I gotta share with ya’ll.

Tito has a great many tattoos. One of them looks like a lipstick kiss, and it is on his hand – one lip on his thumb, and one lip on his pointer finger, so if he made his hand [“talk”](http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/8/89/Make-Hand-Puppet-Marker-Step-4.jpg/500px-Make-Hand-Puppet-Marker-Step-4.jpg) the lips would be the mouth. It’s a very realistic tattoo, and looks like someone really did just plant a lipstick kiss on his hand. Apparently, SDH saw the tattoo and asked if Tito masturbated with that hand, and offered to leave real lipstick on top of the tattoo so he could imagine her lips around him when he did. She also said something along the lines of it being even hotter because the lipstick smear would look like he’d just gotten a real blowjob. Tito looked pale just recounting this story. 

As you know, SDH has been banned from the downstairs café for a long list of offences. This, apparently, has not prevented her from harassing folks who sit in the courtyard lunch area, asking them if they will buy her pastries, coffee, or sandwiches. I was getting our Awesome Temp a congratulatory coffee (we just hired her, oh happy day!) and, as I walked out, I heard a yell.

&gt;HEY.

*Don’t look, don’t look, don’t look.*

&gt;I SAID HEY. YOU. WITH THE COFFEE.

I kept walking, remembering the last time I bothered to stop at the whale crossing. Her blurry reflection in the window showed that she was waddling after me. I picked up the pace. However, a gentleman piped up and made me pause. [Please note that this interaction transpired *very* quickly – it was a matter of two minutes and I literally *could not* figure out what to do, and didn’t have a chance to speak at all.]

&gt;Miss? I think she’s talking to you.

&gt;HEY, STOP.

The pause was just enough for SDH to catch up. She was gasping.

*Curses.*

&gt;DIDN’T YOU HEAR ME CALLING YOU? WHAT DID YOU GET?

I smiled tightly at the gentleman, who seemed a little confused. SDH started talking loudly and quickly.

&gt;IS THAT A CARAMEL FRAPPY? 

Yeah, she said frappy.

&gt;I LOVE CARAMEL FRAPPYS. ARE YOU GOING TO DRINK THAT WHOLE THING BECAUSE I’M REALLY CRAVING ONE. ACTUALLY, YOU SHOULD JUST GIVE ME THAT ONE, IT’S MELTING AND YOU DON’T WANT TO DRINK MELTED FRAPPYS. 

SDH *reached for the drink*. I, knee-jerk reacting the same way I would with a toddler, held it up out of reach. SDH jiggled and tried to “jump” for it, yelling angrily.

&gt;HEY! WHAT ARE – 

&gt;What the heck are you *doing*, lady?

SDH spun around, almost toppling over. SecurityDude stood there, arms crossed, looking incredibly annoyed. 

&gt;SHE STOLE MY CARAMEL FRAPPY.

*Bitch, what?*

&gt;You’re banned from the café. How did you get the drink?

&gt;SOMEONE BOUGHT IT FOR ME.

&gt;So you’ve been bothering people for food and drinks again? 

*Again. Heh.*

&gt;NO! SOMEONE OFFERED BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTOOD MY CONDITIONS.

SecurityDude raised a bored eyebrow at me. I flashed my receipt. 

&gt;Nobody bought you a drink, SDH. You are banned from the café, and we’ve already discussed that you are not to solicit other customers. If you persist in this ridiculous behavior we are going to have to contact your employer again.

&gt;GO RIGHT AHEAD, I’M NOT AFRAID OF YOU. YOU PIECE OF SHIT RENT A COPS ARE A BUNCH OF FAT-SHAMERS AND SEXIST BASTARDS. I AM *SO* GOING TO PRESS CHARGES FOR THIS DISCRIMINATION, JUST YOU WAIT. I. HAVE. *HAD IT!*

With this declaration, SDH stomped away. 

The gentleman who had stopped me picked his jaw up from the tabletop, glanced at me guiltily, and mumbled, “I am *so* sorry…”

I delivered the coffee, sat down at my desk, and shot off an email to Jim, detailing what had just transpired.

Forty-five minutes later, this appeared in my inbox. (Posted with Jim’s permission.)

&gt;Jim: *She [SDH] just came back from her lunch break. Shes been gone for almost 2 hours. She is at her desk sitting over a mounten of trash and she brought back mcdonalds. So far like 5 burgers and one of those really big boxes of chicken nuggets and is dipping everything in ranch. Vijay [coworker] had to go in to have her sign a doc and he told my cubicle mate that she is muttering between bites and making sex noises. Vijay is really conservatave and it made him very uncomfrotable. She is watching true blood on her computer.*

&gt;Hyde: *I enjoy burgers too, but I don’t think anything Mickey D’s makes can make me THAT “excited”. Yuck.*

&gt;Jim: *Theres a new intern today. Patricia [coworker] said she [SDH] spent all morning at his dsek talking about how she wants to find a glory hole. The intern told her that she was being disgusting and that he didnt want to interact with her in anythng but a prof manner and Patricia said she [SDH] was REALLY mad*

&gt;Jim: *Her supervisor wants to have a meeting with her and shes mad that they wont hold the meeting in her office. It smells rancit in there*

&gt;Hyde: *RIP Supervisor*

I figured I wouldn’t see her again for a while, but I was wrong. I saw her this morning as she was “sauntering” in to her building. She was dressed to impress – red and leopard everything – in size XXXL. She wore fishnets, which did her cellulite no favors. The skirt was too short, the jacket too tight, the heels too spindly. 

High heeled shoes are a bit of a wonder, in my opinion. It never ceases to amaze me that two little sticks can support my fat ass, and simultaneously make my legs look never-ending. Theoretically, the higher the heel, the more weight they can support, because most of your weight is actually on your toes.

SDH’s shoes were 4 inch stilettos. That’s a lot of weight on the heel … and it proved to be too much.

SDH was walking sort of detached from another group. She was trying very hard to “sashay”, but somehow it looked more like [prancercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-50GjySwew). I’ll let you take a minute to remember what she’s wearing, and add it to how she was walking. Got it? Great. Let’s move on.

Her left high heel snapped mid-step, and her fall trajectory literally reminded me of the way the [Super Star Destroyer crashed into the Death Star.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW_hGOFukMQ) Yes, I did the sound effect in my head too. She tumbled backwards, landed on her expansive ass, and *bounced* before rolling around on the floor trying to right herself. As she was inside the building, I couldn’t hear *what* she was screaming, but it was pretty evident she *was* screaming. The group she was walking near literally paused, stared at her for a split second, and then rushed towards the elevators. 

I spent a few moments of breathless laughter hiding behind an exterior column watching her turtle about. Literally google any video of a fat person trying to get up, that’s what it looked like. I couldn’t stop giggling. I’m beginning to giggle again just remembering it.

I’m a bad person… 

**tl;dr:** Hamburgers and interns make SDH tingly in the ladybits. 

EDIT: I've gotten several PM's requesting a SDH ""look alike"" on mybodygallery.com. [This](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-37779-body-shape.htm?StartAt=4#.V4Q8P_krKUk) is the closest approximation of her body type/size I could find. It's almost perfectly spot on. "

I see positions offering $100K/yr and I meet every qualification except having had done the job before full time like they want and its driving me nuts, even the most ""entry level"" positions want two to four years experience which is contradictory to the concept of ""entry level"".

I tried asking acquaintances but the only people I know who are in the field are telling me ""helpful"" stuff like:

* I should offer to work for free for two years in return for ""Experience"" (wtf?)

* I should spend thousands of dollars on multiple certifications when he got his job without any at all

* I go to school 4 years for IT (when i'm already self taught and have the skills to be a jr sysadmin)

One of them also told me that using linux in a business enviornment is illegal and I could go to jail for doing it (wow!)

Their eyes glaze over when I start talking about anything technically advanced (like SELinux vs AppArmor, or advanced virtualization security like IOMMU's) but they always insist that they know more than me.

I have done consulting work, and I have had a few (paid) internships but they just use me for grunt work and teach me nothing at all then get angry when I correct them on a serious mistake (eg: using the domain admin account to join an employees personal computer to a domain, having one word dictionary passwords for administrator accounts and the like) and then a few months later they fire me and replace me with two or three unpaid interns. One even insisted I lie to their supervisor and claim that I learned plenty from them. (I am an honest person so I refused to do this)

I'm gonna get my RHCE to start for certs but that still isn't going to get me my two years so sometimes I start to figure why bother at all.

Deblasio is full of shit when he says that there is a tech worker shortage.

I feel like I'm stuck in a rut that I'm never going to get out of and I just really needed to vent about it.

Has anyone here been in this position before? What did you do to get out of it?"

I am afraid to bring this up in case she gets even more upset with me and I ruin a reference. This is my internship, and I don't want a full 12 months to be potentially ruined since I'm assuming my next actual job will want reference letters.

Today I was told in front of everyone that I can't remember simple things (which is not the case) and I just sat there and apologized to her. The only thoughts on my mind are that I must appease until my time is up so I can move onto greener pastures.

How do I deal with this situation? I feel so chained, it's extremely depressing... I really need some advice.

_I cannot just walk away from this job due to it being a major internship and I need the money so that is not an option._"
4sebkm,5,2016-07-11,I'm engaged... and I have an Nmom. How should I handle her during the planning/ wedding?,oakboar,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4sebkm/im_engaged_and_i_have_an_nmom_how_should_i_handle/,"I've posted in this sub with this username before (it's the account I use to post about my Nmom). If you care for all of the details, all of my posts are in my history. For those who wants a summarize, the following is a TL;DR:

I was sexually assaulted by my stepfather when I was a teenager. It took my mom almost two years from when I told her about the abuse to finally kick her husband out of the house. For a while, I thought everything was okay between my mom and me until she started telling me things like how it was my fault her relationship ended, that I staged my own sexual assault to break the two of them up, that I was awful and manipulative and that I needed to go to therapy with her to resolve it all. 

Last Thanksgiving, my sister went to spend a week my our Nmom. Nmom and her new boyfriend made fun of my sister's weight. Nmom's boyfriend also decided that my sister was disrespectful towards him (I know my sister and she probably wasn't). Nmom then kicked my sister out of her home three days early (my sister lives across the country from Nmom). My sister has not talked to or seen Nmom since. 

I have had incredibly limited contact with my Nmom in the past six or seven months. I saw her briefly in March, when she told me that it was a good thing she said all of those things to me. According to her logic, if she had been kind to me, I would have moved back in with her and would not have taken the job I have now. She told me it was only because of her that I have the job I have now, which is not true in the least. 

When my Nmom started with her incredibly ugly words, I was finishing up an internship in DC. Now, I have full time permanent employment doing the very thing I went to college for. I also moved in with my boyfriend of nearly four years and over the July 4th weekend, he proposed. 

I am friends with some of my Nmom's coworkers on facebook, and I didn't want her to find out from them. I told my Nmom about the engagement via a facebook message (we are still friends, although I have her as restricted so she can't see anything I post). She told me that she was glad that I told her and then demanded to show her a picture of my ring on my finger. I told her that if she wanted to be a part of the wedding planning/ wedding itself, then she needed to apologize. 

Today, she sent me a message that said the following: ""I want to be the mother of the bride. I'm sorry for many things over the years. I would like to drive down to see you sometime in Sept. Things are really busy at work. I'm glad you saw your brother for his birthday. Love you."" 

We haven't spoken casually or normally with each other in months, so it felt weird to hear from her like that. To me, her message didn't feel genuine. It made me feel like she only wants to be a part of my wedding so that she can have the honor that's associated with being the mother of the bride, not to support me and share this momentous time in my life. 

I told my Nmom the following:

""Your response was inadequate. Your apology was a sentence long and didn't match the scope of your transgressions. I'm not going to ask you to write an essay or anything, but I really think it would be nice for you to write out EVERYTHING you did wrong, an explanation why you did it, and a detailed plan to make sure that that behavior NEVER happens again. At the end of that apology, make sure you exclude any kind of language that suggests that the things you did were good things (for example, you said it was a good thing said you all of those awful things to me because I wouldn't have my current job if you hadn't. That is not true. Your emotional abuse towards me caused NOTHING good to happen).

Basically, I want you to give me reasons to trust you again. I have no reason to trust you and every reason to believe that if I let you back into my life, you will hurt me again. You have caused me immense emotional turmoil. How are you going to repair that? 

Also, a little presumptuous of you to plan to come down in September, especially considering you didn't want to see me last time I was town.""

My Nmom responded by simply stating that she had been hurt too and that it was my choice if I didn't want her in my life, that she was willing and ready.

(For background, I was in town for Memorial Day and my Nmom told me that she didn't want to see me. For Christmas, she had plans to see me and then canceled at the last minute (I was at the airport about to board my plane to spend the holidays at home when she dropped that bomb on me). I spent the holidays with my fiance's family and with some friends. It certainly sounds like she is willing and ready to be involved in my life, right?)

I know that the way I responded might not have been the most mature or effective way of communicating, but I cannot have this woman at my wedding if she is going to tell me awful things. I feel like there is a lot of happiness to be had in the next year or two. There will be venue picking and dress shopping and showers and rehearsal dinners and helping me get ready before the wedding and all sorts of wonderful things that surround weddings. I don't want those things ruined by my Nmom. My sister, even though she has not spoken to our Nmom since Thanskgiving, has urged me to at least put Nmom's name on the guest list (the wedding won't be for some time). My sister says that not inviting Nmom to the wedding will be the nail in the coffin on our relationship. She also says that if Nmom ever ""comes around"" she will be so sad that she missed out on this time in my life. 

I simply want to go NC with my Nmom for forever. Do you guys have any recommendations?

As I head back to school, I am required to dress business casual everyday (the program I am in gets lots of exposure to high profile recruiters and my uni wants us to impress). Although I try my best to look good in the office, I cant help but feel as though I look like your stereotypical 90s business-dad. I have scoured the internet, but just have not been able to find the advice I am looking for. 

I am 6'4"" and 240lbs male (I have been began a workout regime and expect my weight to come down in the future, if thats important). The currently have 3 problems with the way I dress:
1) I feel like a sail and would like to have a less baggy look
2) I am moderately colorblind and am not sure which colors go together/are appropriate for the work place
3) I do not really know the dos/donts of b-casual

If anyone can answer my questions or point to a resource that will help me answer my question, I would GREATLY appreciate it. Thanks so much!"

Anyway, he will go through our food like there is no tomorrow.

He is a tall, skinny kid.  And, well, she told me he has had an eating disorder in the past.

Well, I don't think it is so much in the past.  I think I just heard him purge.  

I don't know what to do.  Should I tell her even though I am only 90% sure?
I don't feel I can approach him about it.

I have been reading these posts for days, astounded by how  much of my Ndad is similar to all these situations. I always thought there was something wrong with me, but this community proves that wrong. My entire life my dad has been controlling and super verbally abusive. Nothing I ever did was right to him. I became valedictorian in highschool, despite him never being home bc of him working overtime for the purpose of saving money for my schooling...only to graduate and sign on board of the school of my dreams for him to say that he had no fund for me to go and that I should stay at home. At that point I said fuck you dad I'm not letting you get in the way of my future, and I cut him off and was able to negotiate with my school to take the scholarships that I saved up to be in place of my family contribution because my dad went MIA.  

I thought I was home free...until I mistakenly let him back into my life when my younger brother told me of his mom passing away. I talked to so many people and came to the concensus that despite the past I should show up and be there for him in that tough time ( I never spoke to the women so it was pretty traumatizing being at the funeral never knowing who she was). At this point I thought my dad changed. This was the first time in my life he told me that he loved me on his own, the first time he hugged me on his own. He said he was changed and wanted to be apart of me life and help me afford college.

Big fucking mistake.

Because of his constant yelling and other abuses growing up I've developed really bad anxiety that results into depressiom that hasn't been checked. My real dream is to make a life for myself in Japan (I'm a pretty intermediate speaker of Japanese, been studying intensively for 2 years)  I've begged and pleaded my dad to let me go get professional help for these conditions but he thinks I'm just making it up. If I only think positively it'll go away ( biggest bullshit) so it came time for me to study abroad there. Something that was supposed to be the time of my life ruined by my father, yet again. Even though I've been there before for an extended period of time doing an internship for women's empowerment, this time was different. Had really bad panic attacks every night, intense diarrhea, insomnia, etc. I called my dad telling him that I need help, he immediately hung up on me. The program I was in couldn't find a sufficient enough English speaking doctor to help me, and not like I had the money to pay my dad only gave me 100 for the summer (go fucking figure).

So I had to make it back home. My dad is an aircraft mechanic so I can fly for free however since this was against what he wanted he didn't want to send for me so I had to make a gofundme to afford a ticket back home to get medical help.  Now that I've done this I've been disowned from his life (despite all his friends trying to get in contact with my mom. Btw my mom has no job so is financially unavailable) , he's forgetting that I exist. He's moving on and ""finally living for himself"" now with his new girlfriend and he's gonna focus on my brother's education (even though he's equally as destructive to my brother. Growing up my brother was fat and he ridiculed him to the point of him not eating anything and exercising incessantly. And he pits my brother against me by telling him he's never gonna be great like me despite him having all A's and extracurriculars)

He's always used money as a control over me. At first he didn't want me to go to college. Then he did. Now he doesn't. I could be valedictorian, go to the best all women's college in america, but the moment I go against his false reality of the world I get punished. One moment I'm a grown adult and dont need his help, the next I'm a helpless child who can't make her own decisions. He's always had the worst opinion of me. Always telling me I'm just gonna become pregnant, a homeless bum, etc despite my actual life choices showing otherwise. 

Now I'm in a limbo, back with my mom. I'm trying to get therapy and hopefully continue back my schooling. My dad's family keeps calling me a psychotic bitch and telling me I ruined my life because I didn't listen to my dad and now wont graduate....

Its a big dumb mess but, all of you on here have helped me identify the gross human being he is. I will pull through, I will graduate and this time I'm going NC once and for all."
4sf0he,3,2016-07-11,Not sure if this new job is just weird or these are serious red flags.,goatsnboots,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4sf0he/not_sure_if_this_new_job_is_just_weird_or_these/,"Sorry for the length - I'm including everything in case it's relevant.

I applied for a summer internship at the beginning of April. My current job is tolerable, so I wasn't job searching too hard, and I'm moving out of the country at the end of August, so I stopped my job search at the beginning of June. CompanyX sent me an email early last week asking me what times I was available for an interview. There was no acknowledgement of the time gone by (at that point about three months). I responded that I was no longer job searching and wished them luck with their intern search. They responded saying that this internship would turn into a full-time job. I replied saying I was moving. They responded saying the job could be done remotely. So, okay, that's pretty enticing. I set up an interview for Wednesday. 

Side note: I lost my phone a couple of weeks ago. I need to buy a new phone/plan when I move anyway, so I figured Skype and email would work just fine until then. I let the guy know that I didn't have a phone and that I'd only be available via email.

I arrived at 9am for the interview on Wednesday. The guy wasn't there. Turns out he tried to call my old number that was on my resumé (that I sent him in April) to tell me he would be 30 mins late. So I waited for 30 mins - I don't have a problem with this; there's no way this could have been prevented. When he showed up, he said that my phone number wasn't working, and I reminded him that I currently don't have a phone. 

The interview was two hours long and was mostly him telling me about the company. He had asked me to bring in some of my work (I'm in marketing, so I brought in some marketing plans I had done previously). He looked through everything before asking me where the pictures were. I was a little confused, and clarified that I was in marketing not advertising specifically, and he said that was fine. Then he asked me how long it would take me to build his company's website. I was confused and explained that I'm not a web developer. He got kind of upset and acted like I'd wasted his time. Web development, as far as I know, was not on the original job listing, so I have no idea where that came from.

The interview concluded and he asked me to make a marketing plan and present it to everyone at the company on Monday (earlier today) - there are only five or six people at this company, so that sounded fine. I'm getting paid for my time, so I agreed to send him a copy of the plan by Sunday evening and meet again Monday.

I arrived at 9am today. He wasn't there, and his office manager and everyone else had no idea who I was or why I was there. His office manager agreed to call him on my behalf (again, no phone), and when I spoke to him on the phone, he said that he thought I had ghosted him and was no longer interested in the position. Apparently he hadn't gotten my email yesterday afternoon with the plan I made. Anyway, I waited until 10am for him to arrive. 

When he showed up, he said that he expected me to disappear due to my ""unprofessional behavior."" He listed the fact that I have no web development skills, that I didn't take notes during our two-hour interview, that I don't have a phone, that I didn't email him the plan as promised (I went on to show him proof that I sent it), and that I don't have a car (I live in a city with an excellent public transportation system, and driving is not at all a part of this job). 

I went on to do my little presentation for just him and the office manager. Having a job that I could do remotely would be amazing - I am going to be super tight on money when I move - but this feels like a really crummy way to start a business relationship. I'm really torn between waiting it out to see if it gets better or bowing out now. Help.

4sf1dt,8,2016-07-11,I'm having a really bad time at my internship and am wondering if life is going to feel like this forever.,canireddit,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4sf1dt/im_having_a_really_bad_time_at_my_internship_and/,"I'm interning at a large, corporate company in the Seattle area as a software development intern. I feel really frustrated and stressed and am wondering what my best course of action is. The company I'm at is known to hire interns full time at the end of the internship. If I do get an offer (which I doubt at this point, as I don't think I'm doing too hot) would it be a bad career move to turn it down? Should I find a place to work where I'm happier? I'll be graduating next March so I'll need to decide soon.

My biggest problem with the internship is my manager. He's very stern and multiple times a day says ""make sure you implement x"" when I haven't even wrapped my mind around how I'm going to do all the other things he's assigned me. Every time he assigns me something he speaks as if it's second nature to me, even though I've told him several times that I've never done integration tests, MVC development, etc. The first version of my product is due in three weeks and I'm really nervous about the idea of not getting done in time. I also just don't connect with my manager on a personal level and all of our interactions are tense and awkward. I want to like him, and I want to do well enough for him to like me, but I don't get the feeling he does at all. I don't think I dislike the company I work for as much as I dislike working on this team.

Speaking to other interns, everyone seems to be having a really good time. They have laid back managers and helpful, enthusiastic mentors. They also say they're in the same boat of feeling overwhelmed, but they appear to have much more manageable projects with clearer objectives. I don't really see other interns very often as my team works on a floor that's secluded from other dev teams. There's one person on my team I get along with pretty well, but everyone else is a lot older and reserved. I don't think I've seen my mentor smile more than twice during the entire 4+ weeks I've been here.

Everything here just feels so soulless. It's a complete contrast to college labs where everyone is joking around while helping each other solve problems. Is the real world really just like this? 9-5 drag, not having people to talk about Game of Thrones with, bosses that are hard to be friends with? Is CS just not the right path for me? Am I not cut out for this?

4sf3r0,93,2016-07-12,[Train wreck] My internship environment was so poorly run that it got me fired,itinternterror,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/4sf3r0/train_wreck_my_internship_environment_was_so/,"As of today I no longer have an internship at a dysfunctional company. Two weeks ago it was discovered that a finance app we use had been breached on my start date, and the investigation concluded today. What I got was that about an hour before I arrived on my first day, my account, which had a username in the format of first initial + last name and a password of ""password"" when I first arrived, was used to access one of our web servers, which they then used to move across the network and into our finance servers. Given that I overheard the full time staff talking about a ""third domain admin"" and a ""golden ticket"", it sounds like the attacker attained persistent access. I was given a standard talk about how I'm responsible for what happens on my account and then escorted out of the building. I'm not facing any criminal charges at this time, though they did mention I could be facing 160 years in prison if they decided to press charges. I will have enough money to last until classes resume, though it will be a little tight.

My last two weeks there were anything but smooth. I found out that the reason we were seeing so many login attempts on our main domain admin account was because a scheduled task on a server performing some work for another department ran as our second domain admin account, but as part of the script it open up IE6 and log in to a web page on our internal services server as our primary domain admin account, making it look like the problem was on our internal services server.

I also learned from the full time staff that said second domain admin account has a password shared by every user, including contractors and interns, in another department, and is basically never changed. It's a huge thorn in their side, but they haven't been able to reign in its access because that department has an in with upper management. 

There wasn't an actual crisis until last Monday when the NIC on one of their VM hosts (that is the sole host in a mission critical cluster) failed. All IT staff, including me, were called in to try to fix it. Their support does not cover holidays, so after several attempts to revive the problem NIC we had to shut down a host on another cluster and take its NIC to replace the bad one, and they won't be able to easily replace the bad NIC because the mission critical host is the only one with a service contract. 

Finally, on Friday the finance app that got breached went down completely. The IT staff actually couldn't even restart it because it didn't have enough memory to stop the service. Even restarting the server didn't fix it, as the app immediately gobbled up all of the server's memory. We were interrupted by a helpdesk call that wasn't from finance, and, given how little I was trusted, I was given that to handle. The user had gotten a fake antivirus popup, and I tried to get her to shut down, which, after trying to explain where on her screen the start menu is or where the windows key is on her keyboard for 10 minutes, I actually had to walk out to her desk in another building to shut down her virtual desktop. I got back just as one of the full time staff came out of the server room. They apparently had to restore the database from a backup, and finance would have to manually redo anything that happened since the backup was made.

I also had one other humorous thing happen: the senior sysadmin who left found my post and asked me for a more detailed account, which I gave her. She apologized for leaving me with a bomb that was about to explode, but I really can't blame her.

(And one last thing: I'm she, not he)"

My girlfriend jokes with me because she always says yes and never argues against my path because she always knows it will change. 

Ever since I was about 14, I was set on becoming a computer programmer. Shortly after getting to college and choosing CS as my major, I lost interest even with straight As. Shortly thereafter I switched my major to Urban Planning, then switched it again to Linguistics, then to Business, then to the ""Consumer &amp; Community Studies major with an emphasis in Financial Planning"" program, and as of late I have dropped the emphasis to expedite my graduation date. 

I am currently completing an internship within a financial planning firm and have discovered that it's completely not for me. However, despite all of this major changing, I have still managed to graduate college 1 year early (this coming spring) so I have decided to just stick it out with my Consumer &amp; Communities studies degree. 

I have lots of start-up ideas (30+) but I have absolutely no knowledge or resources to start them and sometimes no motivation either. Also, like I said before, my desire to pursue a specific idea changes daily. Along similar lines, I have also been compiling a list of social research projects that I'd like to do but just like my start-up ideas, ""I have absolutely no knowledge or resources to start them and sometimes no motivation either.""

Some of my interests include minimalism, frugality, personal finance, languages, and traveling. Some of my favorite non-major related courses were design thinking, intro accounting, entrepreneurship, and social science research methods. 

I've already received extremely strong hints and almost an even casual offer to stay at my current firm full-time after graduation but it's definitely not what I'm interested in pursing. As graduation approaches, I feel more and more lost and nervous. I'd greatly appreciate anybody's input whatsoever, I'm open to anything at this point. Thank you very much! :)

Budget is around 650$, will probably order it from Amazon US or from Bestbuy.

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
2 in 1 form is my main priority. I would like to easily fold it and use it a a tablet when required, so would prefer sturdy laptops, so that its doesn't get damaged in a couple of months

* **How important is weight to you?**
Somewhat important, considering I would like to use it as a tablet frequently.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
 Windows

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
Between 13.3 to 15.6 inches

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
 I will be using it only for college and internship works.

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
 N/A

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
 Build quality should be reliable, optical drive is not necessary

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
I will be using it for light work, but want it to be reliable nonetheless. It will be used for browsing, might read comics/Pdf, may need to use Microsoft Office. So, it doesn't need to be of the highest config, but would prefer that it would atleast be an i5 and should have atleast 8Gb of RAM. SSD is preferable"

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

-----------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up (would love her to look like Madison Ivy)

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S also looking to role play Marvel/DC, Game Of Thrones, The Witcher and Mass Effect

They liked it so much that they decided to start a sidecompany around it and offered me a job. The internship lasted 6 months and I have been working for the company roughly 5. I'm still in college, graduating for my bachelor in roughly a year. Planning to do a master afterwards. 

I'm not that happy with my position, talks with the shareholders/bosses don't help me along. They want to utilize me to a maximum, but I don't feel like they offer me a lot of reasons to stay.

Pros to stay:

-The program is my program, it's my baby and it's awesome to see people actually want to buy it. 

-I'm the only employee so all technical decision are made by me. 

-Very flexible hours, working from home is no problem. Salary is ok, not great.

-Interesting niche market that seems like a good place to make carreer. 

Cons:

-I feel like I'm not learning too much from developing on my own. I know what I should do better, but lack of time, shifting requirements and lack of discipline cause huge technical debt. Working for a bigger company should increase my knowledge and discipline. 

-After graduation I'm not going to get a salary plus benefits that are expected in the market.

-I need to shift my carreer decisions around what makes the boss happy (master in city were the company is located etc). 

-The fun is slowly wearing off. I'm not that happy going into work. 


I'm I being an entitled prick for wanting to leave? The company will probably be disbanded when I leave, they are not going to find someone willing to go through my code, fixing all technical debt while keeping money from customers flowing in. Therefore leaving feels like a dick move. Long term I think it's better for my carreer though. Sure, there's lots of opportunity in a startup if I dedicate years to it, but in the end I don't have shares, earn a ok salary and only will have earned the ""pride"" of the company going big around my program.

I'm lost, been doubting this issue for months now and not getting closer to an answer. My boss only offers peptalks, no actual reasons to take my concerns away.

Yeah well, people don't wanna see that shit, most people don't care for that shit. I know I don't wanna see that shit, dont want my kids seeing that shit! You make the mistake of assuming that people should feel safe when people see you walking around with your gun, but guess what, we don't know you, and I for sure as fuck don't trust you. All your doing is bringing negative attention to yourself, and without even knowing it, you've probably even become a target yourself, you can't shoot back at the element of surprise. If you wanna carry it.. Fine... conceal it! I thought that you gun people wanted to open carry to protect yourself and others , but you contradicted that by saying that what you're really doing battling the anti-gun drive, well, at least you were honest unlike these other agenda pushing assholes, at the end of the day though, your gun isn't going to save any lives or your own, it's like car insurance, everybody has it, but most of us never have to use it.﻿ -Louie Dominguez IV

Reply:

It's about ridding the phobia of seeing a gun and automatically getting the response that you are giving. Your response sounds more emotional than reasonable. We want people to see a gun and think of it as scary as any type of object that's not a gun. Its like seeing a spider and freaking out when its just a little bug.

I don't think everyone with a gun should open carry but I respect the people who do it and are not are going about it in a bad way and don't bring attention to the gun. People who do open carry should act as good or better than a cop interns of respect for other people. They should not bring attention to the gun. I don't like people who open carry and make it a big deal.

""You make the mistake of assuming that people should feel safe when people see you walking around with your gun, but guess what, we don't know you, and I for sure as fuck don't trust you.""
Not everybody is you and think the same way you do. I agree some people might take it the wrong way but there are people who will take it the right way. You see cops with guns all the time. But they are just as human as anyone else.

""All your doing is bringing negative attention to yourself""
Other people are bringing their negative ideas with their prejudices. That's not the people who carry's fault that other people are judging them without seeing their actions first. Like the way yous should judge a person, after you get to know them and not the way they look. They could be completely respectful about what they are doing.

""you've probably even become a target yourself""
Yes you can be a target. But I don't think the times where you are a target come up much. The argument could be made that if you take the perspective as a bad guy and you have one target that clearly has a gun and one that does not you will take the path of least resistance. Like a car with a locked door and one with not. You can break a window buy why take the chance? You are not also not likely to be in a mass shooting where you might be a target.

""If you wanna carry it.. Fine... conceal it!""
This proves to me that its more of a phobia of seeing a gun. They still have the ability to shoot but you just don't want to see it, which to me seems backwards. If I did not want guns around I want to know who have them so I could avoid them. Not knowing and having someone next to me with a gun would be the opposite of what I wanted. Why does seeing a gun automatically make you upset even if both people have the same ability?

""your gun isn't going to save any lives or your own, it's like car insurance, everybody has it, but most of us never have to use it.""
Well as to say better have it and not need it than need it and not have it.

I use to be more like you till I tried guns out and with a respectful gun community. I lost the fear of the guns and have a better focus on whats important. I know what people with guns are capable of (what bullets can and cant do). I know how to safely use and disarm and handle a firearm (encase I need to). And I know how to hid and run (whats bullet proof, how to make myself a hard target to shoot so I can get away from a bad guy). The gun is only used in the more extreme cases when cops can't help and the victim(s) cant get away. I don't care if I see someone has a gun as open carry, that's not a problem and I will go on about my day. Its making a big deal over nothing in my eyes.

I think the main problem is people look at guns as such a primitive macho thing, ""its not the old west anymore"". That's not what guns are about. Its a serious thing and much respect is given to its use.

I don't open carry. Its a hassle interns of comfortability (I like small easy to carry guns) and socially I just don't want the hassle, and I guess to respect the people who don't want to see it. But I do feel like i'm being counterproductive sometimes. 

/r/Firearms what do you think of open carry?"

When speaking with my advisor he suggested I do their certificate program into a master's program. He said it would take around the same time as a new undergrad degree. My issue is that I'm worried about not having any experience in the industry (internships) if I go certificate/master's route. If I go undergrad I'll have time to find an internship hopefully. Does anyone know how employers view a certificate in Computer Science when hiring? Would I be able to get a job once I have the certificate and then do the master's or should I just go right into the master's?

Still kind of long though. Sorry!


I have body image dysmorphia. I was bullied violently from an early age and after puberty it became specifically about my looks. It was every day for years. Nobody helped, or disagreed with the general consensus. I ended up with agoraphobia and social anxiety, which is now under control. I then developed an eating disorder during an abusive relationship when I was 18-20, and dropped to 6 stone due to my boyfriends insistence that I was fat, ugly stupid, boring and disgusting. I had a BMI of 14. The eating disorder is also under control. I am taking antidepressants and am in therapy currently.


Dating has not been easy due to this. I am incredibly sensitive to perceived comparisons to other woman, and deeply insecure.
Previous relationships have ended in them cheating, or because I couldn't handle how bad I felt because of what may have been innocuous comments and broke it off. Examples include a boyfriend telling me I was the third hottest girl he'd dated. He reacted badly to my hurt reaction and told me I couldn't take a compliment. He was very hung up on his exes and showed me photos to prove their beauty. He said 'see?' One boyfriend would give me compliments like 'you are hotter than 80% of the people in this room.' He also reacted badly to my inability to take this compliment as 'it was still a high number,' but I couldn't stop thinking about the other 20%! He would see attractive girls on the street with their boyfriends and say things like 'why do those guys get all the girls like that? Nice guys finish last.' I was thinking 'I'm last place. I'm a consolation prize.' One guy cheated on me with a self-proclaimed model, and when I told people that part their sympathy evaporated. They said things like 'wow, she sounds perfect. Sorry...' My fault. Not pretty enough. The first man I was intimate with said 'You're no supermodel, but you'll do.' It feels like every relationship I am in is fragile as I am not pretty enough. In reality they are fragile because I am not secure enough and I have no idea how to be. 
I am now dating a man who tells me I am beautiful every day but my insecurity is wrecking it because on a deep level I don't believe him.


On our second date he started describing the intern he was training. Alarm bells started ringing when he described the reaction of every man in the office and how jealous they were of him that he got to train her and that he was a 'lucky bastard.' She is a model. He found a picture to show me. I tried to let it go, then he went on a work night out, and came back with a camera full of pictures of her. 90% were of her. It was like he followed her around with a camera all night. He reassured me by telling me she had a boyfriend. He said 'I don't want someone that men are falling all over themselves to be with, I want you.' I still felt shitty. I did not feel better. In later conversations he has apologised and said he was being insensitive, and wouldn't have liked it if I'd done the same to him about one of my male friends. 


It has come up again because he is doing a photo shoot of her this weekend. I know it is irrational but I feel terrible. Something that makes it even more irrational - it's a pregnancy photoshoot! She is well and truly off the market and I don't think he'd cheat anyway unless I drive him away by being insecure every 5 seconds. But still I am constantly seeking reassurance at the moment and it's driving us apart. I am not letting go of the past. I'm confident it wouldn't happen again - low self esteem meant I practically let those guys disrespect me so badly because I basically agreed with them. If I had those conversations now I'd tell them fuck off. But I still feel completely inadequate and like a consolation prize for men that really wanted a more beautiful girl but got stuck with me. And I am making my boyfriend suffer for the sins of the people in my past. He was an insensitive for sure, but he wasn't being malicious, and I feel I was reacting to the past more than the present.


So... how do I let go of the past? I know logically that beauty is subjective and personal, and one person's super hot might not work for someone else. It's like Dita Von Teese said (paraphrased): you could be the ripest, juiciest peach and there will always be someone that doesn't like peaches. And even if this one girl is hotter than me, what has that got to do with me? Nothing at all! There's no actual tangible reason this should be affecting my relationships so much. Nobody has ever actually said to me 'I can't date you because I hate your face.' And looking at it logically, the guys that treated me like that were not conventionally attractive either, and may well have been projecting onto me. Kind of like I'm doing to my boyfriend right now. 


How do I get decent self esteem? I have okay self esteem in most other areas. But they are all overshadowed by the voice in my brain that tells me I'm ugly every single day. Nobody tells me I'm ugly anymore. But I do.


**tl;dr**: I have horrific self image due to bad experiences in the past and it's affecting my relationship. How do I let go of the past and get manageable self esteem?

4sigmi,2,2016-07-12,"Help! 1st year SPED teacher seeking any advice for a blind, autistic, severely intellectually disabled student",meadowdoor,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/4sigmi/help_1st_year_sped_teacher_seeking_any_advice_for/,"I am a special education teacher intern in Wisconsin.  I have eight 6-8th grade students whose abilities vary from nonverbal to 6th grade-equivalent literacy/math skills.  A divider separates my class from the 4-5th grade group, who have another teacher.  We share a para-educator assistant between the two of us, who us on the classroom for about 4 hours during the day.  

The child in question has a Children's Healthcare Aide of his own.  I have had several different women in this position.  According to my principal, their duties are to:
1. toilet the child
2. help the child eat
3. assist the child with mobility, and ensure that he does not wander from the classroom

Some CHAs have gone above and beyond this job description to doing activities with the child, such as asking him to match objects by texture and shape, or reading with him.

Those are the same activities that I do with him.  I have not been able to find something that engages him.  He does not like listening to audiobooks, either played through a speaker or headphones.  He does not like to hold things.  He will place objects down immediately if you give them to him. 

It seems to me that people gave up on him years ago, and since then he has been allowed to sit in the classroom all day and self-stimulate by making vocalizations and clapping occasionally instead of doing any sort of work.  

Most often, he does not follow my directions.  He is more likely to listen to the para, who has worked at the school for decades and he is more familiar with.  It is clear that he can understand speech, since he follows responds appropriately when we say ""it's time to go to lunch"" or ""let's stand up and move to the round table.""  When I work with him, I am constantly narrating aloud my thoughts and what we are doing.  Here is what I think I will be able to do with him:

1.  teach him to recognize the peg closest to the door as his, so that he can feel for it and find it in the morning.  I expect him to take his backpack off and hang it there.  The same goes for his jacket.  Currently, he wiggles out of the backpack and lets it fall to the ground, then waits for someone to take his jacket out of his hand, lest he drop it on the ground.

2.  Move from wearing diapers to using the bathroom as independently as possible.  Currently, the CHA changes his diaper for him in the bathroom, with him standing up.  I do not have experience with teaching children how to use the bathroom independently, but I am determined to learn how!

3.  I would like to have him practice more functional skills, such as brushing his teeth in the morning (students eat breakfast at school).  I have been able to get him to zip up his own jacket, after starting the zipper at the bottom.  The most difficult part of zipping the jacket up seems to be his hand strength -- his hands are so floppy and without muscle tone when I do hand-over-hand.  

So, the ways things are now, this dear student of my spends most of the day sitting away from everyone else, clapping and vocalizing. I will continue trying to involve him more in group activities, but it is challenging for me because most of the time I cannot get him to move from one location to another.  He can be stubborn and will sometimes fall to the ground like a dead weight if I take his hand to guide him somewhere.  

During my last observation, my principal asked me ""what the hell is going on with D?"" to which I replied ""I am trying my hardest to find a way to engage him, but I have not found something that D even /likes/.""  She told me that I need to make a schedule for him so that he is doing something throughout the day.

This is difficult because most of the time, I am working alone with 8 kids, and D requires 1:1 attention.  Furthermore, the only way to incentivize him to do work thus far has been graham crackers.  I don't want to use food as an incentive.  It goes against my teaching philosophy, and real life will not reward him with food for doing ""good things.""  

I work in Milwaukee's inner city, where there is very little support from administration.  I have never been able to talk to or meet his parents.  Every ""specialist"" I speak to answers my pleas for help with ""yep, he's been this way forever.""  I really do think that D has potential for greater things, and he is becoming a teenager.  He can do so much more than what I've seen so far. 

But please, I need help.  I don't know what to do with him.  I don't know how to teach him, let alone entertain him.  I did have approximately 45 seconds of interaction with him when I blew bubbles at his face.  Maybe I can try to get a little box of sand?  Maybe he would like that texture?  He does not like playdough.  

Gahh!!  I am at my wit's end, because D is only 1/8th of my classroom.  I'm going to night school twice a week and am studying to take the FORT.  I have about 20 days until school starts again.  

Does anyone have any advice for how I can help this child?

I am observing a teacher of the visually impaired next week, and I intend to call in the special ed supervisor, autism supervisor, and vision supervisor once school starts again.  I believe D belongs in a place that specializes in the visually impaired and functional development, but I have little control over those types of things.  

Also, if it makes any difference, I am unsure of what D's ""diagnosis"" was, but I do know that he is missing one eye, and the other is atypically shaped.  The iris is a narrow, vertical oval.  I almost never see him use it, but when he is really interested in something, I can see him quickly tacking that eye back and forth, horizontally as he holds his breath.  Also, he can get around the classroom without help pretty well.  Maybe he can see some variance in light?

I need help because I'm only just not starting out as a special education teacher, and my focus has been on middle school learning disabilities and autism.  D deserves better than what he has been getting from school so far, and if I don't help him, I fear that he will continue to slip through the cracks.  

I am going to be interfacing with the school district and the specialists who can help me with D, but I was hoping that this community could help me find ideas for activities to do with D, ways to engage him, other functional skills I can try with him, etc.

Thank you so much for reading."

I know Lappis and other student housing is available, but I need to be a registered member of the students union in order to apply, and well in order to apply I need to be enrolled as a full time student in a Swedish university, which I am not.

I would like to look for shared housing/dorm like places, but am unsure where to start. I've done some basic navigation on blocket.se and the like but any further recommendations and advice would be very welcome.

4sipmz,497,2016-07-12,Me [26M] with my wife [27F] 4 years. My wife is jealous of one of my female friends. It opened my eyes to how many friends I lost because they didn't like that I married her. Now we're angry and confused with each other.,billsaman00,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4sipmz/me_26m_with_my_wife_27f_4_years_my_wife_is/,"Oo-kay so where to begin? I've been married for about 4 years. Before I met my wife I was actually single for almost 7 years. I never had a high school sweetheart or really anything like that. I have a good amount of female friends but none that I was ever attracted to. I thought I was attracted to one, but it was more of an infatuation and I decided to cut off any chance of a relationship before I deployed one year so that I wouldn't end up getting sucked into a meaningless relationship.

My wife actually was never part of my friend group. She's not even from the town I'm currently stationed in. I was visiting a city in Texas when I first saw her to barhop with a few guys from that city that wanted me to see my first rodeo as well. I actually saw her for the first time at a video game store. I stopped in to look at discount games and she worked at the bookstore next door. She was seriously the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen in my life. She was 100% unlike any one of me or my friends (I'm covered in tattoos and wear trashy holes in my pants and over-sized black shirts, she was in slacks a button down pink shirt with a gold necklace that had her monogrammed initials on it) which is relevant, because she was the last person in the world that anyone expected me to totally fall for.

I immediately had to talk to her. I don't talk to girls I don't know but I had to talk to her. She was beyond intelligent and I found out she had actually gone to school and had wealthy parents and worked part time there and had a part time internship in the city at a big company. I missed the rodeo that trip because the rest of it I spent with her.

I proposed to her after 2 years of long distance dating and meant to leave the military to join her in that city. However, I ended up staying in and she dropped everything to move in with me. A sacrifice I will never forget.

She's not a jealous person and she's not a mean or vindictive person. She's sweet and timid. A lot of my female friends were instantly enraged when I started dating her and I had to give up a few that were constantly demonizing her and putting her down in attempt to urge me to break up with her. It actually strained our relationship quite a bit because she felt really small compared to how many female friends I had and felt intimidated by how many she was sure had feelings for me.

Anyways, I kept the friends that were nice to her and she became friends with them as well and loves them and talks to them almost daily.

So here's kind of the part where it got rocky. I should mention my wife is pregnant now (with a girl, we found out last week). She's still beautiful but she's been feeling terrible about herself. She hasn't gained weight but her nausea is keeping her inside a lot and she's been getting a lot of acne that bothers her. I took her to see a friend that was in town (one of my female friends) named Jessica. 

She actually loves Jessica and talks to her often and admires Jessica's tattoos and stuff. They're nothing alike, but have found common interests and are both open minded. I've been Jessica's friend since the 5th grade and I've known her family that long too. So I brought my wife to meet Jessica in person along with her family.

I thought it didn't go that bad... but as soon as we left that night my wife was in tears and didn't want to go with me to see Jessica again. We spent the whole time catching up and eating good food. Jessica's dad and I both are/were military and always get together to drink to talk about it and catch up. My wife was mostly helping Jessica's mom cook and talk about the new baby and she'd also talk to Jessica. Jessica's brother Brandon (who's 20 and acts like an obnoxious 20 year old) was interjecting but I just told my wife not to take him seriously because he acts like he knows everything to fit in.

According to my wife she thinks Jessica's family is disappointed that I married her. She began naming exact instances and I started to see it and now I feel guilty. When my wife went to the bathroom Jessica's mom took photos of only me and Jessica. Jessica changed my phone background from my ultrasound picture of my daughter to a picture of me kind of staring into Jessica's eyes (it was a weird image that I didn't realize someone caught on camera). Her brother kept telling me how hot all the girls I went to high school got and told me right in front of my wife not to worry that nobody will let anyone (meaning my wife) be jealous or keep me from agreeing. 

At one point my wife jokingly pointed out that she was the only one without tattoos. Jessica's dad, my long time friend, sneered and said, ""Maybe it's time to figure out some individuality."" and Brandon kept talking about how stupid monogrammed clothing and jewelry (something my wife loves and wears all the time) looked and how vapid girls who wear it are. Jessica treated my wife's yorkie like it was the grossest thing in the world and Jessica's entire family mostly talked about how great Jessica and I's friendship was since we were kids.

Now I feel like an idiot. And guilty. I want to stay Jessica's friend, but I feel like my female friends are dwindling to nothing because none of them get along with my wife or really care for her. Or treat her like she exists. In fact, none of my friends treat her like she exists. They invite me out or me to my hometown and they congratulate me on things like promotions... but no one has even told me 'congratulations' on my child. Or my marriage. Or anything.

My wife feels devastated and like she cost me my friends. And in a weird way, I feel like marrying her cost me my friends too. I didn't change my phone background and my wife was hurt and asked me to because she found the picture inappropriate. She pointed out that I post just pictures of me and other girls all over my Facebook and stuff but nothing exists of her on there. I mentioned that nobody ever says anything about our photos so what's the point? She got frustrated and has been spending nights at her friend's house. She's been gone for 2 days now.

I don't know how to fix this or what to do. I love my friends. I successfully kept all of my high school and middle school friends and relationships. My wife is beautiful and she's smart and nice but my friends have been with me for life. I feel like I'm a damn idiot for putting a hot girl I met in Texas in front of my friendships but I have an obligation to make my wife a happy woman especially because she's now pregnant.

I'm lost and don't know how to approach her or talk about this. I don't want to lose my friends. I wanted them to be happy for me but they just aren't and continuing my life with her will one day cost me everybody.

**TLDR; I lost almost all of my female friends because they were abusing my wife and jealous of her. One of my only female friends left, my wife doesn't like because of how she was treated by that friend and her family when we went to see her. Looking back on it, I lost a lot of my friends who never approved of my marriage and now it's starting to depress me and make me feel lonely. My wife is jealous and confused and angry and left a few nights ago and now I'm second guessing everything.**"

I ended up passing with a 758 and I'm in the middle of preparing for PC Pro and A+. 

Today I accepted an offer with a different employer for double my original student intern salary while I work on my associates at 20 years old. I never thought this would happen and it's such a great starting point for someone who doesn't have a college degree yet. Anyone my age or in a similar situation, have hope because if you get the right stuff and apply for the right job this can actually happen. 

I owe it all to this sub and your plethora of knowledge. Now I can actually save up to pay for university with minimal loans which means I can actually go get a bachelor's degree.

Just hoping for some female support here. I started grad school last fall and met a guy just before I started who ended up being one of my best friends. He and I had a bit of a FWB situation for a little while, but in all honesty, I've never been romantically interested in him. As I transitioned to a new place, new people, and a new life, he was a pillar of support in my life. I met so many people and had so many great memories with him. I honestly do not think I could have made the transition without him- I owe many of my friendships to connections with him and he and I were very close.

 Back in May, he and I got into an argument. Essentially, I asked a question about his on again/off again girlfriend that he deemed too personal- we both said some hurtful things, but I didn't think it was a big deal. A week or two later I tried to contact him in a friendly manner, and he basically told me that since I wouldn't apologize to him he wanted nothing to do with me and to enjoy my summer at my internship. 

Since then, I moved to a new state and have been working my dream job in an internship, but I am still very hung up on this guy. The last conversation I had with him ended with me telling him that I just wanted my friend back, and him just saying ""k."" At the time, I didn't want to apologize because I wasn't sorry. I was honest in what I said and I felt like he was trying to invalidate my emotions and choices. After this conversation, I ended up sending him a message because I felt like too much had gone unsaid on my end- I thanked him for everything he had done for me, I apologized for my faults and for not always being good or kind, and I wished him well in the future. I received no reply to this. Since then, I unfollowed all of his social media and have been trying really hard to accept the fact that he made a choice. He chose to walk away from our friendship without a backward glance. Last week I asked him if I ought to just delete his phone number, and he essentially told me he didn't care either way. 

So ladies. I am so torn with this situation. I was initially so disappointed and hurt by his actions, and I have reached a point where I'm mostly angry. I did end up apologizing for the original argument we had, because I recognize that I did invade a topic that was personal to him. Half of the time I want to try to fix our friendship, and half of the time I'm downright angry. This side of him that I am seeing now- this selfish, inconsiderate man who clearly hasn't been affected by this at all- is not someone that I recognize or like. Even knowing this, he is on my mind every day, and I am tired of it. I am tired of feeling this way, and I am tired of missing someone who clearly doesn't miss me. I know a lot of these emotions are stemming from the fact that I am spending a lot of time alone at my internship and have not met many people, and I have found that distance has made several other friends fall out of touch with me as well. I know that with time and space, with new friendships and being busy, I will heal and be okay, but in the meantime I am struggling.  I will also have a high likelihood of running into him in the fall at school, and I honestly don't know how it will go. I have a feeling it will be the ""who can care less game"", but I don't know, and I really want to have my own self sorted out before then.  But I sincerely want to heal and move on from this, and it feels like with every step forward I take two back. 

So if any of you have any advice on how to move on- other than the normal things (get involved with something, talk to friends, ect), I would love to hear it. I am excited to go back to school- I know I will be super busy, working, and surrounded by people that I enjoy the company of. But until then, I fear that I am going to continue to be hung up on this guy. 

Thank y'all for your support. 

**TL;DR: A best friend of mine walked away in May due to a disagreement. After an apology and multiple attempts to fix things, he has made it pretty clear that he is not interested in doing so. How can I move on from someone that I care so deeply for and deal with these feelings of anger and disappointment?**"

I say this because right after the interview, the HR rep said it would take about 4 minutes for the ""head"" department to decide whether I was a good fit. 4 minutes passed and she said the job was mine.

(2) How did you get your previous jobs?
(3) What were your main responsibilities? Achievements?
(4) Are you currently employed?
(5) Are you willing to work flexible or long hours?

4sjm54,231,2016-07-12,TIFU by spending the past three years working on my own indie game,jslavi,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4sjm54/tifu_by_spending_the_past_three_years_working_on/,"Like most TIFUs this didn't actually happen today, but instead has been an ongoing tragedy for the past 3 years. 

The story begins five years ago when after playing around with Unity in 2011-2012 I produced an absolute shit game that somehow blew up and made me a few thousand dollars. For the 16 year old me, that was a ton of money – especially considering I made it all while doing something I really liked to do. It got into my head that if I were to make another less shit game, I would make absolutely incredible amount of cash. Plus, I thought I already knew how to make games (as I now had a bit of experience) so the second one wouldn't even take a couple years (on and off, around jobs and such) like the first.




So for the past two summers, I ended up spending about 3-4 months of 8 hour days on this new game. I worked on it after 8 hour days of a different job two summers ago. Then I decided to not get a job last summer to work on the game and go backpacking. Ended up torturing myself to get it done as I thought I'd stumbled upon the greatest puzzle game idea of all time. It didn't quite get finished last summer, but I thought I was so close so I worked on it during my winter break as well. So for that entire month instead of relaxing in the least, I spent at least 6 hours every day of the time finishing the game. Again, I thought I was super close to finishing and that I'd have it done by the time I'd get back to school. Well, this wasn't the case, of course, and when the stress of school set back in again, I put development on hold and decided that I would finally finish it off this summer and opt to not get any sort of real computer science internship again.


So about a month into this summer it was finished! I was hyped, finally I'd have a solid income. I finally posted the store page on Steam and I'd get three or four emails a day from youtubers asking me for press copies! I couldn't believe it! Finally all this work had paid off! Then a day came when I got an email from TotalBiscuit, I was over the moon, this game could not possibly be anything other than a success! I sent keys on keys on keys, was getting almost hyper waiting the release day.


Well, it finally was released and how many purchases were made you might ask? Less than 50. How many videos came out that day? About 2.


So now, almost a week later, I've come to realize that the success I had been fantasizing about for the past two years will not happen. 


Somehow I've got to tell all my friends that this thing they'd been hearing about for ages, that I'd spent about 8 months of 8 hour days on made me about 50 cents an hour. Somehow I've got to find a way to pay back my friend who loaned me a few hundred to make the game. And then I've got to convince myself that I'm not a complete failure.


I knew game development was hard to succeed with, but I thought that if you made a good, polished game you'd still make some money (and I suppose this is true, if some &gt; 0). What didn't occur to me until recently is that literally EVERY aspect of a game needs to be new and different for a game to have a chance at being successful. It is not enough to innovate a new mechanic or art style or marketing method, one needs to innovate in ALL of these directions to make solid splash – to be noteworthy as Alexander Bruce puts it. I was also stupid enough to get caught up in my own reality distortion field and opt not to put out free demos early on in development because I didn't want anyone to take my idea.


NOTE TO WANNABE INDIE DEVELOPERS:

To anyone out there who was considering becoming a game developer, don't be stupid about it like me. Post demos, post gifs, work in equal proportion to the feedback you get. Don't believe that you have a better idea about what people like than they do. 

TLDR: Spent 3 years and $2k making a silly computer game no one cares about, got to figure out how to pay bills and be happy about it."

Hopefully I'll manage to include scans within future voting forms, but not today.

&amp;nbsp;

A few thoughts: It's kinda neat that the artist (Mitsuhiro Arita) who illustrated the first Bulbasaur has also illustrated the most recent (English) Bulbasaur, as well as the most Bulbasaurs (tied with Ken Sugimori, who doesn't really count, since I'm sure all of those were just interns pasting stock art onto blurry photographs)

I was pretty surprised that Kagemaru Himeno, who's been illustrating cards since the start, didn't get a Bulbasaur until CG. I figured she'd have one long before that.

If anyone votes for the Pokemon Snap promo, I think you should strongly consider your life choices that led up to that moment."

So before I get to describing myself I want to say that there will be a tl;dr at the end as this post will be a bit long, but I would prefer you read the whole post before responding. I will start with honesty, I have talked to people that I really grew to like, that have completely ghosted me for no reason of my knowledge and I find myself here once those fade away because I have little idea on how to find someone in real life.

 I would also like to describe what I am looking for before I talk about myself, so that if you don’t fit the description or you don’t think it will be fun, you don’t waste your time. What I’m looking for is a guy between 20 and 25, most preferably my age, but within that range is fine. I would also greatly prefer if you live at least in my time zone. I don’t care too much about physical looks, but if I find you cute it does help. As for personality, I would love to have a person who is sweet, caring, flirty, but likes to joke around a bit, and likes to laugh at himself. I would also prefer if you were a “never ending conversation” type of person, where we talk pretty much all day every day. Although I am looking for someone to talk to a whole hell of a lot, I am not just looking for a guy to be in a thing with, falling into a good friendship is the best I can ask for with a post like this, and if that’s all it is, then I am completely fine with that.

Now, for the long part. As for me, personality wise, I can be a bit flirty, but I can also be a bit sarcastic and condescending, maybe even insulting (Although once I am told someone is bothered by something I say, I will not say it anymore. It would make me a complete dick if I didn’t stop lol.), but it’s all in good fun. I can also take jokes really well, maybe play a little ‘yes, and’ with them. I am also not past making fun of myself, or pretending to be overconfident and things like that, because if you can’t make fun of yourself, who can you make fun of? One things that puts people off about me is that I have a very morbid, and inappropriate, sense of humor. I can laugh at almost anything, and it has caused me to lose a lot of friendships. With all that being said, I am also really sensitive, and am always around to be a friend to anyone in need of it. My goal is to make everyone I become friends with feel like they are very important and special, because I know what it is like to not have a friend to talk to, and I don’t want anyone else to feel that way. 

When it comes to looks, I am a shorter kinda Hispanic woman (I am not really sure what to label myself when it comes to race or ethnicity.) At 5’2, I still stand out a bit, as my sass levels exceed my height. This may not be apparent when looking at a regular pic of just my face, but I am a bit overweight, and am working on my goal to lose a few (or maybe a bit more) pounds. I wear glasses and have almost shoulder length hair. I also almost always wear jeans and a t shirt, I am far more partial to comfort than I am to looking hot. I can provide pictures of myself once we get talking as well. 

As for things that I do and am interested in, there is a lot of things to list. I am almost always talking about my dogs, or dogs and cats I encounter at work, as I am an intern at a vet clinic, and am hoping to get a job at one soon as a vet tech. If you have any questions about how important spaying, neutering, and vaccinations for your pet are, I will be able to tell you, as I am very passionate about those topics. I love movies, I can pretty much watch movies from any genre, but horror will always be my favorite (extra points to people who get this far: tell me your favorite movie in your reply so I know you read basically the whole thing). There is something about being terrified that will always make me feel great once a movie is over. Another thing I absolutely love is music, I listen to a lot of different thing, but most of my favorite bands/artists are things most people I meet don’t know about. I love to read, at the moment my two favorite authors are Chuck Palahniuk and Joe Hill, but I am getting more into Lovecraft and Stephen King. There is a lot of other things I like and am interested in, but those come out in random conversation. 

**tl;dr sarcastic, chubby, vet tech, horror fan needs new friends, possibly more. PM me with a description of yourself and your age, and I will only get back to you if you provide those things, at least. I have kik or we can talk here (although I may take a bit to reply here), so add your info for one or more of those to your PM.**"

4skomu,0,2016-07-12,"[22/M] Met awesome girl [20/F] with mutual friends, but not sure how to get closer without seeming like a creep",DGwizkid,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4skomu/22m_met_awesome_girl_20f_with_mutual_friends_but/,"To put it simply, I haven't had a real relationship with anybody for a while, and almost feel like I don't really feel like I know how to start a new one. Last time I got close to another girl, things got weird, partly because I knew that her personality and mine were not a good mix for dating (I have a weird knack for instantly reading personalities according to my friends) but I decided to fight my gut feeling on it for a while, and it almost ruined our friendship.  To make matters worse, I lost many of my friends after a friend made a suicide attempt that drove us apart (I realize this seems backwards, it did bring us together, but after he left town it fell apart. The event was like shattering a vase, you can glue it back together, but it was never going to be as strong again).  before its asked, the wounds are long healed, scars (insecurities with making new friends) still show up from time to time (usually with the opposite gender, go figure).

Anyway, working an internship at a large company, meet this girl that my (newer) friends [20/M for both] have apparently known for a few years, and kinda got the feeling that at the very least she is the kind of person that would be a great friend, if not more. I'm finding it hard to strike up conversations though, since we don't have the chance to talk much, but every conversation feels genuine, not like an obligatory response to a friend of a friend. Part of my struggle is that I currently feel like conversations are all being started by me, which is leaving me feeling like a bit of a creep.

Additionally, we attend the same large University, and are even in the same program, but I am 4 semesters ahead of her, so while we will not be in classes together, we will be seeing each other at school.

So if any of you have advice on this, I would greatly appreciate it! I hope I made my point clear that all I am after is a stronger friendship for now. I'm listing a few more facts about my personality below. 

Also, before you say something along the lines of don't date co-workers, my company has almost 9000 employees working in this city spread throughout. I only see 1 of the hundreds of other interns at work as well. As I said, it's a big company.

personality things: I'm not a shy guy, but I am quiet. I'm a very independent person, not needing the satisfaction of others to be content, but I'm also a very compassionate and caring guy, and have no problem listening to my friend's problems and trying to help them.  Also, I tend to get along better with women/girls, than I do with guys, usually because of my personality, but after an old friend's suicide attempt, the opposite has sort of been true as I feel nervous around people for the fear of losing a friend. I also tend to be that guy that gets asked ""Why weren't you there"", to which the response is usually ""nobody told me about it""

TL;DR: Friend [20/F] of friends has genuine conversations with me [22/M], but usually all started by me, not sure how to pursue closer friendship with such an awesome person without remaining 1 sided/me feeling like a creep."
4skr51,7,2016-07-12,Leaving internship early to graduate on time,choirconductor,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4skr51/leaving_internship_early_to_graduate_on_time/,"Hey all,

So I recently accepted a 6-month co-op/internship with a company in my area and I have come into a bit of a bind. I like the company so far, but a few things have come up that are making me want to leave earlier than the norm (3 months).

1) Most importantly, my college adviser recently informed me that one of the classes I would need for graduating will overlap with my internship. I did not know this when I accepted the offer. If I don't take this class next quarter, I will graduate at least a year later than if I leave work to take it.

2) I was recently looking through our company network and found the offer letter given to the other intern that was hired right after me. This intern is coming into his sophomore year while I am going into my senior year. My manager clearly expressed to me that the work the other intern would be doing would be a fair bit easier than what I was tasked with (since he had no analysis or higher-level course background). This intern has maybe done half of the work I have in approximately the same amount of time (no fault of his since I have worked in industry before) and spends most of his time watching training videos. The offer letter revealed that we are being paid the exact same rate, and with my lengthy commute and need to pay rent to stay in the area, I am effectively not being compensated as well... In addition to this, this intern was only hired for two months. I don't want to sound entitled here, but I feel like I'm being kind of undervalued due to the fact that I've already had internships (which have paid more) and team experience in the past.

3) I was recently admitted into an option program (controls engineering) that I am very interested in. Much more interested in than the work that I am currently doing. If I do end up staying in the internship, I would be unable to do this program at all before graduating, since the order of classes is fixed.

4) The company just does not seem like a good fit for me. The people are nice, but the work is not what I would like to do for a career.

I really don't know what to do here guys. I signed up for a 6-month gig, but it was at-will, so I am technically allowed to quit whenever I want. That said, I don't want to tell my manager that I'm leaving the day of and screw over my team. On the other hand, I don't want to tell them now and be stuck with managers that are mad at me for the rest of my internship. Would I be in the wrong if I left for the reasons listed above?"
4sksfk,0,2016-07-12,"Crush on a Girl for Two Years, Don't Know What to Do",aah-whatever,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/4sksfk/crush_on_a_girl_for_two_years_dont_know_what_to_do/,"Hey. I'm gonna be honest this is the first thing I've ever posted on reddit. I don't even know what I really want; vent, rant, cry, seek sympathy. I guess some advice would be nice but I don't know. I guess I just want new ears to hear me bitch about stuff since I'm sure my other friends are sick of this. This'll probably be long, so I'm sorry. 


So i just finished my sophomore year as a film major at a college in New York City, and I've had this horrible, intense crush on a girl (lets call her Genny (short for Genevieve cause I like that name but don't like typing it)) for two years. We were in the same film major dorm for freshman year. I met her during welcome week and kind of just sort of fell for her. She's really pretty, warm, and incredibly sweet (on the surface at least). She has all the sex appeal of a puppy with blonde hair. We've been doing the same clubs for those two years, and have been fairly good friends. We've gotten lunch and dinner several times, been in several of the same classes, and been generally friendly. Now, she's pretty universally considered attractive. There are plenty of other guys who hit on her, flirt with her, and it tears me up inside to see it happen. I don't know how receptive to these advances she has been (my guess is not really, since she's pretty innocent, considering she's in college), but it still ruins me to see all these more confident men hit on her (especially since there really aren't all that suave about it. our College is kind of filled with those guys who are afraid to be forward (as anna kendrick would say, Genny is ""hottest-girl-in-your-improv-class hot"")). 


Now, being the social moron that I am, I have not confessed my true feelings for her. I understand that that would probably be very off-putting to her, but sometimes I feel that I just need to treat it like a bandaid and pull it off. But I'm probably not gonna do that since it would probably make it too awkward to continue the clubs we're in, and those are pretty much the only times I'm ever social at all.


I have asked her out a few times, but she is super flakey. One time, on a saturday, she actually asked me out to ""din din"" (like I said, sex appeal of a puppy) that monday, and of course I said ""yes"". But on Monday, I found out via snapchat that she was with her roommate to see a show in Manhattan. She didn't even acknowledge it the next day at the club, and I had to bring it up via text message. She didn't even apologize. 


I tried to ask her out to a screening of some oscar movie a couple months later, and she said yes at the time, only to withdraw later in the week, citing a busy shooting schedule for a TV project she was working on. But she sent me a series of five texts pleading to go the next weekend, swearing to not bail out. So I accepted, and lo and behold, she cancelled again, citing the TV show. It pretty much destroyed me, and I resolved to try not interact with her that much afterwards cause Im awkward as fuck and don't know how to deal with that. 


I've gone back and forth on whether or not she shares my feelings. There are the above incidents, of course, but she's also been incredibly caring and friendly to me, always stopping to talk when we see each other. She's been a shoulder to lean on in the past when my depression and anxiety really showed up (she's been the cause of most of it but I haven't told her that). She always says hi in class, is super playful around me, has sat next to me and put her head on my shoulder in the past. She even asked me to be her valentine last year ( i didn't really do anything because I didn't know how serious she was, but in hindsight I think she was pretty sincere). 


So, yeah, I don't know what to do. If I could I would list every interaction we've ever had together and get you guys to analyze it, but that'd be way to draining for me. Last time I had any sort of conversation with her, she texted we should get together some time over the summer. a couple of days later she sent me a snapchat of her dog in her dress. a couple of days ago my anxiety about her resurfaced because she moved into an apartment in the city (I live in NYC btw) working at an internship that is way better than mine. So yeah. 


I don't know what to do. I'm still as infatuated with her as ever, but I've been demoralized by our last couple of encounters (the standing up of me by her, to be exact). I don't know. Does she like me back? like me only as a friend? merely just put up with me? Should I contact her again? tell her my feelings? its really been tearing me up these past two years. 


TL;DR: Intense crush on a really nice girl, getting mixed signals, it's eating me up.


Sorry this is so long. Please be as honest as possible. Do I still have a shot? should I get in touch with her? Should I just try and forget it, accept it as an impossible pipe dream? If that's the case, do you have any advice on how to move on from such an intense crush?

4skv4y,170,2016-07-12,Sherry thinks I'm a whore,Spiffynikki13,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/4skv4y/sherry_thinks_im_a_whore/,"All is quiet right now, exDH's girls are at summer camp, exDH is being run over almost daily by the karma bus, I got to fill in the girls' counselor and case worker in the situation with SD1 nearly murdering SD2 (see bitch bot). Generally life is good at the moment, so I'll regale you with a tale from a little over two years ago.  

A little background: this was after a large drama filled holiday blow up (just the way Sherry likes it), and right as my then fiance was starting an important and prestigious internship.  The holiday explosion deserves it's own post, but suffice to say Sherry finally revealed to all how badly she hates me and was trying to let everyone know what a whore I was and how I was such a bad person. 

 She took it on herself to message my best friend, who is am ex girlfriend of exDH and happened to be the matron of honor at my wedding. Of course my bestie   immediately sent screenshots ofeverything to me.  There were accusations of child abuse, neglect, trying to keep the girls days dad from them,  being a poor housekeeper, living in filth (neither I nor ex was living there through the week and the cat's litter box was dirty when she let herself in to snoop around), and myriad other things.   

The one that took the cake though, that made me not murder her then and there was the one I'm about to relay to you fine folks. It actually made me crack up because it revealed the depths of her insanity.  I'm going to copy and paste, and only remove some names. 

**Just please be careful of her BEST FRIEND . FIL and I are going to talk to CLOSE OLDER MALE FRIENDS OF SPIFFY and let them know they are just around her for a few hrs. and don't know the real SPIFFY. She loves to be around men. Before the fight she stood outside here and talked with all the men who were talking with a politician for nearly 2 hrs. and there were several women inside and she didn't come in until the girls' Aunt came in and only then to see if SPIFFY'S DD got anything from her.  You know where are all of her friends in MY HOMETOWN? Why would she choose you and OTHER LOCAL FRIEND to be in her  wedding and not some of her friends from  HOMETOWN? She never talks about any of her old friends except guys. Makes you wonder?**

Truthfully, 99% of my friends were guys.  Still are.  Apparently that, and LORD FORBID talking to a politician with the men instead of sitting inside with the women and knowing my place make me a whore.  She never came right out and said that, but a blind person could read between those lines.  

When Sherry and FIL went around there community with their smear campaign (and they did. Seriously.  We're talking knocking on doors like they were spreading a religion, only it was ""Have you heard about Spiffy? She's a child neglecting whore and she's stealing our son, we'd like you to hate her too.""), they mostly got laughed at or sent away, and the few that listened didn't matter to exDH and I anyway.  

Anyway she's batshit and I'm glad I'm done with her."
4sl560,3,2016-07-12,"Bad first impression at work, now I may get fired.",ThrowAwayAccount0712,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4sl560/bad_first_impression_at_work_now_i_may_get_fired/,"I am a college student interning at a research lab I found via an online application that was sent to many labs/workplaces looking for interns in my field. I had to move across the country for this internship and I had a lot of trouble finding housing for the summer. I ended up staying with a friend of a friend for the first month while I waited for my first paycheck to be able to start renting a room.

My housing situation and not having a car has meant that my arrival time at work has been a bit varied. I kept the people in my lab updated about my situation and was told that as long as I showed up before 9am, I would be okay. I have complied with this with the exception of two times when my scheduled ride cancelled last minute and I had to request an uber. Both time I showed up around 9:45 (and I called as soon as I realized I would be late). Now I am in a stable housing position with a consistent ride and everything should be okay.

The trouble is that my mentor, (also supervisor) was not around for the first few weeks of my internship and was not a part of the initial conversation when I explained my situation and was given permission to arrive at 9am. I thought she had been informed about all of this but I learned only last week that she hadn't been told much of anything (or at least, that's what she says). The first week she was here, I consistently showed up before 9am, and then the second week was when I had the two instances when I showed up after 9am. She called me into my office and stressed the importance of showing up on time. I apologized and assured her that I would be on time in the future.

And now we come to this week. My ride overslept yesterday morning and I had to call and wake him up. I called my lab to let them know I would be late and showed up at 9:30am. Then last night I was up sick all night with a stomach bug and still felt horrible this morning and would definitely not have been able to work today. I emailed my mentor from my phone and apologized for not being able to come and explained I was sick. She thanked me for letting her know and said that she hopes I feel better. But this afternoon, I got a call from one of the other interns to let me know that our mentor was talking openly about firing me if I keep ""pulling stunts like this"". 

I don't know what to do or how to prove to my mentor that I'm not a slacker. I have tried to go above and beyond with my work, making sure reports and presentations have been high quality, and working through lunch occasionally when there was a lot to do. I have stayed till 5:30pm everyday and been the last one in the lab and locked up every time. This isn't my first internship and so I know how to find work-related activities and side projects to keep me busy during slow days (organizing supply closet, updating inventory, etc all with approval from lab personnel).

I have never had an experience with an employer who has such a negative opinion of me. From what I can tell, the only thing that I have done that has warranted this is showing up late. And I have done everything that I can to fix that.

I am planning on meeting with her tomorrow to talk about all of this (I won't let her know I was tipped off by the other intern) but I don't know how to repair the damage that's been done. If the quality of my work isn't enough to convince her, I'm not sure what is. And while I'd like to be able to promise that I'll show up at 8:30am on the dot, I can't get a ride in that early and the bus system would either get me to work at 7am (before anyone else is there) or 9:45am. And there isn't much I can do if my ride is late like he was this week (the only time he has done this).

I know that there are things I could have done earlier like getting a loan from my parents to get better housing sooner or paying more for a location with a better bus route but I can't change those things now. I would really appreciate any advice you have for my meeting with my mentor. "

The driver was driving the incorrect direction on the freeway. It was about 11 PM and I was driving home from a family dinner. The driver and I collided almost head-on (slightly more on the left side of my car). Another car was swiped by the driver as well. The driver was given a DWI and is obviously at fault in the accident. My car was totaled and I have a concussion and sprained neck. The pain and soreness has definitely been getting worse than it initially was after the accident. This was absolutely one of the scariest things to happen to me, and I am so lucky to be okay. I am in my early 20s, and I have never been in any sort of car accident before. I filed the incident with my insurance asap after the accident. However, it's been almost three days since the accident, and I haven't been contacted by the other driver's insurance. My insurance hasn't asked me for a statement yet. I am currently without a car and I really do need one, and I read that I should be able to receive a rental car via the other party's insurance. And, I am a grad student with two internships and classes, so this whole experience is causing me tons of stress in terms of missing obligations and falling behind in my work. I've spent some time researching the next steps and the process, but I usually find that reddit sometimes is typically the most informative and helpful resource. So, I would love any advice, information, tips, or recommendations as to what I should be aware of, what I should be doing, and how I proceed. Thanks in advance!"

He also suggested the actress chosen for this story, so feel free to thank him for that. I tried posting on Literotica, however, it was denied because apparently you cannot post a story about non-consensual sex with a celebrity, so a text post will have to work. Currently working on other stories. Criticism is appreciated. What actress do you want to get the Freeuse treatment?*


We started filming the new “X-Men” film about two months ago, however, today is the first day that Jennifer Lawrence is coming in for her role as Mystique. It was decided earlier on that we would film the parts where she looks like herself first. Once those were finished, we could begin to put her in the Mystique outfit and make-up as soon as she gets onto the set. That was a little disappointing to some of the male crew, myself included. One of the best parts of the last film was watching Jennifer run around in the skintight blue suit, those perfect tits bouncing beautifully. Whenever we knew we had to film a scene with Jennifer as Mystique, we would make sure the set was nice and cold; try to get her nipples to peek through a little. That wouldn’t really work out today.


The last “X-Men” movie, however, was filmed in a different time. Since then, the United States became the first country to enact the “Free-to-Use” laws, or, as people started calling them, the “Free-to-Fuck” laws. So maybe today someone would get luckier than just seeing Jennifer’s nipple through a blue spandex suit. Hell, maybe even me.


The “Free-to-Use” laws enabled men to use woman for sexual gratification, whenever and wherever they wanted. They could use the woman how they wanted, and it could be whomever they wanted. When it came to the film industry, however, there was a general rule upheld by most directors. They believed when the camera was rolling, no one fucked the performers. They always said, “Let them finish the scene before you finish on them”.  Seemed like an easy enough task, although I know that’ll be difficult once we have to film her in her Mystique outfit.


My job on set was as a production assistant. Long story short, I got assigned a lot of different duties in my position. Today my main goals were to make sure the actors are where they should be and are ready when they should be. When we begin a take I will focus on supervising the set and guaranteeing nothing interferes with it. It sounds like a relatively simple job, however my responsibilities don’t stop there. The rest is more technical, and far less interesting. Right now, I was getting ready to great Jennifer when she arrived, inform her on the production schedule, and lead her to her trailer.


A black sedan pulled into the lot next to the trailers we had brought into the city (we were filming on location today so we brought trailers for the actors as well as for make-up, wardrobe, and set pieces). I just waited patiently a few feet away, watching my own reflection in the tinted windows. The door opened and a woman stepped out.


I had forgotten how beautiful she was since the last time I saw her. As she walked towards me I just admired her beauty. Jennifer’s shoulder-length blonde hair fell loosely around her face. She wore black combat boots, black jeans that hugged her beautiful legs and ass, and a grey tank top that brought out her perfect 32C breasts beautifully. She walked toward me, swaying her hips slightly with a big grin on her face. I had to readjust at the sight of her.


“It’s good to see you again Ms. Lawrence!” I chirped, trying to stay as professional as possible.


“It may have been a few years, but you can still call me Jennifer,” she laughed, that infectious, adorable laugh.


I reflected her happy mood, smiling and saying, “Right, you know how the job is though, always have to be professional. I worked with Angelina Jolie before and she insisted I only ever call her Mrs. Jolie, or do not address her at all.”


Jennifer reached me and greeted me with a hug.


“Yeah I’ve met her, she can be a real bitch,” Jennifer replied, a comical tone still in her voice.


We both laughed then turned towards the trailers.


I played with her tits through her tank top as we walked. I felt her nipples harden a little, then remembered I should I tell her about her schedule. “So today we have a tight schedule. I know you’ve run through the script already, however the director wants to make sure you deliver it the way he wants it. You’ll be with him for brunch while you run through the lines at 11. He said he would pick you up outside your trailer.” I switched my hand to her ass and continued, “Then you’ll go to wardrobe and make-up at 1; we are looking to start shooting before 3, and then we will see where it goes from there. Obviously if you have any questions come see me. If anything changes I’ll let you know. Your trailer is this way.”


“Oh wow, busy day” Jennifer said jokingly. Everything she said was light-hearted and playful, something I always found irresistible about her. We arrived at her trailer.


“Here it is” I gestured.


She smiled at me. “Thank you so much! I’ll see you on set!”


I gave her nipple a final squeeze, and then let Jennifer go into her trailer. I began making my way to the set. While she is at brunch I’ll do a run down of the set and see if anyone has anything else for me to do until shooting. If not, I’ll find an intern or assistant to fuck. Jennifer’s perfect body gave me a hard on I needed to get rid of.


I ran into Jennifer again on her way back from brunch. I had been so busy while she was gone I hadn’t gotten the time to blow some steam off. By the way her make-up and hair looked, I realized the director wasn’t worried about the way she would deliver a line. He must’ve poured something over her tank top because it had become completely see through. Her nipples could also be seen prominently; they were still hard. I felt myself get hard.


“Jennifer!” I called out. “Hey how was brunch?”


She smiled the beautiful smile again, however this time it seemed a bit mischievous. “Not as boring as I thought it would be!” Then she added, “Also not as filling”. She laughed to herself.


I laughed too, catching what she meant. Seeing her like this, I couldn’t help myself any longer. Luckily she had finished up with “brunch” early, she didn’t have to be in wardrobe for another 40 minutes, and I had some time to spare as well. I got right up to her and started groping her breasts. She let her eyes close while she sighed.


No one on set stopped what they were doing. Everyone had become accustomed to the constant public sex that came with the Free-to-fuck laws. I moved my hands down to her jeans a unbuttoned them, slipping my right hand down the front of her panties. Jennifer sighed again and I brought my lips to her neck, kissing and licking and (softly) biting. She let out a small moan.


My right hand began to work her clit through her panties, while my left played with her tits more. I could feel how wet she already was through her, what felt like, lace panties. My lips were still at her neck. I could hear her moan softly as she subtly grinded against my hand. Wait, wasn’t I the one that was supposed to get off?


I removed my hands and lips from her body. Jennifer gave me a look of wonder, wanting so badly for me to keep groping her body. I lifted the top over her head and revealed her tits. I popped her nipple in my mouth and tongued it, feeling it get hard, hearing her sigh; I was already so hard. I moved my mouth once again and began to unbuckle my jeans.


I took Jennifer’s hand and placed it on my cock. She quickly removed it from my boxers and fell down beside it. She began to lick it down the length. She went up and down before resting at the head. Jennifer lapped at the head of my cock with her tongue while her hand massaged my balls. She was amazing, but I was tired of teasing.


Jennifer put her mouth around the head of my cock and began blowing me. She went up and down with impressive pace, using her tongue like an expert.  I grabbed a handful of her blonde hair and started facefucking her, for what seemed to be the second time that day. I felt my cock pound the back of her throat and relished that feeling. I looked down and noticed she had begun masturbating as she sucked me off. I could feel her moan around my cock; the vibrations making everything feel even more amazing. Before I exploded in her mouth, I had to know the feeling of her pussy. I pulled out of her mouth and brought her up to her feet.


I told her to turn around and she obliged. I ripped her jeans down with her panties and admired her shapely ass. Other than her pants around her ankles, she was completely naked. I slapped it hard, eliciting a cute squeal from her. I pushed her lower back so she would be bent at the waist. Jennifer’s beautiful pussy was staring right at me now. I rubbed it and spread her juices all around. She had become so wet; she must’ve been enjoying this. I slipped a finger into her and she cooed. Yeah she was definitely enjoying this. I inserted a second finger in Jennifer, still moving in and out, listening for her reactions, listening for the wet sounds her pussy was making. I looked around a realized a small crowd had begun to form around us. Dave, another production assistant who had been watching for some time, approached us. I didn’t stop my pace.


“Although I love the show,” he began, “Shouldn’t she be getting to wardrobe?”


“Not until 1, I thought she had some time to spare,” a moan escaped Jennifer, interrupting what I was saying. I swiftly slapped her ass for it, making her walls clench against my fingers.


I noticed Dave was hard and had an idea. “She has a free mouth, care to join in?” I asked him.


He looked ecstatic. He began unbuckling his pants before answering me. “Hell yes!”


He took out his cock and got in front of the vulnerable, horny, moaning Jennifer. I removed my fingers and spread her juices over my shaft. I rubbed the head over her pussy lips, before stopping right in front of her entrance. I grabbed her waist and plunged into until my I could feel her juices on my balls. Jennifer moaned loudly, a guttural, animalistic moan. As she did, Dave shoved his cock deep in her throat at the same time. I pulled out until only my head was in her, then thrust all the way back in. She moaned again, however Dave’s member muffled it. I was slow at first, gentle. Letting her just enjoy the sensations, until I got tired of that.


I started thrusting in her harder, faster. Jennifer moaned around the cock in her mouth, my pounding only making her facefucking even more brutal. Her eyeliner ran and saliva coated the bottom of her face. Her pussy felt like heaven; one of the tightest in the industry.


Dave began facefucking her faster, grabbing the sides of her head and ramming his cock in. He was getting close. With one last thrust he quickly pulled out and sprayed cum over her face. I felt her pussy pulse around my cock. Jennifer’s orgasm rang out as he let stream after stream cascade onto her cheeks, forehead, lips, and even her tongue. She licked her lips and swallowed his cum.


“What a well trained bitch!” Dave said as Jennifer began to clean his cock with her mouth. When she was done Dave returned it to his pants, thanked me for sharing, and went back to work.


I continued to fuck her, grabbing the back of her hair as I pounded ruthlessly. Jennifer continued to moan in pleasure as I brought her closer to her second orgasm, and me to my first.


“Oh fuck, please please please” Jennifer moaned.


I brought her head up to mine, not stopping my assault on her pussy. “Please, what?” I whispered into her ear.


“Please fuck me hard!! Please make me cum!” Jennifer screamed. That was enough for me.


I increase the pace of my thrusts, grunting as I raced towards my orgasm. She began moaning with every thrust, her head bobbing as she did. She was so close, her hips grinding on me as I felt myself on the edge. I squeezed her nipple with my one hand and rubbed her clit with the other. That sent her over the edge. Jennifer let out a high-pitched scream as her orgasm rocked her around my cock. She completely lost control as her orgasm her over. I couldn’t hold myself in any longer. I thrust myself as deep as I could go and came. Her pussy clenched around my member, practically milking it all out. Her moans echoed across the set, causing multiple people to look over. Some had even begun to fuck as they watched us. Jennifer continued to shake and vibrate as the orgasm continued for what seemed like 15 minutes. I slipped out of her and buckled my pants.


Jennifer reached down to put her pants back on, showing the crowd the cum spilling out of her. She stood up straight, albeit wobbly, put her shirt back on, and turned to me. There was still cum splattered all over her face and her make-up was a mess. She looked like a sexy dream. If I wasn’t completely drained I would push her down and facefuck her myself.


“So, I’ll see you around the set?” She chimed with a smile, pushing a glob of cum with her finger from her cheek to her mouth. Fuck, this chick was dirty.


“I hope so,” I replied, returning the smile.


I watched Jennifer walk back to her trailer, swaying her hips sensually like she did earlier. ‘Fuck’ I thought, ‘I love my job’.

I started playing PokemonGo in Brussels as well; it has allowed me to be able to find cool monuments that I would have never noticed before/learn the names of the places/quick facts. I also have been meeting others who have been playing/walking around while getting exercise. 

My internship is going great; I am meeting new people, making connections, and learning a lot. I'm now looking into a PhD program in Denmark so that my husband and I can eventually move over here.

I'm a math major (applied &amp; computational to be exact) and I do love my major.
However, recently I've been doing an internship in the IT field and realized this kind of stuff is not really what I want to do. This got me  thinking about my real passions, what really makes my heart race and I think it's fashion.
I'm no designer, but I spend every waking moment of my time when I'm not working / studying thinking of my next outfit and going to boutiques and department stores to look at clothes. 
Is there any way for me to step into the fashion industry after graduation? I don't want to give up math, and I don't want to design but I cannot give up on either and I want to explore.

Thank you so much in advance for your input!! Anything helps :)"

I'm a math major (applied &amp; computational) and just finished my junior year of college. I'm currently doing an internship at an IT company and honestly, it sucks for several reasons:
1. I am not very fond of programming, I like it when I combine it with other factors (like math modeling) but right now I'm coding all day long and I'm not into it at all.
2. There is no interactions with other people. I am extroverted and I need lots of communication - meetings, presentations, etc. However, I'm in an office for developers that is physically separated from the HQ.

This is really stressing me out and I have a month left (it was supposed to be for 3 months). I feel like if I continue with it I'm going to be burnt out before returning for senior year. I have two questions :

1. Should I or should I not quit now? It is obviously not acceptable but how unacceptable is this and how is this going to affect my resume / job search in the future?
2. I realized I don't want a job where I just sit at an office every single day. I've always assumed that is what I would be doing after graduation, but this experience made me realize that that's not going to happen. I've redirected my career search to consulting or government positions. Do you think this is a good idea? If not, what are other fields as a math major that I can go into that is dynamic?

4smg78,509,2016-07-13,"Recently graduated, my advice to Computer Science majors",sfst4i45fwe,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4smg78/recently_graduated_my_advice_to_computer_science/,"This sub-reddit has helped me tremendously when it came to making the right decisions while in school. I just want to share what worked for me and give back a little.

**Do I have to go to a top tier school?**  
Not necessarily,  but make sure to go to one that is near a tech hub. Universities that are near tech hubs attract employers. I'm talking San Francisco, Seattle, Santa Monica, New York... Employers like to hire locally, and a lot of them want fresh grads so they go to the nearby universities. My education cost me less than 20k and was not the best school, but I was lucky enough to have a lot of tech companies show up at the career fairs. That being said, if you have the funds and the grades, absolutely go to top tier schools - as all the big tech companies will send recruiters there regardless of location. 

**What should I focus my time on?**  
Do not take Data Structures and Algorithms courses for granted. I went through a LOT of interviews, and that was the one topic that employers seem to care about more than anything else. Interviewing is a numbers game, you never know exactly what they will ask, so your best bet is to learn what is most likely to be asked. Could some guy toss an assembly question? Sure, but highly unlikely. Will you be asked to print every permutation of 'abcd' or some sorting problem? Much more likely. Take those courses seriously, and start doing programming questions asap. Consider the programming interviews to be your equivalent of a law school bar exam. Get a book, learn the crap out of every problem. Then do it again. Redo problems so you retain what you learn. Asides from that, work on programming projects, internships. Get work experience.

**Grades vs Projects**  
Maintain a 3.0+ GPA so you do not get weeded out, then focus on projects. I was never asked any questions about my grades or GPA - however I was constantly asked about my experiences with extra curricular programming projects. Every. Single. Interview was about my projects. Not only do projects fill up your resume, but projects give you the programming experience you need to have stories. Stories asked by an interviewer like: ""Tell me about a time you had to do X,Y,Z and how did you do it?"" or ""Tell me about a time when someone did something and there was a conflict how did you handle it blablabla"". No projects means no stories, no stories means you will not appear experienced to the interviewer. I did not have an internship under my bag, but I had tons of projects, an active github account, and people who benefited from my projects and could vouch for it. These stories are extremely difficult to make up on the spot, but easy once you have a few projects under your belt. The difference between my first round of interviews 1.5 years ago and the second round 4 months ago was that I now had stories - like the time I spent 4 hours on some bug, or when I helped solve a problem in some clever way, or what the strengths and weaknesses of a language I used were... I'm rambling. But you get the idea.

**Where can I find those so-called ""projects""?**  
Asides from personal projects, take a look at Electrical, Mechanical, Computer Engineering departments. A lot of them have group projects, sometimes funded by a company, and managed by faculty. At my school there were a handful of them to choose from, ranging from robotics, race-cars, brain-wave scans, to shoe box sized cube satellites. Don't forget to join the computer science clubs. There is a major shortage of programmers willing to work for free... the projects are there you just have to ask around.

**How many interviews did you fail until you got a job.**  
Let me preface this by saying that I was picky. I could have accepted a job early and settled - but I did not. I had a Google interview, and Google motivated me to study my ass off for 3 months. I failed it. I failed Amazon, Epic, M.S., and tons of others. I accidentally said ""shit"" at my M.S. interview. I took things personally. I got mad at the constant coding homework problems. I gave up on great job offers due to location - hoping I did not make a mistake for months. Speaking of mistakes, I basically made every mistake in the book. But in the end I found a company I liked, and by then I had enough experience failing that I did not care. After a while you realize that there is always another company, another interview. At that interview I cracked a few jokes, forgot to do my hair, nailed every programming problem, got the offer 2 days later. Just like soccer, reading, or playing piano, interviewing is a skill. You learn from your mistakes, you learn what to say and what not to say. Eventually you will realize that those guys interviewing you have not been studying interviewing questions for the last 4 months. You will realize you are probably smarter than them in that department and they just happen to know the answer so they sound smart. Practice makes perfect.

Anyways, just my 2 cents. I hope this helps somebody out there.

TL;DR: Projects &gt; Grades. Location matters.


EDIT: I just want to point out that this is what worked for me. I highly recommend work experience as an intern as well. While I did not necessarily go the path of being an intern, I don't want this post to come off as ""Projects &gt; Internships"". IMO they are both extremely important and should be pursued while in school."

Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

---------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up (would love her to look like Madison Ivy)

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S also looking to role play Marvel/DC, Game Of Thrones, The Witcher and Mass Effect

Sometimes all of the above.  But I'm in my late twenties, attractive and athletically built.  Everyone notices me when I hobble in, even walking with a limp I cut a striking figure at six-foot-two, with close cut brown hair, a light tan and sparking green eyes.  And, most important to our story, a totally-fucked-up right knee.  A backyard rugby match got a bit rowdy and I ended up with a torn ACL.  Fantastic.

So now I'm spending two evenings a week at the clinic, doing frustratingly simple exercises in an effort to slowly rehabilitate myself.  My girlfriend isn't thrilled that she's on her own for dinner those nights, but what can I do?  It's not like I can just walk it off.  So I'm kind of stuck with this, at least for the time being.

But I've missed the obvious question in all of this.  Who are you?  Are you a high school intern, hoping for some valuable experience during the summer break?  Perhaps you're my therapist, who finds herself tempted to push the boundaries of acceptable treatment?  Or maybe you're a fellow patient, some MILF-esque hottie who twisted her arm at tennis and hasn't gotten to play with balls for some time.  

You'll have to tell me.  I'm just sitting here in the waiting room, my nose in my phone, not contemplating the fact that I'm about to get a hell of a lot more out of my $30.00 copay than I ever imagined.

I've also fallen into a pretty awesome group of other interns to hang out with at lunch and company events. There are four of us, 3 dudes and one girl. Turns out the girl and I are both computer science majors at the same school and we even had a class together last semester and didn't even know it (large school = large classes) so it's easy to miss people. 

To get to the point, I really like this girl. She's intelligent, we have common interests, she's not the entitled ""I'm a woman in computer science"" type, and she's hot too. So is it worth it to try and take her out/date her even if that would endanger the friend group? What's been your experience dating people in the workplace?

It's an online program that, per the curriculum, seems to be a decent education for someone who is interested in working as an embedded hardware engineer or something of that nature. But Devry is very expensive and I've heard bad things about them. I recommended that he go to ASU and pursue a real Electrical Engineering degree. The curriculum, as far as I know, is similar to what Devry is offering but more in-depth with cooler projects. Not to mention that I think ASU looks better on a resume, especially since he would like to intern at Intel...which apparently hires a lot of people from ASU.

ASU would be around $10,000 cheaper than Devry. Both are expensive, but he's committed to paying off the student loans as quickly as possible once he graduates. I'm trying to position him for success, and I think ASU is the better option for him. He likes to work with his hands and he is interested in electronics. He likes the concept of writing code for hardware, especially things like Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

I was wondering if Devry really is that bad, and if ASU is much better. For the cost and for the future opportunities of having either on the resume. Does it matter where he goes, as long as he does side projects and learns a lot on his own and markets himself well? Would companies like Intel see Devry on a resume and throw it in the trash? 

Would be very grateful to anyone who has any experience at either Devry or ASU, and especially with their online programs and post-graduation success."

I knew about the conversations with my younger self every ten years (everyone did it), and fortunately with the help of therapy and medication I lasted until I was 20.

I woke up, eager to see what word I would have on my arm. Looking down, I saw what would keep me going for at least another ten years: ""LIVE"".

From that moment forward, I did my best to keep a positive attitude. Through college I volunteered at every chance, and though it took me a while, I eventually graduated with a degree. My parents were thrilled, and things were looking up. I got an internship at a local start-up, started dating a girl I knew from school, and would make sure to look at my arm at least once a day, as though to say ""I will.""

When I was 26, my girlfriend dumped me. It hurt more than you could imagine, and the depression came back in full force. It affected my job, and I was eventually let go. I wound up moving back in with my parents, which didn't help anything but I had little choice in the matter.

There were several times I thought about ending it all. But every time, I would look down at my arm and see that four-letter word that always kept me going. Thinking on it, I realized I would be in a better place in my 30s, enough so that I would make sure I'd use the one word to keep my past self alive to see it.

Things turned around again when I was 28. I got a new, much better job, and could finally afford a really nice one-bedroom apartment in the city. My colleagues and I got along great, and I wound up dating a coworker's roommate for a while. It didn't last, but I was back out there again, feeling better. The depression retracted, albeit slowly, but it was enough to get me to 30. Seeing my 20-year-old self, I simply instructed him to live.

The next day I woke with a smile, pleased with my conversation to help my past self and obsessively curious as to what new word I'd have on my arm this time.

Only, there wasn't one."
4snqnf,36,2016-07-13,Fixing: Zoolander 2,HollandGW215,fixingmovies,https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/4snqnf/fixing_zoolander_2/,"Ok bare with me!


Walked out of Zoolander 2 and I can't help but feel annoyed. The movie was god awful and a soulless cash in. It was like the writers did not even watch the original. The first movie was so clever, funny, and most importantly....satirical! This was just.....bad. So here is my idea, hope you like it.


So, here is my take. Its a rough idea. I personally think funny movies that are realsitic and relatable are a lot better than just stupid shit like ""uses his arms to paddle away from an ocean"" (which btw happened in the movie)

-------------

So the movie starts out with Derek as a fashion designer after his stint as a model. He and Hansel have built this amazing fashion company. They are partners.  Jerry Stiller even works there as a modeling agent. There are the leading designers of fashion and have the top best models at their company. The movie starts as a montage. Showing them over the years. They are the trend setters. Bringing in the best models (cameo of real models). They do all the designer clothing. They have won awards, blah blah blah. However, 2014 was a rough year. The company is not doing too well. For some reason, Derek and Hansel just can't seem to predict fashion trends. 

The movie begins with the company meeting to file for chapter 11 because Derek and Hansel refuse to adapt to modern fashion trends. The board argues that Derek and Hansel simply aren't relevent enough and no one is buying their clothes. The board also states that Derek and Hansel do not have any celebrity endorsements and someone is poaching all their top models. Due to these absurd fashion trends (pokes fun at yeezy), Derek and Hansel still relent and refuse to adapt to the new norm. After some pushing by the board they have a fashion show but its a failure. No one likes their clothing. Everyone wants to have the ""homeless"" look or hipster look. No one wants the blue steel anymore. So the board then votes and decides to lock them out. Penniless and homeless, Hansel and Derek are left with no choice but to model again as they have no other business experience. 

In fact, here we would see them try and get other jobs. Genius bar, coffee person (derek is horrible as he constantly stares at himself in the pot), Gym trainer, interns at a car dealership (fun camero potential here), interns at a start up, and so on. They get fired and have to go back. 

So modeling is very tough for them, because they are old. No one wants old models. They work at Tommy Behama and all these old people chains like Target shows. After pulling some strings with Jerry Stillers, They finally get a chance to model in a fashion show, but they are only there to wear these huge absurd suits, which they refuse to do. At the fashion show they witness first hand what has happened to the fashion industry.  The fashion show is no longer about fashion but a huge spectacle with music, football, celebrities and almost everything but fashion. The clothes worn on the runway are ugly and things no one would wear (like a meat dress). Derek and Hansel are finally fed up and decide to find out what has happened to the fashion world. 


Derek believes only one person can be behind this and this leads them to go to jail and find Mugatu, in hopes he can explain. But when they get there, they find an imposter. The real Mugatu has escaped and is working with one of the newest up and coming designers (played by a young Daniel Radcliff/Ray Romano). When they Find Mugatu, Mugatu explains his evil plan. When he escaped prision, he too tried to dabble in fashion but failed. No one wanted to buy his stuff. Enraged with the public, he decided to start killing/threatening fashion designers and killing/threatening celebrities to wear these absurd clothing and push it onto the public. 


At Muguatu's surprise the public ate it up. He could put all these outrageous designs that did not mesh and the general people would buy it as long as someone like Kanye wore it. (Kanye is here or someone and says ""Yeah but I aint ever wearing that paino key neck tie"" prompting Mugatu to kill him and declaring that the neck tie was too good for the world.) Mugatu then goes on to say that  he predicts over time the general public will grow a big distaste for these clothing, prompting Mugatu to scream ""WHO BUYS a 500 DOLLAR RIPPED HOODY...WHO!?. Mugatu then says ""Once they turn away from the celebrities, they will turn to me for fashion advice!"" Mugatu goes on a rant of when fashion was about expression but now it has descended into chaos and needs one person to unite it together. 


From here, our young desginer that Mugatu manipulated has a change of heart. Mugatu kills him.

Then Mugatu exclaims how he will kill all the designers in the world he will have the largest fashion company in the world. He will then release a monotone and uniform type fashion line that the world will be desperate to have, as they will want order after years of chaos. (Like basically in the SCIFI movies or Walle where they have the same outfit.) Mugatu will even say how ""IF I CAN'T HAVE FASHION....NO ONE CAN!"" Derek and Hansel obviously cannot let this happen and must save the fashion world.


Derek and Hansel somehow escape wherever they are and go to the fashion show (like in the first movie). Here it is a concert. Everyone is awaiting Mugatu's new fall 2016 line.

I'm sick of their control and them using their financial support for college as leverage to micro-manage me. When I went down to the bank today, I felt so good when I turned in that form. I felt like it was real.

**Back story:** I'm looking to apply for a big name game company internship for next summer and they suggest to provide a portfolio of completed projects' source code, code snippets, classes, etc (anything to do with code really in Java, C, C++, and/or C#). They don't say what they're looking for specifically, they just want to know if applicants have a basic understanding of how to code and how to use that knowledge to make games. *This is really just me writing out my plan for my application but feel free to use this for yourself as well.* 

-  *personal*\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
- Currently I'm working on a big project myself that I hope to have done by the end of august so that and it's source code will definitely be included in my own portfolio.
- *everything else*\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- 
- a section of **Utility classes** such as a level/scene manager, music managers, object pooling, texture optimizing, save management, Input controls, etc. This is one of the most important sections even if it's engine-specific. These tools will be used by designers to make the game itself so they need to be well documented and easy to use. 
- Several examples of **MVC classes** for all kinds of character/vehicle movement, health, world interactions. All the things you'd expect to see in games.
- **Custom Physics Classes**, doesn't have to be anything too impressive, just to show a wider range of talents. *Most* game don't need impressive physics engines like air friction or wind speed but it's good to show that you can do some of that. 
- Simple (at least) **UI controllers**, even if it's specific to one game engine. A lot of times you (or designers) will find it useful to implement quick UI elements to test features.
- A set of **super/sub classes** of a game play element just to show your understanding of all of the basic programming concepts. An example of this could be a unit class &gt; archers | warriors | healers or something simple like that. Object Oriented Programming is a MUST in game dev. 
- Some code to handle **online game play** is always nice, even if it barely scratches the surface. 
- Show that you can handle **player management** with save data, profiles, and basic statistics. 
- For a few classes, its a good idea to rewrite them in **different languages** that you know to showcase your flexibility. 

When people look at your code they will be looking for: 
- How easy is it to read/understand/maintain
- How elegant is it? could it have been done a much easier way? 
- Does it have any obvious bugs

If I forgot anything on this list feel free to comment your ideas, I may add them to the list (with credit). "

First time poster. I have a project that I've been working on for a few months for my internship. This project is using a BeagleBone Black as the main driver for a lot of light indicators that are used as a dashboard for a vehicle simulator. The next step I have is designing a circuit board to house all of the lights as they are currently all built on a couple breadboards.

Part of the build is using some Adafruit backpacks that house the chips and lights for 7 segment displays and LCDs. My question is would it be better to design my motherboard to use these existing assembled boards and only include the headers necessary to plug them in, or design the motherboard to house all of the chips and lights and not use the backpacks? 

I personally think that having all of the chips on the same board has less risk for things disconnecting or flimsy connections breaking off of the board, but I haven't had a situation like this before so I want some other opinions.

However, this summer I got an accounting internship to find out if it's really what I want to do...and I absolutely hate it. It's been a month and I have to drag myself here every morning. So I think it could be a good time to take a hard look at a career shift. Here are my thoughts in the past 48 hours.


-Just because I don't like accounting doesn't mean I'm completely ruling out working in the business world. Project Management and Consulting are on my radar

-I like technology and would possibly be interested in Information Systems

-I really love the environment and feel like adding that passion to my work would help me identify with it and get a lot more job satisfaction

-I'm not sure if a shift toward an environmental career would manifest itself as ""still a business major with a focus on sustainability"" or ""complete 180 to environmental studies/environmental education"". I think the latter sounds incredibly fun but would probably take a fifth year of school and definitely be harder to find a job


-One more thing to keep in mind is I have (and plan on having) a pretty vibrant life outside of work: being outdoors, hiking and biking and going on trips with friends, so maybe I should just look for a job I don't hate rather than one I love?

**Big Questions**


Should I stick out my internship for another month and a half even if I feel like it's not taking me anywhere?

What other steps can I take to cement a better idea of my career direction?

Thank you for the help!

Then there's iOS development 101, which seems like a lot of fun and might figure into an internship next Summer. I applied and almost landed one with a small company near me.

I laid out my whole life for her and she asked the magic words, ""Has anyone ever considered you might have ADD?"" It was like a lightbulb went off!

I was an athlete in HS, so I was able to keep myself pretty much together because I had strict schedules (and super strict parents), routine exercise, and deadlines to meet. I was a good student, even if I did put things off until the last minute.

In college, I was really on my own for the first time and I did ""OK"" for the first couple of years, but then my procrastination and disorganization got the better of me and I fell a year behind. Then I had a senior project to do and I never finished. To this day, I'm 4 credits shy of my bachelor's.

I worked in my field for a while (going on the merit of internships and the name of the college I attended). But I hated the busy work side of things and quit before I got fired. Then I decided to return to school. I found a grad program that accepted me despite the lack of a true BS, and struggled through and eventually graduated (mix a surprise pregnancy in there and it was challenging to say the least). I'm sure I actually made it though because it was a subject I loved and my moments of hyperfocus saved me.

Then, in my infinite wisdom, I thought it would be a brilliant idea to go into business for myself. That was almost 5 years ago, and I've managed to practically drive my business into the ground because I just can't get my shit together. I'm so deep in debt, I'll never dig my way out. I have stacks and stacks of work that I know I *need* to get done, and I just can't seem to do it. I am flaky and forget to return calls and emails. My depression makes me feel awful and I hate marketing to sell my business. My anxiety because of all of this is crippling.

I'm going to keep seeing my CBT therapist and I've started Prozac recently for the depression/anxiety and in a little while when we see how I'm doing with that, the psychiatrist wants to address the ADHD.

tl;dr - I'm 35 years old with a string of educational/professional failures behind me and now I realize it's because I've had undiagnosed ADHD my whole adult life."

When I arrived in the US as an intern in 2014 I opened an account at Bank Of America because it was the closest bank that I found. At the time I didn't have any specific needs (nor money) so it never really matter until now. 
As of now I have a core checking account as well as two credit cards (cashback and travel rewards)
I was given a full time position recently and it motivated me to improve my banking situation. 

I'm looking for a checking account that doesn't cost me anything provided I do direct deposit on it, any recommendations ? Is Radius or Ally any good ?

I'd like to sign up for the chase sapphire preferred credit card does that mean that I have to open a checking account with them or is it easy to pay off that card from another bank's checking account ? 

I will open a savings account ($2k initial deposit then 1k/month) is Ally savings account the best solution ?

Finally shall I keep or close my BoA accounts ?

Thank you :) !"

I got a NA 97' miata(155k miles). Engines stock but is fitted with megan EZ coil overs. Will  be used as a daily and for driving through the hills.

Im from Canada and I will be using the Miata for my internship in the bay area for 4 months. After the 4 months I will probably be selling it :(.

My rear tires are pretty close to bald. Fronts seem fine. Would it be worth it to replace just the rear 2 wheels with dunlop star spec tires? My worry is i might get understeer alot with the grippy rears. 
Or should i go with a cheaper tire and replace all 4. 
Again, this would only be for 4 months which is holding me back from replacing all 4 with the dunlops. 

Any help is appreciated!"
4sp3ny,1,2016-07-13,Big 4 Job Question,PSU441,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/4sp3ny/big_4_job_question/,"Hi:

I am a senior that will graduating in December and am going to apply for a position at each of the Big 4 firms once they start recruiting. The only bad thing is that I have not have an internship during my time in college. I had one lined up for this summer but was not able to do it based on family issues that arose toward the end of the semester.

For what it's worth, I have a pretty good GPA and am at a target school. I won't have 150 credits upon graduation so I am looking at Advisory.

Now that I explained my situation, here is my question: Would it be best to apply for a winter internship or a full-time position? I feel that I might have a better chance at getting an interview for an internship. From there I would do everything I could to excel during the internship so that I could get an offer for full-time.

Please let me know what you guys think.

Thanks!"
4sp41a,6,2016-07-13,New AK buyer and need some guidance given the current market situation.,GOOCH_SNIFFER,ak47,https://www.reddit.com/r/ak47/comments/4sp41a/new_ak_buyer_and_need_some_guidance_given_the/,"Just to preface so you guys understand my situation, I am a sophomore in college and have been wanting an AK for some time now. I have an internship making decent money but my budget is pretty tight considering I have a lot of school expenses to budget for.

Im looking at an AK as opposed to other rifles because I see it as a dynamic platform. I love shooting, but am also a hunter, and with the right setup I believe it can serve decently as a hunting rifle due to the caliber (Ak's are legal to hunt with in my state).

In spite of recent events I am worried about the availability and pricing of these cool guns and have felt the urge to make a purchase soon.

I have called around to several stores and my options are limited. Basically for 700 I can pickup a magpul furniture RAS, which I am really trying to justify given the price point (compared to other options) it's supposed accuracy, and magpul firmiture but I am well aware of the issues some owners encounter down the road, which is hindering my decision. Additionally all of the WASR's in my area are around 850-which is extremely pricey for a WASR. Lastly there is a Vepr available for just north of 1100, which I think is really cool but is quite the reach price wise.

I would order online for a cheaper price but the backlog on Atlantic orders is insane according to the associate at a gun store I talked to yesterday.

I am unsure of what to do at this point. I really want to justify that RAS but feel like I'll be shooting myself in the foot if I  buy that.

Any recommendations or insight would be extremely appreciated. Thanks.

&gt; 
&gt; Dear Sir or Madam, 
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; As a recent graduate with a degree in political science and a focus on international relations, I would like to express my interest in the security and defense policy internship at the [orginization], as advertised on [job site]. I am currently pursuing a career in the field of international policy research and am highly interested in many of the topics covered by [the orginizations's] Security and Defense Policy team, including NATO expansion, Eastern Europe, and transatlantic relations. I believe that this opportunity would provide me with exceptional experience and knowledge to further serve personal aspirations in the field. 
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; My academic studies have provided me with an interest and a strong foundation of knowledge on key international security topics. My international relations curriculum extensively covered issues such as humanitarian intervention, terrorism, ethnic conflict, and defense policy. In addition to my regular coursework, I spent a semester studying peace and conflict at [program], based in Belgrade, Serbia. The coursework of this semester covered in depth issues affecting regional and international security, such as the effects of international intervention, ethnic nationalism, and post-conflict reconstruction. Additionally, I conducting a month long independent study on religious identity in Kosovo, and its effects on extremism in the region. Overall, my coursework fostered both personal and career interests, and developed my ability to research, analyze, and communicate effectively.
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Additionally, my prior internship experiences have developed professional skills which I believe would serve this position well. At [orginization], in Prishtina, Kosovo, my primary responsibility was to assist with organization-wide research projects, which included topics in security policy such as extremism and the use of violence by local political parties. Additionally, I conducted day to day administrative tasks, such completing grant applications, data input, and monitoring news sources relevant to the organization’s mission. At the same time, I interned for [local news publication], where I contributed original articles for the magazine and was responsible for editing and publishing English language content for the website. In balancing these two positions while also navigating the challenges of living abroad, I strengthened my capacity to manage time and balance a large number and variety of deadline sensitive, detail oriented tasks. Prior to my experience in Kosovo, I also spent a summer interning at [orginization], where I contributed to projects on disaster relief policy and corruption in law enforcement. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that my academic, personal, and professional experiences come together to make me &gt;a strong candidate for this position. Thank you for reviewing my application.

4spojn,1,2016-07-13,My boss/friend refuses to pay me for helping at his PC repair shop. What do I do?,StechT,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4spojn/my_bossfriend_refuses_to_pay_me_for_helping_at/,"I should clarify first that this is an internship, but my boss/friend has told me that I will be paid this summer. So far that hasn't happened. The only thing he's given me so far is a smoke-ridden HP laptop that's too weak to play Youtube videos and an old parts/repair Dell desktop. Together they're not worth near as much as he says he's paying me.

I just feel like I'm being kinda used. I've been interning for over a year, have fixed countless customer PCs, and have been there to help him every time his business was in a slump. I interned 2 days a week during the school year and 3-4 days a week during the summer. And I still do! I've dealt with HP Customer Support for him when they kept bouncing me around for 2+ hours. I've organized his entire backroom inventory. I've had his cynical asshole friend nearly throw a fucking steel bar stool at my face. I was still there through all that.

I came in today to work on computers as usual and noticed that my boss/friend had bought his 2 other friends Subway for lunch (including himself). I asked if I could borrow money for lunch.

""I don't have any money on me.""
This is kinda when it became personal. I come in to fix computers for you 6-7 hours a day, 3-4 days a week and you don't even buy me lunch? Keep in mind he bragged to me a few weeks ago that he bought a 250 dollar graphics card to play games on his PC and also bought an HDTV that is around 50+ inches in size BEFORE paying me at all.

Sorry if this is in bad taste, but I really feel like I deserve to be payed for what I do. The only reason I still work there is because noone else wants to hire the 15 year old. That and because he's my friend. So I'm at a loss as of now. Do I leave or stay? Or do I start my own business? Please help me decide, this has been on my mind for some time now. Any advice is appreciated."

4sqci7,37,2016-07-13,"Recently graduated from a bootcamp, here's is what I learned.",Iyace,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4sqci7/recently_graduated_from_a_bootcamp_heres_is_what/,"So, this is in reference to the other cool dude who decided to share his experiences as a recent graduate. I am also a recent graduate, but I went to a bootcamp. I've seen lots of questions like ""CS degree or bootcamp?"" and everything, so I figured I'd lend my opinions as a someone who walked the walk and is current on the job hunt.

**Should I go to a bootcamp or get a cs degree?**

   I think this question is almost impossible to answer unless you provide some very deep personal background. There's a couple of things I'd like to dispel, however.

   The first is that a cs degree is the same price as bootcamp tuition, and you'll be more hire-able, so you should go with a cs degree. People who say this don't understand opportunity cost. Sure, even if they're the same cost, you're forgoing possibly 3.5 years ( 1.5 if its a masters program or some such ) of wages getting a CS degree. That sort of argument doesn't hold much merit.

   The second is that bootcamp graduates aren't hire-able within 3 months, and the statistics aren't true. I can't speak to the aggregate data over the industry as a whole, but my personal experience with the two cohorts above me leads me to believe that you're definitely hire-able. Almost all of the cohort that graduated when I started ( 95% ) are gainfully employed as software developers.

   And the third is that a bootcamp graduate is just as prepared to enter the workforce as a CS degree holder. I don't believe this is true for reasons I'll go into below.

**What's the difference between a bootcamp graduate and a CS graduate?**

   There's a lot, actually. Bootcamp graduates actually learn a lot of the things that interns pick up in their internships. We learn the tools of the grade, and how to use them. E2E testing, build tools, frameworks, RESTful APIs, how teh interwebz werks... etc. We learn all of the same things that make us able to be productive in the workplace.

   What we don't learn are the core fundamentals. This is far more applicable in enterprise-level software than it is at small start ups. You can push a lot of bootcamp grads deep on core concepts like distributed systems, embedded systems, and hardware related stuff that we have no idea about ( unless our background is technical ). These concepts become more important when you're dealing with larger systems, which is why I believe you don't see a lot of bootcamp grads get hired at bigger firms.

   There's also this notion that bootcamp grads are more prepared for the workforce, because CS grads have no hands on experience. I think this is false, because you're equating two different things. You're equating the best and most proactive of the bootcamps grads against the least proactive of the CS grads. This isn't a fair comparison, as CS grads with internships have just as much industry knowledge as a bootcamp grad, PLUS a solid core of fundamentals. As bootcamp grads, we don't need to put down other people who worked just as hard as we did because their path was more academic, and we generally don't even have a right to do so.

**Why did I choose a bootcamp?**

   My background is in economics, with a focus on the quantitative route ( econometrics ). I got interested in programming as hobby first, and developing software sort of ignited my passion. So I was left with the choice of going back to school for 2 years, or jumping into an accelerated program to propel my career. I also own a house and bills.

   That being said, I don't recommend bootcamps for everyone. I wouldn't even recommend them to the majority of people. I don't think everyone can become a software developer, because I don't think everyone really wants to be a software developer. I chose the bootcamp route because I really wanted to be a software developer, and was willing to risk a lot of things in my life to get there.

**What was bootcamp like?**

   It was really hard. I went to MakerSquare in Santa Monica, and I really do recommend it to anyone who is seriously considering a bootcamp and has prepared themselves for one. Entry is relatively difficult, as you're given a series of algorithmic questions and asked to solve them using conventional algorithms. This is a weeding out process, so that MKS can find the best candidates.

   Once in, I got a lot of pre-curriculum to prepare me for the kind of material I'd be in for. A lot of it was more advanced concepts like recursion, etc. Fortunately, the first week or so was dedicated to some core CS concepts like data structures (BSTs, Graphs, etc ) and algorithms. Everything after that was such a blur of technology. We learned front-end, then back-end, and learned how to tie it all together. The senior portion was dedicated to using our new knowledge to build three applications from scratch. I don't regret any part of my decision to join MKS, in retrospect.

**What's the job search like?**

   It's hard. No one is knocking down doors to get me into theirs. There's a lot of HR rejections, no one calling me back or following up. The great thing about my bootcamp is that they prepared me well so that when someone does take a chance and gets on the phone with me, I can speak to everything I've done. All throughout the program, we were given a daily interview question to solve, as well as whiteboarding sessions towards the end of the program. The last interview I had (earlier today) was one of the most comfortable and confident interviewing experiences I've ever had, because of how prepared my bootcamp made me.

**So, I want to go to a bootcamp, how should I prepare?**

   Get clear on your fundamentals and why you want to be a software engineer. Are you always the smartest dude in the room and don't like feeling dumb? You're going to feel very dumb in a bootcamp. Do you like free time? You won't have any in your bootcamp.

   If you're willing to give up on everything to get a career in software engineering, however, I would recommend it. So start by getting into the nolife mindset right now. Crack open a CS fundamentals book, and start learning about software. This is going to be a lifelong learning experience for you, so start today. Focus on algorithms and data structures, and pick up a high-level language like JavaScript to practice with. When you're ready, go apply!

As I was leaving the gas station, a large group of bikers with ""combat ptsd veteran"" shirts rode up behind and then next to me. One of them came right up to the side of my car and rode wheel-to-wheel with me. He matched his front wheel with my left front drivers side tire and hugged my car so close I thought he would crash into me. As I approached work, I put my blinker on, had to merge, and they backed off and let me lead them. I could see them smile at me as I led them, so I down shifted and floored it to signal I was down with them. They must have seen me get the orange juice or something idk. I was the leader of a biker group of combat ptsd veterans.

Anyway, I had went to a career fair at verizon through the community college I can no longer afford. I stepped so far out of my comfort zone to be there, I even surprised myself. I was a wolf amongst sheep. I had everyone laughing, they all got a kick out of me, and the most high-up senior manager in the room was matching my body language on the other side of the table. This was it for me; I had found success, and could finally get out of my nightmare house.

While I was applying online for the job after networking with them, my mom called the cops on me and said I was yelling and a threat to myself or others. This could not be proven or disproven. My mom has munchausen syndrome by proxy, and has drugged, starved, neglected, and abused me physically and psychologically my entire life. I cannot even begin to describe the fucking terrifying things she has done to me; she wants to have a special needs child that she can throw around at church and get sympathy for. 

The cops came with a mobile crisis team to talk to me. I talked to them, they left, I finished the application. The next day, she called the cops again for the same reason. Because she called twice in two days, the police had to arrest me for disorderly conduct. I spent 10 days in jail, which traumatized and dehuminized me even more than I had been.

While I was wrongfullying incarcerated, I got the job at verizon. 30k a year plus commission, and 8k tuition assistance?!?! I had made it!!!! I could finally get the fuck away from my nightmare house and I could actually pay for college!!! This job was everything I have ever wanted and more. And that is why she had me arrested, remember she has munchausen syndrome by proxy.

So, I got the job while I was in jail. And they had to withdraw the position because I wasn't responding to the emails. They emailed me five times, the last of which was a notification stating they had to withdraw the position.

I have since re-applied, dozens of times, and am no longer qualified.

I am now living in my deadbeat dad's apartment, unemployed and at the mercy of his outbursts. I cannot take anymore abuse in  my life. And I have to live with him again because I'm just not going back to my mom. He is the most vile, disgusting, abusive alcoholic drug addict you would ever meet. This place is a shithole and I have to deal with his nasty abuse every day now. I cannot take this anymore. I'm living out of state from my school that I can no longer afford. Even if I get abother minimum wage job I cant enroll in school in time and couldn't pay for it anyway so I'm going to have to take maybe a year off after doing exceptionally well my most recent semester. I will not make it, after everything I've been through, I need a real job NOW RIGHT NOW or I will not make it.

I have so much ambition, I know what I am intellectually capable of. I am a literal genius. 

I cannot have another opportunity like the one verizon offered without an internship or career fair at the community college I can no longer pay for and now live an hour drive away from.

The city I live in has train tracks and trains go through it every night. I am going to lay on the tracks in the very near future and just end it. I cannot live with my dad as much as I can't live with my mom. I can't live on my own because minimum wage does not pay bills let alone tuition.

What I need most in this life right now is a career with upward mobility and advancement potential. I will work so fucking hard you would not believe.

That is the only way out of this. Either a ""real job"" falls onto my lap, or a train will. I have no other options.

I am about to be homeless, I'm planning on getting whatever job I can take so I can buy a car and live out of it. Living out of a car would finally provide me with the sense of privacy and personal space I have not had my entire life. I just want to be alone. No one has ever respected my privacy or personal space so I'm going to live out of a car. Ive been looking at an acura rsx type s with low miles because it's a really nice car and lasts forever and I could actually afford it with minimum wage. My dream car is a 1995 Nissan 240sx s14.5 or a boosted evo. That's kindof the only reason I'm still alive, I like cars and want to thru-hike the Appalachian trail while I'm still young. I don't have a chance of hiking without money saved though so that's gone.

If anyone has been through something similar to me and walks to talk about it please do. I have applied to dozens and dozens of office jobs and can't even get an interview. What do I do. How do I make it out of this. I have the mind of a millionaire, I know what im capable of. Please help me

Edit - I cannot join the military because I have crohns disease and am automatically disqualified from serving"
4sr3xf,1827,2016-07-13,My [25/F] brother [22/M] is expecting me to give up a study/internship abroad opportunity and spend the money going to his destination wedding [to 21/F] somewhere I am not interested in travelling to. Am I the unreasonable one?,thailandorparis,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4sr3xf/my_25f_brother_22m_is_expecting_me_to_give_up_a/,"Throwaway because I don’t want to link this to my post history.

For the sake of ease, we’ll call my brother Sam and his wife Kate. Obviously not their real names. 

My brother Sam became engaged 8 months ago to Kate after a year of dating. They have a 3 month old son. Sam and I have never been super close with each other…..we are very different people and have very little in common. We were very different as kids….I was always reading and he was always playing video games. He dropped out of school at 15, right when I went off to University. He was in trouble with the law for a while there and we didn't have much to do with each other. We get along civilly, but he does allow Kate to make an endless stream of side remarks to me which is a sore point for me. Sam never once sticks up for me, even when my parents have been shocked at what she says. Kate also tries to 'push me out' a lot by saying things like how she is my parents daughter. Basically, she has always tried to take my place to compensate for having had a crappy childhood with a single mother who didn't care about her. It sucks for her, but that doesn't mean her behaviour isn't infuriating for me you know? 

Sam and Kate have decided to have a huge wedding and bacherlor/ettes in Thailand and are now expecting me to pay my own way there and book a 11 day trip to Thailand and pay for all my own expenses, including flights. They are taking out a loan to make the wedding possible because Kate has ‘always wanted’ a ‘dreamy beach destination wedding’. (I think that is stupid. I mean it is their life and their finances but why hasn’t that clued them in on how it might also be unaffordable for their guests? If I didn't have savings, would they expect me to take a loan). 

They also want me to be a bridesmaid and given that Kate asked her 2 best friends 4 months ago (I saw it on instagram, she did the ‘will you be my bridesmaid’ proposal thing)….I asked why they were asking now and they admitted one of Kate’s friends backed out because of the coats and they ‘need another and there isn’t really anyone else’. They're angry at Kate's friend for backing out, but she agreed to be a bridesmaid *before* she knew they were planning on taking the wedding from Australia to Thailand. I’m not exactly thrilled about the idea of being a ‘back up bridesmaid’, especially to someone I know dislikes me at worst, is indifferent to me at best. Eff that, tbh. This is going to cost *thousands* of dollars. My parents are not thrilled about the wedding, but are going along with it because they know any disagreement and my brother will take it out on them because whatever Kate wants, Sam makes sure she gets. My parents love their grandson and they know if they 'annoy' Kate too much, they can forget about seeing him. I think Kate knows that and uses her baby to get her way. 

This wedding is not how I want to spend my own money and it is now causing a big drama. 

Even before this became an issue, I was always of the opinion that expensive destination weddings are incredibly selfish and entitled because the couple is expecting their guests to pay a *lot* of money to attend and essentially dictating to them where their next holiday will be without considering they might want to go somewhere else. Go for your honeymoon, don’t make everyone else pay for that too. I mean, I personally have 0 interest in Thailand. I hate the beach……I’m a fair skinned strawberry blonde girl who hates hot weather and can’t go in the water with her contacts in so it’s just…..not my idea of fun at all. I don’t want to spend all my savings on a beach holiday I’ll hate. 

I can technically afford to go based on the balance of my savings account, but I’m saving for something important. I’m currently a masters student studying a double masters in European Union Law and French Translation and have been offered the chance to complete five months study in Paris next year and interning for a major government department for three months afterwards. That is my plan for the money I’ve been saving from my part time tutoring job. The wedding is being held during the internship. They want me to give it up even though it could be the big break of my career. This is how I want to use the money. There is now an expectation I’ll back out of this and go to the wedding and even pay to be Kate’s bridesmaid. 

I’ve said no. Sam is losing his shit because Kate is pissed off I’m not bowing to her wishes. My parents are urging me to reconsider. I know they think this is all bullshit (my father in particular thinks Kate is ridiculous), but they know the kind of hold Kate has over my brother and know if they even slightly upset her, he'll side with her and they might not see their grandkid. They enable her because she’s insane and entitled. 

Am I being the unreasonable one?

One of the things that makes Sam/Kate and I so different is that we have different goals and interests. I have an undergraduate Law/French degree (possible in my country) and am now studying a masters degree. Kate has said on Facebook that her goal is to get a husband so she ‘doesn’t have to work’ and can ‘have babies’. Sam dropped out of school and works a blue collar job. I’m not looking down on that, but it means he doesn’t really understand how important opportunities like the one I have been offered are for careers like the one I am pursuing. We are very different people with very different goals in life, which is fine, but it means they don’t understand that giving up and opportunity like this could be giving up my ‘big break’ and to me, my career for the next 50 years is more important than someone’s wedding day. They *knew* I would be interning in Paris when they selected this date because I told them long before they picked a date. It makes me wonder if Kate knew what she was doing in picking this date. 

What do you think reddit? Am I the bad guy for saying I’m not spending all my money to indulge Kate’s ‘fairytale wedding dream’ and sticking to my study abroad/internship plans or do I have to suck it up?

**tldr: brother is expecting me to spend the $10k+ I’ve saved to study/intern abroad on a destination beach wedding when I hate the beach and the bride is constantly rude to me. Am I in the wrong for refusing?** "

4sr6ym,121,2016-07-13,So today a client told me about his underwear and a woman got forcibly removed from court...,princessofsalt,talesfromthelaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthelaw/comments/4sr6ym/so_today_a_client_told_me_about_his_underwear_and/,"Hello all!

As I've said before on this sub, I am an intern for the public defenders office in a particular city. Specifically, I work on the misdemeanor dockets. It is a pretty cool job because I get to work one- on - one with clients reviewing police reports and sentencing recommendations and I get to watch all the action in the court room. I usually have one or two good stories every time I go in, but today in particular was a crazy day.

A guy came in for his pretrial with an indecent exposure charge, which we don't see a lot of. No one had been over the police report with him yet, so I volunteered, interested in what might have happened. I scanned the police report before I took him into a conference room, and it basically said that two elderly women living next door to the defendant claimed he had purposely exposed himself to them through the window. These women had been having issues with the defendant for months and had file five different police reports in just the past three months about this guy's behavior. There was also another issue with the case. The defendant was out on bond with a no contact order in place as a condition of his bond. This means, clearly, that he can't make any sort of contact with the complaining witnesses. The women claimed he violated this order a few mornings prior when he followed close behind them on a morning walk and threatened them and cursed at them. The women actually came to court to attest to this. I saw this going one of two ways: either these were two spiteful and lonely old women looking to get their neighbor arrested or the defendant was, in fact, a total creep. But it isn't my place to judge, so I go back to the room with this man and find out his mother is with him and wants to come with us (keep in mind the defendant is in his 40s, so he's a grown man).

I go into the conference room with the mother and son, confirm that the information we have about him on file is accurate and showed him the police report. After him and his mother reviewed it, I asked if the information in the police report was accurate. He immediately told me that everything that was in it was true, that these women had been out to get him from the start and that they keep filing false police reports. His mother, talking over him, also told me about how good of a person he was and how he would never do that. I ignore the mother and ask the defendant, ""were you walking around naked in your kitchen at all on that morning?"" 

He informed me that he was probably walking around in his boxers. He told me he has some very high end luxury boxers that are skin tight that he spent a lot of money on and that's what he was wearing. He told me he had worn some today for proof.

I told him it wouldn't be necessary for anyone to look at his boxers and asked if he wanted to plead guilty or see if the prosecution would offer a deal for a no contest plea. He said he wanted a jury trial. I also told him about the claim that he had violated the no contact order and he totally denied it to me. His mother said she was with him that morning and it didn't happen. I said I would let the public defender know that was his defense. I tell them to wait for his name to be called. 

When the defendant's name is called, he enters his not guilty plea and the prosecutor and public defender work out what day to set jury selection and the trial. The prosecutor then asks the judge to have the defendant be put in jail until the trial because of his violation of his bond conditions. The judge asks the defendant about his side of the story and the defendant completely changes his story, telling the judge he was going on ""a rant to himself about people who call the police for no damn reason."" But he also said it had nothing to do with the fact that the two women walking in front of him had called the police on him. Obviously, the judge called bullshit on this, but was nice enough to only put him in jail for 3 days instead of a whole month until trial. The complaining witnesses didn't even need to make statements on the record. 

Obviously, upon seeing her darling son go to jail, mama bear was not happy. She turned to the 80 year old complaining witnesses on the opposite side of the room and started screaming at them about what bitches they are. The bailiff tells her to leave the courthouse or be arrested and she scurried out, presumably to her car. The witnesses stuck around for 5 or 10 minutes (probably to make sure she was out of the building when they got outside), but we later learned from the security guards that the mother actually ended up hiding by the bathrooms out of sight of the guards and continued to scream at and threaten the witnesses as they tried to exit the building. She was forcibly removed and put on the list of people no longer welcome in the courtroom. 

Just another day on the job."
4sr896,9,2016-07-13,My boyfriend [22M] has told so many lies over the past year that I feel like I [22F] don't know him anymore. Thinking of ending it but unsure.,nofaithorconfidence,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4sr896/my_boyfriend_22m_has_told_so_many_lies_over_the/,"We met a few months into our freshman year of college, and we've been dating ever since then. We'll soon have been dating for 4 years, and in that time, my boyfriend Austin has been amazing. 

We don't have any major problems. We rarely fight, and when we do, it's never bad and we make up quickly. Austin treats me very well, and I feel loved. The problem is that over the past year some of his behavior is not consistent with the boy I've know for almost 4 years, and it concerns me, especially since he doesn't see anything wrong with the lies he tells.

All of this started last summer. Austin started the summer doing an internship for a non profit. He was making some money, but he wasn't happy with the job. At the same time he was interviewing with a private company about an internship for the summer. He got a job with the company and decided to quit his other internship, but instead of telling them the reason why he was leaving he lied and told them that his mother had a stroke (not true) and he needed to go home for the summer. 

When he told me this, I was shocked. What bothered me wasn't so much that he lied, but that he was so casual about it. He was not even ashamed of what he had done, and he defended it by telling me that he couldn't deal with disappointing the non profit and the people that had offered him a job. Basically, it was him trying to protect their feelings and to protect his internship as well as the possibility of getting a job with the other company, as he put it. (He was afraid that the non profit folks would contact the other company to let them know what he did.)

Note: our university's office of career services contacted him the next week and he told them the same story, although he made it seem like he was having a breakdown about it so they would feel bad for him and not give him such a hard time. I honestly thought it was pretty disgusting. Not only did he lie about his mother's health but he made people think he was upset so they wouldn't give him a hard time about the way he handled the situation. (He emailed his boss on Saturday night to tell him he wouldn't be back on Monday.) 


I thought that it was a one time thing, but then it happened again in the fall. He was doing fall interviews looking to find a job after we graduated, and I just so happened to find one of his transcripts that he was sending around. It was fake. He had altered it so that his grades were significantly better. I said something to him about it because I was worried about the kind of trouble he would get in with our school if they found out he was forging his transcripts, but he was very dismissive and told me nothing would happen. As far as I know, he continued using them and ended up getting a job with one of those companies. He initially accepted an offer but then later declined. He never told me why, but I strongly suspect it's because they asked for an official transcript, if they're like my employer, and he couldn't replicate one. 

There's one final incident that again involved Austin lying that bothered me. Austin and I took a class in the fall of last year that required a final paper. Rather than turn in the paper on time, he decided to go to the professor and his academic adviser and tell them his mom had a stroke so he needed more time. This not only bothered me because he lied but because it was unfair to myself and those of us who turned our work in on time. 

I know everyone has years that are worse than others, but this whole year I've felt like I was dating a stranger. He's the same in a lot of ways, but this behavior isn't what I'm used to from him. I don't know if this is really who he is or if he's just under a lot of pressure. He says that he was under a lot of stress this year and now things will be fine, but I don't know how I can believe that given that I know how easy lying is for him. I worry now that when things get difficult for us or there are hard decisions we have to make he'll lie and take the easy way out. 

I don't want to break up with him if I can avoid it, but I have lost a lot of confidence in him. I'll admit that he's seemed fine over the last two months since we graduated. I haven't caught him in any more lies, so I hope he's going back to the Austin I love. But I can't stop having my doubts.

Should I be worried given his behavior over the past year or should I believe that the Austin I've always know is the real him and he was just having a rough year?

I am heartbroken to be without him but proud that he got this opportunity that he's worked so hard for.  


My sister [20F] moved in to take his place paying rent (I can't afford my house alone after leaving a soul-sucking job and taking a paycut to do it).  However, my sister just resigned from her job yesterday (instead of getting let go for something minor) and already wasn't paying as much as my boyfriend was (which was half).  Cue the finance-induced panic attack.  Ever since I bought the house in 2013 I have wondered over and over if I made a mistake by giving myself this expensive ball and chain.  


Our original plan was for me to sell my house next summer and move away with him to get his PhD in the fall of 2017 but now I feel like all signs are pointing to selling the house and most of my belongings NOW and moving to Austria to be with him.  I have asked a realtor friend to come give me an estimate on the house this week and he said now is a great time to be selling a house in my city and was very confident that it would sell quickly.


The only thing keeping me here is my family and friends and it will break my heart to leave them but I feel like I owe it to myself to live away from home for at least a few years.  The job I have now is fine but I wouldn't be that sad to quit it.  The thought of living without the crushing responsibility of the house on my shoulders AND with my awesome boyfriend in a beautiful European city is enticing.


So my question is, do I throw caution to the wind and take this once in a lifetime opportunity?  Or am I being selfish by not cherishing this last year with my family and friends before I leave with the boyfriend for his PhD?



Help me Reddit, I'm freaking out.

*-*-*EDIT*-*-* 
Boyfriend suggested that I sell early when I told him about my sister's job and about my weakening ties to this city.  He is very supportive no matter what I decide.
Sorry if I was a little vague, I was trying not to ramble.

Any better ideas?",run_throw_bike_climb,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4srk4v/23yo_currently_putting_1000month_in_a_001/,"I'm a 23 year old computer science PhD student. I have zero debt. Over the past two years, I've been managing my money in the same way: month-to-month, I spend less than I make. I put the extra money into my savings account while keeping my checking account hovering around $1000. 

During the school semester, my stipend isn't a ton, so I'll have about $200-$300 extra a month. During the summers, I typically intern at large tech companies where I make a LOT more money. I don't change my spending habits, so during the summer months, I'll have about $2000-$3000 extra a month. My savings account is currently sitting around $24,000 and this pattern of contributions should continue for at least the next 3 years until I get my degree.

My plan was to move most of my savings into an Ally account that gets 1.0% interest. That pretty much gets me at least 200 free dollars per year that I wouldn't have gotten before. Are there any other better ideas? 

A friend of mine told me that the interest on a savings account doesn't beat the rate of inflation, so they chose to buy a small, cheap, house that needed some TLC. That way, their investment grows with inflation, and also minor fixes to the house will dramatically increase the value, netting them more money than a savings account could.

I'm open to any suggestons. Thanks!

(Side note: Don't know if this will make a difference, but I have a roth IRA with Vanguard from about 4 years ago that probably has somewhere around $2000 in it)"

My first two years were in computer science, my third year I switched to a more business Information Systems major but only took some business gen eds.  Then I came back to CS and have 1 more year left.

Most of my classes have been in the C++ language with some very minor PHP, CSS, HTML and MySQL.  I also have taken an assembly course as its a requirement at my university.  

I'm in a bit of a predicament though as I feel as though I haven't retained as much information as I probably should have.  I feel as though I cannot discuss CS topics and I don't really have anything interesting to tell about my experiences so far.  I had an internship this past Spring but I had to cut it short because I was no longer going to be a full time student.

I've had a few interviews at the beginning of the summer but no luck.  

In the fall I'm scheduled to take a .net class at my 4 year college as well as a computer architecture required class.

I was thinking of taking some courses at my local community college (which actually has more CS classes and more diverse ones at that than my current 4 year state school).  

They have a few different certificate programs where it is strictly CS courses and can be finished in 9 months time.  I was either thinking of doing the web developer one or the applications programmer one which is C++ and Java.  I'm guessing that is more of my personal preference rather than anything.

But onto my major question: Would this be a smart move?  I feel as though I'm not comfortable enough or experienced enough as I should be for going through my 3 years of computer science.  I'm not one to come up with interesting projects on my own though and would have no idea where to start, so I thought maybe a few more classes under my belt could lead me to develop some more worthwhile projects to discuss in future interviews as well as help me become a better programmer in general.

Let me know what you guys think.

4srywl,2,2016-07-14,F4A - The Dark Journey To Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4srywl/f4a_the_dark_journey_to_fame/,"Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

-----------------


I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up (would love her to look like Madison Ivy)

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S also looking to role play Marvel/DC, Game Of Thrones, The Witcher and Mass Effect

4srzaw,5,2016-07-14,"[Fan Story Pre-OS]- ""The Calling of Autumn""",Attydude,swordartonline,https://www.reddit.com/r/swordartonline/comments/4srzaw/fan_story_preos_the_calling_of_autumn/,"The red sun lazily began turning into a silhouette behind the grey clouds as it tainted the dull autumn sky with a new shade of orange as every minute passed.

“It reminds me of the view from our house.” A gentle and all-too familiar voice called out to me. “I figured you’d be up here, you’ve started coming here really often these days. What’s bothering you?” She said as she put her left arm around my neck. She could see right through me as I met her laser beam gaze.

I turned away from her stare with my usual poker face and faced the sunset again. “It’s funny, I was thinking the same thing. This sunset is way too familiar”, I replied with a small smile on my face as I recalled the image of our home by the lake on the 22nd Floor of New Aincrad. I was partly surprised when the person next to me, one of the few people I cherished deeply, hadn’t said a word in the minute that passed and stood quietly by my side staring into the same sunset. My expression turned into a worried one when I told Asuna what I was thinking.

“Recently I’ve been having these moments of realization that the virtual world that we are a part of has managed to replicate real life scenarios like this sunset so accurately. The image that I have of the sunset on the 22nd Floor is almost the exact same as that of this sunset in front of us in the real world.” I took a second to stop and consider whether or not Asuna was following my train of thought. When I turned my head to the right, I saw a beautiful scene right out of a movie. The dulling sun left my partner’s skin almost glittering in its own way. Her face shone brightly in the dying light like a star emerging from the oncoming darkness. She gazed at me with big hazelnut-like eyes and smiled, prompting me to continue. As usual, she was following whatever I was saying perfectly.

I continued, “The basis of Virtual Reality as a concept is to create an immersive-as-possible external environment. We both know well enough how difficult it was to accept this external environment as our new reality when we were stuck in SAO. That was partly due to the fact that this new reality was forced upon us and it wasn’t our choice to make SAO our new reality. However, some players, in SAO and GGO accepted this new reality and began to exchange their actual reality for the man-made one.” I quickly referenced the Shinkawa Kyouji incident to make my point clear. “I’m not sure if it’s worrying, fascinating or disturbing how the line between Virtual Reality and real life has thinned down to a breakable level. My thoughts have been all over the place regarding this topic since the funeral last month.” I turned my head to Asuna again and her skin was bright under the almost dark sky.

“You know, I think it’s completely natural to think of such things in this day and age where VR and AR are becoming so prominent and mainstream. It was surprising to me how many people adopted The Seed even after the ALO incident. But then I realized that these new worlds offer so much that real life doesn’t, and that is what draws people like a swarm of flies around a lamppost.” 
I stared at Asuna in wonder as she explained her perspective on the turn of technology. Her answers were so practical and made complete sense. It reminded me of our quarrels in the lower floors of Aincrad and a small smile appeared on my face.

“Ten on ten, Asuna. Come on, it’s getting dark and the teachers might catch us on the terrace at this time. I’ll drop you home since Suguha won’t be home early today because of her Kendo class.” I grabbed my partners arm and we made our way to the main entrance of the school building. We talked about our day and Asuna stomped my feet a few times for making bad puns. Soon we reached a crossing which was 10 minutes from Asuna’s mansion.

“What happened to your application, Kazuto?” Asuna remembered and inquired as I put on a solemn face in order to reply to her question. “I got rejected, pretty hard at that. The mail was actually almost frightening. The way it was written made it seem like they didn’t want me to even hear of beta test.”

A week after the funeral, I got an alert from my mother’s magazine company telling me that a secret beta test was going to take place and needed beta testers. Staying true to my prior “Beater” status, I decided to check it out and apply for the closed beta. The device and game in question seem to be on an Augmented Reality platform and still have some months before release. Not a lot of information about this strange new AR device has been released. Public knowledge only included the design (which looked like a 2018 headset and mic) and the name – “The Augma”.
 
As we walked, I decided to explain my understanding of AR and VR to Asuna who never understood the point of AR when VR had become so mainstream. “You see, when we log on to ALO, we in a way leave our bodies to occupy our avatars in a virtual world, a completely different world from our own. Our bodies are on beds but our minds are occupied in flying and questing in another world. We can’t feel actual world sensations when we’re in ALO because of the AmuSphere blocking our nervous paths. It’s called “Virtual Reality” because we are no longer in a reality that we normally are a part of. The thing about its counterpart, Augmented Reality, is that we don’t leave our own reality behind like we do in VR. We have the ability to take virtual objects from the Virtual World and bring them into the real one, in other words, we can “augment” them into our own world.” I stopped to let Asuna digest the information.

Her expression as though she was deep in thought, Asuna looked up and accidentally tripped and lost her balance. My newly found reflexes and strength from all my gym workout paid off as I managed to grab the falling maiden in my arms and bring her back onto her feet. If this had happened on the earlier floors of Aincrad, she would’ve instantly turned red and kneed me in the stomach. Instead, she looked at me with a gentle expression and thanked me. I could feel my cheeks turn a little hot as I brushed away her thanks kindly. She locked her left arm in my right and went back into her thoughtful mood.
 
“So you’re saying that in Virtual Reality, we basically leave our world and body and delve into another one, virtually.” I nodded and prompted her to continue. “It almost sounds like some horror movie when I put it like that. However, in Augmented Reality, we’re in a way inviting another world into our own by bringing elements of the virtual world into what we perceive through touch, smell and sound to be our reality. Is that accurate?” Even though it had been a recurring theme over the last two years, I still found myself dumbfounded by my partner’s ability to grasp concepts so quickly. I nodded and added to her statement, “The thing is that Virtual Reality has made amazing breakthroughs in the last 5 years. In comparison, the Augmented Reality sector staled a lot in 2020. The last global hit to come out of AR was a game where people had to move around with their heavy duty headsets or smart phones in order to capture creatures around their area, which were augmented onto their phone screens via a camera and GPS.”

The moment I finished the sentence, we reached Asuna’s giant house. My partner smiled at me and gave me small kiss on the cheek and said, “Seems like this new AR tech might be a breakthrough! I can’t help feel a little suspicious though.” I understood her perfectly, we both had been in a good amount of terrifying incidents to know how dangerous new technology can be, and still we both couldn’t help but feel a rush of excitement when a new game tech came around. Asuna’s expression turned into a grin and she rushed into her house while shouting her standard “See ya tomorrow!”

I waved while witnessing her slender form and long hazel hair disappear behind the teak door of her house. I spun on my heels for some reason (probably in response to that kiss) and turned around to head home. I had to head to the local station to catch a train to my area but that wouldn’t take more than 10 minutes. It left me with a good amount of time to go over the incidents that had happened over the past month. The public appearance of a fishy AR device, a new AR game that had no information leaks (quite a feat in this day and age) and the most concerning of all, the reappearance of a painfully familiar name – “Koujiro Rinko”
Before I knew it, my stop had arrived and I prepared for the 7 minute walk home. It was pretty dark and I had no intention of hanging on the streets any longer. I still had to get to Yui and finish her mechatronic reality switch which was at an 80% completion stage. I also had a ton of homework to finish before I logged onto ALO to participate in the clearing of the current floor of New Aincrad. I had almost forgotten about the mails I had to exchange with Kikuoka about my internship. There was still so much to do before my day had reached its end. I decided to leave my thoughts about this new AR platform in the thought box to pick it up at a later time but as soon as I remembered that email about the beta test application, I felt a sudden shiver and an eerie feeling like as if something didn’t feel right. Maybe it was just my part paranoid nature from the SAO days kicking in or maybe it was a premonition of some sort. I walked into my home leaving those thoughts at the dimly lit doorstep as I walked into the bright and fragrant living room.
 
“Welcome back Kazuto!” My cousin sister’s friendly voice echoed from the kitchen and I couldn’t help but smile and reply, “I’m back!” 





















Afterword:

Hey guys, thanks for checking out this short fan story. I hope you guys had fun reading it. The main reasons as to why I chose to write this are the following- 1. My summer vacation is going on and my English is getting rusty from learning Kanji and Japanese. 2. I’m spending a lot of time playing Pokemon GO so I thought, “What a time to be alive, Pokemon GO and Ordinal Scale are two AR related software coming out one after another!” 3. I wanted to help clarify the difference between VR and AR for those who don’t understand. I just finished high school and I’m heading to Canada for university all the way from South Asia for Computer Science specialization in VR and Artificial Intelligence. You can understand why I find SAO so interesting haha. 4. I thought it would be interesting to write about what happened in between Yuuki’s death (;-;) and the release of the Augma. I tried my best to foreshadow the events of Ordinal Scale and Alicization to the best of my ability too :3

Anyway, thanks for reading, I might write more of these short stories depending on whether people think it’s good or not. Have fun guys! Also, upvote if you think that this is a good way to explain the AR/VR difference for other people to see!

4ssa3c,7,2016-07-14,im burned out,crispytunic,Marriage_Sucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage_Sucks/comments/4ssa3c/im_burned_out/,"i'm 27(m) and my wife is 23(F). We got married two years ago but its been anything but great. About 10 months ago she quits her job to become an actress. i say ok i'll get a job and go to school so u can follow ur dream. i was making somewhere between 3500-4200 a month. i had a $13 hour job plus i used to be in the army and since i was going to school i got an extra $2000 per month for that. our expenses not counting food were $1250. some how we are struggling to pay our bills on time. i find out that she's gone to count it 3 auditions in four months and has been sitting on her ass the whole time. when i figure out the whole acting thing is a lie so she can be lazy i also find out that we might not be able to pay our rent this month unless i work everyday 10-12 hours a day for a month straight. which is exactly what i did thank god my boss and the guys who called in sick back then. 

At the end of my work spree i go this is no way to live i have $20,000 in an IRA acct. im going to take out $15,000(ending in $12,000 due to taxes) that way we dont have to live paycheck to pay check.just to recap she quit her job in Oct this was late Feb.

keep in mind i wasn't keeping that close of an eye on our checking acct. because i wanted to trust her.  I honestly thought that if i cant trust her with this money then i cant spend a lifetime with her. plus when i pulled the money out she said she would try and find a job. she ended up working on her's realtor license which she got it in april.

a week after mother's day she starts working at a real estate agency. she doesnt get paid at this job and it seems like she spends less then 10hrs a week doing it. however if she sells a house she will get a commission. It seems like an internship but not really at the sametime. I cant imagine an intern would ever sell a house but i was hopeful.

On mother's day i find out that our checking count went from $12,000 to $7,250 i go wtf. she says she has no idea. so i leave it alone. in early june her family comes to visit. On june 20th i check our acct again and we are at $1,100 just enough to pay rent. 

I'm at the breaking point. through these 2 years i've noticed im becoming less and less then the man i was before i met my wife. i was confidant, witty, and believed all things were possible. Now i'm a zombie version of myself. i make stupid easy mistakes constantly. i have almost no control over my emotions. Im terrified of having sex with her because what if i got her pregnant now she can milk me for all i got. most importantly i feel like ive been cheated. I feel cheated/betrayed.

The money plays a huge part but she's easily gained 75 to 100lbs since we got married. i never made so much as a peep about it and always told her i thought she was beautiful. i have cooked more meals then she has. and ive been working the whole time we've been married. 

I know this is a lot to read and i dont think anyone's going to read it. but if u do read it i would like some advice on divorce. If i should or shouldnt get a divorce and if so how should i go about it."

The reason is due to the high cost of lab equipment is not within my budget whereas the requirements to learn software development is only a computer. Already I have learned a fair amount of C from schoolwork, and my current internship as a data scientist involved learning SQL. My question is what language I should move onto next? My library of PDFs is very extensive with multiple textbooks covering C++, Java, Regex, Unix, Python, R, LaTeX, Ruby&amp;Rails. I was thinking that if I wanted to expand on data science as potential career than languages like Python and R would be extremely beneficial, but I'm open to input from the /r/learnprogramming community as they might have a different point-of-view and be more knowledgeable on the topic. Personally I think learning Unix and Regex would be useful but, to be honest, I don't really have any idea what I am talking about. If you have time please explain what you think would be the best course of action going forward about the question. Thank you!

PS: If you have any additional programming resources besides the ones listed on the sub please feel free to share. Always am looking to try out something new on the off chance that the resources at my disposal are not geared to my learning style or are tough to follow. "

Amazon prime day happened Tuesday, so I have started ordering parts. The thing is, I went into prime day unprepared, and I don't know how great my decision making has been this far.

**What is your intended use for this build?**

 I am an avid gamer, so I play a variety of games (including rust, fallout, league of legends). I am looking to be able to play and stream most games on high+ settings with little difficulty.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? Between high-ultra settings. I'd like to get at least 60 fps and most likely will go 1080p with my monitors. 


**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**
I would like to pick up two decent monitors and keep the total build below 1250$. I can get windows 10 from university for free, and already own a keyboard, mouse, headset, etc.

I've already decided I'm staying in this city and not going back. It's the end of my third week and I really want to stay at the place I'm interning since it's a top company. 

I expressed my interests in my first week and the manager said we could talk in a month. I ended up applying to a bunch of places while also getting hit up by recruiters and now I have 5 new opportunities (whether it's a phone call, coding exercise, coffee...) that I am trying to juggle. 

The phone calls are definitely easier for me since I can just take a lunch and talk to the person who calls me. However there's a guy who wants to meet me in person and I'm assuming some of these 5 leads will turn into some sort of face to face. 

Thing is though my top pick is the company I'm interning at but I don't wanna miss out on the other ones either in case I don't get an offer at my first pick. 

How can I juggle this?"

Musically, I've played piano for 14 years (took 6 years of classical lessons) guitar, bass, and percussion for 12. My uncle is a guitarist/bassist who's claim to fame was playing rhythm guitar in a YMCA house band back in the '60s, who won a battle of the bands and got to play a set with the Byrds. He gave me a few open chords to start learning guitar and I took it from there. 

I took percussion lessons through public school, always won superior in our district competitions, and played with guest artists like Chris Coleman and Steve Smith in my 4 years playing in our school percussion ensemble. Alongside that, I also had 3 seperate successful auditions for bass, then guitar, then piano in our jazz band all while playing guitar / singing / writing for my own indie band. At 18, I was hired on with the nearby multilevel music studio to teach piano to ~25 students for a year. 

At Uni, I've taken roles like assistant musical director / accompanist for our production of Little Shop of Horrors (taught pit their parts, taught cast their parts from libretto, led rehearsals, played piano, conducted the show) and after a year of jazz guitar studies, played guitar for a semester in the combo and twice in the big band. I also got to play nylon string flamenco/classical, archtop 20's jazz, and some 80's-esque strat parts on guitar for our production of The Addams Family. 

As I finish up this coming semester, I'll be leaving for an internship with a really experienced mastering engineer (learned the trade in Nashville back in the 60's, ran the nearby Uni's studio for 20 years and has ran his own mastering house for 25 years) but I'm not sure where to go from there.

I feel really grateful to find a paid internship in anything remotely related to my field, let alone the studio. It seems like you've got to starve yourself and sleep on the curb and be a free coffee runner / maid for 1-2 years before you're even considered for that cable runner position. So my idea was to try and find the most worthwhile paid internships that I can, and bounce between them until I find something. 

I haven't written any songs since high school, but I'm pretty experienced playing a lot of different genres and I'm about equal across guitar/bass/piano/percussion. Lately im studying a lot of chord scales, partimento, thoroughbass, voiceleading etc. type harmony at the guitar and the piano. My dream is really to work my way up to producer in a studio somewhere, and to be that producer that knows just what the song needs to sound like production-wise and competently lay down session tracks to breathe life into arrangements.

I've always thought there was some sort of magic in being able to put a great song together on order, but have always been told that you either have the craft or you don't. I thought I had a good start with the earlier stuff I'd written (and recent compositions) but I really think it'd further me as a producer to learn a bit from a career songwriter.

Has anyone here interned or apprenticed under a successful / career songwriter? Would you say its harder to get your foot in the door and land a paid gig than the studio? 

Would love some advice on where to go after this mastering internship and how I might begin my search for the next paid music gig. 

Thanks!"

I've held internships since my senior year of high school but I was premed &amp; biomedical eng before switching to CS so they were coding for research purposes.

4sucom,5,2016-07-14,It's been a long 10 years for me... (long post),Chelo7,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/4sucom/its_been_a_long_10_years_for_me_long_post/,"I am 22 years old and here's my story. It all started 10 years ago in the summer of 2006 when I was 12. Around this time, my mom accused my dad of cheating on her with this woman who worked at an office in a synagogue that we had been members of. My dad was the treasurer of the synagogue, so he spent a good amount of time there and became friendly with the people there. My mom is a school teacher, naturally she gets summers off and was looking to spend more time with my dad. Thats fine and all, but he works a full time job, works a little real estate, etc... 

Anyway, summer of 2006 became one the worst summers of my life. I was absolutely infatuated by my parents. I loved them together and they were basically my superheroes, my best friends. They would constantly fight, not even normal marriage fighting, but screaming and hollering and this would scare the shit out of me. I was 12 years old and this was possibly the demise of my parents marriage. I would be so upset everyday fearing the worst. They ended up staying together, but my mom had insane trust issues with my dad. 

Following the summer of hell, my two brothers were in college and my sister lived elsewhere so I was alone with them. Nonetheless, my family is/was very close. We keep in touch daily and we go on vacations often. Everyday was a constant challenge because there would be so much tension, and it would only get worse from there. 

Fast forward past more fighting and me constantly being upset and anxious about divorce to high school. Summer of 2008, my mom was diagnosed with a couple of debilitating diseases and this changed everything. At this point, my childhood barely mattered. Since my dad was working a full day and had meetings and other things to attend to, as well as my siblings doing there own thing, I was left to basically be the caretaker to my mom. 

My mom continued to work as a school teacher, but the two diseases would change her completely from a happy person who was amazing to be around to somebody I would just feel numb towards. She wasn't the bad guy, nor will I ever see her as that. However, I don't feel I can retrieve our relationship that we had prior to this. She loves me way more than I love her and it sucks because I wish I would be able to reciprocate.

My siblings over the years would help from time to time and say things to melike, ""I am sorry you have to deal with the two of them and their fighting."" Or something like, ""I am sorry we haven't been around as much."" This is the best one, ""Sorry you are the one that has to take care of mom."" At first, I was bitter and upset that they weren't around, but then it took me a while to realize that its okay. It is beyond anyone's control, life happens. 

During my high school years, I lacked any motivation to do well, I would get low B's C's and basically just get by in my studies. My parents weren't really around to help me or motivate me. The only motivation they actually tried was threatening about going to the local community college. This initially scared me because I thought at that point, it would be over for me. 

This did not sink in until my junior year when it was a little too late. I bombed my SATs and I knew my parents were disappointed. It was memorial day weekend of 2011 that my life would basically change. I was all out of options until one of my friends brought up they were going to the local community college their senior year of of high school for an early admit program. At that moment, I thought that this was an opportunity to grasp and a brand new start. 

I was accepted into the program and thats where I started to flourish. I became more independent and doing much better than I did in high school. Stayed there for two years. Through the duration of the two years I was there, I had 3 jobs/internships to keep me busy.

It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows though, for things would just get bad. My mom and dad continually fought and finally my dad just left. This ruined me. I will never forget what I said to my mom when she told me that he left. I screamed at her. I said, ""WHAT DID YOU DO?"" Honestly, I felt terrible for her and I felt like an asshole for blaming her. I rushed out of my house and drove to my best friends house and ran into my best friend and is mom and gave them giant hugs while crying hysterically. 

One to two weeks later, my dad came back. But this wouldn't be the first time he would leave. Anyway, Memorial day weekend of 2013 would come. Remember what happened two years earlier? Well, Memorial day weekend of 2013 was 100x better. I was at work the thursday or friday before we went on vacation, and I was checking my email and I received an acceptance email from The George Washington University. I had no idea how to react, I was ecstatic! While away, thats all my parents, my brother and I would be talking about. This was a huge win for me. I never thought I would have been accepted to a school like that. 

My first year of actual college starts and I am a transfer. It was a great place to be and I instantly fell in love with the school. However, they put the transfers basically in no where near the middle of campus. They put us in singles in a dorm that was connected to a 7/11. This was a decent/poor year for me. November of my sophomore year, I became ""addicted"" to pot and would smoke constantly. I got fat and I would not even try. Prior to that, I tried joining fraternity as a legacy but I hated it. 

I hated the fraternity because I thought it would be an easy process, but boy was I wrong. I would get hazed by people my own age and I blamed my anxiety on leaving. I was weak and I couldn't do it. I wish I had the balls to have gone through with it and made lifelong friends, but I sabotaged that opportunity. Later, the fraternity was disbanded and many of the brothers blamed me, but I never told administration about any of the hazing. 

Later that year, I was in danger of failing more than one class, my then girlfriend broke up with me because I barely gave a shit about the relationship, many people hated me for something I didn't do. I was in a deep depression, so I skipped class one day and went to the counseling center because I desperately needed help. After a few visits, I decided to turn my life around. I started dating someone new, and worked harder in my classes. I honestly don't really remember that summer, I think I worked a few jobs and had some fun doing other things.

Junior year of college was better, not much better, but better. I lived in the middle of campus and had three roommates who were okay. I made a lot of different friends and connections that year. I also found my passion of fitness and nutrition so I attacked it by storm and started eating really well and going to the gym frequently. I also ended up getting an internship for the summer following junior year at my colleges strength and conditioning program. 

That summer was unbelievable. I became closer with my female best friend and first friend at GW, also became really good friends with my roommates and did some amazing things. That summer is also when one of my brothers got married. I ended up bringing my best friend as my plus one. 

Now, this girl is amazing. She is one of my best friends, but I have liked her more than that on and off for almost 4 years. We've gone on a few dates, but nothing ended up happening. Secretly, I would marry this girl in a heart beat. 

Man, I'm getting bored of writing more of this, but IM ALMOST DONE. Bear with me. Senior year was great. I made a lot of friends and did well in my classes and all together it was a great year. I graduated this past May. It was such a relief. March of this year, I bought study materials for a personal training exam I will take in August. 

Remember when I told you that my dad would leave again? Well, he did a few weeks ago. I more or less told him to. I knew how miserable he was with my mom. He didn't love her the same way he did 40 years ago. I get it. None of us care anymore. My siblings and everyone else knew this was going to happen, we're basically numb to the situation. My mom lately has become insufferable though. Currently, I am studying for my PT exam and will most likely pass it, and I am ""seeing"" this 32 year old woman who has three kids. My life is actually getting better and I am excited to see whats in store for my future. 

I honestly would not change anything about my life and what I have experienced. All of what happened as made me the man I am today. I am proud to be me. "

My internship started in early June. After the first week of training and orientation, my manager gave me an assignment, and directed me to one or two employees to help me along. He didn't give me any deadlines.

For about two weeks I made steady progress, but then as I entered into territory of the project which required a more intimate knowledge of how the company's development platform and API's work, I began having to frequently ask those one or two employees or my manager for guidance. Now, they provided me the information I needed, but I usually had to wait an hour or two sometimes for them to get a free slot in their schedule to talk with me.

After a week and a half of slow progress, it came time for my midsummer review. My manager told me that he thought I was picking everything up well and learning a lot, but told me that he thought I'd be finished my project by now. I was a little surprised since this was the first time he had ever mentioned the timing of the project to me. I asked him what he suggests I do and he told me to put in some overtime and asks questions whenever they come up, the hopefully I'd be able to finish the project by mid-next week.

That was on Monday. Early on last week he did daily code reviews with me where he'd try to give me a little more guidance on what to do, but after a couple of days he had another employee do it with me instead. Since the review I've started putting in about two hours of overtime every day, and I've been messaging or emailing my manager with questions as soon as they arise, but it takes him even longer to get back to me about these correspondences than before the review.

I get that most employees are busy and they don't really care what non-time sensitive project the intern is working on, but I feel afraid that it's going to reflect poorly upon me if I don't finish this project soon, which is seeming harder and harder to accomplish.

Anyone have any experience or suggestions on why to do?"

Unfortunately I don't have that luxury on the way back as they will both be in NYC for that week visiting their kids/my cousins. 

I am planning on either having a friend fly down to Tampa and we can hang out here for a bit or have him fly to a location along the trip that we could stay at for a bit and he will ride back with me.

What are some suggestions of where to stop as a good half way point? (or place to meet at?)

All I can think of is Clearwater/Sarasota/Tampa but I can't say I know Tampa the city well besides people telling me to avoid Ybor

I am a International Relations major with a double minor in education and computer science
my current internship does project management work as well as work with software platform migration and user training and this is where I really felt consulting or project management would be a good fit... travel, collaborating with new people, helping clients/users understand the new software, etc

1. What are some things they might be looking for/asking about in the interview?
2. Is this sort of reference induced interview give me a higher chance of getting placed in an internship position?
3. Is it OK that my technical knowledge will be limited, i'm just familiar with basic knowledge of the company and what distinguishes them

any words of advice would be helpful, thanks in advance!"

Should I go through with it?,Kshxuab32,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/4svixj/want_to_change_my_life_should_i_go_through_with_it/,"So I’m at a point in my life where I need to make some changes. I have just graduated college with an engineering degree but since I avoided trying to get internships/interviews, I am left with no experience on my resume and no job. I’m 22 years old and have had no friends to hang out with since I was about 13 years old and I think it has to do me with being afraid of confronting people and thinking I’m going to be laughed at and ridiculed for just being a loner and not having friends basically.


My parents are breathing down my neck expecting me to get a job and I just don’t see it happening since I have no experience and have very little contacts in the industry. So I know I am basically going to have to ask around and go to networking events where I have to sell myself which is very awkward for me. I know what I have to do yet I keep delaying this because I am so worried about how people are going to think of me. First of all, I know I will get ridiculed because people who know my college know that there is ample opportunity to get internships and jobs after college that its actually rare that you don’t have any experience after graduating. They are going to wonder what I did all my 4 years at college and the only thing I can point to is my shyness and Social anxiety hampering my thought process and motivation to be more social and network with my peers.  So I’ve decided that I don’t want to settle for this life of living at home and working at part time jobs with a depressed attitude, I want to change that and go out and find people who can help me get the job I deserve after toiling for 4 years for that degree. 


So I already know I’m going to force myself to go talk to people, I just want something that will make it a little easier and I know for sure that it shouldn’t be this hard and it’s not this hard to talk to people for others. I’m like sweating and heart racing nervous for other stuff my peers do so calmly and non-chalantly. I’ve never been diagnosed or talked to any medical professional about my mental thoughts on this, only my mom pretty much. So basically I’m hoping to go to my general family doctor and tell him what I’m feeling about my Social Anxiety and hoping he will just prescribe me some medication right on the spot and have me on my way. Basically I make this post to ask you guys if this is a sound idea and if I should go through with it.

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

-------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up (would love her to look like Madison Ivy)

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S also looking to role play Marvel/DC, Game Of Thrones, The Witcher and Mass Effect

4svrj4,1,2016-07-14,[EVENT]Combating Disease Spread,Derp53,worldpowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/4svrj4/eventcombating_disease_spread/,"Like, China, India has a massive population and a large amount of trade coming out of the Pacific region. It is therefore tantamount that the Indian Government implement measures to control this virus and work develop a vaccine as soon as possible. Furthermore, emergency measures will be set in place as soon as possible to counter all possible vectors of the disease. India would also like to cooperate with China, Indonesia, and Australia on the development of this vaccine and would stipulate the end result be open sourced so that all can use have easy access to it. 

Indian Disease Control Measures to be put into effect immediately and extended indefinitely: 

- Surgical masks will be distributed publicly and all people will be required to wear them or face a 100 USD fine for every infraction. 

- Schools, train stations, government offices, and all public places will be required to install hand sanitation fixtures and keep them supplied as necessary. 

- All poultry products will be removed from the shelves and a massive exam on India's farms, slaughterhouses, meat processing plants, and canning facilities will be undertaken. This measure will be undertaken in increments so as to keep the market stable. However, there will be an advisory against the purchasing of poultry till all sources of poultry based meats are verified and approved. 

- A public advert program advising against stigmatization of those infected will be released in primarily rural areas, though adverts will be expected to run in urban and suburban areas as well. 

- All citizens and travelers will be expected to check for infection and those infected will must be quarantined in their homes away from other people or in specialized hospital wings where the infrastructure will have as much support as possible to handle infected persons safely and effectively. 

- Travelers from other nations who have been infected will be given the option to return to their nations of citizenship, and be handled as a ward of their country as that country see's fit. Or, they must present themselves to the nearest hospital for quarantine as soon as possible. Failing to do so will cause police action to arrest the aforementioned foreign national and forcibly intern in quarantine while the matter is brought to attention of their country of citizenship. 

- Air travel will have mandatory health screenings for infection at all terminals and gates in all Indian airports, train stations will require masks for transit and said masks will be provided as necessary, land travel across the borders from Myanmar, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, and China will require screenings in order to insure the traveler is not infected. If a person is found to be infected, they will be turned back and the Indian Government will send notification to that nation that one of their citizens has the disease. 

- Hospitals will be granted subsidies to operate quarantine wings and the largest hospitals in every region will be designated as quarantine coordination control centers. Police and the Army will cooperate to track those with the disease who refuse to be quarantined and arrest them. 

- The Indian Government will back research into a vaccine using surveys of national blood tests to develop anti-bodies and mass produce them for injection into others. Additionally, the attachment site of the galactose protein will be analyzed to see if an inhibitor can be designed to block virus function completely. 

One point of order is that all transit facilities, doctors offices, police stations, post offices, and other public places will have free masks for citizens and travelers to use. It is encouraged for all to use these to prevent transfer and ingestion of fluids that might occur from infected persons. Gloves are also encouraged for handling certain objects such as doorknobs in areas of mass transit.

4svw61,1,2016-07-14,Should I leave this unpaid internship?,Testonetwothreee,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4svw61/should_i_leave_this_unpaid_internship/,"So I am currently in college pursing a degree in CS. Like every college student I wanted to get an internship this summer and landed an unpaid internship at a startup. I started on May 31st and since then I have done a ton of work for the company, some of which is currently live, and I feel as if I should start getting paid for the work that I do. There is no lead developer there, just three unpaid interns including myself, who just do what they are told. They have never had a full-time developer, just an array of interns, who come into the company, BS around a little and leave. Honestly, I have no idea how they are still running, and the current codebase that they have is horrendous, but yea. I wanted to get your opinion on my current situation. Now that Im writing this post, I'm beginning to realize how ridiculous this situation is, I am currently writing code for them, using my own computer, because they have none in their office, and commute to the office location three times a week on my own expense. Im not really sure what to do. The internship is set to end around the end of August, Should I stay? Or should I go? I will say, I learned a bunch of javascript since the beginning of the internship. 

Thanks you for reading my rant, Have a good Day :D"
4svz26,5,2016-07-14,How to quit my job with integrity?,meister245,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4svz26/how_to_quit_my_job_with_integrity/,"Hi everyone,

I have been working dutifully as a QA software tester intern for 15 months at an MNC. I have recently graduated and I'm looking for full time.

I talked with managers and there weren't any open full time positions for a good while. I am doing the same job as any full time employee for less money, it's been alright while university lasted but it just won't do it anymore.

I've been job hunting and I have already passed the final interviews at another company for a System Administrator position and I'm awaiting the decision on whether they are going to hire me.

The twist is, the management at my current workplace had a change of heart and they reached out to me with the possibility of a full time employment in the near future.

I am very curious to try out new things in IT and I don't see myself in 3-4 years time enjoying my current job. Job hunting has been an eye opening experience for me, I am still searching where my passion is at in IT.

My dilemma is the following:
- The company heavily relies on interns (who can quit anytime).
- There is an enormous project, that has been in planning for months and if anyone leaves, it will hurt the project
- There aren't any available people that can take over my job and I'd have to train a replacement. The project is a month away and requires experienced testers.

If I quit my job, I may be jobless for a while, but I don't know how to break it to my manager. Contractually I'm not obliged to stay, but I would be leaving in a time of need. I believe the company is at fault for making our department like a house of cards (too many interns), but I am also friends with the managers and colleagues and I don't want to leave a bad reputation by leaving now.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it?

extra info: I can legally work as an intern until 1st August, the soonest date I will hear if I have been hired at the other company is after 25th July"

It's rough to deal with when you're on the receiving end of it as an intern or a desktop tech. It's difficult to deal with as a manager. It's a pain for everyone.

It's obviously not everyone, and part of why I love my current job is that presently we have nobody like this in our area at all which makes the entire environment great.

I see it on here as well. 

I think it comes with people who have a job others don't understand and underestimate what it takes to get stuff done. It's just not appropriate behavior though. Even if someone is a jerk to you, you have to take the high road and keep in control. "

Damon says:

&gt;“I’d consider anything with the right director, but I can’t imagine there are any superheroes left, I think they’re all taken at this moment.”

&gt;He continued: “If he (Ben Affleck) was directing me, I’d jump on it in a New York minute. I’d love to work with Ben.

So if Ben were to be directing it, that means it would have to be a DC film. Matt, who’s likely not much of a comic-book fan, if at all, says he doesn’t think there are any left, but obviously there are plenty. So would you all suggest? Other than ROBIN, as I’m sure several say as a joke. Even him playing Nightwing/adult Dick Grayson, wouldn’t really work since Damon and Affleck are the same age. 

So taking into account Damon’s age, 45, my first thought was Ted Kord, the Blue Beetle. I believe it’s already been established the Kord Industries exists in the current DCCU. Like Batman, this Ted could be an experienced hero, who’s been doing this around 20 years. Perhaps the plot of the film could be him planning retirement and looking for an training a replacement, choosing one of his young interns, Jamie Reyes. 

My other thought, if we want to go more high profile, is have him play Hal Jordan in the Green Lantern Corps. movie. That’s what just popped into my head, what do y’all think?

Basically I wanted to know how to split $80 into savings and debit, whether or not to buy a new Volkswagen Jetta or Passat (18,000-25,000) and if UConn (45,000 a year) would be a feasible goal since I am out of state and have no college savings besides a general $500 savings account I started myself. Thanks so much to everyone who has helped and is continuing to help me! I feel better about my plan now. 

UPDATED PLAN:
1. Continue to study hard and keep up my 4.9 GPA or higher to get as many scholarships/aid offers possible. 
2. Apply for as many scholarships as possible. Look into Lion's Club and other deaf specific scholarships or aid. 
3. Look into in state universities or consider doing 2 years community and 2 years university. Ditch the UConn idea since $180,000 is too expensive. Apply to UConn anyway and see if the scholarships are good. 
4. Look into RIT and Gallaudet U. Consider Uconn's online Internet teaching degree plan.
5. Don't buy a car, use a bike or public transport. If I do buy a car, it will be a used Toyota Corrola or a Honda Civic. 
6. Enjoy $20 from allowance every month by putting it in debit, save $60. Look into a higher interest rate for my savings like Ally bank.
7. Get a job as soon as I turn 16 over the summer. 
8. Take AP and college credit classes and get those completed before I graduate early (if I do). 
9. Continue doing side jobs like pet sitting. 
10. Try to get an internship or entry level job in an IT related career. 
11. Think about sign language tutoring on the side or a channel for videos to earn extra money.

Anyways, throughout our friendship, she was always late to everything. Hangouts, literature circles, group projects, no matter what, she was late. It only truly irritated me if it was just her and I chilling, she made excuses for being 15-30 mins to 2 hours late.

I started getting fed up with it and she said she would make an effort to be on time, but it never happened. The school year has since ended and we no longer have weekly meetings.

But.. we have an internship together. Because I can't drive yet, my punctual father picks up my friend and drops us off 15-30 minutes early. I think we have been 2 minutes late once, but that's about it. I don't expect anyone to be that early, but not only do I prefer it, my dad also works abroad and if he's in town, he's on call with his company, and has to get back home to his meetings. The internship is about 45 minutes away

My friends parents are supposed to pick us up in the afternoon, because my dad has his meetings (or is abroad) and my mom has to take care of the elderly grandparents who are visiting from abroad. She usually takes us in the morning if dad is in Canada, and again, she's very punctual.

So her dad comes 1 hour late, sometimes 30 minutes late, to pick us up. The internship ends at 4, he comes sometimes at 5:25. It was normally fine, we would walk around the area and chill. Now, they've amped up the security because two minors went missing once. And so all students have to be released by their supervisors to their parents, but if the parents are late, then the supervisor has to wait with us

Imagine making someone wait that long! And my friend/her family don't even care. This is what really happened though. The director of the internship said that if we aren't leaving on time, then we'll be kicked out of the program. A program like this is super helpful for me and my future, and my friend isn't taking it seriously. Today was supposed to be another ""last warning"" (we've had 2 already) and her mom came 20 minutes late. I'm scared that it will reflect on me when my dad has been dropping us off extra early in the mornings. I told the supervisor that it's not my fault, it's hers (she wasn't in earshot) and she said that she would let the director know the situation, but she couldn't make any guarantees.

What do I do without being rude? Her mom today was like ""I was only 20 minutes late, chill"" and my friend told the supervisor that her parents had stuff to do too (The supervisor asked her to have her parents come earlier since her family was waiting; btw this supervisor is pretty young, only 26 and getting her phd too)

My friend gets super angry over anyone saying literally anything to her. For instance, I said ""You shouldnt listen to music that loudly in headphones, it's not good for your ears"" and she was like ""That's a lie"" and I said ""No, it's really not good, it can rupture your eardrums"" and she got super angry and moody with me

So if I ever say ""Your parents are late"" then she will jump on me (I've mentioned it before a little bit, she got angry)

TLDR: Friend's parents are ALWAYS late in carpool situation. My internship is threatened because of THEIR irresponsibility. Need help addressing the situation."

(AUS),pinkpostit2005,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4swt3p/between_graduating_and_my_first_job_so_many/,"#Can I afford to take an internship between my degree finishing and whenever I get my first job?

29Y F in final semester of physiotherapy degree (VIC). Classes finish end of October, no Board exams here, but can't legally work as a clinician until industry accreditation ~ mid Jan. Obviously there's a huge rat race mid-Jan and Feb for jobs, but have been told it gets easier from March onwards if you can afford to wait. I think I'll definitely have a job by June '17 although have heard in NSW new grads can go 12 months before they find their first one. My goal is to get into private musculoskeletal in metropolitan VIC, which is middle-of-the-road difficulty to get into (not as hard as hospital/private neuro, not as easy as aged care). If possible, I also want to find a GOOD first job - something with a mentoring aspect and strong continuing education program because we new grads really do come out ""fresh"" and need help growing up/learning all the things uni didn't - or can't - teach us. 

I'm thinking of lining up some internships between Nov '16-Feb '17 to get more experience/make myself more employable, understanding that I can bail when I get a new job or extend as required. Here's where things get tricky - though I'm currently studying in VIC and think I should start my career here (much lower living costs etc), I'm originally a Sydneysider so all my family (free accommodation and living expenses yay)/friends/contacts are in NSW. And they're GOOD contacts - I've already wrangled my way onto the physio teams for National and World-level sport championships during 2017 (unpaid but usually accommodation and meals provided). Pity they're not looking to hire, surely this should be a good training experience/CV addition? (All these contacts have worked for the Olympic physiotherapy team and have had various interns also go on to work there; one of them has already agreed to be my referee)

So, interning has major pros, including free accommodation during a time when my Centrelink payments will probably end (**unless I'm eligible for Newstart, which I don't know much about? Can any Australians enlighten me?**). I'm currently freaking out about the VIC side of things, the least of which is the prospect of flying from NSW to VIC for job interviews. 

Around mid-Nov, I should have $25K in savings - I also have a house full of furniture, a rental property I love currently leased till Mar '17, and a car (which I can drive from VIC --&gt; NSW and back if required). My current plan is to intern in NSW during Nov '16 - Feb '17 (where I don't necessarily expect to get a job; hopefully I can find someone to sub-let my place during that time eg fellow classmates looking for an interim place to stay), then return to VIC from Mar '17 onwards and just work any kind of job to help cover bills until I find my first physiotherapy job. I also have a freelance project which could also bring in passive income (working from home developing online training modules for an arts education company - my boss is eager for me to start but supportive of my academic study load, although obviously the sooner I get products out the better).

**Does this sound like a terrible idea, or an okay one? :/** I've gone through this so many times in my head I can't tell anymore. In an ideal world I'd be able to stay in NSW indefinitely until I get a job (cannot express how valuable those internships are as a learning experience, I learned so much last summer), but not sure this is realistic. Am also wondering if it's wiser to a) stay in VIC and work any old job to earn money until I land my first PT job, or b) transfer out of my lease (currently till Mar '17), move back home to NSW and base myself at my mum's house until I find a VIC job?"

4swzrj,11,2016-07-14,Me (31F) with my husband (26M) of 2 years: he was mean and not supportive when I was was having a crisis bc of a reaction to a medication,Arewegoingtobeok,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4swzrj/me_31f_with_my_husband_26m_of_2_years_he_was_mean/,"Hi. First time poster and I really hope you guys can help me.  This may get really long, and I'm sorry, but I am desperate right now.

Background first: husband and I have been married two years, and he has been away most of the summer for a high-stress internship in another state.  I work in a high-stress job with long hours (12-14 hour days 6 days a week) on top of taking care of the house and the cats while he's gone. We have been bickering more than usual because of the lack of regular communication and the stress we're both under.  One major issue we've had trouble with is that he gets downright mean when he is angry, like saying things he doesn't mean or calling me names.  He is usually the greatest person, my best friend, and someone I want(ed?) to spend the rest of my life with.  The worst thing I can say about him is that he's sometimes a little selfish (aren't we all?) and that when he's angry, he resorts to name-calling.  After our last fight, he agreed he will be trying to find a therapist for himself when he gets home, and we are going to try a couple sessions of couple's counseling as well to work on communcation.  I don't know about him, because he's told me that before (he has issues with depression and anxiety), but I know I will be pushing him hard on the couple's therapy because we need it.

We both used to smoke, but he quit about a month ago, and I promised to quit before he comes back from his internship (we've both quit several times before and he started smoking again, so I started again, and vice versa).

I went to a doctor and was given Chantix to try.  I've been taking it for a few days, and other than not sleeping well, I hadn't had many issues.  Until last night.

I was on a day to up the dose, and had been in a bad mood all day.  I got home exhausted from work and took my second dose for the day.  About an hour or so after taking the Chantix, I start to feel my heart racing and have a panic attack.  I also start having suicidal thoughts (apropos of nothing) and thinking about harming myself and I am irrationally angry (not even at my husband, just at everything) and I want to scream or punch something, and I am not a violent person at all.

My husband texted me around that time about buying a video game console.  I texted him back to do what makes him happy, but then responded with a second text saying ""Sorry I'm just having a really bad day and that frustrated me."" Then I listed all the ""unnecessary"" things he's spent a lot of money on lately (hundreds of dollars on clothes, a guitar (he doesn't know how to play) and accessories he barely uses) and reminded him he gave me shit about a $20 part for my car because it's ""unnecessary and we need to save for a down payment on a house right now.""  It took me a long time to compose that text, because I was panicking about what was going on in my brain and I felt like I was going crazy. And I was trying to not let that show in text.  I wasn't mad, just annoyed/frustrated.

Well, he blew up over text.  He said he wasn't getting into it with me, I was being purposely obtuse and he's ""not buying it now so [I] fucking win.""  I sent a long text saying I wasn't trying to fight, but that I was having a really bad day and it just made me frustrated.  I also said to buy the console because we have the money, but I was just trying to tell him I was frustrated because he talks me out of things I want to buy all the time.  

So then he calls me and it blows up into a huge fight.  I told him I'm not feeling well, I think the Chantix is making me feel really really bad, and he starts raising his voice and cutting me off.  I'm trying to talk to him (and I'm raising my voice at this point), and he keeps interrupting me, so I can't even tell him what kind of reaction I'm having to the meds because I can't even finish a sentence before he interrupts to tell me I'm being irrational.  So I snapped and started screaming at him that I am panicking and feel like hurting myself and I cannot do this right now.  I punched myself in the thigh so hard I have a huge bruise today.

He hung up on me. I proceed to punch my bed and cry and just freak out.  He then texts me ""if you get depressed, I'm here, otherwise good night.""  I told him he doesn't seem to give a shit, and he replies back ""I do, but I have no desire or obligation to sit here and convince you of that.""

So I called him (obviously crying) and told him that I am having a severe reaction to something right now and having self harm thoughts and thinking about suicide and I need him to be supportive and understanding and help me.  He then said he wouldn't put up with me yelling at him for any reason, which caused me to start screaming, and he hung up again.  

He then texts me that we are separating our finances immediately and he's not doing this anymore.  I told him I can't afford to live here (I uprooted my whole life to move halfway around the world for him to go to school) and I wouldn't be here if it weren't for him. He said fine, take your cat with you.  So I said just divorce me and he said ""fucking leave me alone and let me have an hour of peace.""  Me, being in the middle of seriously contemplating suicide for the first time in my life said, ""I'll give you peace for the rest of your life.""  He called me a drama queen.  So I sent him a screenshot of the Chantix website saying the mental reactions that are possible (I guess I figured he didn't believe me) and he just said ""call your doctor.""  It's 10 at night.  

At that point, I finally go a hold of a therapist I know, who talked me down a bit over the phone, continued to text me every hour into the night, and checked on me this morning.     

It went back and forth with my husband for a bit over text and he said he didn't want to text all night, and I called him one last time.  I told him I don't care that he didn't want to, I needed his help and it's easier over text when I feel like I'm out of control right now.  He started yelling again that I ruined his night, so I started yelling back (or as he put it later in text ""screeching"") and he called me the worst person in the world and hung up again.  We went back and forth over text again, with him saying I'm being fucking stupid, etc, and ended with a ""fuck you."" I sent a long text about not insulting someone who is suicidal, and that I wouldn't hang up on someone who is either. He responded ""K"" and that was the last text with him for the night.

This morning he sent ""Let me know you're alive when you can."" and nothing else.  I just replied yes.  I was at work and slammed today, so I didn't text anything else.  He sent me a text a little while ago asking if I was just ignoring him now and if I still want a divorce.  I told him we can talk after I get home from work tonight and he said he's going to be busy. 

I feel like someone who loves me would not act that way when his wife is in crisis.  I have NEVER ""threatened"" suicide or acted like I did last night in the entire time he's known me.  I am stunned that he didn't realize this was so out of character for me, or display any empathy at all.  I feel like this has permanently changed how I feel about him.  I can't trust him to support me when I'm literally having a mental breakdown due to circumstances out of my control.  And while I was ""screeching"" divorce yesterday while I was in the middle of a mental breakdown, I still feel like this might be the end, because I don't know that I can be with someone so callous and uncaring.  But then again, this is totally out of character for him too.  What do I do?  

I will apologize for how I acted last night, but I need him to understand that this was a severe reaction to a medicine and not how I really feel/behave even though he should know that at this point.

Also, anyone else have this kind of reaction to Chantix? How long does it last?  I've felt like I've been in fight or flight mode all day and I sitll feel jittery and keep having dark thoughts.  I will not harm myself though because I didn't last night and this is not as bad.  The therapist (she's a psychiatric nurse practitioner) said that it can stay in my system for several days, take xanax and text her every time I do so she can check on me.


**tl;dr**: husband was mean to me while I was suicidal due to a medication reaction. I'm still having effects from the meds and not thinking straight, but this has severely affected my feelings for him.  What do I do?  Also, anyone else have severe Chantix reactions? How did you deal with that?"
4sx40y,2,2016-07-14,My [18 f] boyfriend [20 m] keeps drinking by himself almost every night and I'm getting worried..,baebeelove,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4sx40y/my_18_f_boyfriend_20_m_keeps_drinking_by_himself/,"I first met my boyfriend in a college class and instantly had a crush on him. This was January of this year. We started dating in March and one thing I really respected about him was that he was kinda against drinking and partying so we'd spend our weekends together while our friends were out getting wasted.

Now I have attended parties and gotten drunk before, but after a few parties they all just became the same and I didn't feel like it was how I wanted to be spending my time. I don't look down upon the students who choose to party every weekend, I simply tried and learned it wasn't for me. And up until lately I thought my boyfriend was on the same page. He was even further turned off by drinking than I was.

Then the semester ends and he lands a summer internship with a beer company, mainly just delivering beer to stores and stuff, and is now surrounded by beer and coworkers who are regular beer drinkers, and suddenly he starts changing. I don't even know how he gets the beer because I assumed no one could really just let him have it at work because he's still underage. But I guess people may be lenient and not care or something. So that alone worries me, like how he even gets the beer.

Also, we live a few hours apart now that we're both home for the summer so we've only met up a few times and mainly stick to phone conversations as our main form of communication. So when he's been calling me lately, he'll talk about how he just drinks the beer he has alone in the shower or in his room when he's sad or stressed. The conversation we just had tonight was horrible. He was so distracted and slurring words and not really responding to what I was saying and saying he felt like he was getting even more drunk. 

I'm really worried because it was such an extreme change from where he was a few months ago and I don't know if or how or when I should get help for him or try to stop it. I get having a few beers with friends or whatever I just don't think it's normal to be drinking several on a nightly basis. I know it's his life and I can't tell him how to live it and I've kept my cool and been really patient, but now I'm getting worried and don't know what I should do (if anything). I just really like him and don't want to see something like this end the relationship. I also worry if I leave him for this he'll just drink even more and go down a steeper hill and just really mess himself up. 

I also think I worry a little extra because I watched a cousin of mine face alcoholism and he ended up okay and has been sober for awhile now, but things got really messy and he lost a lot of good things he was working for.

Thanks for your attention and any advice you have. I'm just worrying and don't know what to do and thought some anonymous help from others could help ease my mind a little. 

Tl;dr My LDR boyfriend who once wanted nothing to do with drinking is getting drunk by himself several nights and I worry for his health.

I'm in a good but not amazing public business school in the United States.

I will be a second semester Sophomore this coming fall majoring in supply chain management, however, I would not lose any progress towards my degree if i switch my major to any of the following options: Finance, Accounting, Information Systems and marketing.

I have started to think that the path I am on in business will not lead me to a happy adulthood. I took a semester-long full time internship this spring on an investments team with a fortune 500 company.

 Despite how great this opportunity was, I hated the culture and the work we did. I ended up being very excited when the internship finally ended. This work experience is why I am now second guessing a business degree.

I have a strong interest in the medical field, although I don't think I would be making a realistic choice if i attempt to be a doctor. I have pretty decent grades in the business school, (3.4 GPA) but I don't think I could handle med school. The affordability would be an issue too.

I'm really just looking for some advice. Would it be a good idea to try to change to something smaller in the medical field? Pre-PA, or maybe become a registered nurse? Should I stick it out with business? Any opinions on how my situation makes you feel, please let me know."
4sx8ou,0,2016-07-14,Should I get my Masters or just get the 150 Credits in Undergrad?,Justsomekid8,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/4sx8ou/should_i_get_my_masters_or_just_get_the_150/,"I need some advice.

Background: I am going into my junior year in college and I feel like I am in a great spot to think about whether or not I should pursue a Macc or just get my 150 credits in my undergrad. I have been interning with a Big 4 firm since my freshman year, and this summer is my 2nd year with the firm. They like me very much and I feel like as long as I don't do anything completely stupid, I should have a full-time offer from them when I have my 150 credits.

The situation that I am in right now is deciding whether I should just power through my undergrad and get the 150 credits or get my Masters. Previously, I was 100% for just going the undergrad route, however, I have been starting to 2nd guess myself because a Masters in Accounting may prepare me for the CPA Exam. Also, a Master would mean that I can drastically decrease the amount of credits I am taking per semester in my undergrad. The only thing that is making me not want a Masters is the amount of money that it costs (about $25,000 from my accredited university). Not to mention the fact that I wouldn't need the Masters for a job offer as well.
Other things to know:
I want to have the majority of my CPA Exam finished before my start date. The Macc program at my university is 100% online. I did my calculations and if I took the undergrad route, I would only need to take two summer courses at a community college and count my Audit internship for next summer as credit. I believe the Masters route will give me less stress, but I do not want to take out any more loans than the ones I already have.

I know I am extremely anxious, but I appreciate any advice that you all may be able to offer. Thanks."
4sxcal,65,2016-07-14,First internship has me wondering why I even go to school for CS.,SlyHeist,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4sxcal/first_internship_has_me_wondering_why_i_even_go/,"At my first internship this summer we are developing a web app. The whole process of picking a framework, learning it, planning who was assigned to what features, working through our user stories, and seeing tangible software that thousands of people are going to use begin to form gives me a feeling so incredible I can't even describe it. This is exactly what I want to do for the rest of my life. 


All of that being said, the thought of going back to school this fall to learn ""software development foundations"" and ""data structures and algorithms"" sounds like the most boring thing in the world. I don't want to stop making things, I don't want to lose my drive for CS in the semantics of computing as a science. What I think I really want is to work software development as a trade. 


All of this being said, dropping out of school is just too scary of an idea. I love the idea of working full time software development without having to deal with tests and homework at the same time. It is difficult to work on personal projects and be a student at the same time because I need to maintain a very high GPA to avoid any more loans. I am worried that I will be shooting myself in the foot really hard down the road if I were to quit now. 


I don't want to take on any more debt. I don't want to learn what makes a language Turing complete. I don't care to learn any more about parallel processing in CUDA. I just want to make software that people love to use and I want to start making it ASAP. 


Did anyone else go through this while you were in school? Did you stay in school? What do you do today? Sorry for this dump of information I am just really self conflicted right now and need somewhere to talk about this."

I just found this sub and I'm not sure if I'm doing this right. I apologize if I'm not. 

Anyways, this has been a hard year for my girlfriend and I. We met at a conservative Bible school together and fell in love. She is my reason for everything I do. 

While there, I was studying to be a Pastor. I loved learning, mostly independently, and I loved teaching others something new and interesting. I had a real passion for the religion as well. However, I always had an issue with how conservative the culture and beliefs were.

After 3 years of classes, I started an internship at the perfect church for me. It was very liberal and encouraged me to expand my beliefs. I felt challenged and encouraged. I asked the pastor for a job and got hired. The money was awful, and I very quickly discovered that the Pastor and I did not work well on a professional level. I got completely burnt out and my partner and I left the church after sticking it out for a year.

Around the same time we were experiencing personal stress related to our families (being disowned, etc.) for our changing beliefs and the fact that we moved in together. We lost a lot of family and friends from leaving our faith tradition and it has left me feeling very empty.

When I started the job, I had also made the decision to leave my university. I transferred to a state school that was much cheaper and attended by mostly people returning to school. I loved the maturity of the people I was in class with. However, I have not once felt challenged by the coursework or engaged by my classes. I have been really struggling to balance school with the stress of home and work.

Now I work driving for Lyft part time (even after expenses it pays better than the church did), have failed several classes, and can't seem to get myself out of bed most days. I have so much debt from working towards a mostly useless degree that I'm not sure I want anymore. 

I think I need to take some time off school while I figure out what I want. Im a little over a year from finishing, but I can hardly go another day. I love problem solving and I love helping people through hard situations. I am a good listener and I enjoy teaching, just not kids. I also really love the feeling of being my own boss and would strongly consider self employment.I still have a passion for the Bible even though I don't still believe in it's literal interpretation; or God for that matter. I'm just not sure what to do next.

Any advice?"

- Tease Patch
- Promise Exciting 'Things'
- Release Patch where everything is harder and costs more and almost nothing that was broken is fixed. Abandoned heroes stay abandoned because we can't monetize a hero rework.

- Patch is not well received because, well, it broke things, people in raids at the time had them end and got nothing.  Maybe give them wookie shards as compensation? Nah, too much, we'll save that one for later.

- Draft a CYA Post to forums, usually a page long, where bullet points of 'we hear you' and 'we are working on fixing things' are used while saying an actual page worth of nothing.

- Roll out patch that increases costs and lowers drop rates. Make sure you let people know that they are heard and that these improvements are totally because they are heard.

- Oh hey, I just realized, we should have events that REQUIRE the use of all the crap heroes that we can't be arsed to update to be competetive. Then people will be forced to invest time and crystals into heroes that are useless elsewhere in the game. Awesome, make a note to Darth Steve in accounting.

- What, people are still rambing over there in the internet slums? Type another vague page long ramble about how we are listening and totally fixing things but shut up about taking your consumer rights seriously or seriously there will be consequences. Seriously. Nice things only, or else. But be patient okay? We are totally your friends. Or Else. but smiley face. but seriously, or ELSE.

- Be sure to tell Barb we can't make it to her mom's chemo session because we have to be there for the christening of Emperor Salera's third yacht  that he can take out on Sacramento's beautiful..canals? Probably going to call it Darthy McDarthface  III, it would only make sense after teh first two.

- Note to self, don't make notes to self while typing up Patch Release Protocol steps.

- Darth Steve in accounting apparently says that planned obsolescence was always a thing and over half of the early roster heroes are just shovelware filler to create a sense of diversity and I should mind my own business which is..typing stuff. Darth Steve is a jerk, unless you're reading this and then you're totally not. Also it wasn't me who stole your tuna fish sandwich from the break room.

Dear SWGOH humans,

Look, I know you guys are upset and getting all grumpity because your treadmill speed got reset and you're unfortunately looking at the same picture of a Rancor taped to the window in front of you. See, normally, a game company would give you new shiny content like a new raid, or starships with a 'gear reset' so that you'd focus on the new shiny while starting the new grind over that essentially reset your previous months worth of efforts, however, we're not normal. So you get Rancor 1b with your reset.  Basically we just stealth nerfed the mechanics that were working and voila! instant challenge again! (For a week or two, until everyone has spent money getting mods and upgrading them to get back to where they were. It couldn't possibly take longer than that, right?) *Oh crap, I just realized it might. They should probably nerf the drop rates and increase credit costs and make sure the interns aren't put in charge of the backend math on the mod system and...oh, not my job, right*

My point is, this is all an agreed upon illusion. We put an amazing star wars skin on a competitive slot machine (Seriously, kudos to those graphics and sound guys, spot on work, right?) and you guys  try your luck and (hopefully) money on this thing every day. It's not about the fun guys, it's about nostalgia, right? Fighting each other with nostalgia. Strangers in the arena or heck, even your own guildmates. It's about pitting you all against each other to where you have to spend money to get the edge. So..fun, right? You know, for kids!

What I mean to say is, we all know that it's not about gameplay. It's about triggering false dopamine responses by the accumulation of shiny digital action figures and their blow dryers and shelves (Now with a half dozen assorted geometric shapes!).

So be nice.  We're in this together.  We give you nostalgia under the thin veneer of a game. You give us money. His Holiness Salera cashes out the money into singles and then on weekends I get to wheelbarrow it all into the Scrooge McDuck pool. You get dopamine, I get job security. That's fair right? I mean, you wouldn't be here if you weren't enjoying yourself, right?

- Great, apparently INTRN-451 was watching me type this up over my shoulder and is now talking to a security Roomba and..oh that doesn't look good. I think I'll save this here for now and get back to it lat"
4syc7c,10,2016-07-15,I feel like I've lost myself and my mind over the course of this last year.,MahaMarr,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4syc7c/i_feel_like_ive_lost_myself_and_my_mind_over_the/,"Hey there, /r/anxiety. I’ve got an issue that’s been building and building ever since January, and I’m really hoping writing this out and putting it out there will help me out, however not comfortable I am with letting this all out. A friend of mine recommended I open up about my situation here, a situation I’m not proud of in the least. This story’s long, but TL;DR: I feel like I’ve sabotaged myself and regressed back to square 1 again with my career and life because of my compounding anxiety and ego, and I’m trying everything I can to get back to how I was and regain my confidence and love for what I do. But I’m losing my fucking mind. 

Some background before I get into everything, I’m a graphic design college graduate who’s been out for a year, being fairly successful as a freelancer while trying to figure out full time employment. I’ve been living with my family back in my hometown since my graduation in 2015. Now, I’ve lived in my hometown all my life aside from dorming at college. It’s a small town, a rural place where everyone knew everyone else growing up, even from day care through high school. The town was a fishbowl honestly, as everyone grew older, they formed their own cliques, and everyone on the outside were just left to their own devices. I was one of those outsiders, acquaintances with everyone but never really close friends with anyone. I never really came into my own until my college years. I explored myself, made new friends, and had some great opportunities to do awesome design work, and I felt on top of the world coming out of those four years. Come graduation, I was a student leader, and I had clients from all over the area, a couple of internships, and I loved what I was doing and wanted to explore more areas of design. The only thing was that there weren’t really any industries that I wanted to work with back home, so after a short vacation, I took the clients I had and went freelance, listening to freelancing and designing websites, podcasts, YouTube channels. I was geared up to take on the world, and the rest of 2015 was awesome.

However, 2016 started off with a really sour, stressful note, with both of my parents being laid off from their jobs within a month of each other. My Dad being laid off the morning right before I had an interview with this huge ad agency, which I was already anxious about before we received that news. The two of them had been laid off before while I was in college, and while they got back on their feet with time, it was an incredibly stressful period for everyone in the family, although I was away from the majority of what went on at home because I was living on campus. So understandably, those feelings and memories came back for everyone, and this time I was sitting front and center, and I felt somewhat helpless to help them sort it out. I was bringing in money, but only enough to help me pay off my student loans. Now, instead of getting a part time job back in my hometown, which I felt would have started to undo all the personal development and progress I’ve made since college, I drilled this thought of “I’m not a good enough designer or freelancer, so I have to get serious.” This is when my first panic attack set in, when I started doubting myself and what I could do, and what I was doing. As in, on the floor, running my hands through my hair kind of panic attack. I really liked the work I was doing just because of the work, the money came afterwards, and to be frank, I was still working that whole aspect out. This was the first time I was managing and negotiating paychecks, at that point I was making more money than I had ever really made before. On top of that, a few of my other friends from college who graduated with design degrees found that designing wasn’t really for them after their internships or for whatever reason, and gave up and grabbed part time jobs of their own. Instead of thinking that that was alright, and that everyone has their own paths, a small part of my mind’s doubt told me that “you’ll end up like that.” And that thought terrified me even more. So going from feeling on top of the world in that post-grad honeymoon feeling to feeling more stress and pressure not to fail than ever before. What a way to kick in 2016.

During the months that followed, I got more freelancing work from clients prior and new, and I started reaching out to a lot of my friends and professors from college to get any advice from them about how to go about my situation of not being a good enough designer, and what to do. The work I was doing freelancing was good, but I knew there was something more that I wanted to do than the work I was getting just from word of mouth. I didn’t have direction, something I wanted and needed if I wanted to get better. However, the advice I got from one of my professors, someone who was my advisor and close friend through freshman year wasn’t exactly what I had expected, that life doesn’t always turn out what you expected, but you’re well read, you’re smart, and I know you’ll find your way. However, the class she asked me to sit in on turned out to be one of her last classes. She was always an eccentric teacher who preferred her classes be more about life rather than what she was actually supposed to be teaching about. During that class an argument between her and one of the freshman students erupted, and the student stormed off to talk to the higher ups. That, and a previous incident when one of her students climbed out of a window during her class, and a string of other incidents I wasn’t aware about in her recent years of teaching, resulted in her taking an early retirement after 35+ years of teaching. And I was right in that class when it all went down. I did get to meet and become friends an older student of hers in that class though, and we connected over this feeling of being lost, and possibly a bit of depression. So there’s a little ray of sunshine with all that, but still feeling lost.

As stresses with freelancing, home life, and everything else starting to brew in the coming months, I started becoming more and more frustrated and panicked about what exactly I was doing a few months prior to being out for one year of college. My Dad was becoming more and more stressed about unemployment and finances, and started talking about the possibility of maybe moving and downsizing to another smaller house if things came to that like months down the line. The thought of that terrified me, as this was the house that his father, my grandfather built, and where we had lived for our whole lives. That thought in mind, I still chugged on with my freelancing work, but the enjoyment was slipping bit by bit with each mounting frustration and stress outside of it. I started becoming restless during the day and especially at night, where I started Googling things like “Post Grad Depression” and “Anxiety,” basically whatever I was feeling at that moment hoping to find the right answer. That became routine, as I dug myself deeper and deeper into that Google hole. I started finding the same articles on Thought Catalogue, Forbes, every fucking melodramatic site and blog. And yet I kept reading that shit like it was the bible, hoping every time something would click, but only bringing me more dread about my future, that things don’t always work out the way you want them to, and that “27% of graduates are actually working in the field they graduated in.” That shit terrified me. The worst day of that March came when I had to drive my Dad to the ER following a stroke scare. He was fine, absolutely no stroke, but that stress of feeling so useless and small and everything… the whole situation just stressed me out, and I was even more anxious for the future and what would happen. Our family was on top of the world last year, and now it seemed like everything was slowly falling apart along with the rest of 2016.

I started taking my job searching and design minding more seriously within my field, but the industry situation still hadn’t changed. Luckily within a month after the ER scare, my Dad lined up a new job, and our financial situation was all set. That gave me more room to figure out my searching and take up more freelancing, but that feeling and awareness of how much I needed and wanted to become a better designer was still there. I felt like I was falling behind my other designer friends of out college, and that fear of failure was still prevalent. A short vacation before we got back into working gear in the beginning of the month was supposed to help us all unwind, but I felt more stressed than ever. I couldn’t let my mind unwind from these thoughts of becoming a better designer, not knowing how or where I wanted to focus on, and now this feeling that I wanted more independence from my parents and start taking more charge of my life. The anxiety and nonstop thinking kept me up at night and woke me up in the morning, it was all I could think about. 

Come April, I signed up with a creative staffing agency, and after a short interview, I was set up to start working a two week gig in an ad agency just like I wanted back in January. Holy shit, this is gonna be great. I can get another perspective on designing in a fucking ad agency, I’m gonna learn so much, I’m gonna be in the big city, shit’s gonna be great. And it was. I did great work, and they actually extended my contract for another four weeks. I felt great those first three weeks after so long. Things were really looking up. I still had a bit of that anxiety, but shit was good.

Then the next three weeks rolled in, and the work, the commute, the freelancing I was still doing on the side, all of it started chipping away at everything. I started making small mistakes that kept adding up, and the art directors around me could see that I was having somewhat of a hard time. My confidence started breaking down bit by bit as these stresses got to me more over time, and admittedly I didn’t have a good way of handling it all at the time and unwinding when I got home. I was so focused on learning as much as I could from the job, but seemingly all I could think was that I’m failing at this so hard, and this is not the kind of ad work I want to do. All that fear and anxiety and frustration came to a relative head during those last two weeks, where I was either zoned in on getting the work done, and whenever I had a break, I had the crazy mood swings, from feeling lost, to feeling spoiled, to feeling guility, to feeling calmed, to feeling confused, to whatever emotion came after that, and the cycle continued. I lost touch with my friends, and I was so emotionally drained at that point that during one lunch break, the thought that I couldn’t really connect with them anymore and that I was okay with that… that fucking killed me. Panic attack, sobbing outside of the building on this busy city corner talking to my Mom about how everything’s not okay. Complete breakdown. 

I knew at that point I needed help. I needed help very bad. I called up a therapist I had met with earlier in the year when I was initially freaking out, and started meeting with her after the agency gig was over. I was happy to have that gig under my belt, I loved going into the city, and the commute coming home wasn’t bad at all. Everyone at the agency said I was doing a great job and that I just had to keep it up and I’d go on to great things. Still, I never really felt as low as a I did then up until that point, and all that growth I felt felt somehow misguided. The gig wasn’t everything I expected it to be, or at least I got out of it less than what I thought I would, and I felt more confused about designing than ever. Something hit me those last two weeks though, like a blast from the past. I really more into the illustration and animation portions of designing, or maybe just illustration and animation in general. I was fired up, I knew of a few places where I KNOW I wanted to be, just way outside of my region of the country. Still, I had goals, I had ambition, and for the first time in a while, I kinda knew what I really wanted to be doing. Ish.

Back home, back freelancing, back in therapy, back with a new set of goals to shoot for, summer was coming… nothing could be better, right? Absolutely not, and I wish I was fucking kidding about that. As soon as I came back, all that stress and confusion about what I was doing had grown exponentially as the days back home came on, and that drive to go after animation and illustration died more and more. And I had no clue why. I was at a loss. I was back freelancing, I was back home, I was… back. So why does it feel like I’ve gone back too far? My confidence was still shot, and being back home, still not in control of this anxiety and stress and fear and confusion about the future, I felt and feared that I would regress to feeling and acting like I did back in High School, when I felt like everyone walked all over me, and when I wasn’t really myself. Suddenly all these past acquaintances started coming back into my life, still in our hometown, and for one reason or another, settled down for our small town. And yet they moved on with their lives. Meanwhile, I was back home, feeling a shitty as ever, and allowing these past memories and feelings to come back into me. I felt like I was going to lose everything I worked so hard to have, the person I became, the confidence I built to take on the fucking world, and yet here I am. I felt like my past life in this town was doing everything it could to suck me back in, and I wanted no fucking part of that. I was done with this place, I had to be. I need to be. I still need to be.

At this point, I was driving myself mad to get back that drive and that love for designing, illustrating, animating, ANYTHING to get back to who I was. I drilled it into my head, “Don’t fall back, don’t regress, etc.” “I shouldn’t be here, Why am I still here, I don’t belong here, I’m past all this.” I had to gear myself up again to get back into the fight, but no matter what I did, I felt stuck. I still feel stuck. The therapy sessions seemed not to be working, as after every session I felt some relief before that doubt and anxiety and those fears came back stronger than ever like the days after that. I couldn’t deal with it, and I started lashing out at my family in complete anger and freak out mode, as some sort of way to recover my “confidence” or whatever, which only made things worse, and I felt so shitty about how I made my family felt, which made me feel so sorry, and so immature, and therefore so small, and regressive. It’s a vicious cycle where anything I tried to do in that state to make me feel more independent and in control backfired immensely and compounded the stress and the anxiety, and that feeling of worthlessness and misdirection. I was force myself to get into that design mind frame, that I had to know better, I had to know more, I had to BE BETTER if I wanted to get out of here soon enough and start living my life before my town ate me and swallowed me. 

By that point, the mood swings, the anger, the anxiety, everything I was working so hard to protect I was destroying, and something had to be done. I met up with my doctor and was prescribed an antidepressant at the advice of both her and my therapist until everything evened out and I could think clearly… and it was fucking terrible. The first three days being on that prescription made me a zombie, and I felt like I couldn’t do anything anymore, that I was useless, that I was so dependent on others that I could never feel like myself again. The drugs had the exact opposite effect on me, caused me insomnia, and every day was terrible. I honestly felt so stressed, so anxious, and so lost and confused and terrified that I couldn’t do anything anymore, I don’t know what I would have done if that continued. I was losing my mind. I couldn’t tell what day it was, what year it was, and certain triggers made me feel like I was in a different point in my life, points that I felt my lowest and lost. I was losing my mind. Eventually I called my doctor the Monday after that weekend, got off that shit, and everything mellowed out on its own. 

Now I’m at a point where all the progress I made in the city, all that drive I felt to become a better designer and all of that is still somewhere deep inside me, but it’s harder than ever to pull out, even after things have calmed down. I’m still having anxiety about my future now, and designing, illustrating, animating, all this stuff… I don’t want to give it up at all. I’m recovering slowly, I feel like now I’m falling back into these old patterns of Googling my feelings and symptoms again, not getting any sleep at all, and now feeling like time’s still moving forward faster and faster and faster now, and yet I feel like I have regressed in a way. I’m still going to therapy, but I feel so lost right now, and this anxiety about the future and now making the best possible move towards a future I’m not 100% confident about because of this doubt… I want to get that passion, that confidence, my old self back again.

I just want to love life again. I want to love what I do every day like I did coming out of college, taking on the world. And yet I can’t seem to escape this rut, this hole. What I’ve done in the past hasn’t worked, and now I feel so fucking old. I want my old self back.

I know I’m missing some details here, I’ve been up all night writing this all out. But I’m really hoping I can get some advice. This anxiety is not me in the least, but it's consumed me and my thoughts for the duration of this year, and I’m scared it’s what’s going to define my future. I think I know what I want, and I don’t want that taken away from me now that I could be in a place and position to get it all if I just get past this fear."

I graduated in Summer 2015 and since I am still looking for a Job in Germany, I've updated my Cover Letter and my CV for American Companies.

Since I am not a native speaker I would appreciate if you Guys check this Cover Letter. It is an application for an Internship in a digital marketing agency.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Sir or Madam,

Online Marketing is my passion. Since you are looking for an Intern who is motivated to show flexibility in adapting new trends and someone who is smart and passionate about finding the new status Quo, I would like to apply for the Internship position advertised at your Homepage.

In Summer 2015 I graduated from the Wiesbaden Business School as a Bachelor of Science. Because of these studies, I’ve learned a lot about marketing and because of my Internship at the Zurich Company in Wiesbaden, I was able to enhance these skills. 

I am a very ambitious person and to improve the quality of my work constantly I use every day to learn something new. Besides creativity my characteristics are the attention to detail, as well as persistence and the accuracy with which I work.
 
My last employers were able to benefit from these skills as well. Because of my outstanding performance at my Internship, the Zurich Insurance Company took me over as a working student. 

Since October 2015, I work self employed as an Online Marketing Manager and as a Web designer. Because of this work, I was able to learn and gain experience with the creation, the adaption and the optimization of a website as well as with On-Page optimization, Keyword Planning, Content Management and Social Media Marketing. 

For my next career step, I would like to become a part of razorfish and I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss the position and my candidacy with you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because I wasn't employed since August 2015, I mention in my CV that I was self-employed since October 2015. The part of my CV looks like this:

Since Oct 2015
self-employed as a Marketing Manager &amp; Web Designer, International 
*Keyword Planning
*On-Page Optimization (HTML5 &amp; CSS3) 
*Content Management 
*Social Media Marketing

What you think about this?
 

Many thanks for any Help!!!"

4sydj1,16,2016-07-15,My Coming Out Speech (critique welcome),sharlette,actuallesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/4sydj1/my_coming_out_speech_critique_welcome/,"On Saturday I plan to deliver the following speech to all of my closest family. They think that I've requested them over to talk about my upcoming move to the US, but that's only part of it. They are about to learn so much more than I think they could ever expect. Here it is...

My loving family, 

This is the last time we'll all be together like this before my big move. To this point I've made you believe I'm moving for my career. The truth is that my career is only part of this. The most important and the most amazing reason I'm moving is for love. When I was in the States for that internship last year I met someone incredible, someone who started a fire inside me, and that fire gave me the light I needed to finally see and love all of myself and this life. This person is the greatest person I've ever met......who isn't my family. SHE [emphasise] is the love of my life and she has allowed me to feel depths of my heart I couldn't have imagined were there. 

I love her as much as I love any of you, and I know because of the love I feel from all of you that you will be able to accept this revelation and not let the fact I'm a lesbian harm that love in any way. I know this because we are an amazing family, and also because I suspect this won't be coming as much of a surprise, right? I mean...look at me. You must've known, right? I hope you knew or suspected or that if you didn't that this will not come between us. I love you all so much. That I'm a lesbian doesn't change how I feel about any of you. It changes nothing except now you know why I've never kept a boyfriend or been happy in relationships with men. I'm still me. I'm just being honest about who I am now, more honest than what my hair style or wardrobe can say about me. [I'll probably be crying, maybe hysterically, by this point, or maybe that's only happening in my practice speeches, but at this point I'll probably sit down and let my family have their say, and I'll be hoping for the best. After the dust settles though I'll continue, improvising where necessary depending on reactions.]

There's one more thing I'd like to do here now, and that's to give you a chance to meet Eleesha, my fiancée. She knows I'm doing this right now and she's ready to meet you all on Skype, if you want to. Do you want to? 

End of Speech....


After that hopefully they all want to meet her and they get on well. We'll tell them we intend to marry next year, and that they'll all be welcome at our wedding. And then in 2 weeks I'll be moving in with her, and now that I'm not just stalking you all from the shadows I'll be sharing it with you. 

What do you think of my speech? Good? Bad? Need to start over? My family are really amazing and very liberal so I don't think any bad will happen, but regardless I can't help having some intense anxiety thinking about what I'm doing Saturday. All I can hope is that my speech is good enough. "
4sykc4,1,2016-07-15,"So many directions to take my learning in, looking for some advice",Grycen,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/4sykc4/so_many_directions_to_take_my_learning_in_looking/,"Hey everyone, I've been a lurker in this subreddit for a while, and the community and resources here have been massively helpful. I find myself at a bit of a crossroads with my learning, though, and searching through previous posts and the various FAQs and Wikis hasn't provided the kind of clarity I'm looking for, so I figured it was time to put myself out there a bit and get some more personalized feedback/suggestions. 


So, this is where I'm at/been: 

I'm a CS student, with about a year left in school and had been programming for a while before then. I dabbled in game development here and there, with my CS102 final project being a text-based ""game"" (quotations because it frankly wasn't very fun, mostly there to demonstrate my knowledge of OOP, language's data structures, etc.) I made in C++. Shortly after I finally dove into game development with Unity using all kinds of resources (Ben Tristam's course was the first thing that really kicked off my learning there) and got increasingly better at it, then started picking up some Unreal. 

At the moment I have two jobs, one for a non-game dev software company where I intern mainly doing CI/CD/DevOps work, mostly in Python, as well as a contract with a local game developer where I am a programmer on two different projects, one in Unity and one in Unreal. The great thing about this setup is that I'm getting great, continuous experience and answered the burning question I had for a while on whether I'd be happier pursuing a career in game development over other subsets of software engineering - definitely the former, I still enjoy software development in general, games are just a type of problem I enjoy solving a loooooot more (plus there's the enjoyment of making an artistic product, but I'm digressing).


This leads me to where I'm going and where I'm looking for some input. Now, disclaimer: I know no one can tell me what to do exactly and that's not what I'm looking for. I suppose it could be anything from a ""this is what I did, and what I'd have done different/the same"" or ""this is what I'd do and why"" or ""I think you'd find x valuable given you said you want y"" - whatever enlightenment you feel like sharing. :)

At this point I know I'll continue to grow my Unity/Unreal experience, which is fantastic, I enjoy working with those engines and learning their nuances. Aside from the consistent experience I'm getting with my second job, I am also joining game jams with friends and the like to continue skilling up and expanding my portfolio. That being said, other than the example of the text-based game I built for a project back when I was starting out, I've done very little coding a game from scratch (there was a couple of other games in Python when I was learning the language, but nothing nearly as complex as that first project even). 

I know I really want to, ultimately, build my own engine. Not necessarily for anything other than the knowledge of doing it and as portfolio work. I also worry that I may have ""skipped some steps"" by never having done anything with a library like SDL/SFML, and I still very much feel like an apprentice in the craft of programming, and I think my understanding of the fundamentals will become much more robust by doing some of the work that the game engines handle for me.


What I'm looking for advice in is where to go next. I am aware of several books and resources on the topics above, like Jason Gregory's Game Engine Architecture and Casey Muratori's Handmade Hero, and some others that are more in the ""recommended classics"" for programmers in general, like Code Complete. I also have some others that focus on vector/game math. I don't know that I'm at the level where something like Code Complete or Game Coding Complete would be as beneficial/advisable, and I'm not sure if it makes sense to kind of ""work my way"" into working on an engine by doing stuff with libraries like SDL/SFML.

What I know is that I need to get better intuitive understanding of lower-level programming/architecture, memory management, good algorithm design, 3D math, etc. and just good software development practices in general. I fully understand it's a matter of just getting more practice, I just have trouble deciding where to go next.


Wow - I wrote more than I expected to, so I hope I didn't bore you all away. I'm definitely thankful for all the valuable insights I've picked up from this community's activity in the past, and hopeful some of you can throw in your 2 cents for an apprentice looking for some guidance. Thanks a lot for just taking the time to read this (and, if you felt so compelled, respond)! :)"

As exchange Student with a J-1 Visa, if you find yourself an internship and your University agrees it matches your Major, you can extend your Visa for your internship for a maximum of the time you have been here for studies.

As I am from Germany I have a bunch of questions how to proceed with this in the United States.


Let me say a few words about me:

I am a graduate Student in Computer Science with the main focus on Computer Graphics and Image Processing. 
I currently have an average GPA of 3.5.
I finished my undergraduate studies in Computer Science with an average GPA of 3.0, and my Bachelor Thesis (yes, in Germany we need to write a Thesis to finish your undergraduate studies) got graded with GPA 4.0. I also wrote a research paper on the Topic of my Bachelor Thesis that actually got published to am (small) Computer graphics Conference in Europe. (http://wscg.zcu.cz/WSCG2015/CSRN-2501.pdf, ""Adaptive depth bias for soft shadows"" if you're interested)
I think my CV Looks pretty good on the ""soft skills"" side, as I did a lot of volunteer work as a volunteer youth leader.

Of course preferably I'd like to get an good internship for computer graphics at a big company. My dream internship would be at Nvidea I think. But I would also take more ""general computer science"" internships, if I can't find anything for computer graphics.


So, now all the questions I have:

1. Overall, how easy or hard will it be to find a good internship and at least an internship respectively.
2. I am studying as exchange Student at CalPoly until late March 2017, so the internship should begin in April. When should I start applying? Directly when I arrive in September, or would this be to early?
3. What is the best way to apply? Search for offered internships online and apply for them, send applications on my on initiative to companies without specific offerings, or drop of my resume at a Career Fair at CalPoly?
4. What salary can I expect?

4syodx,8,2016-07-15,"I [20F] have depression and mum died, when I told my friends [19-21 M&amp;F], they stopped talking to me",throwaway568086,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4syodx/i_20f_have_depression_and_mum_died_when_i_told_my/,"Throwaway in case someone I know has reddit and recognises me...

Entering university, I was still super close with my high school friends, as well as making a new group of friends at uni, which included my high school best friend (let's call her Suzie, 20F).

Long story short, about a year and a half ago I was diagnosed with PMDD (Pre Menstrual Dysphoria Disorder). Basically it meant I had depression for a week before my period every month. My therapist really helped me, and really emphasised the importance of staying engaged with the world during this week from hell, by seeing friends, staying social etc.

A few months later my PMDD had decreased and I went off on an internship overseas for 2 months. I had a great time over there, but came back to the news that my mum was dead. She'd had breast cancer 2 years ago, and apparently it'd metastasised and come back as leukaemia. She was diagnosed on a Tuesday and dead by next Sunday. 

I told all my friends because I figure that's the kind of big life event you're supposed to tell your friends. My high school friends even go to her funeral. I also told some uni friends about my PMDD (high school friends already knew). They gave me the usual ""I'm so sorry"", ""tell us if you need anything"" lines and I told everyone thanks for your sentiments, but I'd rather we just continue on as normal. 

It sounds harsh, but my mum's death didn't seem to affect me as much as I thought it would. We'd had an okay relationship (better in the year or two before her death), but I had already not seen her for 2 months, so it felt more like just another thing that was different about home (eg. desk is shorter that I remembered, sun brighter, mum deader!). 

Fast forward to now (about 4 months since her death). My friends (both groups) either completely ignore my existence or only say generic nice things you'd say to an acquaintance (my friendships were always the sort where we showed our love by insulting each other; we only ever complimented non-friends). I'd ask people if they wanted to grab lunch, and they'd come up with an excuse about being busy. Then I'd see pictures of them going out together. Suzie also told me that they had made group chats without me.

I talked to Suzie about this and she said it's because they don't know how to talk to me or act around me anymore. So I think, easy fix! I'll just tell everyone to continue acting normal around me! So I did, and it didn't help one bit. One friend did confess that he was intentionally avoiding me because he didn't know what to say, as if my mother was the only thing we talked about earlier... (spoiler alert: she definitely wasn't)

I'm now at the point where I don't even bother trying to see my friends. Only Suzie will talk to me anymore, and I'm trying not to rely on her so much because a) I don't want her to become sick of me and leave too and b) I don't want to burden her with all my emotional baggage. 

My PMDD came back and then some. I feel hollow all the time now and nothing excites me anymore. I tried following my therapist's advice but I can't do it without people to talk to, and I'm too introverted to make new ones. I'm luckily not suicidal yet, but I wish I'd never told anyone and pretended everything was fine. Am I being too clingy? Please help me reddit, how do I patch up my friendships?

tl;dr: Mum died, told my friends about that and my depression, they gave me the usual ""tell us if you need anything"" bullshit then proceeded to completely ignore me (and even admitted as much). Turns out I only had one 'true friend'."

I got a graphic design internship (I am qualified for a full time position).  Took the internship with the understanding that I would be replacing the lead GD while she was out on Maternity leave, at which time my title was to change as well as my pay. 

Neither of these happened (even upon reminder), my co-workers pretended to be my supervisors to get me to do their work, they have been verbally abusive/harassing me for 3 months now, they take credit for my work, etc.

The last 2 months of my 6 month stint at this company, the main GD is to be back in the office part time. She came back 2 days ago and, consequently, the company took my computer away, gave it to her, and now i am working on a tiny dell laptop but I am still expected to produce the same level/amount of work. I work 50+ hours/week but get paid for only 40 ($15/hr).

MY QUESTION: I want to quit so badly (I have wanted to for some time now)! Will the in-house experience I would have gained from the full 6 month internship be completely lost because of a voluntary quit two months before completion? I don't think I can keep this up any more--too many insults, too many injuries.

I have 3+ years freelance experience, I have more software/program experience than everyone in my department (including the main GD) but this is my first in-house experience. in the time the GD has been out, I have completed more than 100 projects, quickly and efficiently ( I think my portfolio has benefited more than enough at this point). 

I want(need!) to quit but I don't want all this torture to have been for nothing."

A- The lesson you should take from events like Seth Rich is that good intent is worthless without good plans.

You guys do a good job of questioning what you are told in a detail oriented fashion, but not in the abstract.

You need to emerge from your indoctrination into the real world and appreciate principles of reality such as the law of the jungle.


Q- Are you aware of any turmoil planned for the DNC or RNC? If so, is there anything we, as the internet hate machine, can do to prepare or prevent?	

A- You can expect an intensification of strategies of tension in the immediate future. While I know Trump is a bit more popular than Clinton here, the fact remains that very few people like either of them. This is a problem for your regime.	


Q- Are the Clintons Satanists? Why do they kill chickens in the name of Moloch? Why is there a temple on Epstein's Orgy Island?

A- No.

They primarily exercise power on the principle of intimidation.

Their behavior that might make you think ""mystery school"" is primarily focused on creating mystery - confusion, unsure minds, and therefore unsure challengers.


Q- Hello. Thank you. 

Is it a good idea to look at the superdelegates that have pledged their loyalty to Clinton in the dem primary?

Do you have a timeline for the public release of information on any investigation into the Clinton Foundation?

Why did Comey perjure himself before Congress? Is it justified somehow?

Is the media working to actively undermine this investigation by posting unsavory articles to tickle the sentiment of conspiracy theorists and alienate other interested parties?

Are there any sources who are willing to blow the whistle on the record?

A- Comey does not have the authority to challenge Clinton on the email server question.

It was state sanctioned to intentionally leak a combination of information and disinformation. 

Don't interpret this as an apology for the behavior. The Clintons always use state sanction to cover their ass, justified or not.


Q- What can we expect from Sanders and Clintons joint appearance? Has the candidate been read in on any of this information? 

What are the chances of Sanders being made aware? He is the popular candidate, regardless of his amicability in this forum--and seems to be the only chance for national cohesiveness. What does his candidacy have to do with this, I anything?

A- Sanders is fatally flawed in the sense that much of what you guys do is. You can only get so far by asking for things; taking them is the way of the real world.	


Q- If you're not catholic you are a disinformation agent. 

Event then if you are supposedly catholic renounce masons and the masonic order or you again are there for an implanted mason in the church out to ruin the one true faith of God in Christ as yet anot her disinformation agent. 

OP image is prince William the true antichrist.

Out of my way produstant herattics and vile new age witches.

A warrior of God is crusading and nothing can stop him that is flesh.

A- Perhaps you should formulate related questions. Your concerns are not unimportant, but are somewhat misguided.	


Q-Is there enough incriminating evidence already for the anon investigation to be primarily a matter of exposure?	

A- One of the problems you will encounter attempting to 'expose' the Clintons is that their actual accomplishments are secret but, if made public, would find some support - if you are unable to articulate how they were in fact a long con.

It is the multilayered reality that few of you perceive that is at the root of your problem.


Q- Are you implying that if we can't dig up anything NEW, the investigation is pointless?

We're just autists on here putting information in one place, we can't just magically turn into 2 years of FBI investigation overnight.

A- You need both new tactics and new abstractions.

Most of what I see here is ""LOL EVIL"" but if you step back and think for a moment surely you will come to the conclusion that you've been fed this line by nefarious actors that don't want you to see the big pictures.

I'm not saying you'll arrive at a less condemning conclusion either.


Q- Putting yourself in /pol/'s shoes, are you the bad guys, or the good guys?	

A- We are on your side, but not everyone is.


Q-How is the Sun tied up in all of this.	

A-The Son teaches you to see multiple interpretations of the same stimulus.	


Q-Then maybe give us something substantial and we'll go from there. This has only been going on a little over a week and even normies had no fucking clue the Clinton Foundation ever existed until 3ish days ago.

You're contradicting yourself if you're saying the LOL EVIL line is fed to us while what the Clintons did was largely a money laundering/power scheme, which technically is evil to all of us shitheads who can't even get an internship.

Are you on their side?

What use are you to us if the best you have are cryptic responses to dig deeper?

A- Look at the Bush/Clinton cocaine dealing.

At first you think, aha, pure evil.

When you learn more, you see that much of the profit was laundered into Russia to topple the USSR.

Now you have people who laud Reagan and the collapse of the USSR, but hate the Clintons very confused - the Clintons had more to do with USSR collapse than Reagan ever did.

But, you all agree that the American public reaped no peace dividend from this - so was it an accomplishment after all?

You have to peel back many layers here, not just surface cons.

Q-Why exactly do you need us, then? If your ""group"" some high tier secret society shit can't alone win this ""war"" I question how powerful and capable you guys really are if you're relying on some shitposters for the vanguard.

P.S. Are you the Thule guy?

A-We don't need you. We want you.	


Q-OP how much time do we have to prepare for the happening?

If I become a freemason now do I increase my survival rate?

Do I have time to finish school? I need 2-3 years to finish my bachelors degree to become a forensic scientist. (have two associate degrees now.)

Ok when is the master mason date on the Georgia guide stones? is it in aug or the next date?

Is there another side to the Illuminati other then zionism?

IE esoteric nazism.

When will we see the ships in the skys?

A-Define the happening.

Yes and no - you might encounter more severe consequences for overstepping than you would otherwise, but less severe consequences for understepping than otherwise.

Yes.

There is no master plan following strict dates.

Yes.

When you build them.


Q-explain the black sun fully OP.

And the cube of Saturn.

No riddles.

A-Teaches you to see multiple interpretations of the same stimulus.


Q-What can we do to beat the Clintons?

Obviously we cannot investigate at the same level as the federal bureau of investigation. Are we meant to bring awareness to the masses using our knowledge in psyops and general meme making?

A-“Obviously we cannot investigate at the same level”

The FBI is more constrained than you are, not less.	

Q- Why was Seth rich killed? No motives or witnesses and the TOD being 4am smells like a hit. 

Please tell me more about the long con. Are they a tool to set certain events in place, controlled opposition, or both?	

A- All of these things are setup with multiple levels of explanation, in part to control opposition.

It's only necessary that you partially accept one to go quietly. You become dangerous when you see through them all.

Q-How high profile are we now? Are we being discussed by major government agencies? Do you have any information on how effective we have been in getting the word out? Any suggestions on how we can be better at getting this information to the public?	

A-Your regime is increasingly concerned with its inability to control you, and they are right to be.	


Q- Is Pope Francis an ""Illuminati"" plant? Is Catholicism just an ancient PsyOp? Are there mysteries that the ""Illuminati"" still has not figured out about the nature of reality?	

A-He's not one of us.

The church does more to suppress truth than spread it.

Yes.

Q-Did brexit throw a spanner in the works of globalism, or was this anticipated?

A- Brexit is loading the barrel for another financial crisis. You always want a loaded gun even if you don't pull the trigger.

Q-I understand being a wizard allows to speak in such a way. But for non-natives, could you go over what you said in a concise and clear way? What is happening? Are we all doomed? How can we trust you?	

A-Consider the tale of the emperor who has no clothes.

When everyone fails to point out that the emperor is naked, new generations arise that can no longer distinguish between the states of being clothed or naked.

You've reached a point where even your leaders don't know what they are doing anymore.

We are here to bring you back to sanity.

Q-The sandusky sex scandal seems to point to a larger ring of human trafficking. Is this a separate issue or will it point to people we need to dig into	

A- All of these things should be regarded as part of a broader modus operandi of blackmail. Sufficiently expansive blackmail networks confer short-term stability to systems of governance. They tend to degrade the quality of governance over the long-term, however.

Q-Is white Europe going to be gone forever soon? Will the immigration be stopped before it's too late? Why do you all want Europe and white people powerless and gone?

Also, is the Kolbrin legit? Is gnostcism legit? Identity Christianity legit?

A-We are not a racial organization or interested in racial strife.

All religion to the extent that it is meaningful must be interpreted esoterically. Do you think a virgin birth is literal? No, of course not. It's so silly that it is meant to provoke you to question what the symbolism could be.	


Q-Define sanity.

We're not trusting the globalists if that's what you want.

Yeah, sustainable living and Medical Cities and keeping everyone in one place is all nice to you, but we also know not going along with it means we just get killed off earlier.

Who specifically do you want us to trust?

A- We want you to embrace reason, not a personality. Personalities are tools for the dimwitted.	

Q-What are some important questions about the nature of reality that the ""Illuminati"" is still struggling with desu senpai?

Is Hiroyuki Nishimura an ""Illuminati"" plant?

A-An important question for us is whether or not it is possible to sustain civilization indefinitely. The answer isn't as obviously no as you might think.

It's important in making assessments about the importance of stability versus experimentation.	

Q-Is Soros in your ranks?
If so, who buys him doughnuts?

A-No

Q-This guy is a confused Freemason.	

A-Not personally, but most of them wouldn't know that I wasn't.	

Q-So the ""Illuminati's"" intellectual concerns primarily have to do with governance?	

A-We're concerned with permanence, not so much governance. Governance is a derivative concern of permanence.	

Q-The father is on earth , yes?	

A-Yes

Q-Are seventh dimensional light beings real?

If so, are they the result of human attempts to time travel and have an impact on history to change their fate?

A-No

Q-Christianity/Islam/etc. claim that we can get permanence after we die if we live a certain way. Has the ""Illuminati"" definitively determined that this is a meme and so you are looking for a technical solution to extend life or is it still indeterminate, Illuminatinigger?	

A-The afterlife myths of religions are more properly termed second life realities that are experienced here on Earth - your rebirth into a truly conscious being.

We're interested in a technical solution, yes. Closer than you might think.

Q-How high does your midichlorian count have to be in order to be accepted into your foundation	

A-The force must be strong with you, no doubt.

Q-Do you have allegiance to any country?	

A-The USA is our project to a large extent.	

Q-Ok, assuming you are real - 

What can I, just another man on this rock, do to best ensure my family's survival, mine, and if possible community/nation? 
I get that we should focus on doing our best here to research and and disseminate information. And personally, I've taken to reading and studying more topics, to broaden my understanding. But is there anything specific I should do? To perhaps not only survive, but thrive as well?	

A-You need to become a magician. Expand the boundaries of the possible.

Learn to think clearly. What problems do you have? Are they root causes or the result of something else?

It takes significant effort to back out the way you really feel about the world, but necessary action becomes clearer as your thoughts do the same.

Q- Are Bioviva's works actually going to be made publicly available, or are they going to be kept in the circles of the power elite?

Is there an active movement to stop this service from reaching a large amount of people?

A-Yes and yes - although not by us.	

Q-What do you call yourselves?
Rosicrucian?
Brotherhood of the Snake?

How important is Alchemy?

A-Our name is three.	

Q-I bet you're MJ12	

A-More majestic than twelve.	

Q-What can I do to help make sure this gets out? 

Are there going to be any qualifications for treatment other than the ability to afford it?

A-Unfortunately a lot of people who do good work in this area are being assassinated.

You can see how it is classified as a national security concern even trivially. Obviously initial stages will expand geriatric population as a proportion of the whole before extending productive lifespan. This creates serious allocation issues in the current system.

Q-Would it be palatable to limit treatment to those who don't have offspring?	

A-Doubtful, but we don't assess any any need for this anyway. We have technical solutions to apparent problems like overpopulation.	

Q-How are your people in the ""respect for human life and dignity"" area?	

A-We want to see life flourish.

We are not freedom ideologues, however. Suppose you could build a nuclear bomb at home for little expense - would it be prudent to allow public discussion of the means in a world filled with so many would do so?

We think not.

Q-Thank you.

Any suggestions on how to aid me in search of higher self-awareness/'enlightenment'?

Also, unrelated but, how many ""factions"" with any amount of real power are vying for control? Up until recently, if I gave any thought to this, I imagined one overbearing conspiracy ala Book of Revelations

A-There are about 4 or 5 significantly different camps in terms of esoteric ideology.

In terms of actual exercise of worldly power, the world is even less hegemonic.

Q-Where can I find literature on your organization?	

A-You won't.	


Q-What is your race/ religion?

What do you know about Area 51?

Are Ayy LMAOs real?

A-Caucasian. Not sure there is well-defined vocabulary in the public domain for the second answer.

&gt;What do you know about Area 51?

I've actually been involved in some related work. No aliens.

Q-How can I learn more, then?	

A-Ask questions.	

Q-What is the validity of ""Jesus Christ"", is he semantic misinterpretation of scripture?	

A-Actual person existed. Did not literally emerge from the womb of a virgin or anything like that of course. There is a lot to learn from the symbolism of the story.	

Q-I'm guessing your organization (or whatever) is invite only? No one can ""apply"" in a sense?	

A-We don't have a website to submit your resume, no. Applying yourself is likely to get our attention however.	

Q-Of what import is material wealth to you?
How is your group organized/orchestrated/able to affect change?
Explain alchemy.
When you say become a magician, you mean magick?
What is your IQ?
How did you become a member of your group, or must you be born into it?
Do you have any plans regarding population differences in ability and intelligence?
How do your goals differ from those of your opponents? Do you have opponents?
How correct is the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis?(or are they something else)
Where did we come from?
How would the world differ for the average person if you accomplish everything you want? Would there even be average people?
Who teaches or reveals or instructs your group's ""curriculum""? What is the information you have, and how would we go about learning it?
And what would one need to become in order to be a serious asset (even a needed asset) to your group?
Do you have allies? Subordinates? Commanders? How much hire above you does it go? Do you know?
How can you be sure of anything you believe you know?

A-&gt;Of what import is material wealth to you?

We don't diminish the value of material enjoyment, and of course you need some minimum material wealth to sustain your life, provide time to think, grow, etc. It matters a lot.

&gt;How is your group organized/orchestrated/able to affect change?

We primarily use the power of ideas, but not always. Our organization is primarily vested in the preservation of knowledge and forum for discussion that might not go over well in public.

&gt;When you say become a magician, you mean magick?

I didn't mean this literally. More like magic is indistinguishable from sufficiently advanced technical skill.

&gt;What is your IQ?

Sufficiently far from the mean that the number no longer means anything - several standard deviations out.

&gt;How did you become a member of your group, or must you be born into it?

Recruited.

&gt;Do you have any plans regarding population differences in ability and intelligence?

We think that memes like idiocracy have some merit, but are overblown in the context of current and reasonably expected technological advancement that will reverse the trend.

&gt;How do your goals differ from those of your opponents? Do you have opponents?

There are a couple of factions in the world that have always believed in preserving a knowledge gap. We are opposed to that.

&gt;How correct is the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis?

There is no evidence in support of this.

&gt;Where did we come from?

Don't know.

&gt;How would the world differ for the average person if you accomplish everything you want? 

We don't have an ""end game"" per se.

&gt;Would there even be average people?

The formulation of this question is lacking. We could say yes without saying anything at all, right? By definition.

&gt;Who teaches or reveals or instructs your group's ""curriculum""? What is the information you have, and how would we go about learning it?

Often it is passed through families, but not exclusively by any means.

&gt;And what would one need to become in order to be a serious asset (even a needed asset) to your group?

We don't lack needed assets in any significant sense. 

&gt;Do you have allies? Subordinates? Commanders? How much hire above you does it go? Do you know?

We make concerted efforts, but not always unanimously. There is no strict command hierarchy.

&gt;How can you be sure of anything you believe you know?

The best you can do is examine the evidence.

Q-Does the US or any other country have access to a working weather machine and are they utilizing it?

A-Weather can be manipulated. Arbitrarily so? No.	

Q-Is everyone not part of the organization screwed in regards of WW3 thingy?

Why is pol allowed to exist?

is xenogears right?

Is my country going to end up split up into pieces?

Are there 2 sides or is it all the simes having an argument on something?

Is it necessary for good to exist evil to be and i mean in a it must happen way?

Isn't being part of something bigger like a brick in a wall defeatism and at the same time a paradox?

A-&gt;Is everyone not part of the organization screwed in regards of WW3 thingy?

We don't consider that a desirable eventuality by any means.

&gt;Why is pol allowed to exist?

Why wouldn't it be?

&gt;Are there 2 sides or is it all the simes having an argument on something?

There are more than two materially different factions in the world.

&gt;Is it necessary for good to exist evil to be and i mean in a it must happen way?

We don't believe in conducting evil as part of some rationalization along these lines, but there are those who do.

Q-How do you overcome barriers that prevent you from applying yourself? I'll get an hour of pure uninhibited productivity a week, and then no motivation for the rest.	

A-Depends on the barriers.

Q-My 3rd question, what magical powers are within the realm of attainability given one is of ""divinity""?	

A-Consider how much technology has advanced in the last 100 years.

There is far more than this currently available, but not put to use. The potential we have now, today, would blow your mind.

Q- Also, how ""legitimate"" is your organization? Or is it more like the loosely assembled book club of conspirators in the x files?

Use a metaphor to explain how your group differs from the Build-A-Burgers?

A-We use force against others from time to time. Not just a book club by any means.	

Q-How does ""three"" regard the use of mind expanding drugs?	

A-I've personally used several dozen different psychoactive substances.

The outcome isn't always good. Be reasonable about what you are doing.

Q-How advanced is AI technology? Was (((quantum physics))) a PsyOp to set back Soviet research? Was Elon Musk recruited by the ""Illuminati"" after applying himself? What's the deal with his divorce/remarriage/divorce to the same woman: is it an elaborate tax evasion/money laundering/Clinton Foundation donation scheme, or even at your elite level cuckoldry by women is a problem?

A-&gt;How advanced is AI technology?

Not very close to closing the gap between what humans can do and it cannot.

Very sophisticated and useful for much more tractable problems.

&gt;Was (((quantum physics))) a PsyOp to set back Soviet research?

No. There are real observable, repeatable quantum phenomena.

&gt;Was Elon Musk recruited by the ""Illuminati"" after applying himself? What's the deal with his divorce/remarriage/divorce to the same woman: is it an elaborate tax evasion/money laundering/Clinton Foundation donation scheme, or even at your elite level cuckoldry by women is a problem?

As a technologist, he is a horrid distraction.

As to your other line of inquiry, you're very aware. You'll find many cases of companies being created and promoted by groups specifically to fund other enterprises. Another obvious example is Uber getting a free pass from municipalities that you wouldn't otherwise expect. These things are allowed to fund other projects.

Q-Hi again.

You do understand that many people do not see those in your position as benevolent, right? You understand why?

You speak of blackmail webs. How does one avoid them?

You state that your group is opposed to the preservation of a knowledge gap, but your own statements about home built nuclear weapons seems to work in direct opposition to that view. Care to explain?

You state that financial collapses are viewed as tools to be used. Are you aware of the lives you risk for such fun and games?

I don't think I like you or your little group; you sound like you want to be the overlords of us all. I'm from a family that fought the first revolution for the idea of freedom. Many in the US are preparing to do that again. As time goes on, it seems more and more necessary. Can you just leave us and our freedom be, or will you continue to meddle in our economy and government?

A-&gt;You do understand that many people do not see those in your position as benevolent, right? You understand why?

We are aware of this.

&gt;You speak of blackmail webs. How does one avoid them?

Often, if you seek power, you will be framed even if you do not engage in blackmail worthy behavior.

If this doesn't work and you are sufficiently threatening, you will be executed.

If you want to exercise power in the world, you must abide by reality, and therefore the law of the jungle. If you can't wave a big stick, don't threaten a big animal.

&gt;You state that financial collapses are viewed as tools to be used. Are you aware of the lives you risk for such fun and games?

We don't do this or encourage it, but it does happen.

Q-How much of our world history is misunderstood or misrepresented for what it really is? And for that matter how significant is the past as a ressource for learning more and better understanding the larger picture?

Is there any particular short term scenario we as a species would be unprepared to handle?

A-&gt;How much of our world history is misunderstood or misrepresented for what it really is? And for that matter how significant is the past as a ressource for learning more and better understanding the larger picture?

The grasp of history is pitiful and the importance almost impossible to overstate.

&gt;Is there any particular short term scenario we as a species would be unprepared to handle?

Mankind is woefully unprepared for a wide variety of possibilities. Something simple like a major solar storm could devastate civilization and it is only a matter of time. We could list problems like this all day long. Consideration of even one really puts things into perspective when you have some miscreant telling you that the public dialogue is meaningful.

Q-What do you say insider.
God, Creator or The universal mind?

A-Yes

Q-Do you guys have the technology to give someone a genetic sex change? Like they'd still be the same person just the opposite sex version. If so, hypothetically speaking, how much would a person have to pay for such a service?	

A-No

Q-Also... When you say ""preservation of a knowledge gap"" and that you oppose it, how big is the gap? And by ""oppose"", do you mean simply not getting in the way of people seeking that information, not actively preserving the gap, making the info available to some or all who seek it, or actively disseminating it?

Because there's a difference between letting someone find out that there's no Santa, and running up to 6 year olds in the street and screaming that Santa doesn't exist. Essentially, sharing certain info can border on abuse. You know that already.

So how do you plan to close the knowledge gap? 

Also, you know what I mean by average people you cheeky little sumbitch. ;)

Do you plan on engineering a future world populated by what society would now classify as ""elites"" (in multiple respects) ...and what would happen to those society now deems the average, working class all American pleb ...the ""little guy"" ... The not so bright? Would the become an underclass? Would they be transformed somehow? (You allude to technology and transhumanism) Or would they simply be eradicated in the world you envision?

A-We try to actively disseminate both specific knowledge and good guidance.

&gt;Do you plan on engineering a future world populated by what society would now classify as ""elites"" 

We're interested in improving.

&gt;The not so bright? Would the become an underclass? Would they be transformed somehow? (You allude to technology and transhumanism) Or would they simply be eradicated in the world you envision?

We estimate that people are almost infinitely malleable. There is no reason to consider them permanently dimwitted and plenty of reason to expect improvement from them.

Q-What agency is it that the IG couldn't talk about in the public oversight committee meeting (and/or) what was it that was in the email that couldn't be talked about?


How many diseases are there actually cures for that aren't available to the average person?

A-Clinton extensively discussed counterterrorism and counterintelligence operations on her email. Multiple agencies including CIA and NSA.

&gt;How many diseases are there actually cures for that aren't available to the average person?

We have general frameworks for treating almost all viral and bacterial infections and the ability to cure cancer for starters.

Q-Well I guess that's it for my country then

So essentially we are at the final stages of the end of the world or at least very close to it

Would WW3 being averted grantee that no global catastrophe would occur?

&gt;Why wouldn't it be?
well this site being not anymore would be better for them than it existing, i doubt they can't censor the crap out of the mainstream social networks sites and reddit

this isn't some sort of game where you select in a non arbitrary certain actors and according to how they do you decide something in regards of a pseudo scientific with philosophical tints matter ?

right?

once you win how will you clean up the mess without international conflict? Theres no way your average citizen will process all that has been happening i mean despite all the crisis people lived here they don't have the sightless idea of whats going on.

Theres also no way more than one power will use the opportunity to do powergrabs that will prepare everything for the next conflict or is everyone part of the same team

Is the plan a global federation instead of a global empire?

A-&gt;once you win how will you clean up the mess without international conflict?

We don't have any consensus on how to bail you out in a dramatic fashion.

Imagine if we gave you a personality to lead you from the darkness. How do you avoid accusations of that person being the anti-Christ and a dramatic backlash?

It's not as easy as it might seem at first glance. There are so many complicating factors.

Q-You're aware. Great. Do you understand why people do not see you as benevolent?

What on Earth or in the Heavens gives you or any other group the right to execute leaders chosen by the people? ""Because we can""?

If you are so confident in the strength of your ideas and the worthiness of your cause, why all the secrecy? Scared much?

A-We don't assess society as capable of open rational discussion.

Many have died overreaching like this in the past and dark ages have resulted.

Q-My family has been touched heavily by occult forces. My grandfather was invited to the Bohemian Grove (but didn't return) and held many powerful positions in the world. 

I am engaging in and promoting subversive behavior in a very public way - is it likely that I am under observation by occult powers? 

Are there any signs I should watch out for, for the safety of myself and my family?

How likely is some sort of recruitment, should I play along with a Bohemian Grove invite?

A-Most societies pay attention to descendants of members at least initially. They may or may not have written you off as not interesting by now though. Hard to say without knowing more.	

Q-Some of us do study history, we're not all worms underneath your godly feet.

For all your intellectual might and resources, you do understand that there are scenarios from which the only recovery would be a complete rebuilding of all we know, right?

A-We're very much concerned about those possibilities.	


Q-What is/ was the majestic 12?
How can I become someone like you? 
What about the freemasons? What are they what role do they play?
Is there a job in the CIA that deals with the Illuminati? 
What about the Nazi's were they an occult group that tried to do something with Vril or something?.

A-Freemasons are kind of like an umbrella group for dissident minds. Neutral meeting territory. Think of the lodge as equivalent to a meeting ground governed by gentlemen's agreements, like lords meeting in the middle before battle to discuss options before commencing with bloodshed.	


Q-&gt;Cancer cure

Yet you allow so many to suffer so that you hold the fruit of knowledge alone. Let it out.

A-We are not capable of significant extension of productive lifespan yet. If we stop largely stop death but don't restore vitality it will collapse society.	


Q-How do you feel about visionaries, or people with precognition? Is it legitimate?	

A-It's closer to predicting an object will continue to fall under the action of gravity absent an arresting force than something miraculous in a sense beyond the human intelligence potential.

Some people are better in the sense that some scientists are more productive, but not beyond that.

Q-Why must it be kept so secret? And who are you keeping it a secret from?

Surely if your goals are good and correct and you're a ""good guy"" it would be A simple thing to persuade a sizeable chunk of the population to your cause.

Thank you for answering my questions. Even if you are full of shit (and I'm inclined to think you're not) it's been genuinely fun chatting. 

You're more interesting than most people I come into contact with.

A-You have not really thought about what all such a process entails.

What if we seize power and push out the blackmail network. They won't just go quietly and we don't have the means to kill them all overnight, nor even consensus that we should if we could.

So you are dealing with a broad and organized network of malcontents resisting your efforts to improve, plus the government is highly unstable because people have no reason to trust it and are predisposed to revolution.

This isn't a trivial exercise you are proposing.

Q-How many times do you think civilization has needed to restart?	

A-Depends on what you count as a restart.

We experienced at least one near complete dark age from ~10,000 years ago to ~5,000 years ago.

Probably not more, other than less severe episodes familiar to you in modern history.

Q-Can you give us an overview of the different factions? 

A-The major power factions in the world are analogous to dark priests, good priests, kings, and (in theory) meritocracies.

Dark priests - these people believe that beauty emerges from contrast. Evil is necessary for good kind of thing. They are not necessarily pro-evil, but pro-contrast.

Kings - generally less intelligent than dark priests. Much of their code of behavior derives from a belief in the past that you need a slave class to sustain an enlightened class.

I have one year left of classes and then I do a 6 month internship. For my degree, I only need 6 semesters of an ensemble (did concert band for five and marching for one). I didn't need any more so I planned my senior year accordingly. 

I was chosen to receive a scholarship a month ago for $2,500 over the course of my senior year, but I just found out I have to be in one of the top two ensembles (I've always been in the bottom of the two but I'm fine with that). Here's the issue:

I'm already signed up to take 7 classes this fall, as well as work my part time job that I just got a promotion in which means more hours (I work at our performing arts center teching music performances of my classmates and professors), being an officer in our music therapy organization for the second year in a row, and doing an honors contract for the honors college (1-2 extra hours a week probably). Of the classes I'm already signed up for, two are some of the hardest classes I'll have to take (music therapy techniques in psychodynamics and music history antiquity to Bach). 

One of the seven is also my recital, which I don't have to do but want to do. My principal is flute and I was going to do a joint recital with another music therapy flute player (I'm playing the Hindemith sonata, Hypnosis by Ian Clarke, a Mozart andante and an easy duet). 

I am HUGELY stressed about this whole scholarship. So much. It's diving me crazy and I've cried several times just trying to figure everything out. I had said my goodbyes to band and was excited to have an extra six hours a week to get better at my guitar skills (which are lacking and required for music therapy) and also to have some relaxation time that music majors hardly get. I feel like I've been half-assing everything for a while, and even though I have good grades, I know I could be so much better in music therapy and on the flute but I just don't have the time or energy after all of the classes, lessons, practicing, homework, and working. I feel like I'm burning myself out, and all of my commitments (were I to do band) would just be too much. That's why I was looking forward to not having to do it!

But now there's this scholarship! And it's a decent chunk of money, I don't have loans but my parents are paying for everything and obviously that money would be really good for them. But at the same time I'm sick of not having a life. During the semester I feel so stressed all of the time. I can't exercise as much as I want and don't have ANY hobbies.

I feel like and know my music therapy musician skills are lacking, because I just don't have the time to practice. I barely have the time to practice flute more than 5 hours a week which feels like nothing.

Also, my private lesson teacher doesn't really know what to do with us music therapy students bc music Ed majors take 8 semesters of an ensemble. She's gotten very upset and angry at some of my friends for choosing not to do an ensemble or lessons after their degree requirements have been filled. We are not going to be practicing flute as much when we graduate, as we are going to be therapists and will be using our guitar/piano/vocal skills every day. For this reason though I'm worried if I turn down the scholarship she might not let me do a recital, she was hesitant for some unknown reason even though all of the work to organize it is on us. 

I could potentially drop my psych minor and therefore one class in the fall and one class in the spring but the minor is applicable to my field and I like it.

I would also feel terrible and feel like I'm letting people down if I turn it down. And then when I think that I think my mental health is worth more than it, I worry that maybe I could handle everything and I'm worrying too much and then the cycle of worry and anxiety continues. 

Sorry for all of the info, I hope someone has read this far. Please give me some advice!"

Okay, I'm a music therapy major, not music ed., but I'm thinking this is the best place to ask for some advice.

*as a side  note for people who don't know the specifics of being a music major, taking 6-7 classes is the norm. The ensemble is a six hour weekly class that is one credit hour. Last semester I was actually in class for 23 hours a week, with 16 credit hours. This fall semester would be 16 or 17 credits hours, with 18 or 24 hours in class depending on if I'm in band or not.

Tl:dr I was offered a scholarship but it would require me to be in class I don't need that I don't really enjoy as much and could completely overload my schedule"
4t06hv,3,2016-07-15,Embedded Systems in Electrical Engineering,thecrazystumbler,udub,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/4t06hv/embedded_systems_in_electrical_engineering/,"So I'm about to start my senior year in EE so I will be taking the embedded classes within the EE department: EE 474 and EE 475. I am kind of concerned about being able to find a job when I graduate.

I keep hearing people saying that embedded is super hot right now that if you do embedded there are plenty of jobs and that you will get a job for sure. HOWEVER, everyone in embedded (or almost everyone) I see getting jobs after graduating , they end up getting jobs in software engineering stuff, pretty much like if they had done CS. Some of them have told me that the most useful classes that helped them get those jobs were the non majors CS courses such as CSE 373 CSE 374 etc, and of course, reading books of coding interviews and practicing for them. So pretty much doing stuff on their own and not too related to embedded is what helped them land in those positions.

Yes I am good at programming and I have taken those non major CS courses, but haven't been so lucky getting internships in the software engineering area. My EE classes don't really help that much in preparing for those interviews, either.

So my question is, for anyone who may have experience on this: what should I spend my time on this upcoming quarters: Should I completely focus my time on my embedded systems classes, and hopefully I will be able to get a job in embedded? OR should I instead study hard for coding interviews , since it is more likely I will get a job in that area rather than embedded?

Thanks"

We are both overachievers and at the end of our second years, we had enough credits to be seniors. We are also both STEM majors. I am on track to be accepted to a highly ranked grad school after my undergrad, president of the club in my major, do research as an undergrad, and have an internship this summer with a government agency related to my field. I have been on the dean's list every quarter this past year. I am proud of my achievements because I come from a family of immigrants and I am the first to go to college or even graduate high school. I am lucky enough to be getting a full ride (tuition, housing, school supplies, and living expenses) paid for through grants and scholarships.

My boyfriend's parents are very different from mine, his mom is a lawyer and his dad retired at 40 from being an union electrician. Together they easily make over 200k a year. As such, they are paying for his college.

 Recently, my boyfriend suggested we move in together. I was happy and started researching apartments near our school. We both live on campus this year, but want to move off campus for more privacy and general comfort. 

Last night, my boyfriend tells me that his parents took him out to a nice restaurant. They ordered food and then told him to break up with me. His dad said that I was leading him on a bad path and that our relationship shouldn't be to the point where we would consider moving in together. He said that my grants were wellfare and that I was using my boyfriend for money. His mom also said that I exhibited red flags in my behaviour, because when we cook together I get frustrated when he does something wrong so I just end up doing it myself. He was of course upset and defended me, saying I was nothing but a positive influence and that I was a great person. This led to his dad calling me slurs (I am Mexican and they are white) and them arguing. His dad said that if we moved in together, he would cut my boyfriend off and disown him.

I am upset, because up until this point they had been nothing but nice to me and even took me on their vacation this past year. I talked with my boyfriend and I told him I wasn't worth a debt free education, so we decided we wouldn't move in together. But I am still at a loss of what to do with his parents. I really like my boyfriend and we have tossed around the idea that we could get married, once we had a stable life and a house. I just don't know if our relationship can get to that point if his parents hate me so much. What should I do?

TD;LR;My boyfriend's parents turned out to be super racist and I don't know how to proceed."
4t0knu,8,2016-07-15,Roommate moved overseas. Consequences of taking her cat with me to grad school without her permission?,catnapping101,Pets,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/4t0knu/roommate_moved_overseas_consequences_of_taking/,"My roommate moved overseas to Germany 6 months ago for an indefinite amount of time and left her cat (let's call her Lily) with me to take care of. I am going to graduate school in a month, about an 8 hour drive away from here, and she has asked me to take Lily to her parent's house nearby in the suburbs when I leave, where Lily will live outdoors/in their crowded garage when it gets too cold out, as her parents do not allow cats indoors. This was the alternative to Lily staying with me so of course I wanted her with me instead until I left, and never agreed to take her to her parent's house. The living arrangement for Lily is supposed to last until my roommate returns, which could be between 6 months and never, although my ex-roomate has suggested that once she figures her life out she may have Lily shipped to Germany to live with her there, which probably wouldn't be for another year or so. 

Lily would also have to stay at my roommate's parents house with another adult cat whom she has never met and is known to be rather mean (just had surgery for a tooth absess too and is especially mean now). But Lily was born and raised an indoor cat, she sleeps in my bed every night, even when my roommate lived here with us she was nearly always in my bed. She also gets along great with my cat whom she has known her whole life of 3 years.  I have lived with this roommate since August 2013, and she received her cat as a kitten at the start of our move in then (so up till now, I have actually lived with Lily longer). Lily and my cat have been best buddies ever since. They groom each other every day, play together, cuddle together, and keep each other company throughout the day when I'm away. Although I did move across the country for an 8 month internship and brought my cat with me, but when I returned after all that time they became best friends again, and I came back and Lily had gained a lot of weight, which I assume had something to do with losing her playmate and the fact that while I was away my roommate had left to go to Germany for 3 or 4 months in the Summer of 2015 and left Lily with our two subleasers who clearly didn't have a clue about kittie portions. 

We have had some vicious Whatsapp exchanges lately, and she demands that I take Lily to her parents when I leave, and that the cat is 100% hers so I have to honor her wishes. This whole thing has me thinking of what constitutes as ownership of a cat. I  get that she received the cat as a gift, spayed her, and took her to the vet initially and then a second time last year when she was overridden with fleas. That's great for her. But I gotta say my biased perspective felt that was the extent of her ownership. She was always a gross slob in her regular day to day living, for which I admit I have built up a lot of resentment for over the years, but she was especially negligent with the cats in day to day living. I suppose affection and responsibility for a pet is all relative, but I just thought the level of responsibility and affection she showed for her cat was despicable. I had my cat's litterbox in my room and Lily's was in the common area, but if it were only my roommate there that thing would have only been cleaned once a month- or less! The cats would even pee and poop in front of the litterbox and I would resist the urge to clean it up because I was trying to teach this lazy adolescent twenty-something about responsibility. I even went out of town for about 12 days back in Dec. 2015 and asked her to take care of our cats but when I got back I could tell she hadn't cleaned the cat litter once, there was therefore poop in front of my cat's litterbox, and pee in front of hers, the whole place smelled horrible, and I realized she never refilled their frickin water bowl because my cats started drinking out of a glass of water I poured for myself and then saw the water bowl was bone-dry! Ugh! The hatred was brewing. Eventually, I just started cleaning her cat's litterbox too whenever it needed it thinking ""alright well she is basically my cat too and I do hope to adopt her when my roommate moves away overseas and forgets about her so it's really not a big deal to start taking care of her now."" 

Well, ex-roomate unfortunately hasn't forgotten about her, and is telling me I have to take her to her parent's house no matter how much I have pleaded and argued with her about it. I feel she sees Lily as more of an object rather than a living being, like something she can just store away and come back to while she goes off to wherever.  

So, I need some advice. I have been filled to the brim with anxiety, hatred, and full fledged crazy-cat-ladyness. When I try to calm down about this and think maybe it's not so bad, Lily will adjust eventually, so will my cat and I, etc, I picture Lily smashed to smithereens on the busy road that they live just a few hundred feet away from, or running away and getting lost and never returning, or whimpering in the cold disgusting garage they have during this upcoming winter, wondering what she did to deserve this, wondering why all the changes have happened. Ugh, I can't fathom it. But I do want to know what to expect if I end up *forgetting* to take her to her parents' house and she or her family decide to contact law enforcement. 

Other possibly relevant details:
1. Lily is not declawed. 
2. Ex-roomate didn't leave me money for Lily. Although when she left 6 months ago I requested $5 via Venmo for cat litter that month, but haven't requested more money since. I guess I could have, but she could have offered it too, you know?
3. She also left to live out of town in the Summer of 2014 and left her cat with me and our third roommate (who also hated her due to her negligence btw). She did give me $40 for 4 months though after I requested it. 
4. She sucks. 

TL;DR Ex-roommate moved to Germany and left her cat with me. I'm going to grad school and while she told me to leave her cat with her parents to live outdoors in a completely new environment until she returns in 6 months (or never), I do not respect her wishes (nor her) and plan to take her cat with me 8 hours away. Any advice on how to do this or a heads up on legal repercussions I could face would be great. "

I'm studying computer science in engineering but my school is notorious for churning out consultants. (I think there is some statistic from our career office that 60% of graduates from my school go into consulting at least once within 10 years of graduating).

I see the appeals of both - but I'm not sure which I should be looking into for recruitment season next year. Most likely whichever one I choose for my junior internship will be the one I will look for a job in. I'm really stuck between deciding which to look into - or if given offers from both industries, which one to accept.

I do not consider myself a great coder. I have done well in my cs classes (3.9 major GPA, 3.7 overall) and I am at a top 15 university, but I do not have any personal projects. The CS department at my school is also fairly lackluster. I know very little about new technologies or even fundamentals of how computers/programming works. I feel like I just did what it took to get through my classes without actually developing a thorough understanding of everything. I'm currently doing a software dev internship at a large fortune 100 company but I honestly feel kind of out of place. They do not give me work and I do not feel confident asking for work or difficult assignments. When other cs interns talk about tech related stuff - I'm not sure what they are really talking about and so it is difficult for me to get into the conversation. It makes me feel very out of place.

That being said, I know that consulting is something I feel like I am much more suited to doing. I love working with people, and I love solving problems. I just don't know if that fast-paced lifestyle is suited for me either. That being said - I'm not sure which industry to prep for or go into next year. I know the salaries are comparable (with probably more  benefits going into CS if I am able to lockdown a great offer, which I'm very skeptical of being able to do because I honestly feel so out of place in the CS world).

For those of you who were in similar spots, what did you do? What do you guys think about the two industries? Which one would be better for me? "

Prior to college I had never programmed in my life. I would say I now have a decent ability to code in Java, a basic ability in Python, and a basic ability in Linux. 

I live in the Hillsboro / Beaverton area of Oregon, so companies such as Intel, Solarworld, Oracle, and more are in the area. I go to college in Ohio and am dual majoring in Computer Engineering and Computer Science.

I'm wondering what would be some projects that I could work on that would make me stand out as an intern? Whether it be advanced Java coding or learning C/C++, I'd be up for the challenge.

And for anyone wondering what my coursework/grades are like: Discrete Structures and their Algorithms, Computer Science I (Intro to Java), Computer Science II (Intermediate Java), Intro to Operating Systems Concepts and Usage, and other non-CS classes. 3.9 GPA Cumulative.

Next year my classes (first semester at least) are: Computer Organization, Digital System Design, and other non-CS classes."

Tim Cook walks on stage to loud applause. He steps before the crowd of nerds and takes a deep breath before shouting, “Shut up! Shut the fuck up! And sit down!”

An immediate silence rips through the crowd. Bewildered reporters look at each other. Someone amongst the crowd lets out a nervous bout of laughter. Tim responds promptly with “I SAID Shut. The. Fuck. Up. Did I stutter? Not another goddamn word.” No one else dares to push their luck. A solitary but unnecessary photographic flash is the last sign of rebellion.

Wearing the expression of a man who’s one traffic jam away from annihilating his entire family, Tim raises his hand far above his head. Held within his furious grip is an iphone of some model or another. The monolithic projection screen behind him lights up without warning, a close-up view of the device enduring his crushing grasp appears for all the room may see.

Tim throws the phone to the ground. He jumps on it. He kicks it so hard that it goes flying off the stage where it hits some geek reporter in the head who (more from hurt feelings than anything else) fights the urge to cry, too full of fear to let the tears loose. He decides to save them for the 101.

Tim races to the edge of the stage, just barely resisting the urge to leap into the crowd and continue his abuses. He recomposes himself with an obviously false sense of calm before whispering into his wearable microphone, “Give it back…… GIVE IT THE FUCK BACK!”

Spittle falls from his mouth.

An anonymous and shaking hand raises the phone back to Tim who wastes no time in snatching it back. He looks somewhere off stage. “Come on. Come the fuck on already.” A nervous (and faintly bruised) intern rushes on stage with a glass of water in one hand and a stool in the other. He sets one atop the other. The feed on the projection screen settles in on the glass.

Tim paces around the stool, sighing. Finally, his lips pursed, his jaw working like he’s chewing his own tongue like some men might tobacco, he whispers into the mic, “Fuck all of you,” before dropping the phone into the glass of water.

The iphone continues to operate without showing any signs of distress. The smallest amount of blood floats within the glass like red ink correcting mistakes of the past. “And what do we say to that, Siri?”

Like from the nebulous lips of a soulless woman having just learned the meaning of fear, electronic words echo from beneath the water, “Thank you, Timmy. May I please have another?”

Many wonder if the AI’s voice hadn’t actually shaken the slightest bit.

Tim looks out over the crowd. “Jobs… And all of you… Can suck my dick.”

After Tim Cook marches off the platform and kicks open the emergency exit nearest him, the stage speakers ring out one last line before being powered off: “I want my fucking stock’s worth back to what it should be before I reach my car or I’m cancelling the whole damn line.”

Since losing his vision about 5 years ago he slowly stopped working and has been focusing on rehabilitation (went to CVI, got a service dog, learning JAWS for his computer, braile, etc). After completing training at his local CVI they gave him an internship at a nearby college and have provided him with a few resources to find jobs. No luck yet but he's a very tenacious person.

A little about my background and experience: 

* 3 Years as a Civil Engineering Designer (capital roadway improvement projects)
* 2 Years as a Intern  (actually doing CADD/design work for roadway improvement projects). 
* Have my EIT 
* Masters Degree with a Transportation Engineering emphasis
* Currently making 65K a year in Southern California

I am currently fielding an offer for a new company that is mid-to-large size consulting company in Southern California. Based off my discussion with the hiring manager I gave them a range of $34 to $36 an hour (equivalent to 70K to 75K a year). However, from my impression he might have thought that was a lot more than what he was expecting. Wondering am I off on my current value as a Transportation/Roadway Civil Engineer 1?


Update: I just received my offer letter of  $35/hour with full benefits of 401k, health, dental, pto, vaction ... etc. Use this information as you like to anyone else looking for employment in SoCAL area.

4t2akq,9,2016-07-15,"Me [26M] with my girlfriend [27F] of 3 years, she just admitted to ""making out"" with a co-worker. How best can we repair this relationship?",vanpeltpark,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4t2akq/me_26m_with_my_girlfriend_27f_of_3_years_she_just/,"So I recently moved away for an unpaid internship for the next 3 months. We have done long distance in the past for a greater extent of time with no issues.


She had begun to mention a male co-worker at work before I left who seemed to be part of a larger group that hung out and went for drinks after work every once in a while. She had mentioned how this guy tended to mention he had a girlfriend an abnormal amount of times and in odd situations. I had commented that this was a red flag and something people tend to do when their relationship is on the rocks or they don't trust themselves. She also later began to mention how he spoke a lot about his relationship problems to her. Again I mentioned this was a red flag, but he never came up again.


Fast forward 1 month and I move away across multiple time zones for 3 months. After being here 3 weeks she confesses they kissed on two occasions. Once after a work night out with heavy drinking and lasting no more than 30 seconds before she took off and went home alone. 4 days later she had tried to talk to him about what she did was wrong and proceeded to make out again. She claims it never progressed beyond kissing and there was no groping or intercourse of any kind. She said she then finally pushed him away and told him it could never happen again.  She does admit that it made her feel good and that it was exhilarating, but that her intense guilt and shame at what she did ate her alive every day. I sensed something was wrong as she was unusually evasive and avoided talking as much as we usually did. 6 days after the first incident she finally confessed her transgressions to me and said she felt disgusting that she caused me so much pain and did something so horrendous.


I can't say the situation was surprising to me considering his red flags and the fact he was sharing more intimate details, but it was still shocking. She has no previous history of cheating on partners. She had said cheating was something she found so detestable in people and was something that would hurt her so badly. On the other hand I had previously mentioned I'd consider forgiving if it was only kissing and a physical attraction. The way she described it, it seemed purely physical attraction. She said they had things in common, but I could find anyone with similar enjoyments (movies, video games, etc.). It seemed to be superficial interactions but with a physical attraction. She also admitted that he had made a grand gesture for her and claimed he broke up with his girlfriend for her (the same one he hadn't been happy with for 6 months).

To give you background there had been some sexual issues in our relationship. I had been dealing with a lot of stress in my life recently, and it has a history of destroying my libido. We weren't having sex as often as she or I would like. It had been mentioned a few times, and I would try and make changes but when your unable to perform despite still desiring her.....it's embarrassing. I'd say we were having sex 2 times a week. She says that he had made her feel wanted like I hadn't recently. We were still compatible, and a great pair, but that the sexual aspect was lacking. She said she still has a lingering sense of physical attraction to him, but that she loves me. We talked intensely about it and I said I didn't want to throw away everything we had for a stupid physical fling. She has agreed to cut off all interactions with him outside of necessary work conversation and to no longer go drinking if he's in the group. I know it isn't going to be easy, and I was wanting some advice and guidance from people who may have gone through something similar. I acknowledged shortcomings in our relationship and agreed we both needed to be more open in expressing our emotions and worries (I tend to try and figure my problems out myself). 


I will really appreciate any help with this situation and recommendations for how we can work through this and leave these mistakes in the past. I understand it won't be easy and  is not guaranteed to succeed. So please help I'm in need of some direction (I am hesitant to confide in my parents in case we stay together and they forever judge or doubt our relationship). Thank you for reading and commenting.


   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend admitted to making out with co-worker twice 3 weeks after I went away for summer internship. Had done long distance for longer before. Expressed intense guilt. We had some intimacy issues due to stress killing my libido. Still want to try and make it work. Any advice to rebuild?"
4t2l4g,2,2016-07-15,F4A - The Dark Journey To Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4t2l4g/f4a_the_dark_journey_to_fame/,"Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

--------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up (would love her to look like Madison Ivy)

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S also looking to role play Marvel/DC, Game Of Thrones, The Witcher and Mass Effect

4t2to4,3,2016-07-15,The dream of going pro in csgo,TheKnifeDream,GlobalOffensive,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4t2to4/the_dream_of_going_pro_in_csgo/,"Many people dream of becoming a cs go pro player, but give up after they come across the first ""tests"" of dedication and risk. In my opinion if you are living your life without taking risk, you aren't really living. Now don't get me wrong, their is no reason that you can't enjoy living a ""safe"" life, but you are in the shadow of your own potential. There are many things in life that you will get criticized for, but following your passion is inspiring and takes a lot of courage now-a-days.


 I have a passion for playing video games and I dreamed of going pro in counterstrike. When I had some time off I practiced and practiced and decided to pay for esea. I was already decent at cs, but I became very good and started to play against semi pro teams in competitions. However I lacked a great reaction time, I would easily get tilted (not toxic) but mad at myself, and a few other things that showed me maybe I'm not cut out to dedicate my life to cs go. 


However I realized that I could put my love of video games into another job. So i started to research game design and computer programming. I interned at a few places, each with different takes on  gaming. I discovered that I was really good at this and started to dedicate my time to making small games and apps for fun. While I still play cs, I am not at the same level as i once was, but that's ok, because I found my real passion. I am soon going to a prestigious school for game design in California and I could not be more excited for my future designing games. 


To sum it up I challenge everyone with a love for gaming to go out and try your best to become a pro player (if that is your dream) or go out and pursue a job in graphics or gaming. Try to get into internships or play lans with a team, you can’t know if you want to pursue gaming until you go out into the world and apply yourself. I’ve seen many people give up their dream specifically in games because others have told them that it’s not a real job. Now how jealous would someone else be if you told them you travel the world and play games for a living or design top tier games for millions to play. 

Keep in mind this is not easy, you need to dedicate yourself to your dream which may involve removing people that bring you down and allowing yourself to take risks. I hope this post helped someone take a step forward in pursuing a career in gaming, if even one person takes my advice I would be ecstatic.

4t2wwz,1,2016-07-15,Fighting technology ADD,Bamski,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4t2wwz/fighting_technology_add/,"I'm a college senior with a year of programming internships under my belt, and I've been fortunate to intern at a big 4 for a part of that. Before I get in to my main question / rant, I'll provide a little background.

The vast majority of my work has been in back-end projects with a bit of distributed systems. I've worked predominantly in Java and gained exposure to some heavy duty frameworks like Spring and Hibernate (Although I feel like a complete noob trying to use them without stackoverflow), and build tools like Maven. 

I mostly enjoy working with Java, I've found I've really liked working with statically typed, compiled languages. It's not the sexy option by any stretch, but I can definitely appreciate the power behind it.

In addition to Java, I've also found myself working with Ruby for implementing bits of automation and (rarely) delving in to rails applications. Even less often I've had to write Perl scripts for for some low level scripting. 

Now, on to my question.

Recently, I've experienced a fair bit of anxiety trying to bridge my work experience with personal projects and learning. Over the last year I've picked up books on Python, Scala, Haskell and Javascript. I've dabbled in web frameworks, concurrency frameworks, and other tools. The problem is, I just can't pick a path!

Every time I sit down to learn a language or framework, my mind starts wandering - my friends working at other exciting companies tell me about all of the fresh and innovative things they've encountered, and I start experiencing a real fear of missing out. Sites like HN constantly highlight all the cutting edge work being done outside of the Java monolith (Go, Rust, etc), and I wonder if I'm missing out on ""better"" ways to solve the problems I face in my own projects.

I realize that this isn't an uncommon feeling, however it's been incredibly frustrating to feel like my personal development has been stifled by my own ""grass is always greener"" mentality.

I'd like to break down this post in to two questions - the psychological (How've you guys dealt with your own framework or language chasing?), and the practical (Given my background and the things I enjoy, what could be a practical use of my time?). 

Anyways, thanks for reading!

4t2y4q,44,2016-07-15,Ok fuck my last post being my last post. Any IV users please read,HayMoe,opiates,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4t2y4q/ok_fuck_my_last_post_being_my_last_post_any_iv/,"I had my first really MAJOR abscess this week. Ive had a couple before but none near this serious. The other ones just needed antibiotics, one a tiny poke, but when I say this one got bad quick, I mean my entire left arm was completely useless 2 days after the miss and the size of a tennis ball.

Ive heard absolute horror stories about how people were treated in emergency rooms for being addicts. This really made me not want to go, but it was to the point last night that I just could not stop crying because it hurt so bad. So this morning I dropped my bf off at work, sucked it up, and went.

I was completely upfront from the get go about what was going on to the nurses. They called in a surgeon to drain it but said it would be about 4 hours til he could get there. In those 4 hours they treated me so gently and with so much compassion that I was blown away. They gave me oxy within 15 minutes of being there because I was literally sobbing from the pain. Then they put me on IV antibiotics and gave me a shot of morphine every 2 hours. They adjusted my dose accordingly based on my tolerance. The surgeon arrived after id been there about 6 hours and had 2 interns with him. As he started the lidocaine he talked to his interns and said something along the lines ""im sure usually when you guys see abscesses the doctor usually gives the minimum amount of lidocaine and just makes the person grit their teeth. What I'm teaching you is that pain management is our goal here. Just because a person is an addict does not mean they deserve to be in pain. They're an addict, dont you think that means they're already in pain?"" Once again I was literally blown away.

So this doctor gave me the max amount of lidocaine and morphine for my weight before he started. Even so, it was hands down the most painful and gruesome thing i have ever been through. I literally had a nurse holding me down by the shoulders and another holding my hand and even through the lidocaine I was screaming. Needless to say, I dont think i would've made it through that ordeal had the staff not treated me as well as they did. The surgeon said he was so glad I came when I did and that it was one of the worst he'd ever seen. 

The point I'm getting at here is dont let fear of going to the hospital and being treated badly stop you from seeking medical attention when you know you need it. There are good people in the medical field and your life is worth what you have to go through to keep it. 

As for me, I will never put another fucking needle in my arm. I got 2 grams when I left the hospital to taper down over the next couple weeks so it'll be a virtually painless detox. I just want everyone to be safe, and if you do ever fuck up its not the end of the world just seek help. 

Happy nods everyone.

4t3au4,1,2016-07-16,Open Relationship Advice,taquito_4,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4t3au4/open_relationship_advice/,"So before I start I want to give an accurate account of my relationship with the girl I am ""seeing"". 
I use the word seeing because technically we are not in a relationship but we have all the components of one. 

First off I have to tell you a few things. 

1. She lives in another state right now. We fly out to see each other as much as possible. 
2. She is leaving for China this year for an internship for a year. 
3. We have been seeing each other long distance for a couple of months. 
4. We met online via a one night stand, which turned into something more. 

Relationship details: 
1. We are in love. We say it to one another everyday. 
2. We have a strong emotional connection and feel a lot for one another. 
3. We have learned to grow together, even when things get difficult we learn to communicate, to work through our feelings and thoughts. 
4. We are extremely honest and open with one another. 

So here's the kicker: this upcoming year she is moving to China for an internship that lasts a year. There is a strong possibility that I will be moving to her state in the future. But not before she leaves. (To be clear I'm moving for a job not for her, or at least that's what I tell myself).

We have discussed our future. She wants an open relationship. I don't. She has had a long distance relationship before. Understandably she has a better grasp of the situation and is most likely more realistic. I haven't had a long distance relationship, and don't understand the difficulties. That being said I want a closed relationship. I see it as a testament of love, an act of faith, a way to make the relationship stronger. 

We never really came to a decision. Right now I know that she sleeps with other people. She doesn't tell me, but it's kind of just understood. It's not wrong because we aren't in a relationship. At the same time I have a hard time being understanding. I know she still loves me, and I still love her but the fact is I'm a jealous person, I work on it, every weekend, but it's a work in progress. Trust me, I hate being jealous. 

She even encouraged me to sleep with other people. To get more ""experienced"", (I didn't take it personally, she is right about the experience part). I know, I know you guys are like Dude! That's a freaking dream situation! Haha Yeah but I'm just not built that way. I literally can't sleep with or date other people. I've attempted to on her encouragement. It just feels wrong. 

The physical part is hard, but because as I know her, its easier to be accepting or understanding (though it's still hurts, a lot). What gets me is the emotional part, which I can't wrap my head around. She says not only does she want to sleep with other people, but that it's possible to have strong feelings for more than one person, like romantically. When I hear this I just think, well then what's the point of a relationship.l, that doesn't sound very romantic. 

I'm constantly going through mental gymnastics, trying to understand her position, even going as far as telling myself I'm just not open minded enough, that I need to ""get over myself"". I feel bad because this causes issues in our relationship. I've shared my feelings with her on this topic. She has a good head on her shoulders and realizes that being away from me for so long while keeping a closed relationship is unrealistic. I understand her thinking but at the same time I just think that's not good enough. I feel like if you truly love someone you have faith in them you go through hardship (meaning not having intimacy/sex feelings for others etc.) Her counter argument is that that's how much she loves me. She's willing to keep our relationship going, albeit openly, even while in another country until we see each other again. 

Agh. She is so amazing. I just don't know what to do. I was hoping some of you could pitch in about open relationships if you have had/have them, and possibly give me advice about what you think about my situation. I would really appreciate it. Thank you. 

P.S. I've tried listening to podcasts such as Dan Savage, about open relationships, but it hasn't really done much for me. 

TLDR/ Friend who I romantically love is moving away. Wants to maintain an open relationship. Not my style. Need help understanding. Thanks. "
4t3cag,2,2016-07-16,Thinking ahead to grad school applications (help),UmamiSalami,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/4t3cag/thinking_ahead_to_grad_school_applications_help/,"Hi, I was hoping you all could help me out with a decision I need to make about programming projects. I'm a rising senior in mathematical economics and I'm planning to go on to a master's/bridge program in computer science before continuing on to a PhD in artificial intelligence. I'm a career switcher and my current internship has little to do with CS, just a little bit of statistics and Excel and game theory. However, my internship has an opportunity for me to help them with website development if I learn Ruby on Rails. I am new to programming, and I already know some of the basic syntax of Ruby and can write basic number crunching programs, but that's it. And we don't have an in-house developer, so I'd basically be looking at the existing code and maybe adding some things to it on my own.

Basically I have two choices: I can study Ruby intensely for the next four weeks, program a few things, and be able to tell graduate schools in my applications that I have been interested in computer science for a long time and did programming at my internship. After this summer, I'm guessing I'll have little use for Ruby on Rails and start learning Python and R because that is what is used in machine learning.

The other choice is that I just start learning Python or R immediately, get as much experience with them as possible in the next year or so, so that I lose the opportunity to put real world coding experience on my resume, but have more complete understanding of the most important programming languages and hopefully have more independent projects under my belt.

Which is better for maximizing my chances of being accepted into good graduate programs? Anything else to consider?

Currently entering my senior year at university for compsci. I've held numerous customer service jobs in the past and am on my second IT internship. My current internship I have been with them for over 6+ months now and they intend to keep me and have expressed interest in offering a full-time position.

Now for the actual question, I was told that the company will pay for certifications in order to broaden my knowledge base and possibly help out my work more. I work at a small business under a small IT team of 4. I mostly just work under the senior system admin. We are a Windows environment and work primarily with server 2012 R2.

I was thinking of going the MCSA 710-712 and following it up with one of their SQL database administration ones.

Any thoughts on this? My senior sys admin told me the MCSA would be good for me but that he is not knowledgable on certs as he hasn't held one in over 15+ years (he's an older gentleman).

Thanks in advance

EDIT: Hate to sidetrack but I was also wondering if there are any Arizona based system admins here and would care to give information regarding salaries here?

4t3zfx,0,2016-07-16,Please Advice Me On Career,kamisama_123,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/4t3zfx/please_advice_me_on_career/,"I am done with penultimate year in Computer Science and currently work an internship at a big financial institution. The work/pay is okay but I simply do not see myself in IT career. I like Computer Science but it seems that I simply do not have innate talent or passion for building software, it does not come easy to me. After school, I was met with a decision on what to study. Ended up having analysis-paralysis and took a gap year. After one year, I was still undecided but did some programming online and went with CS degree because I had to do something and hoped it will work out.

I do fine in my degree but have nagging doubts about my choice. I also discovered both from TRP and one famous blog the cold truth: time is most precious commodity. I am 23 now and not getting younger. This means that I must either choose and work extremely hard in current direction or look for something else to do while it is not too late. I think of a ship going in the wrong direction and the longer it stays on that path, the harder it is to steer the ship back to correct destination and catch up. I have not told anything to my parents about my doubts because of disappointment, wasted money that would imply. On the other hand, I can't see how ""waiting it out"" any longer would benefit me. I would probably be in my shitty small town in the middle of nowhere working dead-end job in a grocery store because nothing better is available.

This is a major source of my depressive tendencies. I feel emptiness. Men feel alive doing serious shit with a purpose and I crave for such a purpose. Otherwise, someone else creates that purpose, like current owner of financial company I work at.

The other directions I thought of are: becoming a medical/research doctor because I studied natural sciences at school and was good at it. The reason for why I did not go down that path was because: not sure if I want to spend 10+ years on that, parents/teachers pushing towards that, myself never considered in becoming one. I also considered becoming research scientist in biochemistry but the path was also damn long(8+ years). I settled for CS because it is interesting and only 4 years.

As you can see, a few years later I am still undecided. I also think that being medical researcher would be hell a lot more purposeful than me building CRUD apps. And I am not even good at it and don't care about it too much.

Fellow members of TRP, I understand that pursuing a well-paid job is a good idea, especially with automation, the fact of being broke being scary prospects. But what about doing the work you can be inherently good at? How can I discover those skills? I feel that one should capitalize on inherent strengths instead of looking for this passion myth. I am a kind of person who needs more from work than a fat paycheck. Even 40 hrs a week occupies so much time in life. As an intern, I don't hate my work because I am not responsible for huge systems that should be available 99.9% of time. I fear that my passionless attitude to work will leave me miserable. And the clock is ticking..."

While this has made me pick up bits and pieces of a whole lot of regional languages, I can't say I speak any language but English with any degree of fluency(not proud of it)

I currently go to a college in TN and most people here lose out so much just because of their inability to speak coherent English. I am not just talking about trivial shit like getting girls or inter college debates or being in a band or something like that; I am talking brilliant programmers missing out on internships simply because they stutter and stammer and don't get their point across in English. 

During the initial few months in college I used to feel shitty because most people would get hostile simply because of the fact that I used to start speaking in English almost impulsively. But you stick around for too long and people drop judgements they made right off the bat. And now I understand that their knee jerk reaction to a prick coming to them and talking in English is less about aversion than insecurity. 

Just last week I got an intern with a product company while two other guys who suck at english but know their stuff 10 times more than I do did not even make it to the final round of interviews. From what I see in my college the only people who speak good enough English seem to be from capital cities like Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai, etc. I'm really starting to feel that the most crucial thing to get ahead in this country is to be an eloquent speaker of english."

I enjoy the work and I enjoy most of the people.  However there are a few people who love to talk shit on everyone and they act like they have never done anything wrong.  It's usually all they talk about is how other employees suck or how other hospitals in our system suck.  When they do this some other employees who don't normally talk bad about others will chime in.  It creates are really negative work environment.  The main people are the people who look like they hate the job, they come in and they are already pissed off and can't want to go home.  I'm not sure if the have a bad home life and they take it out on everyone at work or if they hate the job so they just want to make everyone else around them feel miserable.  The tech I worked with today started looking for a new job while they were training me. They said they couldn't handle the negativity anymore after 3 years.  I've been trying to engage in conversation with the negative people about there hobbies or interest to get to know them better,  but they would rather sit there and stare off in space.

I just figured by now that we were all grown ups and people would stop being so petty.  I figured by this point in your life you have gone through some stuff and know that life can be hard so why make it harder for others and for yourself.  I thought hospital labs are part of a team and as a team we all work together.  If some one isn't that great at it, then train them better, help them do things the ""right"" way instead of just saying how bad they suck.

I just can't wrap my mind around how some people want to create a negative work environment. You may not like your team members to the point were you want to see them outside of work, but I feel like everyone is doing the best they can at the job and we all want to help the patients by doing our best.


*sigh*  I don't know.  This is more of a rant so I can get this off my chest.


EDIT: Thank you so much for your responses.  They helped me out a lot.  I think i'll take to the humor side of things.  I have already pulled a few jokes one some techs and already said some things that had them rolling.  So I think I will become the funny positive guy!"

My life is pretty fucked because I was given a shit draw at genetics.

I’m a thin guy, barely 5’8. More like 5’7 and 145 lbs. I used to lift a lot to compensate and got up to like 155 and looked muscular cause I’m short. Anyway I think about my life every day I probably need some sort of therapy because im so depressed now that it affects my every day life.

I’m 25

I had sex for the first time at 23 and it was to a girl I met on tinder. I had sex to another girl a couple months later, again from tinder, and she said she couldn’t really feel me inside her. My length is barely okay but my thickness is thin. (6 x 4.5) for those who are interested.

My insecurities:

I’ll never find a girl who really enjoys having sex with me

My height is a huge turnoff
My thin build is a huge turn off (at least I can fix this)
I’m very hairy on my
Legs and back
I have sunken eyes, big ears, big nose, but my face I am actually somewhat okay with. I just don’t look good when I’m so thin. I need to bulk up to cover my big head and especially ears with a bigger body.
Anyway my biggest concern and the thing I worry most about is relationships.

I have never had a meaningful relationship at 25 and my dick is somewhat thin. My job requires me to sit at a computer. I’m an intern at 25 and never had another job. My lack of experience in the corporate world is showing to my boss.

I don’t have any friends. When I say this I actually mean no friends. No girlfriend ever. And no way of meeting women, because that usually happens with friends.

It’s been like this for a while that im sure my depression is somewhat visible when speaking to me. That or I look like
I have zero personality.

The biggest things for me are I wish I had friends so I could meet women, I hate to disappoint my family and never meet anyone and not have a
Social life.

Basically I’m a loser. What would you do if you were me?

I've been thinking of moving to California and finding a job there and starting my life over at 25. But ofc i still have my physical limitations"
4t4wh3,36,2016-07-16,"Internship leads to banter,fun and frolics. Al[m]ost rips a hole in the [f]abric of reality",warpfactor0,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/4t4wh3/internship_leads_to_banterfun_and_frolics_almost/,"So this memory is from my University days - About 1990 when I was undertaking a summer internship with the City Council.  I had been tasked with abstracting legal opinions obtained by the City Council so they could create a database on their computer system.  This is pre-www as we know it.  There were a lot of opinions but I pretty much finished doing the abstracts ahead of schedule so was put into the property section in the legal department and got to work on some property transactions and was set some research tasks. I also got to go around the land titles and state government offices performing searches and so forth.  I got to do these rounds daily with the outside clerk Ann and occasionally the Articled Law Clerk, Jane.  

The clerks from the agencies around town who performed search and settlement services for various law firms and the outside clerks from some of the larger law firms in the city would do the rounds of the various government agencies where information and documents were accessed and ordered twice daily - remember this is before there was an online to perform these searches and access these documents online.

Anyway the clerks who did this were pretty much all female and had their schedules pretty well worked out. Morning tea at this coffee shop at 10.30 in the building where a particular government agency had its office and afternoon tea at 3.00 at another coffee shop next to another government agency and drinks after work on Thursdays at a particular bar and drinks after work on Fridays at a different bar - bars selected for the timing of their happy hours and the deals associated with the happy hours as much as their general ambience and patronage.   These girls had their shit organised.

Being the only guy among this group of women for 8 weeks was pretty interesting too.  They were all younger women between 19 and 25 (the job was pretty junior in the scheme of things and the girls who did it generally worked their way into more responsible roles or left for other reasons before too long).  The girls who worked for law firms were always well dressed and made up and (more than likely) hired on the basis of aesthetic considerations rather than possessing hard to acquire skill sets or intellectual firepower and the other girls who worked in the role were, it seems, eager to keep up with (if not outright compete with) their law firm counterparts.  So the women (I refer to them as girls through the lens of 25 odd years) I spent much of my internship with were good looking if not hot, well presented and not overly concerned with difficult issues.  Don't get me wrong these weren't bimbos or dummies they just were less complicated and angst ridden than the girls at University. 

As the only guy amongst these women and at the younger end of the age range I had an interesting time. At first I was regarded as something of a novelty and subjected to some gentle teasing but the more I was present the more I was let in on their ""in"" jokes rather than being the focus of them. Within about two weeks or so of regularly accompanying Ann on these rounds I'd been invited to Friday drinks ""with the girls"".  Only an idiot would refuse and my Momma didn't raise no idiot. 

Once I was accepted and perceived to be non-threatening the flirting began. Subtle innuendos and double entendres and banter gave way to more obvious ""bait"" for suggestive conversation - bait I'd happily dance around and then throw back.  And so began the game.

One of the ""girls"" who worked for a large law firm was Kelly.  Kelly was about 5'5"" beautifully presented with long black hair, flawless makeup, brown eyes, glasses, nice figure (not overly curvy yet not athletic), nice C Cup beasts and most attractive of all a filthy and agile mind.

Kelly and Jane were good friends largely based on their membership of the girls club and the impurity and agility of their minds.  Whereas Kelly  was dark and tall Jane was short - not quite 5' tall - blonde, blue eyed and built like a gymnast - lean and slender with not much more than A Cups.  Jane also had the filthiest laugh I've ever heard - it was positively pornographic - not sexy but bordering on the depraved.

Kelly, whilst not the only one to play our game, certainly played it with great enthusiasm and enjoyment.  I loved sparring with her and whenever Jane was party to our sparring  (often making valuable contributions of her own) she would often talk about the conversations once we got back to the office with a mixture of enjoyment and disbelief. 

Anyway, having been embraced into the group Thursday and Friday afternoon drinks were a lot if fun not least because the banter was able to go for longer and would be turned up to pretty much maximum inappropriateness.  

One of the themes of the banter between Jane and I was that if we were to get together one would break the other, ruin the other for future relationships, rip a hole in the fabric of reality or result in the other having to take holy orders with vows of chastity because of the certainty of never finding sex which would ever come close to what I would give her or she would give me.  That sort of chirping.  

In retrospect we both liked each other, weren't sure about closing the deal and had pretty decent egos which enabled us to play these little games with each other out in the open.  Again, in retrospect, all it was ever going to take was the addition of alcohol and opportunity and the inevitable colapse of space and time was going to happen.

It happened one Friday afternoon as we sat in the bar drinking Jane and Kelly started chair dancing (as in sitting in their chairs dancing in their seats) and we were just goofing around and the bar was getting busy with the after work partyers so the trips to the bar for drinks turned into a bit of a gauntlet to run.  There were four of us by this point and we figured out if one of us got to the bar we could form a drink relay to get the drinks back to our spot without having to run the gauntlet.  I made my way to the bar, Kelly a few feet behind me, one of the other girls a few feet behind her and Jane at our table a few feet beyond her.

We decided to get four rounds in and set up  camp in our spot for the evening before deciding what to do next.  I was tasked with ordering and starting the relay.  I ordered 8 rum and cokes, 4 bourbon and cokes and 4 vodka lime and soda handed over the cash and waited for the drinks to be poured.  As they were served I passed them back by twos and the relay commenced. First the rumbos and then the rest.  I ended up passing Kelly her vodka lime and soda x 2 and taking my last 2 bourbon and cokes as the relay came to an end and we snaked our way through the crowd back to our spot where the seats had now been dispensed with because the bar was getting more and more crowded. We drank and the girls were boogieing as they drank and I kind of pushed the envelope of our space to create a little room for us all to move around a little more in.  Kelly realized that this is what I was  doing and decided to help shape our space by grabbing my hand and dancing with me where we stood twirling around my hand and just basically demanding more room from the crowd around. 

This turned into a bit of a game of bump and rebound where she bumped her ass or her hip against someone and then rebounded exageratedley back to me and up against me before moving back to go again.   She actually started to say ""Wheeeee"" as she came on for me to catch her on the bounce. It was  a lot of fun and she started to give a little hop as she approached so I had to actually catch her as opposed to simply being the target of her impact.  This lead to more exagerated rebounding and eventually to me dipping her.

Then she did  something that completely changed the mood from ""fun"" to ""fuck"".  She took her hair out and removed her jacket.  

Her dark hair, styled up into a high pony tail, tumbled about her shoulders.  She was wearing a shift dress with a matching jacket so whe she took off her jacket her shoulders were bare and her hair tumbled down past her bare shoulders and framed her face just beautifully.  She tossed her jacket inder the table to her bag and shook her hair out some more then bounced back to me and I dipped her snapping her back up and face to face our noses just milimeters from each other.   It was like the sound had been muted and time slowed to a crawl. I could feel her breath on my mouth and taste the vodka on it. I searched her eyes and swivelled to dip her again this time following her down into a shallow dip as she closed the distance between our lips and we kissed.  It was deep and filled with weeks of sexual tension being released in a single moment.  My hand was in the middle of her back for the dip and I slid  it up to her neck as I brought her back up our lips still locked and our tongues exploring each other's mouths. As we straightened up my other hand reached around and held her hip as she leaned further into me pressing her hips into me and snaking her leg between mine. The kiss broke and we looked at each other with unspoken understanding.  She reached under the table to grab her bag and jacket and within 2 minutes we were  in a cab back to her place. 

We were all over each other on the cab ride to her place.  I threw some cash at the cabbie when we arrived and we tackled each other through her front door. By the time we were in her bedroom we'd shed all but our underwear. Kelly still had her panty hose on and between us we tore them off her and she started grinding against my leg as we devoured each other.  

Next, off came her bra as I started kissing, licking, sucking and biting my way down her neck to the top of her breasts as they are released from captivity.  They were everything I'd been picturing in my mind since not long after we'd met and more. Lovely pale mango-shaped breasts with skyward pointing dark pink nipples that were hard as marbles.  I kissed them in turn and she moaned her approval. My hand found its way down her belly to the waistband of her panties and I flattened my palm against her mound pressing firmly as I ran it down further and felt her lips through her soaked gusset.  She raised her ass off the bed and helped me pull her panties down as I kissed and licked my way from her navel through her trimmed bush and to ger dripping cunt.  I swirled my tongue briefly around her clit producing further moans of approval from Kelly.  She wriggled across the bed and as I lapped my tongue down her slit and tongued around the entrance to her dripping vagina she pressed a condom into my hand and in a loud raw shout told me ""just get it in me!""

I wasn't about to refuse her and rolled on the rubber positioned myself between her legs and my rock hard cock at the entrance to her pussy.  She was lying there in the early evening twilight (it wasn't yet 7.00pm) hair all over the place, lipstick smeared all over her lips one hand playing with her nipple - another slow motion moment - our eyes locked and I leamed forward forcing yhe head of my cock into her beautiful cunt.  She tilted her hips to meet my thrust as I kiseed her again and we started to find a rhythm. 5 maybe 6 thrusts and I was sliding into her all the way and each time I thrust in she'd gasp softly.  We moved together like we'd done this a thousand times before and between her sighs we'd kiss and steadily increase the tempo of our fucking. By the time we could my balls slapping against her ass she couldn't kiss anymore as she was moaning one long continuous moan through which she squeaked in time with my thrusts.  

As the pace of my thrusts grew faster still she wtapped her legs around my waist and started clawing at my back as she was rocked by the first of what was to be numerous orgasms. Her moans changed to swearing ""fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck jesus fucking shit my christ oh my god oh my god oh my god"" and then she screamed and bit my shoulder hard as her pussy clenched around my pistoning cock again.  

I continued for a few more minutes at a feverish pace. She came again digging her long red fingernails into my arms as she did and clenching her legs powerfully around my waist.  This stopped my thrusting in its tracks until she released her leg lock on me at which point I positioned her legs over my shoulders and reached for the headboard behind her to get a better angle and better traction and power into my thrusts which I resumed at aboutbthe pace I had been going at before her thigh crush stopped me. 

Before too long she was cumming again and shouting a long low shout of ""ohhhhhhhh mmmmmmyyyyyyygooooooooooddddddd!"" And moments later I followed with my own incoherent yawp as my balls emptied into the condom and I rolled aside next to her gasping for breath.   After a few moments she said ""Well fuck! Why haven't we done that before now!""

We wre both covered in marks from each other and sweat and juices and it felt fucking fantastic.  

Kelly slapped my hand away as I reached down between her legs to feel her pussy.  ""No not now too sensitive"" she got up and got a couple of towels and we cleaned ourselves up a little before we started making out again.

We fucked god knows how many times that weekend but we didn't do much else other than fuck eat sleep and go to buy chemist to buy bulk condoms, lube and skin cream for the chaffing, bites, whisker and carpet burn we inflicted on each other and ourselves. 

Kelly and I spent the rest of the period of my internship  (about 4 more weeks) basically fucking daily. 

We devolved into a FWB relationship for a few months after I returned to Uni and hooked up a few times (usually following Friday afternoon drinks)

Kelly eventually got a position that kept her in the office and she no longer kept company with the group of search and settlement clerks by which time we had both moved on.  We did come damn close to ripping a hole in the fabric of spacetime while we were together though.

Went there for 4 years and got out with a certification in C++ and Java. I also got an associates in science. I have also made an android application that's in the play store. I also do random projects that don't make it out but that I feel help me learn new API's (pretty much new ways of doing a particular task, for those who don't know). 

Right now I'm in the process of transferring to a university. Completing my Bachelors in CS

I have gotten some interviews from LinkedIn. Whenever I meet up with the recruiter/interviewer, I get asked when I graduate or when I graduated. When they hear that I haven't and won't for another 2 years, they noticeably become disinterested. 

How can I make them see my experience? Should I take the app and show them what I did (is it acceptable)? Any good places that legitimately show paid internships or entry level jobs? Internship.com is plagued with internships that aren't as they require a bachelors and entry level jobs with years of experience required... it sucks. 

How good does it look that I've made my own app, while going to school full time and working full time? - realistically, should I even mention it. "

We have to work long hours because our desk is severely understaffed: there are only 2 directors supervising 2 interns. As much as I'm grateful for the opportunity I think I'm gonna burn myself out before long if I continue working like this. Also I just can't stand one of the directors (let's call him A) who is the kind of person that can't own up to his mistake. Quick story: I'm in charge of preparing a pnl report every day and A is the one who proofreads it before letting me send it out to the higher bosses. That day A decided to add one sentence to the email (he came over and typed it at my workstation) and told me to send it, but it turned out to be grammatically incorrect. The higher boss replied with rage over the careless usage of grammar so I sent him an apology. At this moment A slid over and offered to correct my apology email. The next day during a team meeting he suggested I send the email to him first going first so that he could correct my grammar. Apart from this incident, I'm not so happy with how he treats tech support people in the BO either.
This is my first time working in a bank, so my thinking is perhaps myopic but I hate every second of my job right now. I'm just not the kind of person who can work 14 hours straight and get along well with a supercilious boss. Do you think it's a good idea to turn in the resignation letter after only 3 weeks? I'm even thinking of steering clear of the banking industry altogether, though this has been my dream job, or so I thought, a month ago."

I have no internships under my belt, and almost no projects to show outside of those done in class. I have no work experience, whatsoever, even in unrelated fields.

When I was taking classes, I had only a slight interest in the topics covered, except for web development, which was covered very briefly. Since there were no electives at my college that went more in depth on the subject, I started to do some learning outside of the classroom through freecodecamp and codecademy.

Since my graduation in June, I have yet to hear from any places that I've applied to (started applying since the summer of the previous year). A small part of me is ok with this because the jobs that applied to, specifically software engineering, don't interest me as much as web development.

Is a coding bootcamp to become a full-stack web dev a good next step for me?"

At that time when I was pretty busy and she practically forced me to meet her for a coffee. I found her to be an interesting woman. Not the most attractive girl but pretty interesting. I am a lean guy of short stature not very attractive but I think I am a good conversationalist and I am good at what I do - build softwares.

We chatted a lot and I asked her to meet me again. We watched game of thrones at my place. Talked about how she really wanted to get the job as a full time employee and the firm has promised her they'd but she's not so sure. Also in between all of this at some point she told me that she's also meeting other people on tinder to which I said doesn't bother me much. And she also said that she's pretty okay with hanging out with more than one dates. We used to talk a lot about varied things, her problems as an intern, her experiences in the new city to occasional playful sexual banter. She also indicated that she might be kissing (and possible more with the other other guy whom she met on tinder)

By our third date I was pretty interested in her. By this time she indicated that she just looking someone to hangout with and isn't looking for hookups which was fine with me..Also by this time her internship got extended for another month. But I practically had to beg her for a third date. So on our third date which was again just watching game of thrones in my house [I live alone] so after the episode I finally told her that I was having really a nice time with her and I might have a mini crush on her. after that I met her once more gave her a federer keyring (she's a huge tennis fan)

But after getting her decision from the firm she went home on a long 2 week vacation and started calling me everyday, she'd text all day while I was in office and then talk hours at night. I met another girl on tinder whom i had sex on the first date and I told her about it, she also opened up and told how she was having sex with the other tinder guy but that relationship is dead now. We discussed a lot of things about sex what she likes, what I like and things in general.

I asked her if we can go on a date when she comes back she said yes, but she'll need to figure out the other guy to a logical end first. That relationship is over but she's a little hung up she needs to have one final talk with him. I made it very clear that I want to date her or I'd rather not talk to her at all. She said she's not sure right now but she'd not want me to not talk to her at all.

After which I went home for 15 days, again she'd text all the time, sometime even force me to talk on the phone when I was clearly busy. I did enjoy talking to her. After I came back she met me a few times, one day she came to my house and started crying and told me that the other guy doesn't want to see him anymore.

Few days after this I asked her where do we stand can I ask her out for a date to which she said she doesn't see me as a romantic interest.

I am very bummed with this whole episode, I clearly had feelings for this girls and thought we got along very well, this whole thing is eating me up.
She said she'd want to be friends with me when I said I don't want to talk to her anymore.
She still calls me talks casually sometimes as if nothing has happened.

What do you guys think? What should I do now ?
Help me make sense of what happened here.

I feel like she was using me just to get out of the bad phase she was going through. By not telling me that she's not  romantically interested in me, earlier she kept me talking to her for months. 

So I met a girl on tinder about 3 months back we chatted for about 2 weeks on tinder and whatsapp. She was in the city for a just one month internship.

I am a lean guy of short stature not very attractive but I think I am a good conversationalist and I am good at what I do - build softwares.

We chatted a lot and I asked her to meet me again. We watched game of thrones at my place. Talked about how she really wanted to get the job as a full time employee and the firm has promised her they'd but she's not so sure. Also in between all of this at some point she told me that she's also meeting other people on tinder to which I said doesn't bother me much. And she also said that she's pretty okay with hanging out with more than one dates. We used to talk a lot about varied things, her problems as an intern, her experiences in the new city to occasional playful sexual banter. She also indicated that she might be kissing (and possible more with the other other guy whom she met on tinder)

By our third date I was pretty interested in her. By this time she indicated that she just looking someone to hangout with and isn't looking for hookups which was fine with me..Also by this time her internship got extended for another month. But I practically had to beg her for a third date. So on our third date which was again just watching game of thrones in my house [I live alone] so after the episode I finally told her that I was having really a nice time with her and I might have a mini crush on her. after that I met her once more gave her a federer keyring (she's a huge tennis fan)

But after getting her decision from the firm she went home on a long 2 week vacation and started calling me everyday, she'd text all day while I was in office and then talk hours at night. I met another girl on tinder whom i had sex on the first date and I told her about it, she also opened up and told how she was having sex with the other tinder guy but that relationship is dead now. We discussed a lot of things about sex what she likes, what I like and things in general.

I asked her if we can go on a date when she comes back she said yes, but she'll need to figure out the other guy to a logical end first. That relationship is over but she's a little hung up she needs to have one final talk with him. I made it very clear that I want to date her or I'd rather not talk to her at all. She said she's not sure right now but she'd not want me to not talk to her at all.

After which I went home for 15 days, again she'd text all the time, sometime even force me to talk on the phone when I was clearly busy. I did enjoy talking to her. After I came back she met me a few times, one day she came to my house and started crying and told me that the other guy doesn't want to see him anymore.

Few days after this I asked her where do we stand can I ask her out for a date to which she said she doesn't see me as a romantic interest.

I am very bummed with this whole episode, I clearly had feelings for this girls and thought we got along very well, this whole thing is eating me up.
She said she'd want to be friends with me when I said I don't want to talk to her anymore.
She still calls me talks casually sometimes as if nothing has happened.

What do you guys think? What should I do now ?
Help me make sense of what happened here.

I feel like she was using me just to get out of the bad phase she was going through. By not telling me that she's not  romantically interested in me, earlier she kept me talking to her for months. 

I am angry at her for not telling me earlier and I feel used, feels like i wasted a lot of time because she wasn't honest. Am I justified in being angry at her ? "

This is my first reddit post, so please bear with my language/ reddit etiquette. I have been offered a post grad course in data science and analytics without any scholarship. I have good amount of work experience (8 yrs) in analytics though. My aim is take a break from the long work life and study, work for a couple of years and return to India. I have always loved Ireland and can't wait to get there. This is my last shot at education. But I'm running on low budget and I have a few questions and hoping to find real world answers from all of you.

1. I have saved very little over the years and hence ended up taking a huge loan for my tuition fees. 1 million Indian rupees to be precise. Is it  possible to find part time work/ intern very early into the first semester?

2. How's the job market in the Ireland for data science/ analytics?

Thank you for reading

4t67a2,146,2016-07-16,CS grad and bad programmer with no real experience - what to do,goofsngaffs89,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4t67a2/cs_grad_and_bad_programmer_with_no_real/,"Well, I've finally decided to just be honest with myself today and ask for advice. I graduated my CS program in May. I actually got a considerable amount of interest in February and March when I started applying for jobs, probably 5 or so places contacting me to set up interviews without applying for that many. Maybe 30-40 total?

Like an idiot, I told them all I changed my mind and wanted to focus on academics, because at the time I was having a bit of a nervous breakdown thinking I wouldn't be able to graduate (I ended up with a 3.5 for the semester, it was worrying for nothing).

I've recently started applying again. I'm sure I will get more interviews. The problem is, I'm a bad programmer. I have no internship experience, I'm 27 years old (started school late because of social anxiety and inability to decide what I wanted to do). No personal projects. I don't hate programming itself by any means, but the idea of dedicating my spare time toward learning how to write Android apps makes me absolutely overwhelmed and miserable. I realize this puts me at a huge disadvantage to a lot of people who actually have a passion for programming. Which is why I'm wondering whether to get out of the field now.

My school's CS program *sucks*. I got a 3.6 cumulative GPA despite the fact that I probably deserved to fail my Theory of Algorithms, calculus and discrete structures courses. The programming courses I mainly was actually decent in. But algorithms and data structures altogether? It's mostly like Chinese to me. I mean I know what a stack, queue, arraylist etc are and how to implement them but other stuff I'm not nearly as good with.

I can already see myself getting to my first technical interview, absolutely panicking and just humiliating myself when I can't get up and do some easy problems. 

So basically, what I am here to ask is: Is it worth it to even pursue CS further? Should I try to get a junior job somewhere and, assuming I get one, just try to get better with experience? Or am I so bad that I really should focus my efforts elsewhere, on a non-programming jobs?

If you do recommend avoiding CS jobs, where would you recommend I look? What places might be interested in a CS grad not really good at CS (I have good general computer skills and knowledge, my two year job during school was basically helpdesk).

Also, please be honest. Not looking to be handled with kid gloves, looking for advice that will help me decide a path from here. Thanks.

Got an internal interview next week and feeling nervous,senseios,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4t6g7v/approaching_the_end_of_my_internship_at_a_company/,"Hello, I am currently finishing my internship at a big company. In order to be accepted as a normal developer to my current team I need to have a skype interview with a technical manager from the company's headquarters located in another country.


I think I did pretty well during the last three months here and I have a lot of accomplished tasks so far, but anyway I am scared that I won't be accepted for some reason.

Growing up, my sister and I fought a lot and it was really exhausting to spend a lot of time with her because of this. As she grew into her teenaged years, those fights became mostly one sided, with her deliberately pushing my buttons (calling me fatass, stupid, ugly) to see how I reacted. When I got into college, she relentlessly made fun of how bad the school was and how stupid I was (it was top-20 ranked by US news and reports if that makes any difference). She talked down about that until the only school she was accepted to was the same school I attended. 

She started to depend on me to show her the ropes and to proofread her papers. I pushed her to take certain classes and apply for several internships that I wish I had known about when I was in her shoes. So things were going well for a while. I had graduated after that year together and took a job out of state. After a year, I decided it wasn't for me and applied to grad school in my field and got in! I came back home for the summer and am having to deal with my sister outside of school now. 

She is rude to me and makes a big show of turning her nose up at any of my interests she does not agree with. She continues to call me fat even though I am lighter than her, calls me poor for living at home for the summer. The most recent offense was last week, when she barged into my room while I was skyping a few friends and started to talk loudly about how I am a loser while refusing to leave my room. She smirks and laughs when I get angry and it's starting to get on my nerves.

The worst part is that she still ""tells"" on me to my parents when I do something she does not agree with, like having private photos of my boyfriend on my phone (she looked through my phone without permission to find these), wearing low cut shirts, or coming home after midnight. Of course these are things that my parents don't always agree with too, so they are disappointed in me. 

I have tried to discuss this behavior with my parents but my dad is always busy with work and doesn't participate much in family issues and my mom believes that as long as her children don't do drugs or murder people, there is no problem. I feel like that is half the problem--that my sister only listens to my parents but they don't ""check"" her when she does something socially unacceptable.

My parents emphasize that family is really important and I completely agree with them. However, this disconnect makes me feel the opposite, like I'm not respected enough to be treated well. I know that the future will be hard for my sister if she doesn't change, and I am willing to help her change so I can finally feel at peace being with my family again. What can I do to help my sister grow up? Is it my problem for being easy to annoy?


note: she's very extroverted and wildly popular with her friends and mentors, so the pressure to change outside of the home is never there. It seems she is only rude to me.


**tl;dr**: My sister is immature and disrespectful to me even at 21 years old. How can I help her grow the fuck up?"

I am currently working at a Big Four company in LA as a Security Consultant. I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona as a CIS major. This school itself as a CIS degree has a great reputation in Cyber Security and a lot of grads become very marketable after graduating through internships, CCDC, and clubs. 

I am happy about what I did so far in my career, as I know that Cyber Security isn't an easy field to break into, and I managed to get in without going through the years of being at a help desk or technician.

So at this point, I'm wondering how I can advance my career and (not to sound greedy or cocky) maximize the money I can earn. I am making a decent living as a single male, but where do I go from here? Should I work on getting my Masters in CIS so that more opportunities open up, or get my CISSP? 

Any knowledge would be very helpful :). Thank you cscareerquestions!"

1. I am supplementing my degree with minors in computer science and statistics as the skills learned from them seem to be valuable for conducting research.  Will this influence information systems graduate admissions much?
2. Is there any way to gain undergraduate research experience in the information systems field?  Or is it even expected that a student have research experience in this field before pursuing a graduate degree?
3. What is the general job market for information systems academia?  I know academia in general is very competitive and I want to know if it is the same in this area of study.
4. How much is industry experience valued in information systems admissions?  I am currently a network engineer intern and am working towards some industry certifications.

First build, be gentle.

I thought I'd finally buy the gaming rig I'd been mulling over for well over a year now. The paycheck for my summer research internship just came in, and I'll be heading home in two weeks (hopefully to a month of pre-semester gaming fun.)

Currently, I have a Samsung SSD that's been sitting in my old laptop. It's only seen about a year of use, so I think it should do fine.

As for the rest of the build, I can get the processor, motherboard, ram, and power supply at my local Micro Center for just under $400, and I'm planning on ordering the case off of Amazon, and the graphics card straight from EVGA. Altogether, it should come out to just about $700, right on budget.

Primary motivation for the case and mobo was size. I'd like a rig that I can have on my desk at uni without taking up too much space and which allows for portability when travelling between home and school. Also, the on-board WiFi is definitely a plus, since I'm not sure where the ethernet jacks will be in my apartment this year. 

As far as the CPU, RAM, and PSU, these seem to be popular among the budget builders these days. I may end up upgrading to an i7 depending on where my research stuff goes, but I'll cross that bridge later. I don't see myself overclocking in the near future, so the 6500 seemed the best option. RAM is RAM, and the Crucial sticks seem cheap yet reputable. The PSU was mainly chosen for its availability at Micro Center, so any testimonials or better recommendations are very welcome. 

Lastly, for the GPU, I think the 970 should suit my needs (despite 3.5/4). I'm planning on playing mostly older titles (Dishonored, Skyrim, Bioshock 1/2/Infinite), plenty of 2Ds and indies (Undertale, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Meatboy, Bastion, etc.), and emulation of systems up to GameCube. I do have a 4K monitor, so higher-res gaming is a possibility. I'm thinking I'll utilize EVGA's Step-Up program to upgrade to a 1070 when I have more money saved up (and when they're in stock.)"

A woman desperately waved to Natalia and her entourage as they exited the official Moldovan government smartcar fleet (hey, gotta reduce reliance of foreign natural gas somehow) and had begun to walk toward the capitol building. The woman had pressed her way to the front of the crowd that gathered to catch a glimpse of the Prime Minister. Something about her voice, they way she called for help, caused the Prime Minister to stop. She waved to her staff to wait a moment and walked over to the woman. As she neared the woman, a look of relief spread across her face and she broke into tears.

&gt;""Oh thank you, bless you, thank you.""

&gt;""Please, it's ok. Please, what's the problem? Miss...""

&gt;""Constantinescu. Aurelia. Please, I've been trying for days and don't know where else to turn. My son, Ryan, I haven't heard from him in days. He was in Romania, somewhere near the border when the fighting broke out. He's been making calls and checking in as he's tried to work his way to the Moldovan border but it's been days since his last check-in and I haven't heard anything. This isn't the Romania I know. This isn't the Romania I left 10 years ago with my husband. Please, madame Prime Minister, please help my country. Please help me find my son""

&gt;""Mrs. Constantinescu. Please come with me. We're going to do what we can.""

&gt;""Bless you.""

The Prime Minister placed an arm over Mrs. C's shoulder and helped her across the barrier around the crowd. She led the older woman over to her aides and the groups made their way inside.

They ushered her into one of the smaller conference rooms. The Prime Minister herself made the two of them a cup of tea and sat with the woman as her aides continued to flutter in and out of the room with various smaller things.

&gt;""Please, Mrs. Constantinescu...""

&gt;""Please mam, you can just call me Aurealia"" *[m] because that's much easier to type and doesn't me continuing to check back and see how I spelled it the first time*

&gt;""Aurelia, please, tell me about your son.""

&gt;""Well Ryan was always a very shy boy. He was always reserved and private *[m] get it?* Never one to make a show, but always trying to make the world a better place in his own, quiet way. That's why his father and I weren't surprised when he said that he as going to go back to Romania shortly after the NCP took power. He said he was going to help the average Romanian. The common citizen. He saw the writing on the wall before any else really. He knows that the government would brainwash their citizens, strong arm and bully the ones that didn't go along with them. He knew what we're all seeing now, that the future of Romania under communism was only one of suffering. All because of the communists. We were worried of course, my parents had told us the stories of life under communism and we could only fear this New Communist Party would turn to the same methods to stifle and stop any who went against their wishes, but Ryan was sure of his decision. He never directly told me what he was doing, but all I know is that I've received letter from maybe a dozen families in Moldova who thanked me for Ryan's help in fleeing across the border. But those letter have slowed and now they've stopped. In his last call Ryan was almost shell-shocked. He said that almost all the citizens had now fallen in, lock-step behind the communists. Then the fighting came. The area he was staying up was swept up in support by the NCP. His second to last call said he was leaving and heading for the border and that he'd be home soon. I receive one more call about a week ago. He said the trip was harder than he had thought it would be. Much of the countryside was under heavy police control and he could only move at night. He had been well known for what he was doing in helping families flee the country in the early days of when the new party took over. He said that families he had once known as friends had turned their back on him. One had tried to expose him to the police and he had fled. He was being put up in the attic of one of the few friendly families remaining but wasn't sure when he would be able to leave. I don't know where he is and I'm fearing for the worst.""

Mrs. C again broke into tears. Natalia placed a hand on her shoulder and let her work out the tears. She could only imagine the terror this mother felt for the safety of her son.

&gt;""I just don't understand how the people there could change so fast. My husband and I moved from Romania only 10 years ago. He'd found a better job across the border here in Moldova and we were able to move the family here. This isn't the country and these aren't the people I left behind. I have friends, I have family members, still in Romania and I don't know what to think about who they support. I can't believe that the whole country would just fall into line behind the NCP without some sort of coercion. These are kind, gentle, peaceful, freedom-loving people. I just can't believe they'd do something like this. And now the fighting. They're pouring out in droves to kill and die for the NCP. The leaders are just pointing and they're marching off to die like sheep. That's not to mention the bombs they're showing on the news. In less than a few years its like the whole nation has been turned into terrorists. No better than those that [struck here a few years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/4m8wqs/event_explosions_rock_moldovan_capital/).""

&gt;""I know, I've heard the same thing from leaders from across the free Romanian communities here in Moldova. That's one of the reasons I officially committed our forces to the Democratic Coalition but I fear that we cannot win hearts and minds with our military alone. We must take further action. Aurelia, if I formally request with the Romanian government to help with the search for your son and return him to Moldova, do you think it would help him or only bring the full attention of the NCP to his situation?""

&gt;""As much as I hope the former, I can only assume it would be the later.""

Brow furrowed, Natalia's grey eyes grew colder, but still kept that spark, that fire, that the nation knew meant behind those eyes she was weighing her options and making a plan.

&gt;""Ok. I want you to know that I'm planning on doing all that I can to both find your son and bring him home and also to help the Romanian people suffering and dying under this NCP regime. I promise you Aurelia. Do you have somewhere to stay in the city until I have a better answer for you?""

&gt;""Yes, my husband and I have a small flat in the city.""

&gt;""Ok. Aurelia, thank you for calling out to me today. I'll keep in touch when I can let you know more""

&gt;""No mam, thank you. For all you help. For all you're doing for me and for Romania. You're the best thing to happen to this country and to Romania in a long time.""

Aurelia suddenly sprung forward, surprisingly quick for a woman her age. She gave Natalia a great, big hug that Nat returned after a second of surprise. Aurelia reminded Nat of her own mother, and made a mental note to call and check up on her later.

*later, in a meeting with her advisors*

&gt;""...and that's why we need to take more than just military action against Romania. Hearts and minds. That's what they always say, but you can't do that with bullets alone. Our own military is a drop in the bucket of the Coalition forces attempting to liberate Romania, and even they have bogged down. We have the chance to do the greatest good of any member without even picking up a gun. We share a long and mutual history with Romania. For most Moldovans, for most of their lives, the border between our two countries has been almost nonexistent. Crossing would not noticeably change the language, would not change the culture, would not change the people, would not change the way of life. But everything changed when the ~~fire nation~~ communists ~~attacked~~ came to power.

&gt;But we still have the most powerful arsenal for Romanian democracy that any other nation could hope to hold. Romanians themselves. Even before the border closed, brave men and women, like Ryan Constantinescu, were working to help refugees escape the NCP to free Moldovan soil. Now the NCP government is cracking down on these brave individuals and coercing and strong-arming their population into blindly dying for their cause. This is a fact that, more uniquely than any other country and any other people, we are uniquely positioned to change that. So how do we do that? How do we save Ryan? How do we save the Romanian people""

She stared around the table at her cabinet and staff. Their collective minds, the best in all of Moldova, set to work on solution. Finally, one of the interns at the back spoke up.

&gt;""Well, what's the major difference between a Moldovan and a Romanian? A few words and a passport? Even then, there a plenty of Romanian-Moldovan or Romanian refugees who I'm sure would gladly go back in for the good of the country. With a little support from us and maybe some funding from some of the other Coalition countries they could probably start making a pretty big difference. At very least make contact with anyone still in Romania and get them and any other refugees home safely.""

&gt;""That's...actually that's perfect. Where the military forces have ground to a halt, the average citizen can make a difference. Get me the Coalition forces on the phone, we've made contact with them, right? We can get a call through? Good. Tell them we have a plan that might just change the war.""

tl;dr Moldova seeks Coalition funding and supplies to support sending free Romanians and Romanian-Moldovan citizens back into Romania in order to change the hearts and minds of the average populace. Turn them away from communism and back toward freedom. Ultimate goals would be to lay down arms/overthrow communism/join freedom and democracy and apple pie coalition.

[m] I wanted to get a feel for support and funding before sending in ~~operatives~~ freedom ~~fighters~~ supporters. If I can get the support, the follow-up would probably be a secret post but I'll wait on that for now. Thoughts?"

I'm hoping someone will have experience with this kind of situation and can guide me, because I'm utterly lost and desperate.  
  
  
So I am a relatively new hire doing software development for a big bank. With size comes bureaucracy, and speaking with some of the other new hires who had done an internship here before, they said that things move at a snail's pace with the bureaucracy.   
  
I have a muscular condition that causes pain in my entire upper body if I am typing at a computer for too long. Laptops are especially awful because my shoulders are hunched, my wrists are angled up, my neck is bent downwards, and I don't get much back support because I'm leaning forward. My condition is managed and made better through an ergonomic setup including a keyboard, monitor, and mouse. I read the qualifications of disability in the US, and my condition does not meet those qualifications even if I wanted to voluntarily declare disability to my workplace. I don't want to have to disclose my condition. I have a friend with a similar condition in a similar field of work who says that her company will provide her with whatever ergonomic peripherals she asks for, no questions asked.   
  
  
So, I talked to my manager about getting peripherals. Because I (and the other new hires) are in a training period, we don't have permanent desks, and thus cannot get peripherals. I'm stuck on this terrible tiny laptop. It's been a week and I'm already feeling pretty bad pain to the point where my productivity has significantly declined. It's not to the point where I'm behind on training, but I'm very stressed about that scenario, which is making my pain worse all around.   
   
  
I told my situation to a few of my fellow hires who had been interns previously, and they told me to talk to HR. Problem is, I have no idea what to say. I don't have any sort of script. All I know is that I need to make them realize how urgent my situation is, without making them think I'm a liability. I'm not dumb. The days I had no pain I was blitzing through the training with flying colors. I know I will be an asset to the company.   

  
Options I have considered: bringing my personal keyboard and mouse. Unfortunately, I have to walk a long time for my commute (~20 minutes one way) and having a super heavy backpack triggers my back pain. In other words, I'm out before I can even begin work, and the whole day is unproductive.  

Talking to my manager again. Well, I don't have another script for that, so I don't know what else I could try saying differently.   
  
  
Please ask me any questions that would help you help me. I probably should have posted this on a throwaway, but I don't even care anymore. Please can someone with experience help..."

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

----------------


I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up (would love her to look like Madison Ivy)

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S also looking to role play Marvel/DC, Game Of Thrones, The Witcher and Mass Effect

4t87ib,231,2016-07-17,"I just moved into a new home, and discovered a very unnerving stack of letters.",angryrobotnoises,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4t87ib/i_just_moved_into_a_new_home_and_discovered_a/,"Hi Reddit. 
As the title suggests, I have recently purchased and moved into a new home. The home itself is wonderful, it's a two bed one bath townhouse with a giant backyard. Aside from the tedious moving process, I really have no complaints, other than this strange stack of letters. Before I continue any further, I'm inserting a trigger warning. Turn back now if you're sensitive to graphic violence or self harm. I won't blame you, I myself had a hard enough time typing this letter out. 

Anyways, back to the story. When I arrived at the house it was fully furnished, with everything but a bed. This didn't concern me at all upon first glance; after all, who am I to turn down free stuff?! 
I didn't find the letters until just last week. They were stashed in the very back of a cabinet in the kitchen, each sealed in a yellowing Envelope, hastily scrawled handwriting across the center of each one. Of course I opened them. I don't know what I expected, love letters? Coupons? Recipes? Photos? Maybe even cash? But what i found..... 
I wish I would have just put them back. 

Below is the first letter, transcribed in its entirety. I apologize for any spelling or grammar errors, as I'm typing this on a phone keyboard. (My computer is still in a box).

The handwriting on the envelope reads- ""November"" 

Here's what's written inside: 
""Dear Emily,
I keep having these weird dreams where my teeth fall out. 

Normally it starts with me in our apartment, (you know the one we stayed at together in Paris while I finished up my internship) and I'll wake up and then I'll go to the bathroom and I'll be standing there in my boxers and I'll get my tooth brush and then for a split second I'll see the flash in the mirror. I keep going, even though I know what's going to happen, every time, the minute I open my mouth they wobble, hang, fall. Into the sink. One by one by one. Or worse I'll touch them and they rot away in y hands, turning to dust. And then the pain. The pain Emily, stabbing, prodding, washing over me in waves.

These days I wake up screaming a lot.

Emily. Emily. Emily. Emily Emily Emily Emily. Instead of counting sheep I say your name. 
Emily, do ghosts still get lonely? 
Do you get lonely?
If you could see me now- and maybe you can, who knows, I wonder what you'd say. 

Emily I haven't slept in three weeks and I haven't eaten in two days and I'm afraid any minute now the earth will split open and swallow me whole. 
If I drop off the face of the earth right now I don't think anyone would notice. I don't think anyone would care. I'm afraid people will forget me. 
I'm so afraid that ill just stop existing, because no one notices me anymore. Just another unshaven face in the crowd. 
...
Is this what dying feels like?
...
Sometimes I have dreams where I'm driving to your house and the perfect song is playing on the radio and the weather is amazing, and the air always smells like cherries and those snicker doodle cookies you'd always bake me. Then suddenly I'm driving faster and faster as the clouds grow because everything inside me just snaps for some reason and I'm making hair pin turns and driving faster than ever now, running over curbs and through red lights because some part of me knows you won't be there. And then suddenly I'm standing in the doorway and you're walking around again, your auburn hair in the light and for a minute I  think it's real. Every time Emily. Every time. But then you walk right through me, and go about your daily life again, running around cooking and cleaning and painting and I'm following you and trying to touch you and hold you and tell you I'm sorry but you can't see me and you can't hear me and then I wake up and It's me there, alone. Again. A living, breathing, ghost. 
I just vanish. 
I keep having dreams where I rip off every one of my fingernails just to make sure I'm alive. 
It's passive suicide.

People keep telling me ""You're handling all this so well!""- it's funny, I've really never been worse. 

It's subconscious guilt.
Emily I feel like I take and take and take and never give enough and it's FUCKING WITH ME. 
It's existential...
Fuck it. 
It's not fair, Emily. 
It's not fair.
I'm sorry I'm telling you all of this. 
I love you. Goodnight. 
-N""

And that's all there is. I don't know what I should do, should I burn these letters? Put them back where I found them? Share the rest with the Internet?  I'm not sure if this is some sick prank.... Or.... I just don't know. Anyways, thanks for reading this far. My phone battery is going fast, but I'll try and update soon. 

Update- I typed out another letter, expect more soon
Update 2- second letter is up! It can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4tixra/i_just_moved_into_a_new_home_and_discovered_a/?st=iqsv032f&amp;sh=d7f736ef"

My sister and I have always had a complicated relationship. We are very close and we love each other, but that doesn't change the fact that most of the drama in my life comes from my mother and her. To keep things short, I've been visiting her and staying at her house for the last two weeks. I was only going to stay here for a week, but when I was heading to the airport last Monday she got a job interview and asked me to stay and go to the interview with her (she says I give her luck, 'cause it's the third time I go to a job interview with her and she gets the job offer). I have a summer internship in another city, so I would be missing work, but since I'll go back to our country next month and I won't be able to spend as much time as I want with her, I said I would stay.

I had a complicated week 'cause staying at her house meant I had no time to work on my own stuff or simply do things as I like to do them. I'm supposed to help her all day with her kids and with the house. She doesn't like me texting or reading stuff on my phone 'cause she says it's unpolite and I should be enjoying my time with her. Since I like doing stuff my way and spending some time alone this week was kind of complicated, we had a few arguments and I kept my mouth shut to avoid any fights. But since I'm writing this post you can all guess it didn't work out as planned.

Today we went to a barbecue at my brother-in-law's friend's house. My brother-in-law works for a huge company and my sister is trying to get me a job there, and since his friends and coworkers would be at the barbecue she said I should go too and do some networking. Truth to be told, even without the whole job thing I would have to go because I'm not really ""allowed"" to do stuff without her when I'm visiting. Anyway, as soon as we arrived at the barbecue she started greeting people and left me behind. I knew a few of their friends and greeted them, and one of them said ""Oh, your sister forgot to introduce you, didn't she? Let me take you around"". I ended up talking with this woman for the most part of the barbecue, 'cause I didn't actually know anyone else, and she has always been nice to me. Even when my sister was sitting right beside me she wouldn't bring me into the conversation and would only talk to me to ask me to look after her children. 

I got pretty pissed off, since the only reason I'm still here visiting is because she asked me to, and I'm doing it at the expense of working on my own stuff (like my job). But to avoid any other trouble or drama I kept quiet and sent a few messages to my best friend who knows the entire deal between me and my sister. Keep in mind we spent 5 hours at this barbecue, and I was quiet for the most part of them.

Later we were back at her house, having dinner, and she was talking to me as usual (I mean, when it's only the two of us). She mentioned how the woman at the barbecue was being nice to me, and said she was only doing it to ""get to her"". I told her I thought she was only being kind, but my sister kept on bad-mouthing her - they are allegedly friends, by the way. At the middle of the conversation, a message from the friend I was texting during the afternoon popped up on my iPhone's screen. My sister glimpsed at it, saw that it was about her and tried to take the phone out of my hands to read what I was messaging my friend. I managed to hold on to my phone and stop her, but she got pissed off and told me she would tell our mom I how much weight I had gained since the last time she saw me, since I wasn't being nice to her (my sister). Then she got quiet, told me goodnight and went upstairs to her bedroom. All my friend's message said was to keep in mind that's how my sister acts, that we love each other and that I would be going home on the next day.

We have not talked since. I'm going back to my city and my apartment tomorrow after breakfast, so I'm not really worried about us fighting but I'm really tired and I don't know what to do with our relationship. I know I've written a lot and this post is already huge, but I'm going to talk a little more about some of the stuff I have been trough 'cause I really need some solid advice.

The reason why I'm living in the US is because I got a scholarship from my government to go to college and study here for a year. Like I said, I'm going back home next month. My sister lives here in the US 'cause her husband works at the great company I talked about earlier and he got a job here. When I first got the scholarship my sister and I were in the middle of a fight, and first, she threatened to ""Send a letter to immigration and tell them I wanted to come here and never leave again, so they wouldn't give me a Visa"". Then she said my scholarship was pretty much the same as getting ""food stamps"" from the government. I ended up attending a university in the Midwest (she lives on the East Coast) just to avoid being too close to her. 

We made peace with each other before I moved here, and I visited every three months or so, despite the distance. We had other arguments, of course, but I ended up learning to forgive her because I wanted to stay with my nephew and my niece, and because when we are not having terrible arguments we get along well. We both struggle with weight and our mom is kind of a skinny freak, so that's why she threatened to tell our mom I gained a ton of weight when she saw my friend's message. 

Anyway, we always had a complicated relationship. She always tells me what to do, gets pissed off when I don't do it, and then says I don't know how to live without people telling me what to do. She has everyone doing what she says, even her husband and her children. In the end, I choose to forget what she does and move on with my life, but I'm getting tired and I wanted to have an outside perspective on this situation. Sorry if the post is confusing, it's just that there's so much going on between us, for so long, that if I tried to explain everything I would end up writing a (very boring) book.


   
**tl;dr**: My sister read a message about her she wasn't supposed to read. It was all it took her to treat me badly after two weeks I've done nothing but help her out and be nice to her. It's not the first time it happens, I'm tired and I don't know what I should do."

Long story short, I used to be a researcher in the Neuroscience field. I'm looking to go into software development now, for Android or otherwise.

Here is what I've already done:

1) Familiarized myself with C++ through the C++ Programming book by Malik, everything up to 


- Arrays and Strings


- Structs


- Class and Data Abstraction


- Inheritance


- Pointers, Virtual Functions, Abstract Classes


- Overloading


- Exception Handling


- Recursion


- Vectors

2) Familiarize myself with Java, everything up to 


- Arrays and ArrayList


- Wrapper classes


- Inheritance

3) Found an internship as a Game Programmer working with C#

Soon, I'm looking to:


1) use the internship to learn different stages of project development in teams, since I will be given a project to work in groups.


2) venture into Data Structures in Java after I'm more familiar with the language.


3) work on some Android apps when I have free time

Am I currently on the right path? How far am I away from an entry-level position as a developer?"

Prefer larger screen.,EulersMeth,SuggestALaptop,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/4t91qw/1000ish_budget_dual_boot_windows_10_and_some/,"**Short**: I will have about $1000 and maybe a bit more in disposable income after this summer. I've been using a really nice Macbook at my internship and I'm thinking my aging slowing Asus K55N won't cut it for me anymore. I do not need ""the best"" graphics, when I play games I am solely interested in gameplay. I played Starcraft 2 on low/medium back when I had a desktop rig because it was easier to click on things without the high-graphics effects. I'll probably be playing Overwatch and Rocket League when I'm playing anything at all. If GameCube emulation (Dolphin) is even possible in this budget that'd be cool but if not, I can survive with N64 emulation too (which can be done on like $60 laptops so let's focus on Overwatch). I really liked the nice screen I have this summer but I don't want to go Macbook - anything 15"" should be fine.

**Total budget and country of purchase**: $1000-1500, USA


**Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** I need something that's basically guaranteed to be able to dual boot without me being very sad and breaking everything. Will probably spend 80% of my time in Linux but I'll be in Windows enough for it to matter. I mostly use my laptop plugged in as well, but a non-2 hour battery life would be cool.

**How important is weight to you?** Not at all

**Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac**. Windows 10 AND Linux, probably Ubuntu but maybe Debian.

**Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 15.4ish would be stellar. Bigger screen = more room for activities.

**Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** - Overwatch is about as intensive as I'd want, and again, not super into pretty graphics. Will be using Atom/Eclipse/Chrome/Firefox fairly extensively but I may fool around with Android Studio as well. Basically, I need lots of RAM ;) (Oh, I use Vim too, but that runs on a toaster.)

**If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**
-Overwatch, preferably 60 FPS and settings can be low-med, it's fine

**Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)** 
Longterm reliability - Keyboard is an ABSOLUTE MUST. I really like Thinkpad keyboards and to be completely honest I type really well on my Asus K55N right now. I don't know much about keyboards to be honest but if you look up that model, I want that kind of keyboard (numpad isn't necessarily required though). SSD would be cool. HDMI output is required for Netflix and Chill with the SO, and I'd like a couple USB ports as well. The more the merrier.

EDIT: Also I don't want a touch screen. Don't need one."

I am looking at Australia as one of the candidates for starting my career in because of good economy, weather, people(all Australians I met were excellent human beings and friends) and adventure. I am looking to stay for at least couple of years.

I am not sure if those are just dreams because I am new in immigration research. What is job market for software developers in Australia and how plausible is it to obtain work in the country without being in it? Or is there enough new graduates being pumped from local universities so I might not get lucky regarding my job search?"
4t93mq,0,2016-07-17,[25/m] I fucked up in so many ways. What do I do about my facebook girlfriend [24/F] ?,feedbackcarrot,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4t93mq/25m_i_fucked_up_in_so_many_ways_what_do_i_do/,"Traveling abroad, I met a local girl. In order to not have my date slip away like a gazelle I lied to her about how I intended to stay. To correct myself: I was contemplating living there longer but I knew I had done poor planning.
Below is my text from r/ offmychest. I feel the text is written more appropriately for this sub.

I told a girl I was studying at a private university as a cover for the real reasons: I traveled abroad for dental and facial surgery and possibly getting a second Identity. The trip was unplanned so I didn't achieve any of that. and I am stupid. I got lonely and found a sweet girl[[26/f] whom I dated a bit. we went to IKEA and to a park. She only had time on the weekends which wasnt enough for me.. so meanwhile I had dated another girl platonically (no kiss or sexy stuff). This second girl.. I told her off because I would feel bad if I had sex with two girls. When I told her, she immediately switched gears and texted me and wanted to pay for a trip to the cinema etc. She went home with me..she never left! I also did tell her to make herself at home. I told her off for the second time but she packed very slowly and I changed my mind. She stayed with me for the rest of the next three weeks. 

[Inserted for r/relaionships:I feel I should tell you that she is georgeous in bed and independent financially. She lived in one room with a roommate so we spent most of our time at my place. She studies law has a great body and sings well. She even was in a tv episode. She has ugly teeth and bad face skin but honestly I do not care so much about that.just enough to mention it. We went eating and clubbing and to he malls. I only now realized: She burnt all the three shirts with the iron. So much for trusting a girl to do favors.To this day I still believe it was passive agfressiveness as she told me she irons her school uniform every day. She knew I would be leaving but had told her I would come back in a months time]

I missed a plane because of her drama talks and my VISA expired. I got on a plane two days later. I should have trusted myself more and not listened to her feelings of wanting me to stay a bit more.  [During those two days I booked a hotel near her place even though I wanted to be in the hostek where a travel agency was.]


Now I am in my home country. [ after a few days away feom each other we began sexy video chating..it feels lile she jist wants to see me cum so I do not feel like meeting other girls.]


I Have no plans for going back but I have also not told her. And that is my real tifu. So I have to either 

1: Cut all communication with her. Which seems tough for me. We did not see each other for three weeks already so she might be very okay with it. It can go both ways.

 2 Actually fly back to Thailand, and to cover the lie, tell her that I am busy with school, and will only be able to see her on weekends ( this ia a big contrast to the three weeks together) and tell her that ahe cannot see my student ID or uniform. This is a horrible but ""backAgainst-the-wall"" lie. I eill then have to find a real job in order to not burn through my liges savings. In a country I do not speak the language of.


3 Tell her I wont be coming back anyway as my dad is ill 


4 tell her I wont be coming back as I got accepted to an internship. 


5 Come clean But lets be honest she might do passive aggressive stuff like texting all my fb contacts or something. Maybe say its okay tell me to come and them do ceazy shit I cant wven imagine - like ""lose my passport"" or just want me to spend money on flight tickets or have me arrested when I sleep with her...okay maybe I am being paranoid.


I have money to go and only a few things to keep me in my country. I have no friends and a small family  (father and sister only)

Frankly, staying in my home country is much safer from a financial perspective.
Then again, she did talk about marriage.


What should I do?"
4t9hf6,1,2016-07-17,Abusive relationship and BPD?,thatsanunderstatment,BPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/4t9hf6/abusive_relationship_and_bpd/,"I'm coming out of a full-on episode (months off work, in bed most days, lots of doctors) and struggling to understand how my former relationship related to BPD. I would value any opinions on how to structure my thoughts.  

I started dating my ex very casually. I didn't want anything heavy. He was leaving to go overseas for study. We agreed to have quite explorative sex on a casual basis. Some of the stuff he was into could distress me; he was very insistent on me performing in certain ways, saying certain things. At first I liked pleasing him, and did the things he liked, but as he grew more insistent (waking me up in the morning and not letting me sleep, repeatedly asking me to do these things) I started crying after sex and not feeling good. He said we could stop any time I said so, but I often didn't know how to say so. Often I thought I was fine and then would get emotional the next day. In other ways he was smart and fun to be with and I liked seeing him. We eventually stopped the difficult sexual behaviour.    

Anyway, as he was leaving to go overseas, I thought it was no big deal and we would break up. Until he asked me to go with him. When he asked I told him it was crazy, and we'd barely known each other. He grew sulky and said 'why are you dating me then?' I felt horrible, and said I'd think about it. I had been meaning to travel anyway. I tried to break up with him a few times, and he kept telling me I would regret it, and that I was stressed, and we should keep dating. He won me over and we agreed to go 6 months long distance and then I would join him.     

At the time my job was very stressful, and I was finishing a postgrad degree. After he left and we started long distance all my abandonment issues kicked into overdrive. I was working 14 hour days and crying all the time. I got a medical extension on my uni work. I kept calling him in total distress; he was always busy and I was always panicking. I wanted to break up and he told me I had to have faith, that I was just anxious.  

By the time I joined him abroad I was a mess. Ending work and moving made everything more intense. When I called him I would yell at him. He was very distant and not emotionally supportive of the stress. The day before I was meant to leave he called to break up with me and I begged him not to as I had made so many plans around him- he wound up backing down. I was so anxious I delayed my flight a week because I couldn't stop crying.  

When I got to his city I became more distressed still. He was busy with school all the time and had to pencil in days off for me. We did a few fun things but I couldn't settle. The neighbourhood didn't feel safe for me (homicides and break ins and meth houses). As soon as I arrived he started talking about a great internship he might be offered in a city on the opposite coast; i.e.: just as I was arriving he was making plans to move. The internship was for three months. I encouraged him and helped him prep for the interview. When he got offered the placement I told him to accept it, and then got completely suicidal. I broke a glass and walked in it. I took pills and drank whiskey. I didn't know what I was meant to be doing, waiting for him in a city I didn't know, or moving with him for three months and returning. I decided to go with him because I didn't know what to do in his city alone.  

When we got to the [larger metropolitan city] I didn't know what to do and hid in the apartment all day. Finding a job for three months in a new city in a new country felt awful. I became depressed and had total social phobia. Even going to the supermarket was hard. He went to his internship all day and when he came home I couldn't stop crying and yelling. At this time I suddenly became hugely upset by the uncomfortable sexual practice from when we first started dating. I couldn't stop yelling at him about it and 're-living' it. When I was upset we would grab each other. I threw a (cold) cup of coffee at him one morning when he was leaving for work. I hated being alone all day in the apartment.  

Finally after three months I applied for and got a job. I decided to stay on in the new city, while he went back to school on the other coast. Before he left I said we should break up and he just kind of refused, and hugged me, and told me we would work it out. He left, and the week I moved to my new sublet and started my job we had a fight because he couldn't see me over the holidays. He said he wanted to break up because I was being unreasonable. I had a complete melt down and begged him to stay with me.  

This pattern basically continued (I wanted to break up and couldn't, he would try to leave me and I would become frightened out of my mind) until he visited. I couldn't let go and forgive him the sexual stuff or the multiple moves I had made. We tried to talk it over and he kept pushing me to forgive him and I couldn't. He wanted us to move to another city together and I kept refusing. By the time he visited I had started feeling suicidal a few weeks prior. The day he was meant to end his visit I knew I was going to follow through with my plan. I was terrified of being alone feeling suicidal in a big city, and begged him to stay, to cancel his plans. It became a fight. He grabbed me around my neck and told me to 'enjoy dying'. I made many threats - I said that I would wait until he got a high ranking job and then I would tell everyone about his former sexual behaviour. He turned white. He called my friend and she came to get me, and he left.  

A few weeks later he called to breakup with me. I did not know what to do by that point. I was disorientated and had no idea how to manage. He said we could have (phone) sex if that would help distract me. We started having a lot of sex of the type from the start of the relationship. I said yes to everything, even if it made me uncomfortable. He started sending me pictures of his tindr dates, asking me if I thought they were hot, asking me if I wanted a threesome with them, asking me to seduce my friends, and their partners, and to tell him about it. I encouraged it, even though it felt like torture. I don't understand why I did this. Everything collapsed around me - I had a fight with several mutual friends, who knew I was suicidal. I tried to explain my confusion with the sex and him and they said they didn't think it was his fault.

Eventually I was taken into medical care and sent to my parent's house, and he kept messaging me erotic things. He said I could use sex as a way of distracting myself and that the psychosis would pass. After a few weeks I came back to myself and sent him a long email saying I thought he was horrible and that his sexual behaviour wasn't healthy. He's never replied and we don't talk anymore.  

I am really, really struggling to figure out what is splitting and what is real here. I'm worried I'm demonizing him unduly, and by indicating him as a source of my problems, I'm not addressing them properly. I know I didn't behave like a healthy person would, and I don't know why I didn't leave him. No-one in our mutual circles is talking to me, and I suspect he has told quite a few people I'm crazy. I'm really sorry to unload here if it isn't appropriate, but I would highly value any opinions.

I am currently doing Comp Science Masters in an arguably top 20 US university, I have one year left and I have a good standing there.
As for the languages I know English and French.

I do not have any previous work experience besides some internships

Also My father is Jewish(mentioning this because maybe it is applicable for asylum, for me or for my father? given the current situation)

My family also do have some funds to invest, so that might be an option too.

I of course checked the options for US but as you may already know it is difficult to get a permit there. Even if I do land a job there  I am left with a lottery. 

I am very worried with the things going on currently in Turkey, I would prefer one of the Western Countries but I am ok with any secular country 

Thank you, sorry if I made any errors I am still a little bit in shock of the recent events.

When should I start applying for internships for next summer and is there anything that I can do during this school year to increase my chances of obtaining one?

Bought a bunch of games and got really excited. The unfortunate part of this story is that I (was) a poor university student who only owned a (very old) iMac and a MacBook Pro (I'm a computer science student and it was pretty good for development). Anyways, I've been on an internship for the past while and have made some extra cash. I figure it's time to invest some time and cash into my long-time goal of building a gaming/development PC.

So I've been looking online obviously and have found some recommendations from others but the bottom line is that I'm not looking to break the bank. I'm thinking under $850 for everything, and it should be able to run high-quality graphics at a fast speed as well as be able to keep up with my programming needs (nothing too huge, C++/Java development within IDEs and a few other things).

Thanks!"

4ta83h,1,2016-07-17,I am worthless..,anon4835,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4ta83h/i_am_worthless/,"I am a 22 year old bi-racial gay male living in a medium sized town in the middle of nowhere.  I went to school in a small town where all but a few kids were white.  The class sizes were small, ranging from 5-15 kids, and everyone know everything about each other.  I never had any real friends; I had “acquaintances”.  I considered them friends at the time, but as I look back, they were not real friends.  I did not even know what a real friend was at the time.  I sat with them at lunch and when we had classes together I sat with them as well.  I did what I had to do to survive the four years of hell which was High School.  I could not bring myself to sit alone.  Racial slurs were constantly thrown at me, I was made fun of, but I was never physical hurt.  
	
I was lonely.  I still am lonely.  I could not make any friends, no matter how hard I tried.  What is wrong with me?  I believe that I am one of the nicest people that you will ever meet.  I know how much being bullied hurts, I know what it’s like when you are afraid to be yourself, and I know what it feels like to want all of it to be over.  I try to make sure no one ever has to feel the pain that I have felt.  If someone ever needs to talk, I am always there for them.  I am the kind of person that will do almost anything for a complete stranger if they truly need it, yet no one ever returns the favor.  
	
High school was a dark time in my life.  It is when I began hooking up with complete strangers that I would meet online or on apps.  I was extremely lonely and I had no friends, so this is how I coped.  It made me feel wanted, even though it was for all of the wrong reasons.  I was just a toy to the many guys that I let use me for their pleasure.  At the time I didn’t mind because it gave the illusion of someone actually wanting me and wanting to be around me.  As I look back, I regret every single second of it.  What I did was extremely stupid and dangerous.
	
I landed my first job in High School, and it was the best thing ever.  It was scary at first, but when I finally got the hang of things I was extremely good at what I did.  This was the first time that I ever felt like I was doing something right. I felt appreciated. I wanted more of this feeling. I didn’t start off with many hours, so I would go in to work each day after school and ask if anyone wanted me to come in and work for them.  The majority of the time they would say yes.  I ended up working 40 hours a week while in High School.  Work kept me busy, and I was around people that appreciated me.  It kept the dark feelings away and it was a great way to cope…. for a while.  After six months I was promoted to a trainer, and then six more months passed and I was a manager.  Accepting that position was bittersweet.  I had to work crazy hours and work with other managers who never respected me because of my age.  I became so angry and bitter. I started to dread life again, but then I saw the light at the end of the tunnel.  My way out.  I knew I could never do this for the rest of my life, so I signed up for classes.  It was all of the motivation I needed.  I asked to be demoted so that I could focus on my classes and I was transferred to another location.  It was around this time that I started my first relationship.
	
We had been friends for a little over a year now and decided to take it a step further.  This was so surprising to me because I had never been legitimately wanted before.  It was so new, and it made me feel amazing.  All of these new feelings clouded my judgement.  I let my guard down, and we decided to move in together (I know, huge mistake).  We found a nice apartment and the rent was roughly $500 a month, not including utilities.  I made enough to support us both.  He was a gymnastics instructor at a small (sketchy) gym in town.  Everything seemed like it was going fine at the time, which was very unusual.  As I look back, I remember all of the hurtful comments made that I, for some reason, chose to ignore.  Even when he started cheating on me I tried to ignore it at first.  I wondered what I was doing wrong.  I instantly blamed myself. If I were better he wouldn’t need to cheat.  If I were attractive he wouldn’t need to cheat. All of this was my fault somehow, and I spent the next year of my life trying to fix it.  No one in my family knew about my sexuality, and they still don’t.  So when we broke up and decided to move out I had no one to comfort me.  He was my only friend, and I could not tell my family for fear of ending up truly alone.  I called my mom crying and told her I could not do this anymore.  I cannot work full time, go to school full time, and worry about supporting myself.  I was able to move back home, and I was told I could stay there until I finish college.
	
At the time I was still working with the same company I started at when I was sixteen (just a different location).  It was such a terrible work environment.  At this new location I was harassed daily, and no one would speak to me.  This location was in a fancier neighborhood, and most of the employees were white.  There was one black woman that worked there, and we instantly became friends.  We ended up working most of our shifts together, and honestly she was the only reason I could get out of bed and go work at that terrible place.  Eventually it became too much, and I had to quit.
	
I immediately found another job.  The interview went amazingly well and was offered a job on the spot.  This was my chance. I could be me, so I did, and it worked out tremendously.  For the first time ever I was beginning to feel self-worth.  Literally everyone there liked me, and they enjoyed my company.  I was always asked why I was smiling, and I never had an answer.  I never even realized I was smiling until they began to point it out.  I was at ease in such a friendly environment.  I was told multiple times by many different people that I bring smiles to their faces and I am the reason they continue to work there.  I was also told that I am the type of person that people want to be around.  That statement baffled me.  If it were true, then why do I have no friends? I am obviously a friendly person.
	
I worked there for over a year until I finished my two year degree.  It was time to move on and begin my internship, which would turn into my next job, until I finished my Master’s degree.  I made so many amazing memories there. It was so hard to leave.  Around this time I met my first real friend.  My only friend.  I met him on Grindr.  We talked for about a month until we finally met. I was super nervous because he is extremely cute and I am…just me.  We went to see Deadpool.  I paid; I always pay.  I figure if someone wants to take a chance and actually hang out with me, they shouldn’t have to waste their money.
	
I honestly didn’t think we would hang out again after this and it scared me.  I really liked him, but it was Grindr after all.  We stopped talking for about a month and I finally decided to message him again.  He asked how I was doing and I told him ok.  I had recently received an Xbox One, so I asked him if he had one.  He said yes.  I was hooked on playing Smite, and he said he played it too.  We began playing together every night.  This strengthened our relationship a tremendous amount.  We began to go out and get shakes almost every night after playing Xbox.
	
We decided to go see Batman v. Superman.  It was a pretty good movie.  I didn’t talk much, because I still wasn’t sure whether or not he like me.  We went to get food after the movie and we talked a bit (yes, I paid), laughed a lot, and had fun.  It was time to take him home, so I did.  Things happened and we ended up hooking up.  At least I think we did…never acknowledges it, so I have no idea if it was just a really realistic dream and I have just been making an ass out of myself or not.  I don’t know.  Maybe he thinks it was a mistake (more than likely).  I wanted to do more and we probably never will.  We continued to hang out and we became closer and closer each time.  About four months later I made one of the biggest mistakes I have in a long time.  I told him how I actually feel about him.  I was so foolish to think that he would ever like me in that way.  But I guess I had to try.  Trust me when I say I am 1000% not his type, and even more so nowhere near good enough for him.  This doesn’t surprise me though.  I never have, nor will I ever be good enough for anyone.  
	
It is such a struggle being gay.  It seems like the standards are set so much higher for physical appearances.  People have said I am not ugly…I am.  People have said I am not fat…I am.  To be considered “attractive” in the gay community, it seems that you have to be a model.  I’m finally starting to come to terms with the fact that I will always be lonely.  I don’t know whether I have screwed up in a past life, or done something in this one to deserve this.  It doesn’t matter if you have the biggest heart in the world…because it seems that people only look at what is on the outside.  I feel like a failure…a waste of space.

4tare8,24,2016-07-17,Feeling very guilty about wanting to quit an early stage startup. Advice is extremely appreciated!,penguinmandude,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4tare8/feeling_very_guilty_about_wanting_to_quit_an/,"I'm currently in the summer between my freshman and sophomore years (I'm young I know, but I feel like I've learned a decent amount from various courses and stuff online throughout the last 4-5 years) and have been working for an early stage startup.  In May I didn't really have anything lined up job wise for the summer and when the founder came to me I joined, because, well, I didn't have anything to lose and I thought the idea was promising.  I was 'hired' (never officially, never signed any formal paperwork) and started developing the service with the only other dev.  

All is well for a while, the pay is low and well below minimum wage (I've received roughly $600 total from the time I started to now), but I was getting some experience I could put on a CV and had quite a bit of freedom on how it should work/look/etc.  We got a few thousand in grants from certain places and have received good feedback from our potential customers so I thought we were headed in a positive direction.  BUT, the more we get done, the more I realized why the idea hasn't been done before and why it's probably destined to fail.  It requires exceptional security (which 100% shouldn't be handled by a couple of college students) and we'd need probably a bunch of expensive lawyers to set up the legal framework for it, it requires a lot of reaching out to customers (essentially sales), there's many other competitors in the same general field (though we do give more than they do for less $), and it's simply too complicated and there are too many variables that users can provide for it to be streamlined in any way (which is essentially our selling point).  

Once I realized these things, I started getting bored of the work (mainly just web dev stuff with older kinda boring and not very 'cutting edge' frameworks) and I started dreading having to code this stuff up.  Anyways, I've started learning some stuff I'm actually interested in (angular 2, node.js, database stuff) and I've recently started a little personal project that I think is pretty cool, which is allowing me to use some of the stuff I'm learning, and would be something I could show off to future employees.  

At this point, I kind of want to be done with the whole thing and release all the time I'm spending on it for things that I can actually learn something from and have fun doing.  The founder has started talking about all the stuff needing to be done by November/December/etc. which I really don't want to do as I want to focus on my studies, have fun (I'm in college, I want to have time to party and hang out with friends without fear of missing non-school related deadlines), do some extra-curricular stuff, continue working on personal projects, and learning new/improving my various CS skills out of class.  

I just feel really guilty for wanting to quit.  I'm the only other dev and if I leave, the 'company' will basically be over unless they find someone else who will work for very little money doing the same stuff as me.  The founder is 100% in on this, has no other job, and a lot of expectations from his family/friends/etc. for it to succeed, so if I leave, I feel like I would destroy him and his dreams.  I also want him to be able to give me a good reference for any internships or whatever I might get into coming up, and I'm very afraid that if I leave, he won't write me one.

I would REALLY appreciate any advice you guys could provide me on what to do.  I should probably stay in for the others in the company, but I feel like it's not the best for me.  I just don't know what to do.  Thank you so so much!!!"
4tasoc,224,2016-07-17,"My [21 F] religious, deadbeat dad [46 M] is trying to convince me that my boyfriend [22 M] isn't a ""man.""",usathrowaway69,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4tasoc/my_21_f_religious_deadbeat_dad_46_m_is_trying_to/,"The title is a great summary but let me say a bit more for context.

I grew up in a fairly middle class house. My mom stayed at home and my dad started his own business, so he was never around. When I was a freshman in high school (also coinciding with that little economic downturn of 2008) my dad left our family - like, literally did not show up to my music recital, didn't answer phone calls, we legitimately thought he was dead. Not to worry though! He ran off with the Salvadorian secretary, that my mom had hired, who is only 8 years older than me. Did I mention she was supposed to become a nun?

Fast forward eight years later to present day. My dad is a horrible human being. I could fill an entire novel (and maybe I will one day) about the things he's done but here are the cliff notes: hid marriage to Salvadorian secretary for almost six months; emotionally manipulated my younger siblings and I to live with him, causing a shit show of court cases during the rest of my high school career; doesn't pay child support or talk to my younger siblings; hid my financial aid for college until it was too late to accept the offer; has told me numerous times I will never reach the level of financial success he has BUT refuses to pay the difference my school says he should be able to pay (my school uses the FAFSA, and CSS, which requires me to use both parents income), which was in the 20k range.

I know my dad is horrible, but I have to live with him this summer in order to save money for my study abroad trip. My mom hasn't done so well financially after the divorce (no degree, entered the workforce again after a 15 year interlude during the worst economic time) and my dad has an extra car that I use to get to my job as a bartender, as well as a new house with a private suite, so I basically never see him and it's not that bad.

When I do see him, though, it's rough. Everything always turns into a lecture about how I'm not doing X, Y or Z that always takes a religious angle. Since banging my new stepmother, they've become incredibly religious. They host couples groups, marriage counseling (neither one has a license or training), etc. I've gotten good at tuning out this conversations over the years, but the lectures have recently turned to attacking my boyfriend.

My boyfriend, let's call him ""Sam,"" is the sweetest, kindest person. We have been dating for a year and a half and it's been wonderful. He recently graduated this May from college and is coming with me abroad. This was a mutual decision we came to - I didn't force him and he isn't coming to keep tabs on me. I have a fellowship to do a comparative study of the U.S. and a European country; I don't know the language but Sam does! He will serve as my translator and is getting a freelance visa so he can work on a podcast/documentary idea he has had for a while.

My dad views this as a huge problem. He sees Sam taking time off right after graduating to pursue his degree (in film/production) not at a a desk job as being lazy. Sam has the financial means to come with me - his family views this trip as a graduation gift and is bankrolling this - and is using this time to further boost his resume through these creative projects. He's had numerous internships at some prestigious companies and is incredibly hardworking. Additionally, I know I want to attend graduate school but Sam doesn't know. We've already had conversations about our relationship/him moving if it's not in the area. My dad, however, sees this as Sam just ""aimlessly"" following me everywhere and I'm stopping him from ""being a man."" (???)

This all came to a head yesterday when he pulls me aside while I'm working on a deadline to talk about where my relationship with San is going. We've briefly talked about marriage but we are young, we haven't been dating that long and both of us come from divorced families so it's a decision we'd want to be sure of. By all accounts, our relationship is happy, healthy and both of us are equally fulfilled. My religious dad sees this as a red flag - especially since we're having sex and I'm ""devaluing myself by not keeping the sexual mystery alive.""

We leave for Europe in 20 days now, so I only have to deal with it for a few more weeks, but my dad is trying to schedule a meeting with Sam and I to ""discuss our relationship."" Obviously this isn't going to happen, but I'm not sure how to handle the situation. How do I nip this in the bud, Reddit?

tl;dr My religious dad has notions of what a man should be that my boyfriend doesn't meet and it's causing tension in our already strained relationship."

Here's the deal - I'm several years into a PhD program, but certain that academia is not the career for me. With an eye towards getting some industry experience, I took this summer off from research to do a data science internship at a small tech company. The experience has been great - the work has been challenging and engaging, I have a ton of respect for the company leadership, and the other people on my team are super smart and I fit in well with them. The company is also well funded and growing quickly.
Recently, the CEO approached me to let me know that they're planning on hiring a full-time employee to take over the work I've been doing over the summer, and oh by the way we really like you and would love to have you full time.

If I go back to research, it would probably take me about a year and a half to finish the degree. If I left now, I would leave with a MS. Basically, the PhD has been a personal goal for a long time, but this opportunity is pretty close to being a perfect first full-time job.

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? If so - do you think you made the right choice? Also happy to hear other perspectives.

ETA a few other potentially important pieces of information:

* The grant that supports me will run out before I can defend. It is likely that I'll be able to find another source of funding, but it's never a sure thing.

* My PhD advisor recently moved from the university where I'm a student to a different university out of state. I'm lucky enough to have work that relatively easy to do remotely, so he didn't force me to move with him. But there is some concern about his level of engagement with my project now that he's in a different place.

* There are personal reasons that make me lean toward leaving. I've been in school a long time, and I'm starting to get tired of having both no money and no free time. Also, I've definitely reached the point where I feel like I need a new challenge.

Edit 2: To everyone who took the time to comment - thank you so much for your thoughtful responses. I got way more of them than I expected, and I've read them all carefully. Ultimately it's still a really tough decision."

What I find most frustrating is the media silence from Niantic, do they really not have someone, even an intern, who could the get the legal guys at Nintendo HQ to proof read maybe a 4 hourly statement from them that they could then tweet ?

I have no doubt that measures are being taken by Niantic and Nintendo to remedy this, however in the mean time they are making money hand over fist whilst we use Lure's etc. that we can only use for a short while as the app locks when we try and catch a Pokemon !

So, is anyone else so fed up that they'll stop playing it and just monitor Reddit and Twitter until it gets better ?"

4tbmoa,15,2016-07-17,Where to find bullfights in NYC?,heebiejeebies_ferret,writingcirclejerk,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcirclejerk/comments/4tbmoa/where_to_find_bullfights_in_nyc/,"Dear fellow brothers and sisters in the great struggle of writing,

Long ago I decided to become a writer, to let the spirit of Ernest Hemingway be my muse and guide through the perils of writerdom.

I have moved to New York City upon the advice of my associates; they said this is the hub of the artistic community and no decent artist would live elsewhere.

However, I now find myself living in a rat-infested hovel with no money to speak of, and to my astonishment I have been unable to find even a single bullfight thus far in the city. Some fellows laughed in my face when I asked, which I thought exceedingly rude, since I had asked quite politely.

I really do need to find a bullfight, as I believe it will lead me closer to the spirit of Hemingway.

So I conclude my humble request: **Do any of you know of bullfights in walking distance of lower Manhattan, preferably ones with a paid writer's internship?** 

Also, it should have free admission, as I don't even have any money left for the subway.

Thanks!"
4tbmyr,1,2016-07-17,Support our boys in Blue (This is a satirical essay/article I wrote about police brutality for an english project a few months back. Just a friendly warning that there is some colorful and questionable word choice in this),Mark_line,satire,https://www.reddit.com/r/satire/comments/4tbmyr/support_our_boys_in_blue_this_is_a_satirical/,"July 13th 2015 was a normal day in the United States. I went to my internship at the local public access TV station. The mailman delivered letters and packages. 
Mr. Anderson kissed his wife goodbye before going to work. Little Jacob went to play flag football in the park with his buddies. Sandra Bland was found lynched… sorry-- I meant “hung” in a police holding cell after she had been arrested for a traffic violation.  Ahhh, yep. It was just another day in the good ole USA. 

Last October, the director of “Pulp Fiction”, “Kill Bill”,”Django Unchained”, and his then to-be released film “The H8ful Eight” stirred up quite a controversy among our good boys in blue. Award-winning director Quentin Tarantino, aka the man who taught us that in France, a Quarter Pounder with Cheese is called “a Royale with Cheese”, spoke nonsense at an anti police brutality rally in New York, basically referring to cops as murderers. 

""I'm a human being with a conscience,"" he said  ""And if you believe there's murder going on then you need to rise up and stand up against it. I'm here to say I'm on the side of the murdered.""  These comments were said just days after a NYPD officer was killed, and possibly two minutes after a black man was killed by an officer while reaching for his wallet.  Undoubtedly, officers were not thrilled about his comment, so un-thrilled that the NYPD police union decided to publicize his new movie “The H8ful Eight” by announcing a full-on boycott of the film, in retaliation to his “H8ful” comments. The boycott was highly effective, the film only totaled $144 million at the box office worldwide. Patrick Lynch (no pun intended), the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association of the City of New York, issued a statement: ""The police officers that Quentin Tarantino calls 'murderers' aren't living in one of his depraved big screen fantasies — they're risking and sometimes sacrificing their lives to protect communities from real crime and mayhem."" A fine example of the real crime NYPD officers handled beautifully, happened last summer outside of a convenience store in Brooklyn, where a black man named Eric Garner was illegally selling cigarettes. Officers jumped into action and choked him to death on the scene. Big round of applause to the NYPD, protecting people from lung cancer, one unarmed minority at a time. 

A short while after, Quentin’s loving father, Tony Tarantino, famously slammed Tarantino Jr. for his utterly disgraceful comments. “I love my son and have great respect for him as an artist but he is dead wrong in calling police officers, particularly in New York City where I grew up, murderers. He is a passionate man and that comes out in his art but sometimes he lets his passion blind him to the facts and to reality. I believe that is what happened when he joined in those anti-cop protests."" Tony is a filmmaker whom I am sure everyone has heard of, especially because of his son’s fame and fortune. The best father of the century left Quentin before he was born, only to come back into Quentin’s life after he became famous. Come on guys, how about we give this guy an Oscar for father of the year? 

Perhaps Quentin was partially referring to the suicide of Sandra Bland, a Black Lives Matter activist who somehow managed to commit suicide in a Waller County, Texas jail cell after she was arrested for a traffic violation. This is completely an accident and in no way did the Waller County Police play in any part of her death. Let me explain my reasoning here. In “Pulp Fiction,” after Vincent Vega accidentally shot Ronnie in the face, he and Jules take the car and body to the home of a friend and associate, Jimmie. Now Jimmie asks the pair “ Is there a sign on the front of my house that says ‘dead nigger storage’?” Spoiler alert: there isn’t. That is because storing dead niggers ain’t his fucking business. There is not a single sign outside the Waller County jail that says “dead nigger storage”, so we can only assume that storing dead niggers ain’t their fucking business. Therefore they are not responsible for her death, despite the sketchy details of the entire incident, but let’s just assume that there was a noose just lying on the floor of her cell and out of the blue (again, no pun intended) she decides that she hates her life and hangs herself. 

Lets face it, if they had killed her, they would have done it out in public where everyone is filming it on their iPhones and uploading it to world star, Instagram and Facebook, then the police department would just pay off an all white jury and judge to drop the charges.

4tc2f0,43,2016-07-17,Working at Northwestern Mutual (wall of text),nugrape,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/4tc2f0/working_at_northwestern_mutual_wall_of_text/,"I've seen a few posts asking about working as a financial rep at Northwestern Mutual, so I thought I'd write about my experience there. Since they recruit new reps on college campuses, maybe this will be useful to one or two people. Technically it's not a finance job, but my guess is that people will search for it (as I did).

Of all the wirehouse firms, two have more kool-aid than any others: Edward Jones and Northwestern Mutual. I've heard stories about Edward Jones, but I can only speak to NWM.

The recruiters are incentivized to bring you on board, of course, so they'll tell you about all the money you can make (which is true, in theory), and since they've already drank the kool-aid or they wouldn't be there, they will be very excited about NWM. If you're a prospective intern, they'll show you literature about how it's one of the best internships in the nation. If you're thinking about going to law school, they'll tell you how law school is saturated whereas the financial services industry has a lot of people on the verge of retirement (this is true). You might be skeptical, but you also might be able to make a lot of money helping people which is a win-win, so you might check it out further. It's at least worth googling, and it actually doesn't look too bad when you search online! Now you're actually kind of excited.

The management team or ""coaches"" and all are very likeable people. The first person you'll interview with will most likely be very attractive, and she'll ask some very light questions about yourself. She'll tell you about how NWM is one of the top-rated companies out there with the highest financial strength ratings available (also true), and you'll think it's a pretty good company! Eventually she'll ask about who you know, but let's not get into that too much. She's trained to gauge your personality, and as long as you aren't a completely wet blanket, you'll be qualified to move on to the next round of the interview process. (If you're really special, they'll give you a gift card to a mediocre restaurant once you start.)

Soon enough, you'll meet with one of the most affable people you've ever met. He will meet all the expectations that first interviewer set up. He's also incentivized to hire you, but he'll make it seem like they don't just hire anybody - and they don't...technically - and even though he'll tell you this business isn't for everybody, you'll realize that this business is for you. This is the guy that will train you, and he said that as long as you do what he says, you'll have a great life. People just make this business too hard. Once you pass the extensive background check (and believe me it's thorough), study for and pass your Life &amp; Health exam, you're good to go!

You've already put a lot of work into this thing by the time ""basics day"" rolls around. This is when you actually begin to learn how to sell. They'll have scripts - language that you'll have to memorize, and a time-tested strategy based on a scientific method. All you have to do is do it. More importantly, they'll show you that in just your first three months working there, you can make up to $64,000 just for helping people! Not bad!!

During the training period, which lasts about a week, you'll learn more about this great company, directly from the people who have succeeded there in your area. They'll all seem very happy. They'll tell you all their secrets. Eventually, you'll build a list of at least 100 people that you know in the area - friends, family, and other people with money. You'll learn how to talk on the phone and convince people to meet with you - even if they object (up to three times). You'll use these new tactics to convince people you know who are ""centers of influence"" to meet with you and let you pick through their network so you can help all of their friends with this great new career you've started. At the end of the meeting, you'll even be able to help the ""center of influence""!!

Once you start working, you'll be persuaded but not forced to take a ""joint-work partner"" with you. Joint-work partners are the people who showed you their secrets during training, plus others in the office who have years of experience and are really, really good at what they do. You'll have to split commissions with them, but ""it's better to get 50% of something than 100% of nothing."" There will even be one or two in your office who are Gods to everyone that trained you (except for some of the people who have been there for a while and who will tell you all sorts of bad things about these legends...after all, you should be doing joint work with this guy, not that guy, if you want to close business, and anyway this guy is nice...you'll thank him for helping you).

You'll spend the next three months doing lots of joint work, calling everyone you know trying to get meetings with all the people you love and care about. Some of them won't meet with you, even though you're just trying to help them. You'll get pissed at them, and you won't talk to them (and they won't talk to you). But you'll meet with a lot of your friends and family, and you'll sit there with a shit-eating grin, agreeing with everything your joint-work partner says (and he'll do ALL of the talking), because you're creating a financial plan for them! You're HELPING them! And not only that, but you're making money by giving them access to the single most important, wonderful product of the modern world: Northwestern Mutual's Permanent Life Insurance.

Now, you may have intelligent friends and family who have done some research, or read some Dave Ramsey, and they know that whole life insurance/permanent life insurance is a bad idea. Stay calm. Agree with them. Most permanent life insurance really is dogshit. But NWM whole life is fucking beautiful. You've been trained to know this. You've even checked it out, and it's really, really good. They have graphs and shit. They all own it. You might even buy some, too! The world is an uncertain, uncertain void, and no one knows where the market goes, right? And you'll know all about how the dividend of NWM whole life fucks the ass out of any other investment product...tax-free!!

Fast-forward another six months...

You've blown through most of your friends, family, old high school buddies, and all the people whose numbers they gave to you. The ones you haven't met with yet won't return your calls. You haven't spoken to them in a long time, and maybe your career is slowing down a bit. Maybe one person who is still relatively new to the firm (like you) is doing a great job, but you're in a rut right now. You've noticed that the really likeable coaches and managers aren't giving you as much attention anymore, but hey - if you fail it's your own fault. Didn't you read the handbook? You haven't had 150 new meetings in the last six months, and in order to stay (statistically speaking) you have to have 300 new meetings by the time your first year is up. They'll let you stay even if you get 250, but, man that's a lot of work. Plus, you've had a few really big cases, and even with some of the people getting rated on their medical exam who were interested at first, but found the premiums to be just too expensive, you know you have to keep seeing people, seeing people, seeing people...

Nine months in now, and you've slowed way down. No one said this job was easy. You know that. You're also kind of frustrated, because you still don't really understand the nuances of the products that well. Most of the ongoing training sessions are still just about how to sell, not about what it actually is you're selling. You don't want to give 50% of your money to the joint-work partners, so you've been doing more cases on your own, and you just can't close as much business. Some of the reps you came up with are already gone, and maybe you miss them. They were good dudes. The ones that are still there, struggling just like you, have the same concerns you have. Why don't they teach us more technical knowledge about these policies? They said I'd learn through joint work, but I still haven't learned enough. And some of the joint work partners make mistakes! It's a whole company based on the game of telephone, and by the time the information gets filtered down to you, it's not really true. And the dividend on that whole life isn't actually a rate of return like you thought...it's largely just a return of premiums with 2% growth instead of 6% growth like you assumed based on how they explained it.

You've been there a year now. It's time for your quarterly reviews with the Managing Partner who is never around. He calls you on the phone to go over your numbers (you were supposed to meet in person, but he left the office for the day). He tells you it's time to move on. You started strong, but now you haven't closed much business. This just isn't the right career for you. He wants you to be successful, but it just isn't going to be here. You had to borrow money from your parents to pay your rent and all the premiums on your expensive life insurance policies - they told you that there's statistics that prove NWM reps who have big policies themselves sell big policies. You're angry, but it's okay - Mass Mutual contacted you through LinkedIn, and they want you to join their firm. You've been told by your coach that Mass Mutual sucks, and your non-compete clause won't let you take your clients with you, but at least they don't have a non-compete and they even give you leads and people to call. That's good, right?

Note: this career path isn't all bad. If you play your cards right, you can end up at a good, fee-only firm that doesn't rip off their clients. If you're at NWM, or if you really want to do this, focus on getting your Series 7 &amp; 66 instead of your Series 6 &amp; 63 like they recommend, and then leave. It's a lot more work, but you'll be more marketable. And even though it may be hard to resist, and everyone else is doing it, don't sell people things they don't need. Term insurance is just fine. Have them open a Roth IRA instead of selling them permanent insurance that is difficult to get out of. Or maybe you'll be one of the few people who actually makes it work at NWM. I don't know how you'll sleep at night knowing that you're giving the people you know and love (and the people they know and love) an overpriced product with high commissions. But then again, if you make it that far you're probably either a sociopath, willfully ignorant, or you just don't care. When I quit after getting a job at a good independent firm, the joint-work partners I worked with (who got to keep all the clients) were concerned about one thing and one thing only: ""can I still call that [insert high net worth position here] we tried to make a client together?""

My internship is due to start in September. 

My future manager was the one who interviewed and hired me. We have been emailing occasionally since then - he sends me resources to prepare for my internship, answers questions, etc. He seems very easy-going. 

What concerns me is something he said in his last email after I mentioned that I was tired: ""you should rest, but it's not like you need beauty sleep."" He knows what I look like from the interview, and linkedIn/email pictures. I did not address that comment, and left my response brief.

He is much older than me, and has a wife and kids, so I'm not worried about anything funny happening. I'm worried about hearing similar comments in the future, and of course the creeping feeling that I was only hired because I am a girl, not because I deserve the job.

If this ever happens in the future, how should I address it without leading to an uncomfortable confrontation? Should I do anything to address the last comment? Am I overreacting? Was he just being nice? 

TLDR: What to say when much older manager calls you pretty? Being a girl in tech sometimes sucks."
4tc8xt,6,2016-07-17,[Ohio] Did some work for lady in university and now she is trying to sue me. HELP PLS!,awaisted,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4tc8xt/ohio_did_some_work_for_lady_in_university_and_now/,"I recently graduated with with a bachelors in mechanical engineering. 

During my final few years I worked with a lady to help her get some ""drawings"" of her idea for a patent. She said that she could pay me under the table since I was an **international student**. I was VERY poor and just wanted some money to pay rent bills etc. She paid me very little but I did quite a lot of changes to the model so it added up. I used a student version of a CAD software through school, made the 3D model and drawings and gave her the PDFs.

A couple months later she told me that her provisional patent got approved and she worked with me again to get a physical 3D printed model.I helped her with everything and even put engineering detail into the design (standard threads ect.) which I had learned through my internships. 

This model got her consideration with a couple of companies to buy her provisional patent but she waited for a better offer. She eventually tried to start her own company to start manufacturing this product. By this time she had gotten her product moved to a ""full patent"" (I wasn't involved in legal stuff I only got involved when she contacted me). Apparently she got picked by a university program which offers to do pro bono patent filing.

So she got in touch with me after another couple of months (few weeks ago) and wanted me to help her convert the 3D files into a different format so a ""manufacturing company"" could quote the product. I said that I would do that for her if she could get my name as the engineer on the patent since I had put in the hours to figure out the tolerances, standards, and clearances. She said she would talk to her lawyer but needed the files. So I converted the files and sent them to her via email and said that she didn't have to pay me. I just wanted to be associated as the engineer behind the patent and I had no financial investment or interest.

The day after she received the files she texted me saying that she paid me for those files and they are her property. And I need to turn them over or she will sue me. She was paranoid that I would try steal her company. I tried to make it clear I wanted to financial role in her ""company"" but she wasn't understanding. Then I decided I will just turn the files over (she was clearly dicking me over but whatever I want nothing to do with this) and we planned that I would e-mail it to her and organize them in folders of three file types. 

The next day she messaged me again saying the latest files I sent her (the ones I did for free) didn't work and the manufacturer couldn't open it. I told her I'm sorry they didn't work I don't know whats wrong but I just want to send you the files and get out of this mess. She kept threatening to sue me and now she claims I am stealing her ""intellectual property"" even though I did all the work for it. So I sent her the three formats we agreed on and she just got them today. 

She just messaged me again saying that the USB was bent and it wouldn't work. She wanted me to mail her the USB so its not my fault how it arrived. I had put the files in the USB and now she is threatening me for destruction of her intellectual property. She keeps threatening to sue me and I don't really know what to do anymore. I don't want to waste money on a lawyer but she wants to get them involved. I don't know if she has the money finance that but she keeps threatening me. I dont know if she is serious but she has completely gone off the rails. 

I said I am not dealing with her anymore. The lawyer can call me because she is being very difficult. She claims I signed a contract which I don't remember and she said she is not going to share it with me. 

As far as I am concerned it happened in three steps:

1. She paid me for PDFs of the drawings (to get a provisional patent)
2. She paid me for the actual 3D model (to get a patent)
3. She got a different format to get a quote which I was never paid for.

I don't see where I would have to hand over the full engineering data of the model (which include the dimensions and the editing capabilities). Only thing to keep in mind I am an international student who got paid under the table to do this.

**TLDR** Helped a lady get a design patented and now she is trying to sue me to get all my CAD files. Am I legally obligated to return those files?"
4tc9rl,1,2016-07-17,Dirty old man,AnthoZero,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4tc9rl/dirty_old_man/,"Ok, 

My Grandfather is a poltician and he worked for my city, he got me a job in one of the city departments after he retired as an intern. 

I've been working there for a couple weeks, and I've been having a good time, I don't really do anything (city jobs). 

I don't have my own computer, so I have to share a computer with a guy, let's call him Joe. Joe is usually on the road doing work, so I used his computer a lot. 

The past couple days I've been in his car with him helping him write some things down that we find that need to be fixed, but most of the time we're driving around doing nothing, he'll buy me a coffee and he'll tell me stories about his sons and stuff. 

It slowly got awkward when he started telling me really personal stories, and it went overboard when we drove passed this young girl, maybe 12 or 13, and he said ""Wow, some of these girls are so hot, I'd love to tap that. I'm such a dirty old man"". 

I sat there and said nothing for the rest of the ride, and I felt so uncomfortable. Later, he asked where I was going to lunch and I told him, I had plans to meet with my friend but he invited himself and drove me. I had to text my friend to not show because it wouldn't have been good because he's racist and islamaphobic, and she is Muslim. 

The day ended and I was so happy. 

The next day I tried to avoid him at all costs, seriously all costs. I heard him coming into my office (my boss is on vacation for a week so I get it) and I hid under the desk. The rest of the day I hid in my friends office. 

Later that day, Joes partner came in and handed me his cellphone. It was Joe. He asked me if he wanted to pick me up, so I lied about having a lot of work and I had no time. He said then we can do it on Monday. 

He makes me so uncomfortable and I honestly don't think I can't be near him again. How can I avoid him without hurting any feelings or ruining my reputation?"

I'm going to be a senior in college next year with a major in math and minors in stats and cs. I have a 3.9 gpa at a large state school and I've done 2 internships including my current one. I've used java and c in classes and VBA at work.

Both of my internships have been actuarial (insurance pricing) and I've slowly realized that this isn't what I want to do when I graduate. I've tried two different industries which were health and life but my favorite parts of the internships have been when I'm coding in VBA (ugh...) to automate projects or performing analysis on large data sets with sql/R. I really would like to do that sort of work with like minded people since most actuaries seem to hate coding but I know almost nothing about the jobs that are out there since I had this epiphany so late in my college career. Due to this late change I have also never interviewed for any sort of programming role so I'm not certain how qualified or unqualified I actually am. I've done very well in all of my cs and math classes but I can't be sure how well success in the classroom transfers to the job market.

Does anyone know which sort of jobs would be a good fit for someone like me? I've been looking into data science but most of those positions are seeking phd graduates and most programming roles seem to want a lot more coding experience than I have."

They both want me to work with them part time while I finish school, but I can only choose one. I'm not sure which is the better opportunity in the long run. The agency seems to be more fun and relaxed, but the corporation feels more secure and prestigious and has more post-graduation employment options.

Do any of you have experience you'd like to share?


Random info:

- They both offer comparable pay

- I've been in web development for 3 years

- I strongly prefer front-end development

- Most of my work experience is working in marketing/advertising teams as a web developer—I really enjoy that

- I hope to eventually work in UI/UX"

So far, I've only come up with two arguments for why I'd attend an on-campus program:  
  
I miss academia. I'm a year out of undergrad and would kill to be able to relive and create new on-campus memories. I loved being in a classroom with people who had similar passions and ambitions and were excited to learn the material. Frankly, I miss the college lifestyle.  
  
The second reason is that I absolutely do NOT want to stay in rural Massachusetts. It's beautiful in many ways, but I NEED to live in a city again. If I do an online program, I feel like I'll get a job here in this area afterwards and just stay here forever. Leaving my parents' would be a swift kick in the ass as well. I think it would also be beneficial to live in a city I'd want to work in (such as Washington DC). I could establish connections more easily if I were actually doing internships in the area I want to live in.  
  
But are these arguments good enough to warrant leaving my current library position with a steady income and the free rent provided by my parents?  
  
What's your advice to consider when deciding between the two types of programs? "

After being patted down no less than three times, being sniffed by two very angry dogs, and having a staring contest with an FR combat suit (which has no obvious eyes), Davey was finally ushered into a boardroom with a long table. On one end sat Pearl-kun. Across from her was the hero Bill Jameson. And at the head was a thin man with black hair and round glasses. President Trockle.

Trockle: ""Hello Mr....Davey, was it? Please, have a seat."" Trickle gestured to an empty chair. ""We have two more guests on the way, then we can begin.""

The man before me was young, perhaps in his mid-twenties. Both his facial and head hair weren't particularly well kept, but there was a certain quickness in his eyes that contrasts with his disheveled appearance. His body was largely hidden by a red robe, so it was hard to tell what his build was. His only other defining feature was a black skull pattern that covered half of his face. I was unsure of whether it was a tattoo or just face paint of some kind. He sat down and leaned over the table, forming a finger pyramid. “So ladies and gentlemen, let’s just get down to the question everyone’s thinking about: How… do we kill… the batman?” The beautiful, petite young woman seated at the table stared at him- then realizing he wasn't taking things seriously she seemed to frost over. If the notorious Psycho promised flames, death, chaos and war, the young woman across from Davey promised a cold kind of ruthlessness despite her diminutive nature. She seemed the kind to wait until your guard was down to step out of the shadows and then slip a concealed knife between the ribs. And in that moment, it looked like she was contemplating doing precisely that. It was all behind that cold fury she radiated towards him. Davey clearly was not used to the famous 'Snow White' aura and quickly folded his hands back down. Trockle simply stared. 

Trockle: ""I appreciate the effort to lighten the mood Mr. Davey, but you have to know your audience. That reference is almost certainly before Pearl's time, I'm known for having almost no sense of humor, and Jameson prefers dick jokes. Anyway, we are expecting at least one more person, then we can start.""

Davey: “These are dark times indeed. Will he be here soon? I haven’t seen him either."" There was a commotion at the door, with some people yelling.

Trockle: ""That's probably him. One moment please.""

Davey: “They didn’t do that when I came through and I brought a walking tank! What did he-? Oh if he’s doing this to deliberately one-up me I am going to personally-“ Davey trails off into mumbling.

Trockle stood up and went to the door. Outside of the door stood a man easily six feet and three inches. He had a strong jaw line and deep set eyes. His hair was jet black, and pulled back into a short braided ponytail. His eyes were a dark green and looking right into the eyes of a guard. He was wearing a black cloak, but it was open, showing black and grey body armor, covering large muscles. He was holding a tick cane with a heavy metal head. He looked to be in his mid twenties. I was geeking out. It was Warnik Odinson.

Warnik: ""They seem to take issue with me bringing my walking stick with me.""

Trockle: ""Is there something unusual about it? A weapon, or bomb built into it? Or a radio?"" Trockle looked at him. ""If it's any of those, they won't let you in, and I'll have to agree with them. We can provide you a replacement in the interim."" Warnik tossed the cane to one of his people in the back. He started walking into the room.

Warnik: ""I don't need one.""

Davey looked surprised. ""Warnik?"" This clearly didn't match the mental image he had of him.

Trockle walked in with him. ""Then why did you bring it?""

Warnik: ""That's the sword I used to kill over a hundred infected, and it was by my side when I died. I'm a little attached."" He turned to Davey. ""Warnik Odinson, yes.""

Trockle resumed his seat. ""Well, we are all here now."" He gestured to a bar with a variety of drinks. ""Please, feel free to take any refreshment you would like. Otherwise, if there are no objections...let us begin."" He panned around the room.

Warnik took a seat and looked at everyone, staring at them if they stare at him.

Warnik: ""I'm ready.""

Seeing no objection, Trockle nodded. ""Alright, let's start with the elephant in the room. Warnik, you requested to be a part of these talks at the last minute. Why?""

Warnik: ""Who is most qualified to tell you if a plan is going to get you killed when implemented against the Borsons then the person that made them?""

Trockle: ""Understood. But why are you willing to assist us? You created them, why would you now help us destroy them?""

Warnick: ""They where unfinished, they aren't what I had planned for them. This shouldn't be happening, and I am responsible. I will help and fix my mistakes.""

Trockle nodded again. ""Very well. I can accept that."" He turned to the rest of the room. ""Any objections to Warnik being present for the rest of this discussion?""

Davey looked somewhat longingly at the bar before snapping back to reality. “Wha-? Oh, yeah. No. But didn’t you already say that you don’t consider yourself as their father? Why pick and choose which sins to inherit?” He turned to Warnik, seeming somewhat disturbed that he actually had to look up at him.

W: ""That was the slave self, I am free, a true continuation of my soul."" 

He got up and went to the bar still talking. ""I am now able to accept this as me, alive once again. Not the disgraced things Anabel forced into existence."" He pulled out two glasses, pouring whiskey into both of them. He started walking back to the table, ""I am the man who killed a nation, who poisoned the world with radiation, who mutated the infected and released them onto anyone I wanted to. I captured and forced Cats to carry a baby, I went to war with a nation and used the infection as a weapon in that war, I took over part of that nation and set up a puppet government. I have killed with my bare hands and with a push of a button."" He set one of the glasses in front of Davey, then sat in his own seat again. ""And I have beaten death to be born again. I accept all of my sins."" I almost wet my pants. Davey stared at the man in front of him, then stared transfixed at the glass. 

D: “Hey, I appreciate it and all. But I can’t. Kane’s orders.” He grins.

Warnik downed his drink and pushed the other one in front of Jameson.

D: “Well, down to business. Let’s see, we’ve got… Two mad AI’s hanging out in Duluth, A potentially mad woman who’s probably fairly steamed at loosing her new sea city, an aggressive nation in the west that’ll probably take full advantage of this situation the moment any of us blink, and a doubly mad half-infected woman heading through Canada. Most everyone’s mad here, it seems.”

Warnik glanced at Davey. ""All of the best people are mad.""

Pearl looked up from her glass of wine.

D: “I was of course excluding present company.""

Jameson waved the drink off. ""Can't. I'm a man of my word and I promised not to until the war's end."" Sensing some confusion from Davey, he added: ""Oh, and cats was a person. An adopted moniker or a particularly strange parent. Perhaps Neko was her long lost brother.""

Trockle nodded. ""Well, that was quite poetic, Warnik. And a concise, if somewhat tongue-in-cheek summary of the situation, Davey. It's certainly a difficult situation. But we will win. There's no real other option anyway. It's win or die."" He stood up. ""We have our problem, we know what it is. Let's talk resources. As we are hosting this, I'll tell you what the Free Republic has available first."" An aide came up to the table and distributed a packet to each leader. [""We are currently 80% of the way through mobilizing first through sixth brigades. In addition, we will have all three mobile artillery battalions ready, and every single available Erinyes, 800 in total. Finally, we will have three airship battlegroups - each consists of one Syracuse class heavy fire support airship with paratrooper complement, and two Poughkeepsie class escorts. All told, we are bringing approximately 35,000 soldiers to this fight for now.](/s) If the war drags on, we will have more resources available later.""

Warnik looked through the pamphlet.

D: “If this is going to work we need to divide all of our forces up and rejoin them into complementary combined arms groups. An all-kanite battlegroup will get steamrolled by heavy armor and an all FR battlegroup will get harassed by gorilla forces.”

Trockle nodded. ""That's part of the purpose of this meeting. How to best coordinate our forces. But we need to know what everyone has available before we can really determine that. The packets I gave you give an overview of how our soldiers are equipped and what vehicles are available. We need to know what everyone else can bring, then we can discuss how to coordinate or integrate our forces.""

[""We're not much good against guerilla forces either,""](/s) Jameson pointed out. ""Our war with church of the damned made that painfully apparent.""

""We, however, excel at facing guerillas,"" Pearl smirked.

W: ""With Ve dead the Borsons would be mostly regulated to hit and run, and guerrilla tactics. Davey, you said you know where they are? Duluth?""

D: “That’s what I’m getting at. We are by and large individual specialists that wouldn’t last long individually against the Borsons. We need to make our alliance more than just a signature on some documents if we want to be versatile.” He paused for a moment. “I did. And I do. In the past few weeks Duluth Minnesota has been stripped of every possible resource. All the towers and skyscrapers have been torn down for scrap. I believe the Borsons are using that scrap to assemble weapons and perhaps soldiers.”

W: ""Robot Warriors, most likely AI control. Their ability to make more AI was something I worked very hard on. I never got around to having them build AI better than themselves.""

Davey under his breath: “thank Kane”

T: ""Davey, just to backtrack a little. What exactly did you mean by having our alliance be 'more than just a signature on some documents'? It sounds like you want what, complete integration of our forces? That's a dangerous thing to ask for - it's a very, very large step to turning this from an alliance into full integration of our nations.""

D: “It’s also the only way we can beat them. I- You’ve seen what they’re capable of. Every moment we wait they’re going to get exponentially stronger and faster. And what I’m proposing isn’t a complete integration. The time for something on that scale is way way far from now. I’m only talking about close coordination. You’re already doing it to some extent, AMR artillery covering Smith scouts with the microwave moon raker in FR territory. It just needs to be closer or we’ll wind up bumping into each other as everyone tries to fulfill their own separate objectives.""

W: [""I can make some clones to give as soldiers. About 500 is what I can promise. They won't be amazing, but that can help turn the tide.""](/s)

D: “Can you at least keep their origins under raps? The Sentinels aren’t going to want to [fight beside clones.](/s)”

W: ""Of course, they can even be randomized so they look different.""

Davey sat back looking relieved. He apparently expected more opposition.

Trockle sat down, thinking. ""That is...a good point. We will need very close cooperation to pull this off. Well then...if everyone agrees, I don't oppose close integration of our individual forces. But we should specify that this degree of integration is only for the war effort. If we leave it after the war...in five years we may find ourselves as one nation. And unless things change between now and then, it will likely be the Free Republic taking the lead. That could cause...problems.""

D: “Ohh yeah.”

W: ""You wouldn't want such power?""

D: “My people wouldn’t want such company. Nothing personal of course. But the average Kanite is not as… tolerant as yours truly.”

T: ""I wouldn't have it even if I did. I'm an elected president, not a king. My first term is up in a year and a half. And I plan to retire at the end of it."" I did a double take. President Trockle retiring? ""We aren't particularly tolerant of Kanite practices either. Many of your most sacred rituals are illegal under Free Republic law.""

""Yeah. You guys seem to already take issue with psycho,"" Jameson said irritably.

D: “If we took issue with her she would be dead and not being looked after by our healers. We also wouldn’t be willing to train her, which we still are, providing we’re around by the time the war’s over. And I’m curious about how you know of our rituals. I also remember FR supporting freedom of religion… At least south of New Rochester.""

J: ""Not you, I'm talking about FR. As far as I'm concerned? You're fine.""

T: ""We support freedom of religion, within limits. The blood tithe, initiation rituals, and method of ambrosia production all break multiple Free Republic laws. Kanites would be free to worship Kane here. They wouldn't be free to take blood from people and run it through a half-infected to make ambrosia. And don't act like you don't know how I know. Your intelligence service may have certain issues with...effectiveness. Ours doesn't.""

D: “When I first appointed NGI’s head back in the day he said he had experience working in the CIA. It was only afterwards that I learned he had been an intern there once and was never asked back again.” He chuckled. “And we don’t usually take people’s blood. The vast majority of it is given willingly.”

Pearl looked on dispassionately at all this until Trockle spoke of retiring

W: ""Retiring? Really, and what would you do?""

T: ""Move to the FCC. Maybe teach a class at Hampshire. Or just live off my savings."" He leaned back. ""More than anything else, I want to live with Mercy. She's accepted the directorship of UMASS. If she can't come to me, I'll go to her."" A rare smile flitted across his face at the thought. Warnik stroked his chin at this.

P: ""I could ask her to relieve herself of all duties to come to you,"" Pearl offered. ""We'd miss her.""

Trockle shook his head. ""She could have refused the position, Pearl. She didn't, because she didn't want to let down the people who depended on her. It's a large part of why I love her. I don't want to ever force her to go against it, or change for my sake... But thank you for the offer."" He sat up straight, a stern expression resuming its place on his face. ""Enough about that, for now. Let's get back on topic. Where were we?""

W: ""Merging armies for the war. About that, how many of you are sure the Borsons haven't infiltrated the top ranks of your militaries?""

T: ""Reasonably certain. Our upper ranks are required to [provide top secret authentication codes on a daily basis, and we haven't had any reports of any officers going missing.](/s) However, if you have a reliable way to detect if we have, I'm all ears.""

""Pretty sure."" Pearl said. ""They wouldn't tolerate the [Warnik clones we have](/s). Plus our upper ranks are fairly plain and require deeds they'll likely find... distasteful.""

“We’ve had very few such incidences so far. As some of you may know” he looks directly at Trockle “our initiation rituals can be somewhat… rigorous. Especially for the sentinels. Besides it’s unlikely that any Borson implants could survive the near constant presence of the channelers without being specifically designed to do so. And to my thinking they lost the resources to do something like that when they lost the lunar colony.""

W: ""Okay so as long as all of you are sure. Now what about weaponry?""

Davey whistled “I’ve actually gotten a jump on that. I take it you’ve all already seen our adds? [And that’s just the one gun we were ready to sell to the public. There’s also the Nicola Project, the end result of which is currently outside this building. Oh yeah, and the drones.](/s) Everything else is pretty much what you’ve seen before.""

T: ""Weapons...our full listing of weapons is in the packets I gave you. I'll just go over some of the highlights.

[Each soldier is at the very least equipped with a Mark I modular multi-purpose rifle that fires caseless ammunition. They can be switched to assault, sharpshooter, and carbine mode in 10 minutes, with some training. They also have a secondary Airbursting projectile launcher. There's also a Mark II - a sniper variant. It can change chambrings, although that takes closer to an hour than 10 minutes. After that, each squad is equipped with either 2 AT-4s or 1 SMAW II Serpent. 1 in 5 squads is equipped with an FGM-118 equivalent. Another 1 in 5 squads is equipped with a 10mm HV Penetrator - it's a weapon that basically fires 10mm railroad spikes at high speed.""](/s) My mouth started watering. [""Continuing down the list, we reach vehicle mounted weapons. They range from automatic grenade launchers to high caliber machine guns, occasional miniguns, all the way to 120 mm cannons on a stabilized light vehicle. As for artillery, we mostly use M777s. Our Syracuse class airships are equipped with twin GAU-8 Avengers housed in individual turrets, and quad M105s. The Poughkeepsie class escorts are equipped with rapid-fire 88mm cannons housed in individual turrets - each cannon is capable of continuous](/s) fire at 1 round every 3 seconds, or burst fire for up to 30 seconds at 1 round every second. Also, and this is classified...each airship [carries an AMRAAM battery. Syracuse class have 8. Poughkeepsie class have 4 AMRAAMS.](/s) Finally, we have the Leopold II suits, which are used exclusively by our Erinyes squadrons. Every variant carries a [rifle capable of firing 1 inch shells - either High Explosive or Armor Piercing. They also carry arm mounted machine guns and at least 1 flamethrower. All suits have a multi-spectral optical suite capable of seeing in Ultraviolet, Infrared, and X-ray wavelengths. They all have jumpjets and a minimum top speed of 40 MPH.](/s) Please refer to your documents for more discussion on the variants. Finally, we have begun mass production of [multi-spectral visors for your soldiers. Many borson forces are equipped with a camoflage cloak that surpasses our own. It will be necessary for](/s) even seeing the enemy.""

After he finished speaking, Trockle stood up and poured himself a drink.

Warnik nodded. ""Impressive, and armor?""

Jameson grinned. He shot a look over to Michael. ""I have [explosive ammunition. Ordinary bullets are hit or miss depending on the transhuman, but armor piercing and explosive work.](/s)""

Pearl added. ""Swords are also effective, though they tend to explode upon death, [so the typical brain stem slash or stab is ill advised.](/s)""

Davey, determined not to lose the measuring contest, added ""We've developed technology that [amplifies the abilities of a channeler and gives them the added property of bouncing from one grounded target to another.](/s) We've even got it down to the size of a [bullet with its own weaker charge. Tesla ammo's](/s) not on the market currently, but with some FR tech support we could probably mass produced them to the point that we could give them out to allied troops.""

W: ""Yes yes, but how are you guys on armor? The weapons are useless if your people are dead.""

T: ""What armor is even remotely useful against plasma rounds?""

D: ""[Ours is. If he can react in time, the pilot can generate an electromagnetic field that repels plasma bolts. We tested it with](/s) captured Borson weaponry. Aside from the ambrosia, we've recently developed, with the help of FCC engineers"" Davey gestures to Pearl, ""a [combat power suit specifically designed to increase the survivability of our channelers. It's similar in make to the armor Ash used against Ve and is meant](/s) for heavy frontline combat. [The suit uses tesla arc technology to enhance the pilot's already considerable power, and carries an on board PK-23 heavy machine gun and retractable chain weapon.](/s) The pilot is also capable of holding whatever weapon they choose, which usually is a grenade launcher of some sort. Our prototype's outside.""

W: ""Also special [ceramics will cause the magnetic containment field to dissipate, and will distribute the heat over the armor.](/s) It will only take a few rounds before shattering, but it's better than nothing, and should increase survivability by a lot. I can produce some in my city if you will provide me with the materials I need, and compensation for the labor.""

D: ""Given that we can't currently [mass produce the suits,](/s) I'm sure we could find material to airlift you. And it's good that you mentioned payment because I actually wanted to discuss your share of our profits while you're here.""

W: ""Oh yes, my investment.""

D: ""I'd wondered why you made it at the time, and it looks like I have my answer. But that purchase was allowed because you were representing yourself, not Anabel June. I cannot hand over a portion of our GDP to a foreign power for a number of reasons. And here you are the leader of New Faroe. Do you see the problem here?""

W: ""I can represent myself, and my new nation. All money earned by myself will go to my personal coffers.""

D: ""Just wanted to make sure you were aware of the situation... And I suppose there are worse nations we could owe money to.""

Trockle stood up. ""Let's take a twenty minute break, shall we? We can continue these discussions later.""

""Yep. We haven't even gotten to my artillery or the mobile armor.""

""If you want."" Warnik shrugged, some metal clicks as he does. Was he a robot under all that muscle?

*20 minutes later*

J: ""Alright. Naval barrages, [a trio of World War Two rapid troop movement, one of which is modernized with very accurate gunnery platforms and an AAA envelope that's radar controlled. These are enormous guns with range measured in dozens of miles. We also have heavy machine guns as point defense on our ships as well as railroad cars. And yes, the trains also have naval batteries and army field guns, including cannon](/s) that match that of the naval battleship batteries.""

D: ""Our [drones are stealth,](/s) and if we have them we need to assume the Borsons do as well. You're [guns can't hit what they can't see](/s) no matter how big they are.""

T: ""There's always the option of filling the air with so much lead that you're bound to hit *something*.""

D: ""If you're willing to expend that much ammo, sure, that might work.""

J: ""We have no problem with that. Besides, we don't intend to operate alone.""

Pearl interjected. ""It's easy to make tons of shells when you can set prices.""

Then his Jameson's grew. ""Our soldiers are becoming better equipped- from our mark one through mark four. Mark one is [glorified textile armor and a big honkin' machine gun, but the mark four is a work of electronic artistry. Integrated heads up display, mounted flamethrower, jet pack (dependent on proximity to generator), and a wrist grapple. Then there's the mobile armor.](/s) A few stories tall, we recognized the mobility flaws and corrected with verniers.""


W: ""Directionless energy is also a massive waste. It's spitting in the face of the square cube law. I've heard that Jameson is having issues in the polls.""

T: ""Yes, he and I spoke about it at length earlier. I'm doing a few things to help on our end. And he's taking action as well. Why do you think he's not drinking today?""

J: ""I admit their range is limited. [They do have a high quality battery, but they must return. We do have some...some cables as well.](/s) And yes, the polls matter. There is a senate and they are answerable to the public.""

W: ""That's why I never let my people have a poll. The person is smart, people are dumb scared animals, and all of you know it.""

D: ""I'm not joining the men in black Warnik.""

""No wonder mercy left,"" Pearl mumbled.""

""You understand a lot of references for one so young."" Warnik looked at Davey. ""As for Mercy, she never opposed my rule, simply the direction of my research."" Warnik said, now staring down Pearl.

Trockle slammed his fist on the table, surprisingly loudly. ""ENOUGH! We can debate the relative merits of democracy and autocracy later. Right now, we have a war to plan for, this is not the time to squabble like children.""

Warnik raised an eyebrow. ""Indeed. I apologize for my straying of thoughts, I haven't had much chance to debate anything in a long time.""

Davey mumbling: ""seriously?""

Trockle fixed him with a stare, raising an eyebrow. ""Do you have a problem, Davey?""

D: ""None whatsoever. So are we all in agreement that we need to work closer in tandem to be more effective?""

""I agree."" Trockle returned to a neutral pose and tone. ""Temporarily, that is. After this war, while I would like to keep an alliance going between all of us, we cannot risk continuing to entangle our forces like that. Or we could end up forming a superpower, one that isn't necessarily benevolent.""

D: ""You show a surprising reluctance to grow in power for somebody who would probably end up leading such an alliance.""

""He's a good man."" Pearl said approvingly.

""There are no good men."" Davey looked down. ""No evil ones either.""

T: ""Again. I'm not a king. I'm an elected President. One with fixed terms. Even if I could be trusted with that much power, and I'm not sure that anybody can be...""

Pearl bristled seemingly at Davey's comments.

T: ""I can be replaced. My successor won't necessarily be a good person.""

D: ""Iron hands. Death empress. I could name others. It worries me that you'll retire and they might not be (presumably to Trockle).""

W: ""We are getting off track again. I can commit, 500 light Infantry, produce ceramic plasma armor, and we have while not sizable, a very advanced](/s) navy, stolen from Anabel.""

Trockle looked at Pearl and smiled. ""We can discuss that eventuality later."" He looked back at Warnik. ""If you are willing to share the recipe...the Free Republic can assist with production. We are on par with or possibly ahead of AMR in terms of production capability."" He turned to Davey. ""And we can assist with producing those [lightning rounds](/s) you mentioned.""

P: ""I can donate four hundred [scouts, and another hundred embedded in remote postings are responding as 'active.' I also have a further three hundred soldiers, and three Assault class types, which is a new training program we launched. Maine excels at combat but we were unsuccessful at teaching diplomacy and stealth. So we focused on his Combat.](/s) We have begun training others for this. I can also donate two hundred [construction corps builders for fortresses, traps, mines, explosives, and in a pinch they might be able to do some damage with guns, and a further seven hundred civilians we have armed and taught to](/s) march and point, load, and fire a weapon.""

Jameson splayed his hands. ""They've got us, so we started manufacturing chips. They produce..."" 

W: ""I can share the recipe, but I can't guarantee that you will be able to make the ceramic, it requires specialized equipment.""

Trockle shrugged. ""Ever since we got our [semiconductor fab](/s) running, we've been able to drastically increase our production capabilities, at least as far as specialized equipment goes.""

D: “It’ll take some time to gather them back from various assignments, but I can commit [1200 Sentinels led in platoons of 30, each toon lead by a channeler. Several of those channelers will have power armor, but most won’t. There is also a bezerker corp](/s) that we’ve been using. They’re only good for close combat, but if you can get them there they are quite good at it. I can also promise the whole of New Golgotha’s [air force, which at present consists of two armed predator drones and Ms. Nomere’s boat plane.](/s) We’ve been… experimenting with [air-to-water insertions. It’s been hit and miss](/s) so I wouldn’t lean on us having that capability. How fast can you get us those [ceramic plates?](/s)” He turns to Warnik.

W: ""I can get the [plates](/s) out in three days, then in a week we'll have full production, as long as I get the material. We should be able to produce [500 plates a day, it will take three plates for a](/s) good armor set, [two for a chest plate and a helmet, and one for something like Kevlar, with only the front chest and](/s) back protected.""

“Also, there’s one last thing.” Ooo, Davey looked nervous now.

Trockle looked at Davey. ""Yes?""

D: [“The Borsons will notice if New Golgotha mobilizes. And they are more than likely to have knowledge of our military capabilities. If we’re going to move against them we need to](/s) do it far from the city.""

T: ""What about vehicles? And combat suits? In our experience, Borson forces often require heavy weaponry to kill.""

W: ""A suit would take ten plates, a jeep seven. A tank would take about 12.""

Trockle did some quick math. ""Ideally, we would want....[150,000 plates, it sounds like. 90,000 for our line soldiers...8,000 for our combat suits...12,000 for our airships, and about 30,000 for our vehicles.](/s) Not including spares.""

W: ""Like I said we can make [500 a day](/s) full tilt. We need to maintain the reactor, grow food and linen, maintain buildings, ships, and fish still."" Warnik sighs.

T: ""I think we're just going to have to forgo them for now, then. There is no way to supply our army evenly. Or really, in any quantities sufficient to make a difference.""

W: ""I wouldn't forgo them. Protect the [force multipliers, the suits and airships first. Even one being harder to take down](/s) could turn the tide of war.""

T: ""Warnik...it'll take you 16 days just to produce enough for our suits. Then another 24 to protect our airships. [We can't wait that long to launch an offensive. Davey is right - every moment we delay,](/s) the Borsons grow stronger.""

W: ""If you can get a factory up to speed in a few days, I'm sure you can make more. I can send engineers and workers in to help with that.""

Trockle nodded. ""We'll see if we can. I can dedicate several factories to these [plates.](/s) Assuming we can make any, we may be able to make these by the thousands. Tens of thousands if we're lucky.""

D: “I’ll send tech representatives over to see about getting the [tesla rounds mass produced. But if we’re going to assault Duluth we cannot muster in Minnesota.](/s) They’d see it coming. We’d have to either launch an [amphibious assault from New Michigan, which presents it’s own complications, or come down through Canada and get](/s) closer to “Alice” than I’m comfortable getting.""

T: [""Why not come up through Wisconsin? We can stay well east of Minneapolis maybe assemble near Green Bay, then push west](/s) after we've mustered.""

D: “[Pushing along the coast might work out fine for](/s) an all scout or commando force, but not for something this size. What if- What if we split our forces into [a pincer or even a triple pincer movement. That way if something happens to one assault force, ambush, zombies, what have you, the other two can still move in. They’ll be outflanked and pressed against the Great Lakes. Hammer and anvil. Hell, we could even have a diversionary force for one push and the](/s) other two pushes could be legitimate.”

Trockle thought. ""Possibly. Although to my understanding, we don't really have the force sizes that make something like that work. Classically, [pincer movements involved armies in the hundreds of thousands."" He shook his head. ""That said, I'm an engineer. Well, project manager, actually. Point is, I'm not much of a strategist.](/s) That would best be discussed with my generals.""

W: ""They still have the ultimate high ground. They can probably see all troop movements through space based surveillance anyway.""

[""Not if the weather's right they don't."" Davey grinned insidiously, ""get enough channelers together and you can start a thunder storm. I've seen it happen.""](/s)

W: [""Wouldn't they find a moving thunderstorm](/s) suspicious?""

D:[""Storms move](/s) all the time.""

""And with satellites down, I don't think they'll notice."" Pearl nodded to Davey, lending her support to his plan. [""There is no longer weather monitoring.""](/s)

D: ""Granted, it might look a bit suspicious when [a storm rolls in toward them. But that might work to our advantage psychologically.""](/s) He looks at Trockle. ""You said earlier that you had generals. Perhaps at least one of them should be present?""

W: ""They still have Void Crawler correct? If they stuck to my original design it would have cameras and sensors along it. It is in a HEO right now, they might not be able to look at a person's name tag, but that could see large movements. [A sufficiently large storm cell should hide the movements though.](/s)""

T: ""If we are going to discuss strategy, they should be. I wasn't expecting these talks to progress so quickly.""

J: ""How would they, they aren't the most numerous and from what Pearl tells me, their cultists aren't coordinating with them. They have their hands full harassing us as it is, [setting up a weather monitoring system would be a waste of resources they're already expended to down satellites. If they intended to monitor weather, why down weather satellites?](/s)""

D: ""I wouldn't recommend bringing them all here necessarily. Centralizing control at one point has its disadvantages. Speaking of which,"" Davey produced his own file and slid it over to Trockle, ""[we may be able to use that inherent weakness against the Borsons.](/s)""

Trockle opened the file, looking at it dispassionately.

W: ""They don't need to make a monitor platform, the Void Crawler should have that capability. They wouldn't be able to monitor every part of the world, just the third the Void Crawler is stationed over. Also seeing as we still have comms over satellites for Reddit, not every satellite is down yet.""

D: ""What you're looking at is Operation Fenrir. It's a plan I drew up in the old days and have been refining to [assassinate all or one of the Borsons if it ever came to that. I'm giving you the knife I'd use to stab them in the back,](/s) do you understand that?"" Davey spoke earnestly, as if Trockle's opinion in this matter was very important to him. Okaaay, kind of weird.

Pearl's interest was piqued, visibly so.

D: ""This was originated assuming they'd have their old resources. But perhaps it can be adapted to the present. I can't promise miracles, but it's my best attempt as a tactician.""

Trockle nodded. ""My senior military staff will be here shortly to take a look. They're better qualified to discuss viability of something like this."" Almost as if on cue, two Free Republic personnel walked in. One was a handsome man in his mid-30s in a blue uniform, the other was a hard-bitten woman in her early thirties wearing camouflage. The brass. Warnik eyed over both of them.

I'm a sophomore currently working towards finding an internship in UI/UX Design and I wanted to start my own summer side project before the Fall semester comes along.

I love mobile apps that make people's lives easier, yet I feel like I see a lot of apps on the App Store that fall short mainly due to a poorly designed user interface which leads to a bad user experience. I want to make an unsolicited redesign of an app that rightly needs one in order to add it to my portfolio to boost my chances of landing an awesome internship.

Therefore, I ask my fellow Knights to kindly help me out by suggesting an app that you use (or have used) that you believe needs a better interface. The app can be free or paid and can fall into any category. I'm open to anything! I would love to share my finished work with you all! I can even try to get a prototype up for you guys.

Thanks in advance!"

Day 1, Part 2",Channel_20_News_Net,Askasurvivor,https://www.reddit.com/r/Askasurvivor/comments/4tcrrj/exclusive_coverage_of_the_alliance_war_talks_day/,"Trockle stood. ""Everybody, I would like you to meet Admiral Pierre Duvalle"" he gestured at the man, ""and General Natalia Ubumwe. They have my full confidence in military matters.""

Jameson chewed his lip and locked eyes with the admiral. Davey stood up and extended his hand, but not for a handshake. Instead he placed two fingers deliberately to the tendons in his exposed wrist. The Kanite salute.

Warnik stood and goes to parade rest looking at them. ""General, Admiral."" Warnik looked at Trockle, ""I take it you have your Air Force integrated as an Army Air Core?"" Duvalle and Ubumwe saluted smartly.

""We used to, sir. But there were logistical troubles doing that, so we split. As airships maneuver much more like naval vessels than airplanes, we treat it as such. A sky navy, if you will,"" Duvalle replied, smiling warmly. Warnik considerd that for a moment.

W: ""An interesting idea. Very practical as well.""

D: ""That's another concern. If we [conjure up a storm they'll be high winds and frequent electric discharge.](/s) That'd make trouble for your blimps.""

Duvalle was unfazed. [""Our airships are rated to pass through lightning storms and hurricanes.](/s) We may need to fly low, but we can manage.""

D: ""Hurricanes, really? Wow. I think that's better than most old world craft could do.""

W: ""Most old world airships didn't have armor plating as well.""

J: ""Our trains can't handle [washouts. The infrastructure was in need of work before shit hit the fan and ten years of neglect](/s)."" 

D: ""Your trains will likely [move faster than we can keep up with anyway. And it's more than likely that the rail lines around Duluth have been sabotaged. You may have to bring your longer range guns](/s) to bear if you want them to be effective.""

W: ""Also Anabel and the Borsons removing train tracks can't be helping that. I doubt they'll have left tracks for at least ten miles from where ever they're based. Do you have crews to build track while under enemy fire?""

J: ""Our track workers are effective, and as long as the grade remains we can have sabotage repaired in minutes.""

W: ""Sabotage and removal are different though, I would doubt that the Borsons left a single rock or timber leading to them. I know I wouldn't.""

J: ""We manufacture our own. Honestly it's half the work done already. Placing lengths of track can be done at a pace of over a hundred miles in a day.""

D: ""[What you have besides trains is a sizable navy, and there's less they can  do to counteract that. If you could sail you battleships into the great lakes, we can ensure that Hells Navy leaves you alone.](/s)""

Ubumwe spoke up. ""Can you disguise your military trains as civilian ones?""

J: ""I don't think they'll care. Even our civilian trains look the same- personnel carriers are identical in most regards, the civilian transports carry artillery to discourage harassment.""

""Interesting how you mentioned Anabel just now."" Davey leans forward onto the table. ""Who else here thinks that Anabel's going to swoop in to help whoever's winning in order to curry favor with the victor?""

W: ""The Borsons hate her, and she hates them. She isn't in this conflict now because she knows once the Borsons are gone anyone who wants an edge over the surviving nations will align with her.""

P: ""Or she knows once the Borsons are gone, we'll be worn down and easy pickings. I see her as akin to death empress. Ready and willing to change humanity and subjugate the survivors of her conquest."" Pearl didn't mince words.

Davey leans back ""I'd say you're the expert in the room. But I just think we should be prepared for her intervention if it comes. For instance, would your troops be willing to fight besides her clones?"" He turns to Warnik, ""I doubt mine would.""

W: ""Pearl you see Loki in everyone you look at. Anabel might use the weakened nations to expand into new compounds, however she knows she would lose an all out war, however she also has a lot to sell to people in a war of their own.""

P: ""She is not trustworthy. She gave me a vial saying it would restore life to the students she butchered. It created special infected out of their corpses."" She tipped her cup. ""Forgive me if I don't see in her someone who will stand idly by.""

D: ""We've done business with her multiple times. I have no doubt that she'll take advantage of the chaos, but she'll have to beat NA and Death Empress to it. She has no reason to eliminate sources of profit. And she's already lost significant resources.""

""As have I,"" Jameson said. ""In turn she bombed a locomotive. She's daft. Unpredictable. Just because it's nonsensical for her to attack doesn't mean she won't, and I would rather not rely on those nations to bail us out.""

Warnik looked like he was going to say something but decided against it.

Trockle walked over to Pearl. ""Anabel June is certainly a problem. But right now...the Borsons are the clear and present threat. And we cannot hold back resources against them.""

""She's also established a clinic in our city"" Davey retorted, ""because of her disease in the Quarters is at an all-time low. There are no evil women.""

Pearl's cough sounded like she might have said ""Psycho."" In response to Davey.

W: ""Both of you were getting cozy with the Borsons, essential the people that wanted her dead. If you don't work with her, you are against her in her mind."" Warnik looked at Pearl.

Ubumwe spoke up. ""Look, Anabel is a problem. But you can't count on FR support for it in the short term. We expect [heavy losses from this fight, we're going to need to consolidate after this](/s)."" She put down a paper. ""We're sending [35,000 people out. Our most optimistic projections put it at 15,000 coming back at fighting strength. That's 40% of our total military that's going](/s) to be just...gone.""

W: ""A wise sentiment. I would also suggest at least pretending to trade with her, humour her. Buy a few clones, an ICT, some medication, anything to make it look to her like you need her around. That should stave off attacks. I don't have that luxury, but I can move my city.""

P: ""Already on it. We have a control device on our train. Bitten once threw my country into chaos and scared the FR into militarization. Which, I'm sorry about. Grateful for now, but still.""

D: ""Wait, that thing's seaworthy?!""

W: ""That was its design. A mobile base to control Edward, and sell Junenetics products to new markets. It's made up of 50 meter by 50 meter squares and hexagons 50 metres on each side. They interlock but each one has a propeller and can move itself plus four others. It can't move fast, but it can move. Max speed is 10 miles per hour, normal moving speed is seven.""

D: ""B#tch made herself a mobile floating fortress..."" Davey mutters under his breath.

W: ""Honestly I stole most of the plans from the old world Seasteading institute, but if someone has already invented the wheel, no need to make a new one.""

Jameson shook his head. ""[40% casualties will be abhorrent. Considering these are also able bodied workers, even more so, your](/s) benefits will see a serious drain. What do you say to a jobs program? High risk, but even the mentally incompetent and flat footed should be able to perform no problem.""

Trockle looked at Jameson. ""What exactly do you mean?""

""Jobs. Manning the solar carts is a dead man switch. Literally holding down a button, even an incompetent can manage that. Foundry jobs where intelligence isn't needed, and flat feet don't matter. I want all citizens to feel they have a stake and a part to play in this."" Then he offered a smile. ""I could also offer to heal crippled veterans.""

""I'll see what we can do. But we're at 97% employment as is. We are almost completely switched over to war production. It can continue until we run out of resources."" He thought. ""As for healing the permanently injured, I would be grateful for that. That would cut our expected losses by more than half.""

""Veterans are worth ten rookies, psycho tells me. And three percent is counting people who aren't seeking employment? Either way, how many shop owners and employees could make decent soldiers?""

""They are. [And half of our forces going on this offensive are reservists. I won't lie to you - we can't support the army we currently have indefinitely."" He sat back. ""That's a large part of why we won't be able to do much to help with Anabel after this. This war is going to drive us into the red](/s).""

J: ""Wars are expensive."" 

Pearl frowned. ""About our tobacco crop...""

Trockle waved his hand. ""It was destroyed, I know. For the sake of the war effort, we're forgiving the FCC's debt to us.""

He turned to address the entire table. ""That does bring me to another point I want to make. A condition on this alliance. If any member wants to start a war, they have to discuss it with the other members of this alliance first. Jameson is right, wars are expensive. If all of us can be dragged into wars that just one member started, pretty soon we'll all be bankrupt. Obviously, this excludes defensive wars. I imagine that if any of us is actually attacked, we should be able to expect the full support of the other members of the alliance.""

D: ""I second the motion.""

P: ""I apologize about this war. Had there been time, I would have consulted. But that is fair. I back it as well.""

""I suppose the decision is unanimous,"" Jameson said. ""If and when Creathian arrives, he may have his own vote, but I'm on board.""

Trockle nodded. ""Good. The fact is, all of us are going to be weakened by this war. This alliance may prove necessary to our survival in the near future.""
Suddenly the dreaded tyrant Creathian of New Michigan burst into the room, several guards following close behind him.

C: ""Sup bitches?""

President Trockle stood up calmly. ""Glad you can join us Creathian, we were just talking about you.""

C: ""That so?""

T: ""We were discussing your vote in the motion to add a condition in the alliance saying that no member must attack a foreign power without the approval of the other members. That way we can't be drawn into war after war. If you're through giving my head of security a heart attack, I believe we were getting to the next item on our agenda. Namely, what our response is to TSmk1 and the AMR science facility that produced her. Speaking of which, would it be possible for Laura to come down here? I can guarantee her safety as long as she stays in the Free Republic.""

Creathian considered it for a second, before shaking his head. ""Not any time today. She left for New Michigan last night. She'd be there by now; it's about a day trip. As for the stuff about the alliance, uhhh works for me. Can you tell these guys to ease up a little? I don't do this sort of thing on the first date."" By now the psycho had to guards restraining his arms while a third patted him down from behind. 

T: ""Just as soon as they're sure you have no weapons on you. Then you can take your seat.""

J: ""I know nothing about weapons or the like, including what our weapons needs are for our military. I find trade purposes for those. Psycho herself hasn't been around to carry out more than cursory inspections. It may be that she was lied to. Or that tsmk1 is an aberration and none of the others ever gained sentience. Or that tsmk1 is and never was sentient.""

T: ""Jameson...I know that knowledge that flagrantly unethical experiments were committed under your watch is a bitter pill to swallow...but sticking your head in the sand won't fix it. You already know they happened - the existence of 0230 is proof. And you know he is sentient as well - you've met him."" Trockle turned to Creathian. ""Would it be possible for Laura to come down? You have my word that she will be safe here, and we will ensure that she gets to go back to New Michigan as soon as she wishes.""

J: ""0230 was alive and conscious, a separate project of a terminal child patient. The head researcher disappeared and his grandson somehow became involved. It should surprise no one when an entire settlement goes up in smoke that records are hard to come by. And though she'll collect my head if this ever gets out, Psycho cared deeply for 0230. She kept a stack of his favorite lullabies and would sing him to sleep. Yeah. I wouldn't believe it either. Still, TSmk1 was different. A clone by birth, stripped of identity and memories, and supposedly of coherent thought or memory retention. Designed to change healing, one scientist decided to inject different muscle fibers and bone growth, with human powered flight as a bar for true success."" 

T: ""Jameson...that wasn't a terminal child patient...that was just a kid grabbed off the streets.""

J: ""The original 0230 was a terminally ill child. The success and product of the project was the lead scientist's grandson, we suspect. Some sort of transference, some sort of splash from when the original went insane in the streets, or perhaps it was a shock zombie, it's unclear which happened. From 0230's postings, perhaps some injections were involved, reasons unknown.""

D: ""So why did you put out a bounty on Laura and not this clown?""

J: ""Tsmk1 is the penultimate in our research, the first success in several regards. Flight, yes, but healing capabilities, blood/oxygen transfer, enhanced lung capacity, better bone structure... The list goes on. Their blood literally can heal, provided you have an iunetanna chip. The scientists is presumed dead.""

D: ""But not sentience right? Couldn't possibly have squeezed that in there at some point, just to see what would happen?"" Davey sits back in his chair.

Trockle shook his head. ""Let's table this for now. Earliest Laura can be here is tomorrow. We can resume this discussion then."" He turned to Creathian. ""Would it help if I sent an airship?""

J: ""No. The point of clone research as a testing bed was to reduce the time between theory and implementation. We have a million ways to cure cancer...in mice. I thought if we could sidestep the moral issue by stripping them of all capability to think...she must have healed herself- you can't rebuild everything from scratch. But speech patterns, mannerisms...perhaps even The Voice.""

Trockle brought his hand to rub the bridge of his nose. ""So many...never mind."" He looked up. ""Look, obviously that didn't happen. At least one became sentient. Maybe even was created sentient on purpose.  You yourself admit it - your scientists put the pursuit of knowledge before ethical considerations. And there might be more like her, suffering torturous medical experiments as we speak. The fact is...your scientists have more in common with Mengele than Mendel.""

""There's also the political ramifications to consider."" Davey seemed tired all of the sudden. ""If what you're saying is true then what stops the AMR from... Building more like her, turning them into super soldiers? What sane man would hand that kind of capability over to AMR, or any nation for that matter?""

Jameson drummed his fingers.

T: ""Even more than that Jameson. You're suffering in the polls. And this isn't a scandal just waiting to happen - this is a scandal that's already happening. You can't cover it up. If you raid the labs now, and punish those responsible - you'll be seen as a leader who made a grievous oversight, but one who took swift and decisive action to rectify his mistake. But the more you hem and haw and try to deny, deny, deny - well, the more you seem like a weak leader who wrung his hands when faced with a difficult decision. Or worse. It could even look like you did know. And approved.""

Pearl looked displeased. ""Tsmk1 is none of my business. But frankly, it does sound ethically worrisome."" She paused. ""And Trockle is right. This may blow up in your face politically. What do you mean 'human flight,' anyways? I haven't been following her much.""

Jameson groaned. ""I'm loathe to send them to their deaths. They're ultimately trying to find a cure for zed virus, or at least gene therapy immunization. They're close.""

Warnik stood up and grabbed another drink.

""I..."" She looked at him like he was an idiot. ""That has nothing to do with zed virus. They're playing God on your dime. You'll fall for this, and they'll likely skirt punishment and continue researching their pet projects. The question of other test subjects gaining sentient thought isn't a matter of 'if' but 'when,' if they haven't already.""

Duvalle looked at Pearl. ""Laura, or Tsmk1, has wings. Fully functional ones.""

Jameson threw his hands up. ""Fine. They've got the healing chips functional. That's enough for now. The rest I'll leave for the future.""

Trockle looked at Jameson. ""You need to do that raid I keep mentioning. As soon as you can. The bull is out of the pen Bill. Your choice is whether you stay on top, or get trampled.""

""It almost."" Davey began rubbing his unkept chin, ""Now it almost seems like these scientists of yours might be operating with their own agenda in mind, possibly under some organization or group you don't know about? That's just a theory though.""

W: ""Or just that given no oversight scientists will do what ever they can to advance their agenda, morals be damned.""

Trockle stared at Warnik. He looked like he was about to say something, but decided against it.

D: ""Yeah, maybe I'm just assuming the worst again. By the way, there is something I really need to let you know before we all leave here.""

He looked at Davey. ""Yes, I remember you keep trying to say something. What is it?""

Jameson looked eager to get the conversation off of himself.  

Once Davey realizes he has Trockle’s attention, his smirk disappeared and his face went blank. He inhales for a solid four seconds as the room died down. “So… The Borsons and New Golgotha kind of made a deal a while ago. It’s part of the reason I know their location and certainly the reason we can’t assemble forces there. We offered to provide their forces safe harbor in Minnesota and free reign of the area’s salvage in exchange for certain services rendered.” Wait.... what? Oh this was good.

Warnik looks at Davey. ""What were the terms exactly?""

Davey didn't look back, just forward. “We provided them with supervised access to some of our more valuable scavenging grounds under the guise of having a battle with the Borson cult. We also agreed to exterminate any Borson cultists for them. I don’t know why there are still ones attacking Smith, the Borsons already told them to go to Minnesota. We also agreed to cover up any sightings of their teams in the area, thus offering them a safe haven. In return, they augmented 20 sentinels, nineteen of which were combat oriented.” He looked blankly at Pearl.

Pearl tensed. She was strung tight, like a bow about to release.

W: ""...And the other one?""

P: ""Yes, traitor, tell me."" Creathian leaned forward, raising his eyebrows a day giving a look.

Davey shifted his weight in his seat slightly “Was not combat oriented. They also agreed to provide us with testing kits for the Voice, which we’re currently using alongside the ones given to us by Smith. The last thing they offered was a non-sentient AI centered around strategic planning. Think *War Games* but more advanced. And I’m not a traitor.”

Pearl's hand formed a fist. It was beautiful and absolutely terrifying at the same time. ""We could have used that scanner. We could have saved students. We even have ones at your compound. What have you done with them?"" She kept her cool, controlled tone, but it sounded as though she were hearing a prisoner confess their crimes prior to execution.

Davey’s voice and face were both expressionless, but I thought I could see his eyes widen a bit. “We’re using them to find any among our number who have the Voice. New converts too. Those people will be separated out early and will probably be offered safe transport to FCC Smith. If I was a traitor, why would I be here, in the stronghold of my enemies? Why would I have kept Psycho alive? Why would I hand you the greatest weapon I could craft to use against the Borsons? And why the hell would I ask Bolts of all people to perfect a weapon design? Why would I send him a shipment of the guns we equip our sentinels with?""

Pearl seemed to relax a bit. ""Fair.""

Trockle nodded dispassionately. ""You do realize those augmented sentinels will die as soon as the Borsons know you've turned against them, right? It happened at Smith.""

Creathian leaned back, and looked at Pearl.

D: “They might, that’s why the Synod only wanted twenty. But the Borsons have not upheld their end of the deal, one the Synod and me to a point were willing to make at the time because it seemed like the right thing to do. We provided them with raw material with the understanding that they’d use it to repair their ships and Void Crawler. We were offering them a way out, a way to end this insanity before it started. And we, I, posted sentries with their teams to make sure they followed through. Instead, they chose to take our gift and use it for weapons and combat robots.” Davey was silent for a moment. “I trusted the men I sent. They were my brothers, if not in blood then in spirit, and I thought they’d be above whatever pettiness the Borsons offered them if they ever tried to betray us… Each and every one of them looked me in the damn eye and told me they were sending the scrap into orbit via space elevator. Then some photos come back from the drones as they re-enter Minnesota, and surprise surprise Duluth doesn’t have any buildings.” His voice was more lively and animated now. “So I went to check on these brothers of mine, and I found four empty beds in the sentinel barracks. They probably left hours ago when they figured things were getting too hot, I don’t know.” He looked up at Pearl. “Imagine if someone like Ash or North had stabbed you in the back on behalf of those maniacs. Imagine if Wilcox lied to you for their benefit. I can’t speak for the Synod anymore, maybe they saw an opportunity to grab power, maybe not, who knows. But I did what I did cause I wanted to save a species, not prolong a war. I’m not a traitor because my loyalty is to the people who already betrayed me.”

W: ""Interesting. They could have many robot soldiers with a city of scrap.""

D: ""Probably  well over a thousand"" Davey holds the bridge of his nose in his fingers. ""I didn't dare send a team after that to investigate. If they were caught the Borsons would be spooked and we'd either lose their location or be overrun by them before we had a chance to mobilize.""

Trockle massaged his temples. ""Alright...I'd say that for now, this changes nothing. I doubt Davey would be here if he planned on betraying us."" He looked pensive.

Warnik runs his hands through his hair. ""Why did this have to be a full frontal war? Couldn't you have waited for a better time to attack them, like make a virus to infest their systems and slow them down?""

""Warnik, the Borsons' programming is at least a decade ahead of anything we can make, with the exception of yourself. Any virus or malware we could put on their systems, they could remove trivially."" Trockle turned his attention back to Davey. ""Davey, the news you gave us is disturbing. I want an assurance that you truly are with us in this. I want a blood binding.""

W: ""Pandora.""

Davey looked like something just jumped up out at him ""where'd you hear tha- *sigh* never mind. I'm going to drain that intern later... Fine. It's the least I can do I suppose. You want this done personally or with a representative?""

T: ""I'll do it personally. I know it means less if it's just a representative."" Trockle turned quickly to Warnik. ""And Pandora wouldn't work well either. If the Borsons are children, Pandora's an infant. It would just be a good way to warn them of our intentions and get a newborn AI killed.""

D: ""I'll need a knife...""

Pearl looked unsettled at the prospect. ""I had one scout go bad. I killed him with my bare hands. I expect the same from you. People will die for your mistake. Noble it may have been, but we are now faced with this.""

D: ""You want a medal? It has to be me wielding it. No one else here knows the ritual. Level a gun at my head if it makes you more comfortable. I don't care. And don't give me the 'you've killed us all' speech. That honor goes solely to the one who opened fire on the Borsons in the first place.""

Warnik stood up, facing the President. ""Do not presume to lecture me on matters of science and technologies. Given proper time and direction Pandora could have made a self evolving program that could have really given the Borsons trouble. I'm not talking about in a few days, I mean over weeks or even months. However, do to someone's rash actions humanity has been thrust into a war which it may not win and was in no way prepared for. [I have developed a knife that when used to stab a Borson injects a nanite that corrupts their code as it is sent out for back up, effectively truly killing them.](/s)""

Trockle went over to a case, and pulled out an ornate knife, handing it to Davey. ""I personally made that knife. I know a personal knife means more.""

Jameson slowly raised a hand. ""You made the weapon. I fired it, and let's be honest, it was the only shot we were going to get.""

Davey carefully took it. ""You're unwarranted trust is appreciated Mr. Trockle."" He examined the blade for a moment, then jabbed himself in the forearm with it. Blood immediately started to flow, but not enough to be a pierced artery. Slowly so as not to antagonize anyone in the room, he began scribbling strange looking symbols and spirals all along his exposed arm, using the knife and wound as a kind of ink and quill. The patterns culminated into a design of cuts on his palm, a kind of crudely ""drawn"" bird. Bad ass.

D: ""With the vitae that flows through us all do I anoint my unworthy flesh, with the sincerity that goes to the roots of my bones do I consecrate my vow. And with the spark of sacred life within me do I make a pledge to Michael Trockle of the Free Republic."" He offered Trockle the still wet knife and displayed the bird in his palm. ""My personal symbol and avatar when I finally join Kane. Many moons and suns from now. The black eagle. May it carry me to hell instead should I violate the bond."" Trockle took the knife, made a slit on his hand, a thin trickle of blood flowing out, and then shook Davey's hand.

D: ""What are your terms?""

Pearl winced.

T: ""To fight with us against the AI known as the Borsons. To honor the terms of the alliance to the spirit and letter in which it was forged. To speak only truth among us without hint of a lie. Those are my terms.""

Davey disconnected and just kind of stared at Trockle. ""I could have been you slave just now Trockle. You could have asked for anything and I'd have to give it if it was in my power, even if it was the city. You realize that right?""

T: ""I do. But we do not approve of slavery in the Free Republic."" He looked at Davey. ""All I wanted was an assurance that you do not lie when you say you are with us. I have that now.""

D: ""Yeah... I guess you do.""

W: ""Unless he's lying about the ritual.""

Trockle shook his head. ""I asked for the ritual, remember? I know its meaning.""

W: ""But do you know it's been done correctly? I trust Davey, but still even with this ritual it comes down to trusting him. If you don't, then the ritual is meaningless.""

T: ""Again, I do. My intelligence network is thorough, Warnik."" He shrugged. ""Plus, faking the ritual would dishonor him as much as making it and breaking his oath.""

D: ""Faking blood bonds carries... Weighty entailments in this life and the next. Nevertheless I understand your suspicion. I wouldn't trust my word or my troops either. So how about a revised battle plan? The rest of you deal with the Borson's main force and I'll make sure Gaia's chosen doesn't come in and kill everyone indiscriminately. June and the NA to if I can manage it. Call it a penitent crusade. Worst case scenario, I run off and Pearl gets to hunt me like an animal. Deploying into Canada would also ensure I couldn't warn the Borsons if I wanted to.""

W: ""The unfortunate reality of the situation is that unless your channelers are in the mix, the chances of the army's winning drops dramatically.""

Trockle shook his head. ""We need [that storm cloud](/s) Davey."" He looked at the rest of the table. ""Warnik, Pearl, Jameson - Davey is telling the truth. To lie to us now, after blood binding and swearing to only speak the truth, would consign his soul to Kanite hell. It's....as bad as or worse than Christian hell. I'm telling you now - I asked for a blood binding because it is completely impossible for a Kanite to fake, and there is no room for him to wiggle around it. Even if he breaks it, he will be hunted by every other Kanite alive - and deboned.""

D: ""It's true. These marks don't go away. If the Kanites see the scars they'll do everything in their power to make my life unpleasant. Deboning would likely be the culmination. I can supply them and all the [tesla suits I have to the main force. The suits were specifically designed to have a manual shut off switch on their backs that they can't reach. If they go rogue, which they won't, just yank that and the whole suit goes dormant. Bolts can confirm it, it was his idea. The suits](/s) would also minimize the number of channelers you'd have to be deployed alongside.""

W: ""As I said, I trust you. It simply seems strange to me that you would make a person you don't trust make an oath using a custom you can not be sure of. Unless you have witnessed such a ritual before Trockle and I am misunderstanding the subtext here. Or, Trockle does trust Davey and thus this whole ritual was for not.""

T: ""I have witnessed the ritual. We have recordings of it. I asked because if he intended to betray us, he would not have done it under any circumstance.""

W: ""Ah, to the heart of the matter, thank you. I was concerned that the leader we are staying under had just undertook a ritual with out fully understanding it. Thank you for easing my mind.""

Pearl crossed her arms

Trockle stood. ""Well...I think we've accomplished a lot. Let's call it a day. Please, feel free to take a look at the sights of Albany. I have guides ready if you wish. Or you can simply explore.""

W: ""I do have a few things I need to talk to you about after this. Mostly dealing with trade.""

T: ""I understand. I'll be available."" He turned to Pearl. ""Are we still on for dinner tonight, Pearl?""

P: ""Words are wind. Frankly? I think he's doing this because he is scared. He carried giving them scrap without any of our knowledge- why? We might have sued for peace. Perhaps he was scared iunetanna might discover his complicity? Perhaps he is a sacrificial pawn."" Pearl spoke with conviction, turning to him. ""You ask for trust after assisting the enemy. Your brothers- are they 'dishonored'? Why risk betraying you? What fate awaits them for assisting our enemies?""

""Big words coming from someone who murdered a guest to their home."" Warnik glares at Pearl.

Pearl's frosty gaze turned to him, now.

Warnik smiles at Pearl amused by her.

D: ""Two of my brothers are dishonored Pearl. Two, and I will skin them alive when I find them. Our potential annihilation at the hands if Smith and company was a factor in our decision I admit. But so was our distaste at exterminating those who had never wronged us. Psycho also had her misgivings. Want to know what I told her? I said that New Golgotha was the recent member of an exclusive club, and that we had just gotten our foot in the door before our new 'friends' started a massive bar fight out of nowhere. Of course we played every option to survive while pissing as few people off as possible. Wouldn't you?""

Trockle sighed. ""Again. Calm down. Everyone. Pearl - trust me, Davey wouldn't fake this ritual even if he doesn't truly believe. Deboning is a painful process, and that is what would be in store for him. Warnik, the FCC does not observe guest right as a matter of course. Her actions were perfectly legal under FCC strictures. All if you - this alliance requires a modicum of understanding of each other's cultures, without judgment.""

P: ""I killed because I had no choice for my peoples' sake, Warnik. Kidnapping an FCC citizen is an act of war. Discovery of this act of war was done after guest right was granted. No bread was broken, and while an invitation was made, it was broken as he refused to change his vote even though the status quo was an act of war, and then he threatened me in my own house. The punishment for that is death. Time until their discovery of our abilities was limited. I had no choice but to do as I did. Besides, if I did not start this war, someone else in this very room would have- and they would not only have the FCC's powers solved, but would have had such a deep understanding of the voice that they could reverse engineer it to discover further weaknesses than just a genetic marker to identify citizens. So, you point the finger at me for starting this war, because it is easy- but ask yourself why that laser was built. We didn't build it. Why Jameson and Trockle didn't demobilize their armed forces.""

W: ""I don't have armed forces to demobilize. Also from what I understand that wasn't a citizen, it was some thief from somewhere in Asia. Did they take someone from your home? Also how is not changing a vote an act of war? You invited them into your home, that gives them guest rights. You broke those rights. I point my finger at you because you are a leader with a lot of power behind you, yet you seem to treat those around you like wolves ready to eat you at a moments notice.""

P: ""That statement was aimed at Presidents Trockle and Jameson. You ordered rushed production of new prototype suits and weaponry. Yes, death empress had a part to play in retooling your economy, Jameson, and as a continued threat. But that giant laser was built for one purpose only.""

W: ""I have no knowledge of this laser other than it was used to destroy the Moon base. Even so, you gave the order to fire it.""

P: ""Yes, because they frankly would subjugate us if they could. What if Spootin came upon one of these test kits? As though the reapers aren't deadly enough. Iron hands wanted us as breeding stock- the future plans for which I shudder to contemplate. Many smaller settlements resent us- our wealth, our strength, fear of the unknown. If we were weaker, they would wipe us out. Washington's comics are reaching the wasteland, which is doing more for public perception than anything else, even if it doesn't paint the most flattering picture at least they are coming around to the idea that we're still human. And I recommended it be fired. Ve would regenerate, and descend upon the earth on a path of annihilation. We cost the enemy the majority of their forces and resources. Not all, and were it not for..."" She sighed, reluctantly letting go of blaming Davey for his actions. ""...equipping the enemy in a noble but misguided attempt at a peaceful exit strategy, this could be over with comparatively limited bloodshed- all while saving mankind from an oppressive force.""

Warnik raises an eyebrow. ""Surprisingly well articulated. While I don't agree I do see your point. As for the laser, so ultimately,"" Warnik faces Jameson now, ""You had deciding and tactical authority over the firing of the laser?""

J: ""I conferred with my co-president. We mutually decided after deliberation that it must be fired. I had to convince her."" He looked sad. ""It cost 0230 his life. Psycho took the death hard. She is on sabbatical training at Davey's New Golgotha.""

Davey, apparently not a complete fool, took the out. ""I saw what the Borsons represented and not what they were. That is my mistake and I will live with it, though I know others won't...""

""You meant well."" She waves a hand. Warnik looks at her as she waves. 

W: ""Gnatt?""

She ignored him, and looked at her empty cup. She got up and fetched more wine- at 5'3"" on her toes and weighing maybe ninety pounds, she already had a tiny blush going. The cup she returned with was a quarter full.

Trockle walked over and put a hand on Pearl's shoulder. ""I suggest we end it here for now. We've covered a lot of ground - we can pick this up tomorrow. Warnik - I'll be with you shortly."" Pearl froze, then nodded silently. Trockle sat down next to Pearl. ""You didn't answer me earlier. Are we still on for dinner tonight?""

""We are,"" she said. She seemed to finally relax as she was engaging now solely with Michael Trockle. I gawked silently. Her fabled warmer side began to show itself. I had only heard of it in hushed whispers in the most exclusive of comic clubs.

T: ""Good. Please extend my invitation to Jessie and Captain Wilcox as well.""

P: ""Of course. I think they'd be happy to join us.""

Davey still looked nervous, probably waiting to see if he'd be given an armed escort.

Trockle looked up - ""Feel free to go about Albany. It's a safe city.""

D: ""I'm sure it is."" He leaves in a hurry.

Trockle stood up. ""If you'll excuse me. Warnik - my office, 15 minutes?""

""If you'll have someone escort me."" Warnik replied.

""Of course."" An aide walked over to Warnik.

4tcxcr,11,2016-07-17,"Started working at too low a rate under very unclear terms, now asking for more money. Advice? [Graphic Design/Front-end Web]",waxphan,freelance,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/4tcxcr/started_working_at_too_low_a_rate_under_very/,"I am very new to freelance, fresh out of school, and it has been a very very bumpy road so far. I need some advice on a very strange, very confusing situation.

I've just graduated, and I've just started applying for jobs when I get a call from an agency on a Thursday at 8:30pm asking if I can come in to work the next day, for a 3 day project. I say sure, since I'm not legally supposed to be working yet (visa's in the mail, not yet in my hands, don't worry about it), an extra bit of cash can't hurt. So I go in, they offer me $20/h, I say sure, since _I have **no** idea what I'm doing,_ and think ""it's only 3 days and it's money I otherwise wouldn't have at all."" Bad start. I know that now.

At the Monday morning meeting, everyone's treating me like I'm a full-time new hire. They ask what projects I'm on, to which my response was something like ""do I even work here??!"" The two senior designers (both one year out of school) reply ""... don't you? Crap, we need to talk to the boss."" We go see the bossman, and he and I agree that I'll stay on for the full week. At this point, I'm starting to get nervous about my rate. It's low, and now my whole week is booked, so I can't be looking for other better paying, more interesting work. I never intended to freelance (though now I think I like it, and want to keep it up for a while). ""A week, and then we'll see,"" he says. Still very very vague. I know I'm better at the job than many of the other designers there, and I work much faster.

Later in the week, I speak with my mentor, and some friends, who say to ask for more money, especially since I was unclear on the terms at the time of the original agreement. So I approach bossman, and he says we'll use the week as a trial, at the current rate, and discuss it on Friday. Ugh. Fine, I say.

Friday came and went, and we did not have that discussion.

A friend of mine says I should be charging much more (~$60/h), especially since they want to put me on web development too (I have front-end and creative coding experience, in fact, that's most of what I've done). The week we agreed on is up, my friend says I shouldn't go back to work unless they agree to pay me more. She says to tell him I have another offer at a higher rate. If it matters, she knows this guy personally, so if she thinks I can tell him this, I somewhat trust her. Also she's a badass freelancer, and I don't have even a third of her confidence yet. 

I shoot the bossman an email tonight, asking for $35/hr (which I'm comfortable with) and telling him I have an offer elsewhere at that rate, as per my friend's instruction. He replies saying only ""let's discuss tomorrow."" What do I do? I don't expect he'll agree to the new rate. I don't actually have an offer at that rate, I have an offer for a $15/h internship (which I'm absolutely not taking). If he says no, do I just walk away? He went on a whole spiel last week in a meeting about how they have to work ""good, fast and cheap"" in order to stay in business, so I know they're not totally loaded.

**TL;DR started working at an agency on unclear terms, don't know if they're trying to hire me, or permalance me, or anything. I agreed to start at a rate below what I believe I'm worth, now I'm asking for fairer compensation, on the grounds that I had (and still have) no idea what I was agreeing to.**

EDIT:

So I tried to have this conversation this morning, but I absolutely suck. He said he needs to see if there's work for me, and I'm stuck at $23/h now (a number I said very casually at one point last week. Mistakes galore). So this sucks. I think I'll tell him I'll finish the few projects I'm already on, so I leave on relatively good terms, but not take on anything new. And then GTFO. Because I want to leave on good terms, and it's not like I have anything better to do today. 

Extra fun, he also said ""you don't seem comfortable talking about money. Are you Jewish?"" I'm hard to offend, but fucking _seriously_? I am; he is too, which is no doubt why he thinks that's okay (""part of the tribe"" or whatever) but what the actual fuck. "

Okay, so I think some history might be necessary to give the appropriate context on us. We met 4 years ago at an airport en route to a summer camp in Greece. We were each others' camp crushes and were practically inseparable the whole trip (in all seriousness, about half of the pictures of one of us generally include the other). We had a small falling out towards the end of that trip (turns out she had a bf back home, and I kept tickling her on her sides, i.e. getting a bit too touchy for her, which is my bad, I didn't mean to make her uncomfortable, I'm thankful I grew out of that habit). Even though towards the end of that trip ended on a bit of a low note, we kept in touch over the years. We kept in contact as she graduated and we both went to college.


This last year, things advanced a lot more. Around fall of last 2015, our conversations drifted. We were always good friends, but our conversations started becoming focused on hypothetically being together, and even hypothetical marriage, despite the fact that we were both in relationships at the time. At one point, we had a conversation about our conversations, and both admitted that we still had feelings for one another, but instead of being crushes they'd evolved far beyond that. We were most definitely romantically interested in one another, but neither of us wanted to be a homewrecker for the other. We kept talking about these hypotheticals, but we also gave advice to each other as to how to deal with our relationships (which eventually crumbled due to their own issues, not because of our influences on one another). 


The reason the things we've discussed are hypotheticals, are because neither of us are in a position to be in relationship with the other. She's currently living over in Boston, working 2 internships, and is finishing up her last year for college. I'm currently living in Cali, about to be hired as an EMT, and I'm gonna finish up my last semester to graduate with 2 majors. After I graduate, I'm going into the Peace Corps, and then Grad School, followed by Med School. I'm going to be transient for the next few years, and she's trying to get her career started. Neither of us are really ready for a full on relationship (well, I kinda think we can, but I do realize that it might not work out realistically). To sorta test out if we could work, I flew out to Boston a month ago because I hadn't seen her in 4 years. I even did what I consider one of the coolest things I've ever done, where she walked over to me at the airport, and as soon as she was in arms' length, I dipped her and went in for by far the best kiss of our lives. That trip to Boston was extremely magical, but it also brought a new problem. It was a test to see if we'd work well together if we actually were together, and it went very well. Too well, in fact. We miss each other more than ever now, and she's dealing with it better than I am. But despite how much we miss each other, we've both acknowledged that now is just not the time to be in a relationship with one another.


We both have our own respective issues and faults, and this weekend mine got the better of me. Over the course of two days or so, I asked her to check some stuff out, I asked her a question along the lines of, ""What do you think about us given our history, etc."", and she asked if I was free to call, but hung up since she was going into a tunnel and then forgot to call back for a few hours. These are all little things, but in my head, these little things were adding up, and I was conflicted because I was legitimately upset that I was falling to the wayside, but she's also working two internships and has a load of other stuff on her plate so I really ought to drop it. She's busy, I ought to understand that she might not have time for me sometimes. Yet, I let my insecurities get the better of me, and these last few days we've been arguing. Thursday was because of what I just described earlier, but Thursday evening I was having some difficulty trying to reconcile those thoughts in my head, and I ended up having a bit of an episode (it's difficult to explain). She left me be to hang with her friends and because she thought I needed space. The next morning I was mildly combative, because I felt like I was left for fun stuff when I needed help. Yesterday, I told her I was lowering my expectations since she kept saying she doesn't have much time for herself, let alone me, and the argument kinda kept going. My argument was that since I treat her with priority, I wanted to be treated similarly (not as her highest priority by any means, but certainly a bit better, not a lot but a bit), and she kept saying, things along the lines of, ""well sorry I'm trying to set up my life and working two jobs and have barely any time for myself"", etc. I asked last night if we could compromise by working on our communication (I trying to work on my insecurities so I don't get upset over small shit so easily, and her on treating me with a bit more expedience). We're good as of today, but I'm still worried. I'm scared that my behavior this weekend might've driven her away to some degree, and I don't want to lose her. I guess my question for you guys: How do I deal with our situation better?

4tczl5,3,2016-07-17,[.NET Developer] First Real Interview,CodeRedHF,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4tczl5/net_developer_first_real_interview/,"Hello, this is my first time posting here. I don't have any specific questions, I'm just looking for general advice for my first real interview.

--BACKSTORY--

So from Nov. 2014 - July 2016 I worked at a local online university. A family friend of mine basically gave me the job without having to really interview at all. It was my first programming job and I didn't have a whole lot of knowledge going into it, but everyone there was nice and helped my find my footing. So as time went on I went from just making visios for the web flow, to working on the UI, then the business logic, and finally messed around with SQL and the database at the start of 2016. It was going great and I had learned a lot, however they still were paying me minimum wage, which is $10/hr in CA. I was okay with this when I first started as I was still learning and it was more of an internship rather than a full time job. Though as time went on and I became more of a full stack developer I had requested an increase in pay. Nothing ever came of it and towards the middle of this month, July 2016, the company laid off essentially the entire team, 3 developers, the sr. developer/manager, and the head of our infrastructure.

-- CURRENT SITUATION --

So now that you know the backstory I can explain my current situation. I've been applying to just about every place that was looking for .Net developers where I met the requirements, basically 2yrs of .net development. No real interviews just a few small phone conversations that never went anywhere. Until this last weekend where I got a call from a company I applied at. My conversation with the lady I talked to told me how she had received 150+ applications and only picked one other person and myself. She also asked me how much I was looking to be paid, and since I live at home and don't have any real bills other than paying for my car insurance and gas, I had been asking for $20/hr which is 2x as much as I was previously making. She then told me how the position they were looking to fill was 70k - 100k a year, which is a hell of a lot more than I was previously making. This is what really caused me to post on here.

Since I was being paid $10/hr previously, I felt like $20/hr was fair for my work and now that I know they're looking to pay 70k/yr it's got me questioning my own value. I don't feel like I'm that great of a developer with only 2yrs of experience to be making that much money. This has caused me to be very panicked and worried about the interview I have because I feel like they'll think I'm a fraud and not know what I'm doing and embarrassed myself. Does anyone have any advice as to how I can get over this fear of feeling like a fraud? Also does anyone know what I should expect in this interview, because it'll be my first real developer interview.

Thank you so much, and sorry this was so drawn out.

TL;DR: Old job was paying me $10/hr and caused me to only value myself $20/hr. Conversation with a new company informed me that they're looking to pay 70k - 100k/yr, and I'm now freaking out about them thinking I'm a fraud. Any advice on how to overcome this and what to expect in the interview?"

Hey r/velo,
I just wanted to get some knowledge from people who have been doing this longer than me and have a little more experience.  This is kinda long with a lot of backstory but I'd rather give more than less detail.

Last season, I upgraded to Cat 3 and was starting to be able to keep up with faster guys but a bad crash and some really bad posion ivy kept me from having the results I wanted at the end of the season.  I started working with a coach in the off-season and came into this March in probably the best shape of my life with designs on my Cat 2 and maybe some points on my 1 for this season.  I figured that would give me the momentum to get my 1 in 2017 and maybe snag a pro contract (please don't ostracize me, I like having a dream).  I decided that my targets for the first part of the season would be a top-10 at crit nats and a win in the 3s at Somerville.

I had planned for a structure generally like this:

February - April: Collegiate racing

May: Peak for Nationals and Somerville

Late May/Early June: Training break/Family Vacation

Late June - Mid-August: Racing in my LA (MABRA)

Late August: Peak for Thater

September: Maybe race GMSR, Doylestown or Boston if I'm feeling up for it

Long season, I know but I thought it would work out.  Anyway, you might have seen my posts about my knee injury in March but if you didn't, I got patellar tendinitis.  I caught it relatively early but was still off the bike for about a month.  Lack of glute strength plus being lax on stretching (you try organizing a race) resulted in overtightened quads and therefore, tendinitis.  I got in a week and a half of training before shipping off to nationals, where I got destroyed (go figure).  In the race I did the weekend between nationals and Somerville, my rd was snapped off by a rider behind me and I lost another few days of training waiting for a hanger.  Somerville ended up being combined into a 2/3 race with 160-some guys and I was just pack fodder (I had no idea how to race with that many guys, I was fine fitness-wise).

I decided to take my training break anyway and just did some free-form riding and a couple races for fun in addition to having a bike fit before falling sick the week before vacation (which involved a few days of pretty decent riding). 

Since coming back, I've gotten a follow-up on my bike fit, done a road race (cramp) and our regional crit championship where I did the 3 and 123.  Did alright in both of the latter but not as well as I was hoping.  Then, I got sick again.  This one knocked me out for almost a full week.  I finally got back on the bike last Sunday for a ride, then did two more during the week before my achilles started bothering me.  Based on talking with my coach and working with my buddy who is a massage therapist, we think there's a weak link in one of the muscle groups on my back, which caused strain in other places and is now pulling my achilles and causing issues.  I'm not really sure how long this one will keep me off the bike but it's really just weighing on me because I haven't really had a solid, uninterrupted training block since March.  

At this point, I don't know what to do with myself for the rest of the season.  Technically, there are races I can do until September 17 but by the time I heal up, I'll still be months behind everyone else in fitness and I don't know if I'll gain anything from the races.  I have a really dull internship this summer and the bike has been the only thing keeping me sane so not having it when I was sick and now having to get off again is kinda killing my morale.

So, I'm wondering if anyone else has been through something similar and what they decided to do.  I figure that I have a couple options:

1. See what happens with the achilles and start building back up to race speed once it feels better, hope that weak links don't cause further injury.  I'll have a chance to earn a spot on a better team for next year but if I get hurt again, it'll just plunge my morale at work.

2. Call it for this race season, let achilles heal, work hard to correct weak links, do base miles and come back harder next year.  I am almost ok with this option since I will hopefully be able to just ride my bike again but I might not be able to ride with a stronger team next year.

3. Quit job, lay in bed and moan for remainder of July to let achilles heal before riding all of August to get ready for GMSR.

Also, a couple questions

1. I don't think this is how most racers have their season go and I'm starting to think that there is something systematically wrong with how I've been going at things, does anyone notice anything?

2. I'd like to be better at keeping a training journal so that I can better track events and sensations so I'm more likely to be prepared for an injury next time.  I've tried keeping it in various places to remind myself to use it but no dice, any tips?

Thanks in advance for the advice"
4tdbws,26,2016-07-18,My [28F] husband [31M] has a close female friend [21F],mywingsfly,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4tdbws/my_28f_husband_31m_has_a_close_female_friend_21f/,"My husband and I have been married for 3 years, and we were always in a good relationship. He's the kind of person that's quiet and likes to stay at home, playing computer games. He doesn't go to bars or parties, he doesn't spend much time with other girls, and this makes me feel safe.

In the beginning of this June, in his team, there came a new intern. She's still in college, and she's from a Chinese family. I am Chinese too, and I know he likes Asian girls, so that made me worry a little.

Only one week after they know each other, I find them chatting a lot online and play games together. He says it's because she reminds him of himself, who is also shy and doesn't talk much, and doesn't have many friends, that's why he wants to be friends with her, which I totally understand. They also have a lot in common, they both love to play computer games, so they have a lot to talk about. When they play games, they Skype (audio) at the same time so that they can talk to each other about where to fight next. He says he used to play in his hometown with his friends like this, but after he moved here, he only plays games online with unknown people, and it makes him feel lonely, so he misses this feeling and really enjoys playing with her. I'm trying to understand them. Every time they play, they play 3-4 hours straight. Sometimes I feel it's difficult for me to talk to him and I have to find something to do by myself in order not to be bored or lonely. 

Actually I don't mind my husband making friends with others. He's always so good to me and I trust him. It's just that sometimes I feel they are too close and hope they spend less time together, but he thinks there's nothing wrong. 

What bothers me is that I feel they chat all the time. First of all, they work in the same team every day. They have lunch together and have tea breaks together. They can also chat using an office chatting software. I don't see everything they talk about, but occasionally I happen to see a few sentences. Like one day, my husband logs onto office computer at home before he leave home, as he always does, then she sends a message to him saying she hasn't seen him in the office, then he replies he will be there soon. Also at weekends, sometimes they start from good morning and ends with good night. The girl will also send a hug emoticon, and my husband replies with a hug emoticon, which makes me feel a bit uncomfortable.. I've mentioned this to him but he says it's only virtual, not real. In the past two weeks, we went to see some movies, but every time right after the film, she'll send message to him asking about how's the movie. Also yesterday, my husband and I and a few friends went to play room escape, but he was chatting with her all the time on the road, then I have to talk with others. He says she was telling him that her family went to a park, and they had Thai food, and he told her he's going to a room escape and had Chinese food. Well, he says he needs to find something to talk about to friends, but I think that's a bit too much and too trivial. I will not report what I do every day to another friend. I will just talk to them when I want to share something with them. 

Today, I found him spend all day looking at Reddit, searching for ""relationship + Chinese"". I ask why, he says she has some problems in her family and he was trying to help. I feel he is thinking about her a lot, maybe just in a friendly way, as he is always nice to others, but it just makes me feel uncomfortable and being neglected. I gave him a few suggestions about how to solve her problems, but he still insists on doing more research to see how to help. But I think our problem is more important than hers. Maybe he should try to search ""how to have a proper relationship with a female friend"" because I'm always feeling they are too close, and I always see them chatting with each other when he's with me, and it makes me feel he's not focusing his attention on me. 

Also from what I know, this girl doesn't like outdoor events and prefer to stay at home , to be online, either chatting with friends or playing games with others. I'm not sure whether my husband is just one simple friend of hers, but I do feel they are very close and she spends a lot of time with him. Even during the Euro Cup soccer game a few weeks ago, I feel we were watching together, because whenever there's a goal, she'll send  a message to him. So he must be special to her, because she won't send message to everyone whenever there's a goal. 

My husband is a very nice man. He says since she's only here for 3 months, he wants to take her out, spend time with her, giving her a good intern experience instead of her just going to work and going home. All these weeks I'm trying to understand their relationship, but every now and then, I still feel sad and lonely and don't know what to do. He doesn't like to talk much, and he rarely talks to me about what they do or what they talk about unless I ask him. He says most of the time they talk about games and things that I won't care. I'm afraid he will talk more to her and be closer to her in the future. I don't want to always feel lonely and upset. Therefore I seek advice here, hope to know how I should think about this or what he should do.

**tl;dr:** My husband made a new female friend that they always chat together and play games together. I feel they are a bit too close, although they say they are only friends. I try to understand their relationship but still feels sad and lonely occasionally."
4tddda,7,2016-07-18,"Promoted to Shift Supervisor, but only if I commit to a full year?",zacharyfett,starbucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/4tddda/promoted_to_shift_supervisor_but_only_if_i_commit/,"Long story short, I have been a partner for about 1.5 years. Moved to a new state, new city, and a new store about 6 months ago. The transition was smooth and I genuinely like my store and my fellow partners. But it's a high volume store in a difficult part of town, so the turnover rate tends to be pretty high. Lately, a lot of partners have been transferring/leaving the company, most importantly about half the shift supervisors since when I started just this past January.

So in need of help, my SM offered me a promotion to Shift Supervisor. I said I'd think about it. While Starbucks has been a great company to work for in the interim, I am not sure what my future holds. I didn't move my life across the country solely to stay with the company (I moved to get closer to my dream career - which is not coffee related), but if it happens that way, I'm okay with that.

I thought about it and decided sure - why not go for a shift position - I'd get almost guaranteed hours and a nice bump in wages which will help me survive out in the big city. I can pursue my dream on my own time and move up in the company as a back up plan. My SM knows why I came out here and has been cool with everything - even with me interning at a company in my field two days out of the week. Until now.

When I told my SM I accept, he backtracked and told me the job was mine only if I committed to staying with the store/company for minimum of one year (he came down from two years after I questioned him). He cited the many departures as of late as giving him pause to hire anybody new. Even though the other shifts have been recently overworked, tired, and upset at all the recent changes in the company, he claims that he is not in a rush and will not hire anybody new if I don't accept the position. He gave me some more time to think about it.

Even with the disappointing trajectory of the company, I still like my job. It enables me to pursue my goals, but just barely - like skin of my teeth barely. I want to take the promotion, but a lot of red flags started to go off when he said he needs a minimum of a one year commitment. Is that even legal? (I gather no.) Whose to say 6 months from now an opportunity falls in my lap, what am I supposed to do, not take it??? That's bull. 

I don't know. I've never heard of something like this happening. It didn't seem right and I figured I get you all's opinion. Like I said, I want to accept the position and plan to quit my internship to have open availability to help the store out in my new role - but I have to look out for myself and will not stop trying to pursue my goals in the meantime. That may mean applying for potential opportunities outside of Sbux. It just seems unreasonable and plainly - unethical - to offer me a promotion only to then back me up against a corner and dangle the position contingent upon an oral time commitment. 

Thoughts???"

The issue is I'm doing the front-end engineering of a web application, and some really cool stuff happens at the back end. So as I describe the project, I might end up making the front end part (which is very innovative in itself) sound too simple, and the back end more interesting. I'm great at underplaying my work...

Also, the audience will be a mix of people who know what the project is about, and who have no idea who I am. But all of them have more dev experience than I do. 

What's the general approach to this kind of presentation? 

In what order do I proceed? Like, intro to the project, high level description? Walk through the code? (like literally show the code?) Jokes/Ice breaker? Demo of app. I'm pretty lost.


Any help/direction would be appreciated."

I am currently working at a Big Four company in LA as a Security Consultant. I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona as a CIS major. 

This school itself as a CIS degree has a great reputation in Cyber Security and a lot of grads become very marketable after graduating through internships, CCDC, and clubs.

I am happy about what I did so far in my career, as I know that Cyber Security isn't an easy field to break into, and I managed to get in without going through the years of being at a help desk or technician.

So at this point, I'm wondering how I can advance my career and (not to sound greedy or cocky) maximize the money I can earn. I am making a decent living as a single male, but where do I go from here? Should I work on getting my Masters in CIS so that more opportunities open up, or get my CISSP?

Any knowledge would be very helpful :). Thank you cscareerquestions!"

After 5 years of that, I graduated with an associates degree in computer IT and a high school diploma. I've been working in ""IT related fields"" since I was 16. My last job was an awesome paid internship with the government. I moved in with my boyfriend and started working on my bachelors in Computer Science. I thought we were going to get married and so on and so forth. Then it all changed last year...
My boyfriend ended up cheating on me so I left and moved back in with my mom. I'm paying my own way through college and get grants, but I wasn't accepted for a grant this semester, so guess what? I can't go to school! My internship ended and I couldn't find another job in my field in this small town, so I now work at a gas station for minimum wage. I broke down crying at work yesterday because I feel so lost and out of place. I hate my job and living with my mom at 22. Dont get me wrong, I love my mom, but I'm such an independent person and this is just killing me. I don't even know where to start to move forward. To make it worse, I'm constantly having anxiety attacks because of all the stress. My friends have all moved away, got married and/or had kids...but I'm just so alone and stuck...."

Been a longtime lurker and am starting to consider getting out of the US. I've been out of school for a year working in Seattle as a firmware engineer and I figured I'd need another 2 years or so to have enough experience under my belt (maybe more?)

Which countries would be looking for firmware engineers? Should I start looking into more high-level software skills that would be more applicable? Right now I'm working mostly on microcontrollers and writing in C. But I'm willing to spend the next couple of years to add more to my skill set if that would help.

I'm an outdoorsman so I'd love to be in a place where I could escape into the wilderness on the weekends. Also would like a better work-life balance than in the US (more vacation time would be great).

After reading a fair number of posts, it seems as though Scandinavia isn't looking for foreign workers, Estonia is looking for high-level software devs, NZ and AUS don't have big engineering markets, and the UK, Switzerland, and Germany would be my best bets. I lived in Switzerland for 6 months working as a medical device intern, but ran into a lot of obstacles (homeless for 1 month, xenophobia, etc), so I'm not sure if it would be a great fit (beautiful country though).

Another thought is to switch careers entirely, but I want to see if I can use my current experience before resorting to that.

Any advice would be great! Thanks

They spent an inordinate amount of time in season 8 attempting to build up those characters, especially in the beginning of the season. 

Yeah I guess they did bring Denise back (better known as Jane from happy endings, an infinitely better and more likable character) but I thought they were setting up katey to be mini elliot and that one glasses dude to be a more dopey looking (but surprisingly sharper) the todd and Sonny to be a... well actually I dunno, maybe jd? I just liked her because she was cute and sweet, which was refreshing in comparison to the snarky sarcastic riff-raff. 

But most importantly of all, they brought back the famous Jett Jackson! I loved watching that show as a kid, and to see the actor again playing Derek is just perfect. Can't believe we never see him again, instead they replace him with who, the ever annoying Franco brother of James? Or the white dude who looks like the drug addict that tried to scam elliot out of meds. That always bothered me since I thought we were going to see him again if they were doing a spinoff on the interns. 

And all this is IF they were going to do a spinoff at all, since in general the interns are usually better in small bursts, like Lonnie."

I've finished my intro classes and a data structures class, and am going to be taking a machine learning course in the fall. I have just began some work on my personal website (HTML, CSS JavaScript/jQuery), I'm working on an Android app (Java, PHP, SQL), I'm attempting to learn iOS dev and a few other languages/implementations of code/getting my lingo down, and I'm studying internship questions for next summer already. 

I feel like I'm doing a lot. I spend like 3-4 hours a day doing CS-related stuff on weekdays and like 5-6 or more on weekends. Yet, I see posts on here of other undergrads with their 5 Android/iOS apps, 7 web apps, 100 contributions, and what feels like an incomprehensible amount of research. 

I'm trying as best I can to do whatever I can to get a solid internship going into my junior year. I love CS, and especially love working on my Android app (which is really as personal a project as it gets, it's pretty messy). I just don't know how everyone else seems to do so much more, and this worries me when it comes to internships/careers. 

Where do you people make the time to do all of this stuff?

I've recently acquired an associates degree in Network Security. Supplementing the degree I have, I'm also doing a part time internship as a desk-side technician. By the way it looks, the company at which I'm currently interning has no intention of hiring me as they don't have any positions that need filled, as I have already inquired. By the time the internship is over, I'll have close to about a years worth experience under my belt. So my question is does anyone more experienced have some advice as to what the next best step to take is? I know in the realm of IT there are varying opinions on school/certification and vice versa, as well as how much experience is required in order to meet your personal goals. I personally have found that employers in this field are placing more emphasis on experience and certification as opposed to a bachelors or masters degree on a piece of paper that ""says you can"". 

The courses I've taken in my field of study, just to name few:

CCNA 1-4 and Security 
Linux Administration I and II 
Microsoft Server 2012 R2 Courses 1-3 
Ethical Hacking I and II
VMware Virtualization I and II

Some of the certs I'm currently working on obtaining are LPIC, CCNA, and MCSA. I've been told by my professors that those certifications would be good to obtain because they would help me reach my end goal to become a Systems Administrator as well as make me more employable with less education. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated!

The people here answer my questions in a very respectful, non sugar coating, but still helpful way and it's immensely helpful. Sorry if I ask too much and seem needy ._.

Anyway, I have a dilemma that pertains to my near future plans. So basically I have two decisions to make. My boss at my internship wants me to work full time instead of the part time I work now. It pays 16 an hour and the money sounds really nice (I live at home, mother is VERY supportive, I pay rent but the number is VERY reasonable, I can save, ""easy life(not really but trying to give as much info as possible)"" Working full time would net me a nice boost to my paycheck.

The thing is I want to go back to school to obtain my bachelors degree and full time work and school is something I KNOW I can't handle. Thus I kind of want to stay part time so that I can take even 2-3 classes a semester and obtain my degree while gaining more IT intern/help desk experience.

I don't know which option is the best for me and both my immediate and extended futures. Advice?

PS: Are there any IT jobs that pay well and are strictly 9-5 with non mandatory, extremely minimal time over that?"

I can't do an internship because of ageism (this country is no silicon valley), but my age is still OK for a regular job. The problem is, companies here require the experience up-front because they don't want to spend any money training new devs, no matter how promising they might look. So my only chance is to learn by myself, as I've done in the past for every technology I've worked with.

Do you think it is feasible to spend a few months studying and coding samples and exercises? Or is this something you need to learn in-house, due to expensive server licenses/tools?


I was thinking on buying the most important books on modern JavaEE and maybe do some online courses.  But apparently for JavaEE the information is too spread and often outdated. What should I learn to be knowledgeable in both modern and well-stablished standards? 

Should I go for .NET instead? At first glance it looks like it would be less stuff to study, and information is more concentrated and up to date."

Okay, so we have Andy, the person Angela cheated on the day he proposed to her, who obviously had to live through something horrible as he went to work everyday seeing both Dwight and Angela. A person who was the sweetest, most puppy-dog character on the show.

And then there's Erin, who suffered through a relationship with Gabe, until Pam said WTF girl break up with him. And Erin was still the sweetest person on earth, who basically couldn't hurt a fly. She's almost naive with how trusting she is, so who's her match? fuckin ANdy right? like he had anger management issues, but inside he was the nicest person on earth (which is such an epic combo in a character.) And that's what made them so perfect for eachother. They were the only two people who deserved eachother. 

So that's what happens.

And then Steve Carell fucking leaves and they decide to make Andy boss. And that's all good whatever, till Ed Helms leaves to film a god-awful what-is-wrong-with-you-people sequel to Hangover 2.

And for some reason this puppy dog neglects his relationship??? the fuck???? he didn't email someone he truly loved in his giant heart i mean. like they explained that he had wifi n shit. and erin's like ""he emailed me 4 times"" BULLSHIT 

ANDY BERNARD IS THE SWEETEST, MOST LOVABLE PERSON ON THE SHOW. HHOW DARE YOU. AFTER GETTING HURT BY SATAN (ANGELA), ANDY DESERVES TO BE HAPPY. 

And so does Erin. She is not the type of character who goes after an intern when she gets lonely. Yet I had to endure her ""friendship"" with the most bland piece of shit character Pete.

So yeah, I'm a first generation Asian American and obviously my parents aren't going to understand the things that NORMAL American teens do. I have a fucking 8 oclock curfew, unless I'm at work (the restaurant closes at 10pm but I always end up getting 500000 missed calls and angry texts from them at 9 begging me to get my ass home and I always end up having to give my tables to another server and losing all potential tips...wonderful) then, of course, the second I get home they fucking try to sniff me out for pot or alcohol and interrogate me about literally everything. I'm not allowed to hang out with anyone they dont know (which is hard because they only know 2 of my friends and I always end up having to sneak around and have those people cover for me) and even then, I'd be lucky to be able to stay out until 8. 
Dating is obviously impossible, the guy has to be ""their idea of perfect"" which is a wealthy, successful white or asian guy who is no more than one year older than me and he has to come over to meet my parents so they can interrogate him. I've kept all my relationships fpr the past 3 years a secret and said I was ""hanging out with friends"" whenever I went out on a date or something. My current boyfriend is a 22 year old hispanic guy going to culinary school, so clearly they would never be accepting of that and I have to sneak around with him, which is really annoying because we both want to take things further. 
Oh, and they want to force me to quit my job before I start college in a month because it will ""get in the way of my studies"". My job is the only thing keeping me sane right now because otherwise I just sit at home all day like the prisoner that I am. They didnt let me dorm because ""college kids who dorm do drugs"" so I'm stuck with them until I'm fucking 40 and lose the will to live. 
I got offered an internship in NYC (which is only a half hour away from me) which is a once in a lifetime opportunity and could really help with my career goals (journalism) and of course, they refused to let me take it because ""I can't go that far away without adult supervision""...fucking bullshit. 
About a month ago, I was at the mall with my boyfriend and a couple of other friends. They were all heading over to my friend's house afterwards (at 9pm) to just hang out and I was like ""my parents will literally kill me so I'm just gonna take an uber home"" and everyone started giving me weird looks and ""what the fuck, you're 18"". That was when I decided I had enough of this bullshit so I texted my parents saying I was sleeping over at a friend's house and would come back home the next afternoon. Phone died shortly after, so I couldnt even see or think about their follow up questions and other angry texts. 
I was too scared to come home the next morning because I was positive they would chain me to the radiator until I eventually die at 30 because I dont go out but the empath in me knew that they were scared half to death and felt horrible about doing that to them. My original plan was to crash with some friends until I find a place of my own (have plenty of money saved up so that isnt even an issue) but I ended up coming home anyways because my phone was dead and I had no way of telling them I was still alive. Of course I got bitched at when I got home, they took my car, and I was grounded for a month. I was planning on packing my bags, leaving them a note, and moving out the next day but I was too scared becausd I still care about them and don't want to hurt them. I ended up enduring the grounding, got my car back a month later, and everything was back to normal but theyre still strict as fuck. I dont know what to do at this point because they're not lettig me grow up and live my life. Like I said, I feel like a fucking prisoner here and I don't know what to do. There's no way they would ever be more lenient with me as long as I'm living under their roof, but theyre not letting me move the fuck out already. I'm 18 and I feel like I'm fucking 70 because I just sit at home all day and watch netflix with my cat. I've tried to have logical adult to adult conversations with them but it always ends the same way: before I can even say three words they start crying and yelling and threatening to lock me up or some shit, and then they try to buy me over with expensive clothes and whatnot like ""are you really going to treat us like garbage after all that we BOUGHT you???"" They won't listen to logic and I am just about to give up all hope because there's no convincing them now. What would be the most reasonable thing to do in this situation?"

I was going to community college and dealing with severe depression. I felt like all of my friends were moving on with their lives away at other schools while I was stuck at home. I eventually started talking to a girl who I met through a mutual friend. She went to a school across the country but she planned to come to my area for a summer internship. I transferred schools and life was going great. We got very close and developed feelings for each other. When she finally came here we went on several dates and we made things official. We visited each other about once a month, and we waited six months before having sex when we told each other that we loved one another. We were each others first love and we continued dating for two years. She stayed at my house the next summer while she was here for another internship. We grew incredibly close, and made future plans together. We planned to move in together after college and she always wanted to move to my city ever since she was young. We talked about marriage and even a family together. 
     Several weeks before her graduation we got into several small fights. We never fought often and there was no cheating on either side. She proposed a break as she realized she was not happy with the relationship suddenly. She made up many BS reasons as to why and said that I would never change. I sent her letters and care packages and did everything I could to get her back, but nothing worked. A week after she started the break, she contacted me and said she couldn't stop crying but she had to do what was best. After this every contact we had, she was mean and cruel. She said she was so much happier and loved being able to go on dates with other guys. She also couldn't even call me to officially end things. My depression came back hard. I thought she was the one and everyone always told me that she was perfect for me. The day before her graduation, she told me that she just decided to move to anther city far away instead of moving here.
     After one month of no contact she texted me ""I never want to make things harder for you and Im sorry if this does, but I really hope you're doing well and everything is ok"". I responded two days later with a simple ""Thank You"". It has been almost a month since then and things are not better. She deleted only some of our pictures online and never likes my pictures anymore. She continues to like and comment on all of my friends pictures though, and her friends do the same with mine. She liked one of my pictures once the morning after posting it but then unliked it the next day. She said that she thought we were in two different stages in life and that I'm in the college party stage and she's in the professional stage, yet she gets trashed with random guys every weekend. She was never that kind of person and has never been one to sleep around. For a month she liked and reblogged all of my tumblr posts but then stopped that as well. She posted so many conflicting things saying that she wants to be single but then dates other guys, or that she let her relationship become her whole life and misses who she lost but then never contacts me. I've stopped checking all of that as it only made me sad. 
     Im left heartbroken and lonely. I can't stop thinking about her. I don't want to get back together with her because I've seen a side of her that I hate, but I dont want her to be gone from my life forever. We were best friends. I know only time will help and that eventually I will find love again, but none of that feels true. My self esteem is at an all time low and I feel like she thinks every guy is better than me because she found so many to go on dates with just weeks after moving to a new city. I am trying to let go and move on, but I just don't know how. I can't stop wondering if she misses me, or cares about me, or even thinks about me. She told me she does months ago, but her actions say otherwise. I hate her and love her at the same time. I want to cut her out but also keep her close. I don't know what to do.

4tgbq2,1,2016-07-18,[NeedAdvice] Trying to structure two months of summer break,Kashi_and_friends,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/4tgbq2/needadvice_trying_to_structure_two_months_of/,"Hello

At my university you have two months of summer break, which just started. As every year I have a ton of things written down during the semester which I want to do. And after one week of break time I noticed that the same thing as last year is happening. I get very little of it done.  
So this time I want to be proactive. I don't want to look back at the beginning of the new semester and think ""that is it?"". I thought I could do this here so I can get some input on how you structure larger amounts of free time.
__________________________________________
Things I have to do:  

* **Work** - I don't know how much work will come up (work on a being needed basis as an intern) probably not that much until mid-August, since people are on vacation. I expect maybe *10hrs/week* from then on.
* **Master's Thesis** - Waiting for clarification of next steps from advisor. Potential for endless work is there, I can schedule to do it when I want basically. I expect maybe *80-100hrs in total*, I guess. Really hard to gauge but I would not do more than max 5hrs on one day because more would be really tiring due to the nature of the tasks at hand.
* **Administrative things** - there are things that need to be planned for the upcoming semester. In itself not that large of a task but I can take long to make decisions. Estimate *10-15hrs*

Things I want to do in terms of self-improvement and learning:

* Continue learning a **Russian** on my own. Doing this with duolinguo and a book I bought, currently. Started in February and I think I am making some progress.
* Going through a **learning program relevant to my studies**. Doing this will help me greatly in the licensing exams and makes me feel more confident for next semester. Also it is really interesting. (I love my field)
* **Sport**. Get body in shape, I want to get a workout routine that I can follow in more stressful times too. Also swimming and running.
* watch a **lecture series on a topic outside of my field** - just because it is fun, I thought I could do that when eating and in the evening when too tired
* and the old ""I wanna write a book"". I have two ideas, decided for which one to tackle first, but I don't really know how to approach **writing** a book.
* **reading** I want to finish ""Deep Work"" and also have a lot of other things on my reading list. Including a book where the author expects some kind of feedback from me.
* **codecademy** I do this more whenever I feel like it. No pressure there, but I'd like to get some basics. 
* improve **habits**. I just finished the book ""The power of habits"" and want to implement some of the things I've learned. And I thought the summer would be a great time to ingrain some new habits.

Then I have another list of things I want to do for fun. Because it is summer break :)
_____________________________________________
That already helped to write it down in a more concise manner than my list.

The problem is I often end up going back and forth because I want to do everything at the same time. So, where do I go from here? I though of maybe making a schedule with the goal of being done with anything work/productivity at 6pm, so I have every evening off to do fun stuff (although lots of the improvement stuff is also fun).   
Or pick a few goals every day and only focus on them.   

Now for the schedule, would you suggest doing a day a task. For example: Monday Russian, Tuesday learning program etc. Or mix it up do get a daily dose of everything?

I already have a habit of tracking my productive time in place (using the app atimelogger and a spreadsheet, been doing this for over a year). But I am unsure of which amount of hours for each goal to aim for. I don't want to feel bad for days with &lt;4hrs but I am kinda conditioned to.  
I know setting goals is very important but I am notoriously bad at it...

Another thing that I plan to do is block reddit and other sites again during the day, maybe from 23:00 to 18:00.

Well, thanks for reading and I am happy about any input and I'd love to read your summer plans if you have any, to get some inspiration :)

Greetings,  
- Kashi
_____________________________________________________

**tl;dr and questions**  

I wanna do too many things. 

* How do you structure your large amounts of free time?
* What do you think is better - big chunks or a bit of everything ever day?
* How do you prevent getting distracted and the thought of ""I have three days to do this, I have plenty of time"" ?

Recently I was accepted and felt really excited about it, but now, after moving abroad (first time for me to live outside home) I cannot sleep during nights. I wake up constantly, I feel like my sleep is very shallow.

The situation is like this since 2 weeks already. Of course I'm extremely unproductive at work, even talking to team members is hard for me (my English is not very fluent), not to mention writing code.
I started taking medication few days ago (Zolpidem) which makes things a bit better, but there's a risk I will get addicted.

So my options are:

1. Resign and go back home, which would be a terrible experience for me, and would prevent me from doing other things like studying abroad etc.

2. Continue the internship despite being completely unproductive, also possibly damaging my health.

3. Anything else?

What would you do?


PS. I'm following all the common advice from the web but nothing works."

I'm an introverted gal but I'm very detail oriented and autonomous. I can pick up new skills quickly with little supervision. My two main interests are the digital arts and data entry work.    



**Digital Arts:**   
I'm proficient at Adobe Creative Suite and Microsoft Word. I also know a little bit of Autodesk Maya. I'm willing to learn any required software or hardware on the job. I'm looking to get my foot in the door into the animation industry. Not just film, but motion graphics, medical illustration, advertising, etc. I'll scrub the floors of a studio if that's what it takes. I have a Bachelor's in Fine Arts and I've done internships in motion graphics, medical animation and whiteboard animation. I have my own laptop and Wacom tablet so working from home is doable.  



**Data Entry:**  
My typing speed is 60 WPM and I'm a stickler for spelling and grammar. I've done work through temp agencies in the past and have often been asked back to work for the same companies. I also have ten years of customer service in the past in various industries (retail, food, laundromat, museums, conventions) so I'm used to dealing with the good and the bad from the general public. I'm level headed and very strategic, and thrive most in a back office setting. In the past, I've transcribed medical research interviews and processed claims for a bank during a major credit card breach.  


I'm available to work ASAP, so please PM me if you're interested! I can forward you my resume and my website/portfolio there. Thank you! "

I'm not going to sugar coat this. There are good people but also bad people everywhere and there are a lot of them in CS.
They are the ones that are pretentious, mean, rude, sexist, and more and the best policy is to ignore them. Don't associate with them because you become more like them and that's when you give them power. I graduated last year and I honestly never want to meet certain people in this department again. I had to watch my girl friends get picked on in classes and harrassed, my male friends accused of harrassment, and my male and female friends shit on for not getting to work at the so called 'good internships'. sexism is thriving but so is straight up being an ass. the department NEEDS to address this. It got so bad to a point where a large number of my friends and myself did not want to spend time in Siebel anymore because it just doesn't feel like a safe place.

There are so many good people but the bad ones are so loud. recently, acm has become a specific hotbed of people like this. There is a vocal minority of people that do things just to look cool in front of others but don't actually do anything themselves except for a couple truly amazing individuals. There are good and bad eggs but the bad eggs tend to flock to ACM from what I have seen. They cheated, spread rumors, talk themselves up, and talk shit about their friensd just to bring people around them down when we should be trying to do everything to build each other up. based on what i heard from a friend that stuck with ACM, some even got banned from their office by the department for going too overboard. i've seen a lot of people fall into this crowd and become similar types of people and that makes me sad. I'm ashamed to call those people Illini when there are so many good people in the department ....

Just look at HackIllinois for example.... They supposedly made a huge mess and didn't clean it up but I remember walking down the halls and seeing a couple diligent members of ACM/Hackillinois cleaning until the early hours of the morning....
Yeah, don't get me wrong there's a bunch of jerks and mean people in ACM and in the CS department in general but please just don't pay mind to them and make them aware that their attitudes are unwarranted, unwanted, and intolerable.

Bullying is defined by the recipient, not the speaker!!!!!! The people around you determine what is ok behavior and if they ask you to stop, you stop immediately. Telling someone to 'stop being a little bitch' or anything of the sort is not conducive to the community. That's too often just used as an excuse for people to justify bullying. you don't udnerstand anyone else so don't pretend that you have the right to talk down to them. 

Be kind to one another because it costs nothing to you but means everything to everyone else.

But then again who am I to talk, i'm old and already graduated...

Sincerely,
-Former Senior, peace out UIUC"

I just found out last week, so barely 5 weeks pregnant and I test positive at urgent care. My nurse freaks out, as I just told her 3 minutes prior I have an IUD. Doctor recommends I speak with an obgyn, as his IUD experience is lacking so the nurse personally suggests a clinic as I'm new to town.

Ok I call the obgyn office and tell them everything and after some back and forth they send me to the ER. Oh man. I call my boyfriend and get to tell him ""hey I'm pregnant, and I'm headed to ER, you should probably meet me here."" I explain what ectopic is and why they think mine is. It's a high stress no time to be anything but scared situation.

Ok 5 hours later they find a sac in my uterus, take the IUD out (it was sitting down in my cervix) and tell me congrats your pregnant. I get let go and finally get some dinner. I had only ate a cliff bar that day!

Then next day I have an obgyn appt. She tells me the sac was empty, but it's still early. However, that means I'm not cleared for an ectopic. So I have another ultrasound two days later to be sure. The tech tells me she sees a yolk sac and I seem to be 5 weeks ish. My doctor confirms, and says were in the clear, it's not ectopic. Now I need to decide what to do.

Now, this wasn't planned, my BC very obviously failed here, however I'm really warming up to the idea of a baby. I'm about 6 weeks. I don't want to get too excited as something could still happen, but is it too early to start planning around having a baby in March? I've been thinking how I should plan an internship and when I should transfer from community college to university. What do you guys think? Should I slow it down here or do I need to be making these kinds of plans? Also I feel like I'm scared if i get really excited them something happens it will be so much more hurtful then if I don't let myself get so excited.

Tl;dr, it's pretty early to be planning a life around the baby but I'm doing it anyways. Input?"
4thkze,1,2016-07-18,Getting a PhD with Incomplete Legal Education,TheNightmareChild92,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/4thkze/getting_a_phd_with_incomplete_legal_education/,"Hello all, 

Last January, I took a leave of absence from a top-10 law school after finishing my third semester. After a lot of contemplation, I’m giving serious consideration toward getting a Ph.D. in political science – specifically focusing in comparative politics.  My basic question is this: should I complete my legal education before pursuing it? Below are specifics about my situation: 

In college, I graduated with a 4.0 GPA, both in my majors (political science and history) and cumulatively. I did internships in federal and state government. I got some limited research experience by doing a senior thesis, but my relatively little-known college didn’t provide opportunities for faculty research assistantships, presenting at conferences, or even a very strong methodology resource. During my senior year, I was torn between pursuing my PhD or getting a law degree. Ultimately – and somewhat shamefully – I regretfully chose what I thought would be the more practical, if slightly less altruistic, option. (Regardless, I took the GRE, but without studying, I got a 164 on the math and verbal sections. I plan on taking it again, this time with some proper preparation.) 

After 2.5 semesters of law school, I concluded the experience wasn’t for me, as I don’t want to work in a legal or even quasi-legal position in the long-term. Then, when a serious medical event compromised my final exam period, the school refused to reschedule my exams, and my previously adequate GPA (~3.3ish) is now about a 3.0. If I had stayed a fourth semester, I would’ve additionally acquired my first student loan debt, as my scholarship amounts diminish each year.  At that point, I would’ve had to start paying tuition, and would’ve ended up with ~$25K in debt, poor to middling grades, no career, and a degree that doesn’t line up with any academic interests. So, having no debt, it was at this point I decided to take a leave of absence. By that point, being in law school had made me anxious, paranoid, and sick – all without any benefit or upside. I have no intent on drawing upon my legal education in selecting a PhD specialization. While my law school does encourage JD/PhD programs, there is a vast disparity in the ranking between them. The JD is a top 10, but the PhD is roughly top 40. I’d like to see, if possible, whether or not I am in a position to do any better. 

Here’s the thing – since I regret not pursuing a PhD, I’m willing to do nearly anything to get into a good grad school – including finishing my law degree and waiting to apply for the PhD in 2017 if it’d help my chances. Right after leaving law school, I got a stopgap position in local government that pays enough to cover any law school debt should I return. Thus, my concerns about returning to law school are not so much financially motivated – but academically. Given the very tight curve in law school coursework, I can probably only pull up my law school GPA to a 3.2 or maybe a 3.3. Although, I could take some classes with the university’s political science department and try to focus my legal coursework on international law or policy matters. I don’t have to be concerned about letters of recommendation, as I have three very supportive professors from college who I’ve worked with on my senior thesis who are happy to write them. 

In sum, I’m concerned about the impact my legal education – finished or unfinished – would have on my PhD application. Ignoring issues of dissertation topics/specializations for now, would it be help my chances to finish my law degree (or would it hurt my chances if I didn’t finish)? Could my law school GPA have a negative impact, even if my undergrad political science GPA is comparatively higher? Would even completing the law degree somehow cause PhD admissions committees to view my application with skepticism? If anyone could provide any sort of insight as to how I should go forward, I’d be very appreciative. Thanks in advance. "

Help?",gumption0424,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4thskp/notforprofit_cant_afford_to_pay_me_for_lots_of/,"I work for a non-profit entertainment festival. I did an unpaid internship with them, and was then offered an hourly job once that was concluded. It's a great place and I feel as if it is a great ""bridge job"" into a true career, seeing as it is in my field. However, I don't see myself there forever.

One problem, however: I am required to do work for free VERY frequently. I've had the job for months now and I am required to vet and review entertainment for the job on my own time. This takes up A LOT of time. On top of this, once the entertainment is selected for the festival, I am made to do a write-up for it, which takes up even more time. ADDITIONALLY, I am made to be on call to answer emails and fix other problems all the time, lest my superiors get upset with me. I am unpaid for this as well. It's as if I am constantly working.

This is about 15 extra hours per week on top of the 40 hours per week I already work. This is unmanageable for me, both mentally and financially. It takes a substantial toll on my well being.

I am told by my bosses that they cannot afford to pay me for this extra work. I initially verbally agreed to do the extra work, because I am really hoping to get a good reference from these people once I leave the job so that I can break out into an actual career (I'm a recent college graduate). This work (except the emailing) is additionally done by volunteers, so I am hesitant to ask to be paid. I am also hesitant because they are my only connection into my desired career path right now. 

I am at my wit's end. They are good to me otherwise, but I can't keep going like this. The festival inches closer and closer with each passing day, and more work keeps getting dropped on me.

Please help me; I'm exhausted and stressed out beyond all belief. Thank you in advance for your responses.

I know I'm largely to blame, but I'm going into P4 year of pharmacy school and have little work experience (besides IPPE's and some APPE's). Going into my P3 year, I called a bunch of pharmacies, and even had an interview with a retail pharmacy by my house. Due to budgeting, they weren't able to hire me and a bunch of other pharmacies in my area didn't have any openings. I ended up getting a volunteering position at a local hospital pharmacy for the year, hoping to gain some experience and possibly be hired as an intern at the end of the school year (that's how a few people I know got hired there). A few months after I started volunteering, a couple of retail stores I applied to even called me, but since I already committed to volunteering, I apologized/thanked them and told them I had found another job. Of course when it came time for hiring hospital interns this summer, they said they felt I was too far along in school to hire and now I'm back at square one :/ I've been feeling pretty down about it lately since I really got my hopes up, and I'm scared I've really messed up my chances of ever finding a good job. If I didn't hold on so tightly to volunteering, I probably could have already had a steady retail job. I've called a few pharmacies this weekend, all who either had me send a resume or said they MIGHT have some openings at the end of the summer. One small independent I called told me to come in later in the week to talk. I'm strongly considering accepting a job if they offer (beggars can't be choosers), but I'm wondering if I should keep exploring my options and try to get a job with a chain pharmacy to have more job prospects post-graduation? Is there really any chance of me getting an intern job with a major chain this late into school? Many of the chains I called said they might have jobs at the end of summer, but there's really no guarantees. I know my age might make them a little hesitant as well. Any and all advice is appreciated."

This has changed. I had to make a new account because what I'm about to say would be slanderous in my circle of friends and family.

I just can't stand the Democratic Party anymore! They've become a bunch of cry babies that want to stick everyone in their little box of labels. They've halted any progress we've made on race and gender and turned America into a nation of shame.

I'm all for opportunity and a better life for everyone. I support movements that give people of all nationalities and gender a voice. I don't care what bathroom you use in Target. I do believe we have to do something about Carbon emissions. I refuse to be expected to do something because of labels. Am I supposed to be ashamed because I worked hard my whole life and happen to be white? Are my friends who aren't white supposed to be ashamed because they aren't ""black enough""? Everyone looks so damn confused! The other day I spoke with my coworker and he flat out said ""Seeing what's happening lately makes me feel ashamed to be black"". How terrible that we have to feel this way! That it's all come down to us having some label that defines who we are. Nevermind my coworker is a hard worker and stayed out of trouble growing up. No police officer ever had a reason to shoot him because he wasn't looking for trouble.

I have some of friends telling me ""You gotta vote for Hillary! She's better than Trump!"". I'm not so sure about that. I don't agree with everything Trump says, but the message is there and it's hopeful and proud. I don't hear about me having ""White privilege"", what do these assholes know about my privilege? They are protesting in their sweet college campuses how much privilege I had, while I busted my ass for 5+ years studying days and working nights to get my college education. Really?!

I have a family and a good paying job to show for my work. I manage people of all backgrounds and treat them with respect. If they work hard, I have their back. It's as simple as that. Don't come into my company thinking you're going to get special treatment because your daddy is an ivy-leager or the NAACP is sponsoring you internship. If you're a bum you're going to get kicked out regardless of your genetic makeup!

I voted for Obama. I think he did an okay job at first, but these last couple of years he showed no backbone. He never stood behind people like me and said ""Thank you for being a good American"". Instead, there they are, both Hillary and Obama, making fucking excuses for cop killers and tarnishing the good name of anyone that's done anything good. ""We don't know the motives of these killers"" Obama said, how convincing! All while they both cash their fat paychecks from Wall Street quarterly and claim they are looking out for us.

As I said, I'm sick of it!

Mr. Trump.. You were the only one on the stage that had the guts to stand behind law enforcement. You didn't shame us because of our skin color. You didn't run to Wall Street to get more money. You might not be right about everything, but you believe in America. That is something I stopped seeing the Democrats do years ago.

My vote is for Trump! I hope he crushes the Democrats and shows them that we're sick of their smug knowing smiles because they tried to buy the presidency long before the race started. "

I am looking to combine a few interests together and I think now is the time to start looking. I don't really know where to look and would like some pointers. 

I am currently a Level 1 Tech/Help desk and have been for about a year. I took this as an internship and it developed into full time position. The pay hasn't increased with the responsibility and time escalation, and there isn't too much room for advancement in the near future. I can move about 30 minutes and make double my current hourly pay, but Help Desk isn't really where I see myself forever so I am looking for ideas. I don't mind the work, but it isn't...engaging? 

I have an undergrad in Mathematics/Stats and about 2 semesters of Grad School(CS) under my belt. Unfortunately, I dropped school for work as I couldn't justify more debt when my job was helping my stay somewhat afloat.Both were demanding more of my attention than I thought I could handle. I regret leaving school as I really enjoyed my programming courses and was looking forward to some of the other courses ahead, but I accept the choice I made. 

Anyways, with a Math background, interest in programming with *some* knowledge of Java/JavaScript, and experience in IT ; are there any careers that kind of combine those? I have thought about DBAs but I don't know much about that field. I have setup a lunch with a DBA soon to learn more, but it keeps getting pushed back (very understandably). 

tl;dr: I like working in IT, but would like to leave help desk if possible. I have a math background and like the programming courses I took in college. Any way to combine these? Thanks!"
4ticll,3,2016-07-18,Getting a PhD with Incomplete Legal Education,TheNightmareChild92,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/4ticll/getting_a_phd_with_incomplete_legal_education/,"Hello all, 

Last January, I took a leave of absence from a top-10 law school after finishing my third semester. After a lot of contemplation, I’m giving serious consideration toward getting a Ph.D. in political science – specifically focusing in comparative politics.  My basic question is this: should I complete my legal education before pursuing it? Below are specifics about my situation: 

In college, I graduated with a 4.0 GPA, both in my majors (political science and history) and cumulatively. I did internships in federal and state government. I got some limited research experience by doing a senior thesis, but my relatively little-known college didn’t provide opportunities for faculty research assistantships, presenting at conferences, or even a very strong methodology resource. During my senior year, I was torn between pursuing my PhD or getting a law degree. Ultimately – and somewhat shamefully – I regretfully chose what I thought would be the more practical, if slightly less altruistic, option. (Regardless, I took the GRE, but without studying, I got a 164 on the math and verbal sections and a 5.0 in analytical writing. I plan on taking it again, this time with some proper preparation.) 

After 2.5 semesters of law school, I concluded the experience wasn’t for me, as I don’t want to work in a legal or even quasi-legal position in the long-term. Then, when a serious medical event compromised my final exam period, the school refused to reschedule my exams, and my previously adequate GPA (~3.3ish) is now about a 3.0. If I had stayed a fourth semester, I would’ve additionally acquired my first student loan debt, as my scholarship amounts diminish each year.  At that point, I would’ve had to start paying tuition, and would’ve ended up with ~$25K in debt, poor to middling grades, no career, and a degree that doesn’t line up with any academic interests. So, having no debt, it was at this point I decided to take a leave of absence. By that point, being in law school had made me anxious, paranoid, and sick – all without any benefit or upside. I have no intent on drawing upon my legal education in selecting a PhD specialization. While my law school does encourage JD/PhD programs, there is a vast disparity in the ranking between them. The JD is a top 10, but the PhD is roughly top 40. I’d like to see, if possible, whether or not I am in a position to do any better. 

Here’s the thing – since I regret not pursuing a PhD, I’m willing to do nearly anything to get into a good grad school – including finishing my law degree and waiting to apply for the PhD in 2017 if it’d help my chances. Right after leaving law school, I got a stopgap position in local government that pays enough to cover any law school debt should I return. Thus, my concerns about returning to law school are not so much financially motivated – but academically. Given the very tight curve in law school coursework, I can probably only pull up my law school GPA to a 3.2 or maybe a 3.3. Although, I could take some classes with the university’s political science department and try to focus my legal coursework on international law or policy matters. I don’t have to be concerned about letters of recommendation, as I have three very supportive professors from college who I’ve worked with on my senior thesis who are happy to write them. 

In sum, I’m concerned about the impact my legal education – finished or unfinished – would have on my PhD application. Ignoring issues of dissertation topics/specializations for now, would it be help my chances to finish my law degree (or would it hurt my chances if I didn’t finish)? Could my law school GPA have a negative impact, even if my undergrad political science GPA is comparatively higher? Would even completing the law degree somehow cause PhD admissions committees to view my application with skepticism? If anyone could provide any sort of insight as to how I should go forward, I’d be very appreciative. Thanks in advance. "
4tih12,4,2016-07-18,"Student pharmacists’ preparedness for the REAL WORLD, pharmacists are you doing your part?",velveeta20,pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/4tih12/student_pharmacists_preparedness_for_the_real/,"Graduation day has arrived!  Pharmacy students have completed their didactic pharmacy course work and advanced clinical rotations. They’ve taken that walk across the stage in front of their family and friends, and they possess a piece of paper claiming they have satisfactorily completed the requirements to achieve the title as Doctor of Pharmacy.  For the last several years, these students have spent hours reading books (Ha!), reviewing PowerPoint slides, listening to old lectures, and preparing for exams.   All these years of knowledge, have surely prepared them for the provision of patient care in the real world, right?

In my experience as a pharmacist, educator, and preceptor, many new practitioners are overwhelmed by the amount of responsibility bestowed on them as soon as they enter the workforce.  Having limited past experience in these real world settings, novice pharmacists often feel as if they are in over their heads. Unfortunately, the years of classroom exams and PowerPoint do not exactly translate to real practice.  For some, as they dive into patient charts, drug information questions, and medication reviews, they report feeling as if they have forgotten everything they have previously learned.  Eagerly awaiting the chance to utilize their knowledge, some are paralyzed by their newfound autonomy. 

The issue of workforce readiness does not solely apply to pharmacy students, but rather the whole generation of young professionals entering the work place today.  In a recent report assessing the readiness of students entering the workforce, employers reported that many of the new entrants lack skills essential to job success.  Employers expect young professionals to arrive in the workplace with a set of basic and applied skills, and the Workforce Readiness Report Card makes it clear that the reality is not matching the expectations.

Many employers believe that educational institutions are primarily responsible for ensuring students are adequately prepared to enter the workforce, however, with the 132 U.S.-based colleges and schools of pharmacy with accredited professional degree programs, what is the profession of pharmacy doing to ensure that employer expectations are being met? 

Introductory/Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences	
Introductory Practice Experiences (IPPEs) - expose students early in their didactic education to common pharmacy practice models, including interprofessional practice, professional ethics and expected behaviors, and direct patient care activities.  IPPEs are structured and sequenced to intentionally develop an understanding of what constitutes pharmacy practice.  Advanced Practice Experiences (APPEs) allow students to build on previous IPPEs and didactic courses with a goal to establish practitioners through the integration, application, and reinforcement of the knowledge and skills previously obtained. 

Summer Internships
A quick Google search of “pharmacy internships” brings up a plethora of pharmacy intern opportunities in a variety of settings.  While acceptance into these programs is becoming increasingly competitive, these programs offer a unique, structured learning experience that supplements formal didactic training. These programs support and guide student interns while allowing them to progress at their own pace, based upon their experiences and interests.  Often mirrored after a typical 40-hour work week, and without the pressure of having to obtain a passing grade, student pharmacist find these internships to be most comparable to real world pharmacy. 

Postgraduate training
Pharmacy residencies, or postgraduate training programs, were established to build upon the education and training received during pharmacy school and further prepare pharmacists to make meaningful contributions to patient care. A residency allows the resident to perform as a licensed practitioner but to train under the supervision of an experienced preceptor. The cornerstones of any pharmacy practice residency include direct patient care and practice management. During a residency program, the resident is able to develop skills and competence in providing pharmaceutical care to a variety of patients in various settings, thus accelerating growth beyond entry-level experience. 

Pharmacists, what are you doing to help alleviate the anxiety of these young pharmacy professionals as they transition from student to pharmacist? 

As practicing pharmacists, we must all do our part to ensure that novice pharmacists are well prepared for the workforce demands of the real world.  After all, when we became pharmacists, we took an oath to “… utilize my knowledge, skills, experiences, and values to prepare the next generation of pharmacists”.  As pharmacy leaders, we must take an active role in outlining the kinds of skills needed in order to guarantee the success of our profession.  We must play a role in the creation of opportunities young pharmacists to continue to develop the skills they need, and encourage our professional peers to do the same.

She has been away for the past month doing an internship in Dublin, Ireland. This morning I woke up to a message from her saying that we needed to talk. What she told me was that she got really drunk at a music festival she went to and went to a bar with a guy that she had a mutual friend with, but the mutual friend went home. At some point they kissed. She said it took her a few seconds to realize what she was doing before she told him that what they were doing was wrong and she took a taxi back to her apartment.

I love her and I trust her for the most part but she says she has some small gaps in her memory. She's not much of a drinker so this was the most drunk she's ever been. Anyone whose advice it is to ""dump her ass now"", please leave this thread, your input is not wanted.

I've tracked down who it is on facebook and I was thinking of sending him a message to hear his side of the story. I have written it up and I think it is very civil. Here it is,

&gt; Hey, Eric. You don’t know me, but I’m Carly’s boyfriend. You obviously know what I’m messaging you about. I’m not going to chew you out. I understand you were both very drunk and not in total control of your actions. From what she’s told me, at the music festival you took good care of her and I appreciate that immensely, but what happened afterwards still majorly crossed the line. Carly told me what happened as soon as she was sober but she has some gaps in her memory of that night. This is in no way to incriminate either of you, but I was wondering if you could give me your side of the story so that I’m clear on everything that happened.

So how bad of an idea would this be to send? I am very hurt and I really want to know everything that happened. Thank you for taking this seriously."

George paced in his office. Then, on Saturday November 15th, the match sparked in Coventry. At 7:21pm George Fitzwilliam and the Central Committee were meeting and discussing the implications, and possible use, of the recently approved Red Brigades. George asked the Committee to present a vote as soon as possible to elect the leaders of the Brigades. Then the door to the meeting room opened. A member of the PropCom entered.

“Have you seen the news? Revolution in Coventry!”

Andria Jacoby was serving in the Defense Committee, which was in charge of establishing the Red Brigades until the election for the first Commissars could be held. At that moment she was in Coventry meeting with the local party leaders about their progress in establishing the “One Big Union” and the Brigades. When she stepped out of the local party headquarters and saw the mass of chaos in front of the Lady Godiva statue, she was speechless.

It was she that would, over the course of that evening, report back to the Central Committee and Defense Committee the state of affairs in Conventry. She was also pressed with directing the actions of the just formed Coventry Workers' Guard of the Red Brigades.

Meanwhile, with one ear pressed to a phone call with Andria, George called the Central Committee into the Defense Committee headquarters and began writing off events as they were declared. Televisions around the office were playing the official statements of each party on the events, as well as the general updates on the course of the event. Dozens of interns flicked through twitter feeds obsessively, adding copious information to a board that they were writing on to depict events. Immediately discussion began on what actions to take. Almost immediately, Fitzwilliam began to call for the use of the Red Brigades in to present the Communist presence, while Shaun Kern argued that any intervention of the paramilitary would be a failure.

“What the hell did we make the Red Brigades for? This is exactly what we intended them to be used for. The Party voted for the Goddamn things and now you're too ass-terrified to fucking use them?”

“Don't come at that, the Party should vote for this action.”

“There's no time for that, you know that!”

“We can't move alone for this!”

“The Constitution of the Party says nothing about Party votes for each individual action.”

“It does say that the Panel should handle it. There is no panel yet.”

“I'm the acting Brigade Commissar! It's a temporary function of the Defense Committee!”

Then someone got on the phone with the leadership of the Celtic Workers' League. It soon became clear that they had their own paramilitary forces which they would be sending in, and after they caught wind of the Brigades, they hoped to coordinate the announcements of their Partisans. Meanwhile, the discussion raged on between George and Shaun and quickly became heated, with George performing a raging tirade of insults at his opponent, and Shaun stalling any attempt at a roll call vote of the Central Committee or statement by George.

Then the Squadristi arrived in Coventry. Declared to be armed with blunt weapons and tasked with corralling the horde of rioters and directing their anger, though nominally claiming to be serving as peacekeepers, the BIP's own paramilitary was a hastily assembled force of fascist anger. Not uniformed in black shirts, or with any regular command structure, the force was cobbled together from BIP voters and members in the neighboring regions, many being driven in from the fascist stronghold of Yorkshire. The mere mention of fascist thugs quickly worked a unanimous vote of approval from the Central Committee to take action immediately."

Let's recap, bitches.

1st up was Chase, also known as boring until this episode? Like what, Chase has a personality and is actually kind of great. This was the first time I saw chemistry between Chase and Jojo - like I get it. They are cuteeeee together. But he won't win obvi. He's like really cute and seems way too normal for this shitshow (that I LOVE dearly). Turns out, he has a storyline that could have been great all season if it were not for Jordan or JorJor Binks as his dear friends call him. 

Chase is a child of divorce and has some obvious issues still with intimacy. He seems to be really into Jojo, but it's hard to tell if it's legit or just because he's in a cage of producer prodding and heightened emotions. He's a solid candidate for next Bachelor. I'm starting to think he had a personality all along and the producers just didn't care enough about him to showcase it. 

JoJo met his daddy and then his Mom and siblings. His dad was chill, albeit a little uncomfortable on camera. His mom was also chill. And there was a cute baby. Whose? I dunno man.

NEXT was Jordan. Did you guys know that Jordan is Aaron Rodgers brother? That's all I have to say about his hometown. Oh, and it seemed like Jojo cared wayyy more about impressing JorJor Binks and his family than any of the other losers. It reminded me of that one bachelor Ben and how he was always trying to impress Cortney.

NEXT was Robby. Robby robby robby. Such a character. A formulated one! Robby is like a ken doll - plastic and ready to please. His family seemed cool and I liked that his mom told him what the blogosphere was saying about him and his ex-girlfriend of THREE MONTHS. (He totes had to apply for the show while with his ex, right? like the timeline tho.) But Jojo actually seems to like him. Is it because she knows he wouldn't hurt her like JorJor Binks? Robby is veryyyy confident, but seemed thrown by his mother's conversation with him. He brought it up to Jojo and she was DRUNK. like for real though did you see her unfocused eyees? That was hilarious and maybe the first time I've seen a lead be obviously drunk on a hometown. Mama likes her wine. 

Robby and Jojosophina seem like an awkard couple and I could not imagine them in the real world together. I think Robby just wants to be the next bachelor. But I can't see him as the lead. The producers like good ol' boys, not ken dolls for Bachelor. This leads me to LUKE - AKA the mysterious cowboy featured on those smutty romance novels your grandma reads. (It's erotica, grams. We all know it. Also this reminds me that the first erotic anything I ever saw/read was a smutty cowboy novel my nanna had at her house. Wow. Luke is real nostalgic for me.)

LUKE. Luke is so sexy. Like super not smart and says LIKE all the time, but goddamn if I wouldn't let him do dirty dirty things to me. Just don't talk, sweet Luke. Luke drove a chevy truck to pick Jojo up and then brought her to meet the entire town of Texas at his house. Everyone was pretty and Texan. Luke spoke some words with his father and Jojo cavorted with his friends/family/cute fat baby. 

This was the only hometown where Jojo didn't chat with the mom. I think? Weird. Then Jojo and Luke sat on hay and talked about their feelings and then he brought her to a heart made of candles on grass, which seems like a major fire hazard but what else are interns for? 

He told her some mumbly things, like that she had his heart, but didn't say LOVE which all the other dudes said. She like cried? Maybe about saying goodbye to him. At this point, I thought he was solid number two.

THEN at the rose ceremony, Jojo wore a tight blue dress - BOOBS - and cried some. She told the camera that she wanted to get rid of Luke. Like, what? He's so sexy. Just bring him to the fantasy suites, Jojo. Ride that cowboy and then send him home! Like are you honestly telling me that Robby is better in bed than Luke??? No.

Luke pulled Ben's reject aside and said, ""yo girl I loves you,"" or something like that. Then Jojo cries some more cause how can she send him home now?

A bit of background. I currently study Industrial Civil Engineering with emphasis in Computer Science here in Chile. Its basically computer engineering with a different name.

I would like to do my internship abroad, hopefully in the bay area but if not anywhere else is welcomed.

Do any of you have a set on information on where and how do I have to apply since I will probably need a visa? I know bigger companies tend to give more of these visas since its easier for them, but I want to have a full idea.

Also, my idea is to do the internship starting july 2017, when should I apply then? Do companies offer internships starting that date?

Finally, what set of skills should I have as a minimum? Because of college I have worked with languages such as C, C sharp, python, RoR, SQL, and java. I also know how to use Git. But aside from the typical college projects I have none. College here is very demanding and we barely have time for side projects.

 
Thanks everyone and all comments are welcomed, specially if you have any stories/experiences doing your internship abroad.  "
4tj49z,4,2016-07-18,(Rant/Advice) My parents cancelled my bank account.,MargaritaSoda,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4tj49z/rantadvice_my_parents_cancelled_my_bank_account/,"Hey guys, I've posted on here with a different account but I made another one to make myself more ""anonymous.""  Anyway, this rant may be a bit long, but I'd appreciate your help if you have any.

I'm 21 college senior with a paid internship next semester.  I've never had a ""job"" during semesters because my Nfamily won't let me.  They say it's because they're worried about my school, but in reality I think it's a control issue.  Because I've never had a job, I don't have money and don't really understand how getting paid works on a long-term basis unless it's basically the same no matter how long you hold a job.  I also don't understand how payment would work if I get a bank account separate from them.

For example, about a year ago, I wanted to apply for a part-time position in a secretary-like job.  Since my parents only let me apply for summer jobs, I lack references.  I have summer bosses, a few professors, but I needed 5 references.  So as my final reference I used a family friend.  I know they didn't mean anything by this, but they told my parents, ""Oh yeah, MargaritaSoda is applying for a position at X.  They called me and asked about her.""  Well, they promptly flipped shit.  ""Why didn't you tell us about this?  You never tell us anything.  You realize you're putting your schooling in jeopardy, right?  You're just going to spend the money you earn on stupid shit.  If you think you can have a job, we can just stop paying for your rent, tuition, cell phone bill, car insurance, gas, and food.  You wouldn't survive.  You can't make enough money to handle yourself, you spend SO much money on everything!""

Funnily enough, I actually don't spend a lot of money.  Well, maybe to some I do, but it's all on needs, not wants.  They do give me money for food and gas, along with paying the above mentioned fees.  That's very nice, but it doesn't justify the years of abuse, gaslighting, and control.  They're just super weird about *how* I spend it.  For example, if I get groceries from Walmart, that's fine. If I get some fries at McDonald's one day, that's not okay.  If I get sushi at the over-priced sushi bar on campus, that's fine.  It also makes me angry because they're rather wealthy, so 1) I know that they're using money as a manipulation tactic and 2) why does it matter *how* I spend the money you give me for food, as long as I don't overly spend it on food?

Also, on the note of they're weird about *how* I spend my money.  Although they're rather wealthy and won't let me have a job, they don't like it when I spend money on anything that isn't a ""need.""  Here's a few examples:

* I cracked my phone my sophomore year of college.  I left it for a while, but it eventually got so bad I got shards in my fingers if I tried to swipe it to unlock the screen.  I won $50 from a contest at my university, so I was just going to use that plus $30-40 more from my ""food"" money to pay for repairs.  I was going to make up for it (and I did) by eating solely ramen noodles for the next few weeks.  Well, when my Nmom saw on the bills that I went to a repair store, she flipped shit.  ""Why are you so irresponsible?  You spend so much money.  You can't take care of anything.  You're going to amount to nothing.""  Keep in mind, the last electronic I broke was when I was 15.

* I had a business casual dress for an event last semester regarding my major.  I tried to find a pair of pants, a dress, anything in my closet that would fit.  But none of it did.  So I went out to JCPenney's and bought a dress for about $30 that I knew I could wear for this event and future ones (because I know they'll come).  When Nmom saw this, she yelled at me about how I don't ""need to spend so much money.  You literally have like 4 dresses and 2 pairs of dress pants, that's enough.  I don't care if they don't fit, that's your own fault.  You don't just go out and buy more clothes when they don't fit, that's not how the world works.""  Okay, so she wanted me to wear unfitting clothes to an event where I would be representing my major and hanging with professors... Okay then.



Anyway, back to the original thing.  So I have a paid internship next semester.  My parents were reluctant to let me accept, it was like pulling teeth.  This internship is from a great company, will boost my resume, is semi-relevant to my major, and *is paid*.  One would think those are awesome reasons to accept, right?  Well my parents thought it would be ""stupid"" because I could apply for something similar after I graduate and that it would be ""unsafe"" because it's further away than they're comfortable with (so I'm taking online classes next semester).  But even if I could and did apply for something similar after I graduate, that doesn't mean I'll get it.  I also think they're just using these excuses as manipulation tactics to keep me close to them -- after all, they only let me go to school an hour away from them.

So, with this paid internship I wanted this money to be used for the following:

* Save money so I can gtfo from their grasp

* Use it as a gauge for how I can spend money if I allot it to gas/food/rent/etc.  Basically, budgeting 101 since I've never done that.

* Spend it on things I may not *need* but would be beneficial or just generally want.

Well, my parents are **insisting** that they're going to pay for my stuff still while I have this internship.  They're acting like they're doing me a favor and being nice, and I've tried almost everything to convince them to stop, but it won't work!  Also, since I would like to use this money for when I plan to go away from them, I wanted where I keep this money to be separate from my current bank account that is linked with theirs.  I've ""joked"" about getting a bank account separate from theirs in the past, but they swear that it'll ruin my credit.  If this is true/not true, could someone confirm pls?

Anyway, after I told Nmom sort-of about reason 2 up there (basically the budgeting part) my Nmom agreed to let me get a bank account separate from theirs.  I nearly cried I was so happy.  I was finally getting closer to independence.  So I go to the bank the next day, sign a few papers, done.  However, my Nmom ""forgot"" that my current debit card (which is linked to their bank account) can still function as a bank account.  So Nmom called her friend at the bank and cancelled the new account.  The ""friend"" gave me a new login, but it's still the same linked account - I just can't see my parents' stuff.  If I use my ""old"" log-in (aka my dad's) I can see their bank account and mine.

Well now I'm very upset because I feel like I'll never get freedom.  I feel like I take 1 step forward then 10 steps back.  I can't help but wonder if that's even legal what this lady did?  But I don't want to cause trouble, because I know her ""friend"" was trying to be helpful because my Nmom is actually kind of sick right now and can't leave the house.  I had to fill out paperwork for the internship a few days ago, and so for now I had to put my linked bank account on the forum.  So my parents get to see when I get paid, how much, and what I spend that money on.  It makes me feel so child-like, like I have no sense of control over my life or it's choices.

**TL;DR** I've had a linked bank account to my parents my whole life.  I recently tried to separate my account from theirs.  Parents agreed at first, then cancelled this separate account and now are trying to pass off my new ""log-in"" (which is to the same account) as a separate account when it is clearly not.  I have a new job soon, and so my parents will see how/when I'm getting paid and how I'm spending the money.  Me no likey because me want away from them.

Does anyone have any advice for this situation?"
4tjf4w,11,2016-07-19,My Catfish has been sooooo convincing! Seeking help.,IgotCatfished255,catfish,https://www.reddit.com/r/catfish/comments/4tjf4w/my_catfish_has_been_sooooo_convincing_seeking_help/,"I started out matching with this girl on Tinder around end of March this year, with the name as Chloe, from University of Sussex. Her profile stated that she was British + Singaporean, and is fluent in mandarin and Singlish(English with Singapore accent). We started off normal, just chatting like i do with Tinder matches, and eventually managed to get her off Tinder onto Whatsapp. Here's where things get weird. 


She gave me a number that i could text on Whatsapp, but could not normal call or text! I found that out because i tried normal calling her one night and the service provider states that he number is not in use(red flag!). But i Whatsapp called her and it worked! She said that it was because she told the service provider to block all calls because it was eating up too much credits as she is using a prepaid service. I didn't think much about it as she was in Singapore on a year long internship. 


She's told me that shes a citizen here in Singapore, but moved to England when she was 15 due to her dad's work, and has been studying in UK until earlier this year. She has an apartment in SG that she's been living in that her grandmother left in her name when she passed. 


Anyway, she requested that we moved on to Line, which we did, and we would call each other for hours every single day until a week ago. Every, SINGLE, day. We grew really attached to each other really fast. She has this flair of getting me to open up, and i have told her things that none of my closest friends knew. She opened up and told me about her having abandonment issues really soon in the 'relationship'(red flag!), and i decided that i'll deal with it. I should have just stopped there. Stories of how her mum is emotionally abusive, how her dad passed away 2 years ago (she was very close to him), how she had a episode of depression afterwards and self harmed. She was broken, and i was trying to fix her. 


All these issues and insecurities become her ammunition against me when i was trying to progress our relationship. She would pick a fight before our arranged date to meetup because of smth i said triggering her, and afterwards it simply became a 'wait for me to be ready to trust that you wouldn't leave me' situation where dates wouldn't even be made. I went ahead with it because i was trying to be understanding, and her issues made it such that I'll push her away if i try too hard. She also wouldn't skype me as she wants our first 'motion interaction' to be when we first meet. We simply exchanged a lot of pictures and talked a lot on the phone. At the very least, I know im talking to a girl because her voice was very feminine and sweet, another reason i was blinded for longer than i should.


She would send me selfies, but those pictures would be of her face and not show her background or surroundings. Nudes too, but they wouldn't show the face. We were like in a relationship, growing more attached to each other as days goes by like scenery on a train.


One day, during one of her 'breakdown' episodes, she told me that she cut herself and was bleeding out. I panicked and went to the local Police for help, gave them her full name and phone number hoping they could track her address and help her, because i didnt have her address. Police came back and said that there was no such person, and the number was cancelled a long time ago. Thats when it really hit me about how little i know about the person on the end of the phone. That night, she called me again, supposedly 'surviving' the bleedout. I told her what happened with the police and she just feigned ignorance with the police database, and challenged that i could whatsapp her, proving the phone number was legit. I was still very doubtful, and she requested that i download snapchat and she snapped me the next day. But it was just a still picture and not a video. I took the bait then because she was convincing me that a picture snap is just as legit as a video snap. Thinking back, she could just have printed out a picture and snapped it. I was in denial because she was a major support in a difficult time then. 


I really need to end the story soon.


Fast forward to now, we were growing ever closer, i continued talking to her simply because it was enjoyable. Catfish or not, we could communicate in a way that i never had with anyone else. We were each other's emotional supports and understood one another. It felt so safe to talk to her.


But the doubts in my mind was accumulating. So many inconsistencies, but everytime, she would manage to come out with a reasonable excuse that was believable if you add my denial and her 'issue and insecurity' ammunition to the mix. One day, i looked through our photos and realised that there were patterns with the resolutions. Some pictures of food and ikea funiture and stuff that were really clear, had the exact same resolution, to the dot. Her selfies, would always be 1242 x 1200s. Her nudes? all over the place. 


This got me really suspicious because i checked the pictures that i sent her, and they were SUPER consistent with the resolution, unless i cropped them, so it wasn't the app compressing or changing the pictures resolutions. Now, I have previously image searched her selfies and even nudes on google and came up with no results. But now, i searched the newer ones that she sent me, and there were a few that she SLIPPED UP. A few of them came back with results from pictures on tumblr. One of the original pictures had a different face and phone model on it, which she cropped away at the neck before sending it to me. The doctoring of the picture was what finally convinced me that she was lying to me all along.


I confronted her on a call, sent the original picture to her, and she hung up when she saw the picture and never responded since. I couldn't reach her on Line, whatsapp, Steam(she plays CS), snapchat, skype(added me but nvr video cam). Basically blocked me on everything. I even sent a lengthy wall of text on how i just want the truth and i dont blame her on Steam, which she read. But she removed me as friends and blocked me after.


I am so hurt now. It just feels so unreal, this person that you cared for for 4 months, supposedly in a relationship, your emotional support and confidante, someone who promised love, concern, understanding. Gone, just like that. No explanation, no apologies, no contact, no nothing. Just gone. Wallowing in my thoughts, wondering why i don't even deserve answers and explanations. Stuck in limbo with my anguish and agony.

4tjlpw,14,2016-07-19,21 &amp; Done,notalwaysthere2016,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/4tjlpw/21_done/,"[Remorse] I lost my job in May because I had a nervous breakdown and got committed. I got my diagnosis the second day of being there. Bipolar one/w depression, PTSD, major anxiety with borderline personality disorder. After I was released I saw the psychiatrist and met my therapist. At my first visit with the psychiatrist she asked me some odd questions and kept asking me about family history and etc. When did symptoms start, who was my last therapist and etc. I felt so embarrassed. After this initial session she asks me to come back in 1 week. I come back and she blatantly tells me I need to sign up for disability ASAP. She then asks me about level of function and etc. I start bawling. Before my symptoms started I was a straight A student, active, social butterfly, put together, and reliable person. It started in high school, sophomore year if I recall. I would get super happy, like over the moon spiked with helium and expresso happy. I would do stuff extremely out of character when I was manic. I remember fucking my ex best friend in the movies, buying things I didnt need spending money like water, dressing rather inappropriate  (like wearing a dress &amp; sandals in 32 degree weather or wearing a swimsuit to a baseball game.) lashing out, running away and just being irresponsible. My friends just laughed it off as typical me since I was already outgoing and goofy. My best friend made me see a therapist but it was no use she was more concerned about my weight and nonsense. So I quit going. Went to school had my 1st nervous breakdown I went to outpatient through my school. I dropped out soon after it because it was to much for me. Took care of my gran and worked part time until the fateful day she passed. Things were fine even though my symptoms were getting worse and worse. I decided to attend job corps for 2.5 years. I saw the therapist who first thought I was bipolar but didn't want to diagnose me for sure. It became worse. Nobody thought anything was wrong with me. I was very active in student government, campus safety committee and ran the independent dorm. I even won awards for my efforts and got to work with some very important people on my internship. I mean other then a perpetually dirty room I appeared normal to everyone. After I graduated I got placed with a job within 2 weeks. However within a month they talked about firing me. (I later found it was a tactic they used to motivate agents to get higher sales and more hours out of us.) It made my anxiety worse and at that point I was in a depressive stage. I had panic attacks daily before work and on my off day I tried to kill myself. I took 7 Seroquel thinking that would do the job. It didn't matter anyway my then wife found me and took me to the ER and had me committed. Since then I've been hospitalized 3 times for various reasons. The last being a med reaction. I'm just really tired right now. I have had 7 different meds in the last 2.5 months. I've had to pay out of pocket because I lack insurance and dont qualify for jack shit. The last 300$ I had was stolen from me in June by my mothers ex after he beat my ass for existing. So Ive had to rely on mom for everything however she doesn't have it either since he stole from her as well. I feel like a sack of shit because frankly I am useless. I can't work or do any odd jobs. The side effects of the meds cause me to stutter, have tremors, twitches and make me pretty loopy. The medicine that I need to keep me sane is 70$+  per bottle. I wish I would have kept it together longer. Whatever that was holding me together has snapped and flew far far away. I can't afford it, I've called churches, tried to get loans, applied for help and even tried some shady stuff only to get scammed. I thought about ending it all. I thought about how to do it. I was going to crush some old sleeping pills up and down it with some gin. But then I thought about it my mom doesn't deserve that. It isnt that deep.  So I'm just here you know. In 2 days I will be out of meds completely so it is what it is I guess. It's odd to be high functioning but suffer from mental illness that impacts your quality of life."

Currently I work at an internship for the summer that pays me hourly as a temporary full time and i work 40 yrs a week at $17/hr. I filled out a w4 when i began this job and expect to receive a w2 come tax season. I also work as a real estate agent and fill out a 1099 form because I get paid through non taxed commission. I make a lot more through real estate than my full time job. I also work part time at a bank during the school semesters.

4tjq9t,1,2016-07-19,Me [21 F] with my boyfriend [22 M] should I hide my relationship status?,lonelylonergirl,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4tjq9t/me_21_f_with_my_boyfriend_22_m_should_i_hide_my/,"Hey reddit! I’m in need of some advice, although I feel a little embarrassed for a multitude of reasons. I’m not sure if I’m being an awful girlfriend or just overthinking things too much. Also pardon my grammar, writing this makes me a little emotional, and I think most of it is just me venting about it because I have no one else to vent it to (lol, part of my problem).  

&amp;nbsp;

My boyfriend and I have been going out for six months and I’m head over heels for him. We have an awesome relationship, and he is honestly the sweetest boyfriend I’ve ever had. We communicate well, we do cute things for each other, and we support each other through hard times. I love his family and I can see myself dating him for a long, long time.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, some backstory.  This summer I am a couple states away from where I live in order to pursue an amazing internship. This is my second year interning at this company and I feel very fortunate. I made some amazing friends last year and I am rooming with a couple of them, and I was so very excited to embark on my new adventure this year!

&amp;nbsp;

Except it hasn’t been working out the way I planned. I haven’t made one new close friend this year, and I feel like my friends from last year have “moved on”. They’re always out partying, getting drunk, doing drugs, or trying to sleep with people. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, but a lot of these activities I can no longer participate in (I don’t drink or do drugs anymore and I am very happy in my relationship). We hang out when they do sober events, but sober events rarely happen anymore.

&amp;nbsp;

I have tried really, really hard to make new friends, too. I’ve scheduled meetups with interns, I’ve gone out of my way to strike up conversations with people, and I’ve been my naturally bubbly self. I’ve never had problems making friends before, so I’m baffled with how hard I’ve been trying with no success. I find myself just counting down the days until my friends back home visit me, and I am incredibly lonely. I’m also learning how to be happier alone, and doing solo activities to pass the time. I’m even trying to volunteer at an elderly care center just to reassure myself that I haven’t lost my social abilities.

&amp;nbsp;

I have a good cry at least once or twice a week because I’m so lonely, but it’s beginning to be every night because I have nothing to do after work other than my solo activities. I know it’s killing my boyfriend as well, because he can tell how unhappy and lonely I am. We talked about it one day and we attributed some (not all) of my trouble to the fact that I work in a male-dominated field and I am not single. On one hand, I feel that if people don’t want to be my friend because I’m not single, then I don’t want to be their friend either. However, my boyfriend mentioned that sometimes he wouldn’t pursue friendships with girls who had girlfriends because he didn’t want them to think he was trying to pursue a relationship with them. That makes me feel like there might be more people like him out there.

&amp;nbsp;

So my dilemma is that I want to hide my relationship status on Facebook so that people will be more prone to being friends with me. I wouldn’t hide it any further than that, if people asked me if I had a boyfriend I would respond truthfully, and I wouldn’t dare flirt with people. I just feel guilty about it and that makes me feel like it’s a bad idea and I should just tough out being alone for the next couple months. What should I do? Please help me.

TL;DR: Have no friends but have a boyfriend. Should I hide my relationship status on Facebook so people won’t be reluctant to talk to me?

4tjxs0,6,2016-07-19,[Help] this sorta stray dog follows me everywhere and he will get himself killed doing it,ashu711,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/4tjxs0/help_this_sorta_stray_dog_follows_me_everywhere/,"Look for Short version in comments.

Hi, I'm in my final year of uni. Last August , the watchman of the hostel opposite the house I'm renting, bought two (mongrel) puppies which were adopted by our neighbors. 

These puppies were allowed to roam around and they'd frequently come over to our place because my roommates and I would usually play with them and give them a treat or two. In December, one died... Not sure why, I'd returned home for my term holidays and to intern. 

As the other one grew, I remained the only one to frequently play with him whenever he came over. I think our neighbors kicked him out around two or three months ago. 

Ditka is a really friendly dog and is generally always ready to interact with people. He'd follow me around but never outside of his 'territory' .I'd left for home again in May and returned in July.

I'd just returned from my morning walk when he came running at me out of nowhere on the first day I was back. I didn't really expect to see him considering my absence.... Id always assumed that he would come over to my place, because I generally fed him a few marie Biscuits at night. 

So I was obviously touched when I saw him bounding toward me that morning after not having seen me in almost two months.

I'd forgotten to mention, after he was kicked out and sometimes even when he was still a pet... He'd sleep on our front porch at night, hell he's saved me from two cobras in that period. Ive anyways kept a bowl of water for him there too.

On my return, I'd begun there daily routine of giving him Biscuits at night and even considered moving to dog food like pedigree. 

However, recently he's been following me around everywhere like he's my tail. It happened for the first time last week...he left his'territory'and followed me on to the main road and didn't leave. Now I wouldn't mind this, it's always nice to have company on long walks.....but Indian roads are filled with strays, and they are a mean bunch who do not take kindly to outside dogs. They usally attack him in packs of four or five and the only thing keeping them at bay is me shouting at them... Trying to scare them away, which just keeps them a small distance away, growling and barking at me. 

What is worse however is the main road....it is amazingly congested and it's very common for a dog to be run over. In fact , two dogs which were friendly with some classmates who live on a street parallel to ours died in December... They were run over by a bus.

So how do I get Ditka to stop following me around like a hyperactive stalker. I'm always at my wits end trying to keep other strays at bay and making sure he doesn't run on to the road. 

The worst in the mornings when we leave by bike to college, he runs recklessly trying to keep with us...for almost half a kilometre before he finally gives up. 

Shooing him away doesn't work, I've acted like I'm going to throw a stone at him ..doesn't work ... He just sits there and wags his tail looking adorable.

I can't adopt him either... because I'm leaving next year and my parents won't allow me to bring him home when I return.

I had problems related to school so my grades were bad but now I am improving them after fixing my problems. So I decided I also want to try interning in a foreign country.

I have until next summer, I plan to also talk with my school and learn what I can do. I plan to go to Germany because I am learning German, I also have some relatives there and I want to improve my German.

What are my options?"

I'm a 20 year old college student, I might be a bit late to the game for seriously wanting to get into the industry, but everybody's gotta start somewhere. I go to UCLA, and I'll be graduating in 2 - 2.5 years with a B.A. in Economics and a B.S. in Cognitive Science, with an emphasis in Computing (the department has a program where you can do most-to-all of the classes the major requires in the engineering school). I'm thinking of also picking up a minor in Digital Humanities to get access to more design classes. 

I'm somewhat of a socialite, and I'm studying in London at the moment, so I've been walking into local offices (Google, Glasscanvas, Brain labs, Jagex, Bam construction, etc.) to try and meet young people in the industry and get a feel for what skills they have and how they got there. I've made some headway, and I've got a running spreadsheet at the moment with programs/skills I should get some sort of mastery with. So I've got longterm goals to learn a lot of things, but more relevant to me at the moment is what I need to get my first internship, something I'm hoping to have by this fall/winter. 

I've digressed a bit, but my main question is, **where should I start?**

I've been learning C++ in school for a little over a year, so I've got a pretty decent understanding of basic algorithms, data structures, and writing, developing, and debugging code. I've also got some experience using Java, Python, Swift2, and mySQL. I am obviously continuing studies, so I will naturally improve and learn more, but I want to pick up something on my own as well.

4tl6dk,7,2016-07-19,Thoughts on WWLS The Sports Animal and other local OKC sports radio?,TheHandyman1,Thunder,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/4tl6dk/thoughts_on_wwls_the_sports_animal_and_other/,"Good morning fellow Thunder fans, I've seen some hot takes around these parts and /r/nba on the Sports Animal and since it's the off season and our roster is about shaped up (miss you Didi) I thought I'd open up this fair and rational discussion I'd wanted to have hear for awhile. 

**It's** been fun seeing comments on Reddit about folks being so triggered by The Animal and I find it funny and I don't know why. I remember one Thunder fan, I will not name names but I hope he shows up tell me that ""The Sports Animal appeals to the lowest common denominator"" and that's why he listens to The Franchise. You know, the ""rival"" radio station that has a non-stop stream of drunk and digestive issue jokes as female member Kara (Cara?) Rice degrades herself mercilessly. These days they have a morning Pokemon Go update every morning. Top kek.

**Let's** start with the Morning Animals. When the old Animals left to go to the Franchise I was breathless and heartbroken. I didn't get to listen to them a whole lot except during summer internships or maybe an early class for a semester but I was very sad when they left. My fears quickly diminished though as I begrudgingly found myself in a giggle as toked out super homer Spinozi furiously circlejerked the rest of the old fatties into quality morning sports talk. They're not perfect but they mix up the sports with the trash making for an entertaining commute to work.

**Next up** there's Chris Humphries. Not much to say here, he's an empty void of emotion and more or less just drones on about how Tiger Woods will still win a major tournament. You'd be better off with a glass of warm milk and melatonin whilst listening to The Franchise during the Hump Man's hour.

**Then** there are the frat star beer bros that run the Monsters of the Mid Day. What makes half the show is the retards like ""Everett"" who call in giving opinions that give the best shitposts of /r/nba a run for their money. Also Mark Rodgers is easily the most self aware guy on the station, especially compared his aloof partner Dusty Divorceforcheck. Dusty is 100x better than the other wackass OU player they had with Mark before but Sam Mayes still had better chemistry when he was on IMO. I'm pretty sure one of their producers is a Redditor. He fits all the archetypes being a contrarian, sporting a beard, lobbying for Bernie, and just making millennials look like absolute jackasses. Josh if you're reading this please do an AMA bby ty. Not to mention when Mark is on with Jim Traber it's some of the most entertaining local radio there is. It's always nice listening to Mark work up Fat Man Jim into a yelling tizzy. 

**Which** brings me to the the most polarizing figure in all of Oklahoma City radio, Jim Traber. The man, the myth, the ego, the ULTIMATE. Jim's job is pretty much to stir up some kind of magical love and hate storm towards him. He spends his time on the airwaves triggering super fans and left wingers with facts, logic, and a bit of 80s cocaine autism catching up to him. I like Jim, he's right more than he is wrong but he can be sooo wrong. Him pretending to not understand the hate for KD when he left was just about inexcusable. He does to a good job of criticizing OU and OSU, and his criticisms on the Thunder are pretty spot on and a welcome voice to break up the ""lovefest"" as he calls it. Here's one for the yardbirds Jim, thank you for carrying the station on your back!

**Finally** there is Al Eschbach. The creepy old man with a bit of a creepy accent that pioneered Oklahoma sports radio. He spends is evenings painting his taint crimson and cream in front of a Bob Stoops bobblehead. Al is best in other company and in moderation with Jim, Berry Trammel and Dean Blevins in the total dominance hour. Al's been in the industry for awhile so I get why he's there but there's no excuse for him to have 2 hours for phone calls at the end of the day. I guess old folks listen to him before bed at 8.

**So** that's it, not to bash the Franchise too much. Competition is essential and I'm glad we're in a market that allows for such. I think KD leaving might be a bit worrying for the Franchise, hopefully we can stay contenders and keep up the radio competition. 

I realize that some, if not many of you probably don't listen to local radio because you live out of state or country but I cannot for the life of me listen to ESPN radio or any of the big guys, even if the local guy's are annoying they're more in the know especially if you're into CFB. Also feel free to recommend some podcasts. Local radio is sure to be stroking the crimson n cream here for the next 3 months so work might just suck a little bit more. "

So the dream started off with me and Team A in a room, and Team A's leader (who I consider my mentor) told me we were playing a game of bingo against Team B, then my teams leader told me the losing team is killed.

I started to question why we were doing this and I got no answers other than ""this is the way we do it here"".

I started to feel very stressed, and having anxiety attacks.

So the game started off and I was first to get a bingo, so I was relieved I was not going to die first, but I was still very afraid. My bingo card was examined and I was told I was wrong, and had to start over again.

Then for some reason I was in another room talking to someone, and I was making my way back to the bingo room in a car, when I got to the room I was told I lost and I was to be killed.

In a panic I tried to drive away in my car while everyone chased me, as I tried to drive there was a very steep hill I could not get up so everyone caught up to me and I was taken out of the car.

Upon being taken out of the car I was screaming, to be let go, and yelling stuff like ""this is not right!"".

My team lead locked me in a glass container, (the kind you see at a restaurant holding fish in the wall) , and then proceeded to screw it shut, I was screaming while I was drowning and then I woke up.

I am absolutely perplexed at this dream and a friend recommended I post here and inquire to you guys about this.

Dear Faculty, Staff and Students:

I’m writing to you today with mixed emotions to inform you that I will be leaving the University at Albany this fall to assume the dual positions of Chancellor of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Vice President of the University of Illinois System. My last day in the office will be Friday, September 30.

This decision wasn’t easy for me and my family.  In fact, it was one of the most difficult dilemmas I’ve faced in more than 37 years in higher education. I hope you all know how much I’ve really enjoyed and loved serving this institution and working with all of you and the leadership team to advance the University at Albany to the next level of excellence.  Although I had planned to retire in this position, the opportunity to lead one of the most highly-regarded land-grant institutions among America’s public research universities and the flagship campus of the University of Illinois System is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

When I came here in 2013, I found a campus that was still reeling from the aftermath of budget cuts and the closing of academic programs and unsure of where it was heading. Working together, we built an ambitious vision and regained our confidence. We have taken many, many strides forward and that has caused people across the region, the state and the nation to proclaim that “The University at Albany is on the move!”

I am very grateful for your support, and I am proud of the work we’ve done together. We have launched the largest and most strategic expansion of the University’s academic programs in 50 years, with two new colleges and a deep affiliation with historic Albany Law School. We are laying the foundation for a major health sciences initiative and starting the conversation about reinvigorating the arts and humanities.

We have increased the size of the faculty, begun to address the challenging issues of adjunct pay and graduate student stipends, and expanded our support for faculty research, scholarship and creative activities. 

We’ve taken major steps to enhance the student experience, both inside and outside the classroom. We have created new research and experiential learning opportunities for students, increased our commitment and services to assure that all of our students have high-impact learning experiences such as applied learning opportunities and internships, and the opportunity to hone their entrepreneurial skills to launch their own businesses. And we have added new opportunities for students to engage in campus life and enjoy the arts, cultural and athletic events.

We are building new ties internationally and expanding our global reach. We have attracted one of the most diverse and talented student bodies in the SUNY system, and we are supporting our students as they do amazing things.

Together, we’ve generated a lot of momentum – and it is being noticed. News media coverage of the university has grown substantially. Our faculty are competing successfully for major grants, like the $10 million NIH endowment to address minority health disparities and the more than $23 million contract to build the New York State Mesonet, the most advanced weather detection system in the nation.

Our alumni, friends, and faculty have responded enthusiastically to this compelling vision – donating more than $52 million in my time here, including the two largest gifts in university history with more to come in the months and years ahead.

I urge all of you to keep this momentum going, for the excellence the University at Albany seeks and so richly deserves is well within reach. It has been a great privilege to serve as UAlbany president and to be a part of the SUNY leadership team at such an exciting time in public higher education. I want to thank  Chairman H. Carl McCall and Chancellor Nancy L. Zimpher for this opportunity, and for their strong support over the years. 

Chairman McCall and Chancellor Zimpher expect an interim president to be appointed at the SUNY Board’s next meeting in September. I know that you will give that person the same enthusiastic support you have shown to me. 

Thank you for all you have done, and continue to do, to make the University at Albany an outstanding public research university. I will watch with great pride as UAlbany continues to strive toward its strategic goals. 

Best regards,





Robert J. Jones
President

4tlkux,1,2016-07-19,Editing help?,princess_swizzle,PublicSpeaking,https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicSpeaking/comments/4tlkux/editing_help/,"Can someone edit my speech, or send me to a sub that can help me? This is rough draft #1, so it's very very raw. 
Context: Step Up is an intern support program, that gives kids 13-19 jobs at fortune 500 companies, as well as provides them with job training and certification for things like Excel and html code. I was asked to speak at the annual celebration this year. 

Step Up has been my summer for four years. All through high school, I’ve been a member and an active participant in Step Up activities- some of my greatest connections and friends are people that I have met through the Step Up program. I have been through Discover, as a younger teenager, working with a communications company and then the next year with a small cafe in downtown Minneapolis. Both of those jobs were huge learning experiences for me, and fortunately, rude awakenings. I wasn’t always the best kid, and truth be told, having a job during the summer kept me out of a lot of potential trouble. It was the thing at the time, for me- to be a trouble maker. But being placed in a real-world situation, where being a trouble maker could lose you your job, made a lot of sense to me and really kinda reverberated through me for the next few years- and it will continue to. 
Now, I also have Achieve experience under my belt, having worked with Centerpoint Energy last year, and then this year with the Walker Arts Center- coincidentally just down the street from the previous. Not only have the latter two jobs provided me with a more mature job structure and a more learned position- they also provided me with more applicable information than I could have imagined. All of my positions did. After that first summer, I went into school with a whole new outlook on the way life could be lived. It was simple, and applicable, and taught me professional skills that I could put on my resume and be proud of. And that’s how I always wanted to be from then on, was proud of myself. I’ve worked in private, public, big and small jobs; when I look at my resume now, and I feel that sensation of proudness, I have Step Up to thank. 
What I’ve learned from Step Up alone, and also the jobs, is a list that stretches a mile long, and then some. One thing, is that I’m really good at working. At getting told to do something, and then just doing it. Another is that there is nothing in my professional life that I use, that I don’t have Step Up to thank for. All of my professional skills- from html code and Excel, to communication and a firm handshake- are skills that the people in my summers have taught me. Skills that I couldn’t have ever acquired on my own. These are things that people should learn, and I have been graced with the opportunity to learn them while getting paid for it. It isn’t only the job skills however; it’s the everyday skills that have really made a jump into my life. The communication, the networking, the talking and the listening. The people skills. Things that you can learn on your own, but would be better with a partner- things that you can take into any and every situation. Skills that not only land you a job, but can also land you lifelong friendships and connections. I’ve been graced with the confidence to practice my skills outside of the workplace, and it has really paid off. 
	I’ve been able to get interviews for people who are supposed to have experience in the field- jobs at Fortune 500 companies, like Target, 3M and Best Buy, for jobs that are typically occupied by people who have specific connections with the company. Because I can say that yes, I’ve worked with CenterPoint Energy before. Because I can say yes, hire me for this job, because I deserve it. Look at my experience, and tell me I’m not overqualified for this position. I can now get jobs at 17 years old, because employers can look on my resume and see that I have 4 years of professional experience; 4 years more than most people who apply. And it’s that exact kind of feeling that is what made such a big impact on me. That feeling of success, that I-can-do-it-because-I-say-so feeling. It spills over into everyday life, also. That kind of confidence is contagious- I can apply my firm handshake and communication skills and I can share my experiences and stories, and that is the impact that I appreciate the most. Is that it simply applies. To anything and everything, what you learn here applies. I’ve gotten into an amazing university in Saint Paul, because of what they saw on my resume. What they read in my essay about who I am. What they saw when they met me- the professional demeanor I have acquired over the years, thanks to none other than Step Up. Even further, I’ve been given a 2500 dollar scholarship by Minneapolis Achieve- the program that has given me over $6,000 in wages over the years, is giving me $2,500 more for college. They are thanking me for simply being a part of what they have created- and that just makes me want to turn around and do so much more for them in return. 
I look forward to seeing myself here. To being a part of the community that is Minneapolis Achieve and Step Up. The jobs have helped me pave the road for my future- they have helped me discover parts about myself that otherwise would have been left uncovered and untapped. If it weren’t for Step Up, my current plan might be to live at home with my parents for a year and see how well that works out for myself. But Step Up was there. They were there when I was picking out a school to go to, and they were there when I had complete and utter freight. When I didn’t know what to look forward to, Step Up was there and said “look forward to me.” And when I did, I got accepted into Hamline, with most of my tuition covered by merit scholarships. So when it comes to Step Up, I look forward to giving back. To going to school, applying my skills to my road to success, landing a sweet job as the new Indiana Jones, and then simply giving back. 
My plan is to discover- discover more about me, what I can do, what I want to do. Discover more about the world and the universe I live in, about the people that can teach me things I didn’t know I didn’t know. Discover the happiness that wells within us all. My plan is to achieve- achieve what my dreams have drawn for me, achieve what I have been reaching on my tippy toes for, for  so very very long. Achieve the most that I can achieve. My plan is to believe. To believe in others, like others have believed in me. To give back the love and support that I have been given without hesitation or question. The impact of the Step Up program is insurmountable, and I can only start by saying I am grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of the never dying experience that Step Up is.

I'm at a crossroads in my life.  My current job has reached a dead end and isn't very intellectually stimulating to me.  The pay isn't bad but I am just not driven towards what my manager's plan for me is.  Unfortunately my current bachelors major is not very applicable for many other jobs so I likely would not be able to spring to a different industry and expect the same pay.  I'm already barely scraping by and my pay is above average in the US (Yay california).

Recently with the advice of a friend I took to learning to program.  I've finished an intro class at a local Junior college and really enjoyed it.  I finally got to feel like I was using my brain after not experiencing that since joining the workforce.  It's something I would like to pursue and was thinking of getting a second bachelors in CS.

Do you think it's worth it to go for the second bachelors? My parents are able to help me a bit financially so I wouldn't need to take out loans.  For anyone who has done a second bachelors how long did it take you?  Do you feel like it's worth it?  There are a lot of tech companies nearby that offer a lot of internships and I'm far enough from the bay area where the competition isn't nearly as fierce.

Over the weekend my boyfriend went out with some coworkers of his. He only started working with them about a month ago, and this was the first time they went out together. He is away in another city for an internship this summer. Everything has been great with us, I was really feeling like I was trusting him and feeling secure even though he is away, but then this happened. 

I don't think he thought it was funny or anything, but the way he told me seemed rather casual. He said he thought it was pretty weird because the woman literally approached them on the street while they were waiting for the train. I told him I thought the whole thing sounded disgusting and that she probably had a pimp who controlled her life. (I know, sort of cliche, but I this was after he said that he thought the girl worked alone, felt the need to tell him the chance of that was basically zero.) 

I'm happy he was honest and told me about it, but I'm left feeling a pit in my stomach. Like these are the people he is going to be with the rest of the summer? Should I just let it go and he happy he was honest or take this as a show of his character? When I told my friends they said he was a creep for even being there when it all happened, and with how he was pretty casual about it. 

tl;dr my boyfriend went out with coworkers and said coworkers got a prostitute. Sort of creeped out over the whole thing. He was honest but was his attitude about it a red flag? 

EDIT: thank you all for the reality check. I think it was more so that he is around the type of people who would get a prostitute that freaked me out. Also the fact that they brought this prostitute back to where they are living, sorry didn't say that before. Going to stop listening to my friends and just be happy he was honest. Thanks Reddit! "

I am eager to get into a job and working, but I am worried that if I start now then I will never return to do a Master's.  However, the fees and living costs in London make my Master's almost financially infeasible, since I have not received any additional funding.  The internship is not particularly well paid, but will at least cover my living costs for the 6 months - and I will get solid work experience while improving my French (I only speak English fluently).  I am also looking to defer my Master's and do both, but this option is looking increasingly unlikely.

4tm1t2,1,2016-07-19,COOP (paid internship) search and broadening work experience. 21M,MT_Sneaky_Snake,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4tm1t2/coop_paid_internship_search_and_broadening_work/,"As a student in my program in college I am REQUIRED to take 5 semesters of full time (=&gt; 40 hrs/week) COOPS/paid internships. For the first three semesters I have worked with a company that pays well above average for students in my program, although not enough to sustain myself after tuition and room/board fees when I go back to school on my ""school"" semesters.

Recently I have been involved with some of the interviews of new hired engineers at this company, and the salary they are offering seems on the low side of average (~65k), but does offer room for yearly growth after performance reviews.

I have been in three different departments in these three semesters, and I also worked part time during a school semester. The departments are: quality engineering, product engineering, and acquisitions/project management. Within the company I feel my portfolio is diverse, but I don't have any other engineering related experience elsewhere.

I've been thinking about finding a new COOP for my last two ""work"" semesters, which will be served in consecutive terms. The things holding me back from trying to expand my résumé is:

-I'm almost guaranteed a lower (current) pay
-relocation costs (which are only sometimes covered by employers)
-unsure of benefit of switching employers 
-if I begin a search for a new location, I may not be able to rejoin my current company if I fail to find something.

Other information that may be helpful: I will be obtaining a bachelors degree in Mech. Eng. tech. In spring 2018, and I should have a masters of engineering in mech. Eng. specialized to manufacturing and design either in summer or fall 2018. I am in the Cincinnati area.

I feel welcomed at my company and have a high possibility of being offered a full time position upon graduation, but do not know if they will honor my graduate degree. But I don't want to be limited in my options if my resume isn't diverse enough.

Should I stay or look for another employer?

4tm5s6,9,2016-07-19,"Voc Rehab counselor went off on me, and now the office won't return my calls or respond to e-mails. What are my options?",Q-Gravity,Veterans,https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/4tm5s6/voc_rehab_counselor_went_off_on_me_and_now_the/,"My Voc Rehab experience has been a bit of a roller coaster, here's the gist of it:

I'm in the middle of earning my Bachelor’s degree, and I'm trying to switch from the post 9/11 GI Bill to Voc Rehab. I started working with a counselor early this summer.

Although getting a hold of her wasn't always easy, she always responded back within a reasonable time. Like a couple days at the most. In the beginning, I had plenty of time and always figured it was a busy office anyways, so no biggie. However, she wasn't entirely too informative, and whenever I asked questions—I received fairly short, sometimes seemingly curt, responses via e-mail. Yet, to be fair, I always try not to take e-mails out of context since I know sometimes things can come off wrong. And when I spoke to her on the phone, she was always playfully sassy or would give me a hard time, but it never seemed too negative and we always ended the conversation on a good note.

On June 3rd she finds out I'm planning on attending a school that will require her to send a write-up asking for approval, due to the tuition costs. She tells me overall it shouldn't take too long and she does it all the time. I ask her an ETA, and she says 2 weeks.

I went out of town for most of June, and attempt to follow-up with her when I got back. I gave her a call on July 1st, then sent an e-mail July 5. She responds to the e-mail asking, ""You're going to [school] for [degree] correct?"" I respond yes, and then I don't hear anything from her for a few days. Okay…

Following that, for two weeks I tried calling her and left her a couple of messages. I even sent a couple of e-mails, asking about the status of my process package and if there was anything else I could/needed to do. She responds with this:

""Hi, [name]:
As with did with you, we have Orientation, and now additional days for it. Also, I have scheduled meetings with Veterans. So, sometimes, I am not available via phone, or email if I am with someone, or away. However, I can be reached by both. And, I will make contact be either or both method, as the days are just packed. At the moment, there is nothing for you to do. However, I will contact you as soon as there is…""

(I copied this directly from her e-mail)

Okay, so I now know there's nothing for me to do, but she didn't catch me up to speed on what the status is.

I'd like to add here that I'm getting married soon and planning the wedding. I'm going to be starting school again soon and a possible internship, so I'm kind of under pressure. Plus, the only thing I know about Voc Rehab and my case specifically is what she's shared with me, so I don't know much—nor do I know how long things will take etc. Additionally, I've kind of had a bad experience already with the VA in regards to things taking ages and me having to jump through hoops before anything happens.

Anyways, time was going by and I was left in the dark. And I couldn't find a contact for my VocRehab office anywhere, so I called the VA. Through them I got a phone number to my VocRehab office, and the lady who picked up the phone said she could transfer me directly to my counselor. To my surprise (and surely hers, as well) my counselor picked up. Without any tone or anything, I politely said ""Good morning, this is [name]. I'm just calling to see what the status of my process package is?""

Before I could even finish, she went off on me. Saying ""I already told you!"" And when I explained that she didn't, she retorted ""You need to let me do my job. I know when your school starts. I'm a person and I get busy"" And so on, and so on. She kept repeating herself without even letting me get a word in.

The way she was going off on me was the straw that broke the camel's back. While still keeping my composure (and while she's still going off on me) I told her that I'm sorry, but I'm going to request a transfer to someone more professional. That's when she hung up on me.

Since then, I called the office back and they told me I'd have to speak with the Acting Director in order to request a transfer. I've e-mailed the Acting Director, and tried calling her (the Act Dir) a few times as well, even leaving messages. It's been about a week and I haven't received a call or e-mail from neither my counselor, or the Acting Director.

What should I do at this point? Am I basically stuck with that VR counselor? If so, I'll try to apologize for any troubles I may have caused her and hope that she still helps me out.

Am I stuck with this office? And if so, does that mean I should just play the waiting game until somebody finally e-mails me or calls me back?

EDIT - Made some changes for clarity.

I'd like to point out that I never once insinuated towards my counselor that she needed to rush things, that I thought she was slacking, or anything like that. She must have had a guilty conscious or something in order for her to immediately go off on me, and be so defensive when I was simply trying to find out what was going on. I was never pissed about the situation, and I'm not mad about it now. All I wanted/want was to know what was going on, and would be the next things to come. My only concern now is that I still don't know anything, and now I'm worried about time.

Thanks for your help and input!

EDIT 2 - For those wondering about how often I contacted my counselor in the 2 weeks:

- 5 calls total. Called on two different days first week. Called 3 times the 2nd week, and one day I called twice (morning/afternoon)
- Out of those calls, I left two voice-mails. First one asking about status and leaving my info. Second asking when would be a good time to reach her.
- E-mailed her twice. First e-mail was asking about the current status. Second e-mail, I left my best contact info/time and asked if she could contact me and/or when would be a good time to contact her.
- The first week that I contacted her, I only e-mailed once and called once on Monday, then on Thursday.
- Prior to this, she would respond almost immediately, if not at the most a day or two later. Usually with a quick call or e-mail. So for her to not even respond with a quick e-mail was unlike her."

I'm new to reddit and this forum and hoping for some support and advice. I haven't posted much about my feelings before and I'm pretty down so I apologize if my post is all over the place.

I'm not suicidal ( I was 2 years ago , pulled through because I couldn't imagine putting my mom through the pain ) and I'm off depression pills . I thought I had improved but I'm completely sinking back in and I don't know how to get through.

I'm 25 and at this point jobless , friendless , and completely and utterly numb . I was never a very happy person , always had an inferiority complex but still I was ok . I had my hobbies , a few friends and a head that worked.

But over the past few years I have categorically ruined my life . I'm not going to blame it on circumstances or people , people get through huge difficulties in life and I have had a reasonable standard of life.

Yesterday I got the results back from a test I have been studying for the past 7 years and trying to pass for the last 3 years , this was my final try and I failed again.

But unfortunately this negates all my work and now I have nothing to show on my resume . The last qualification would be May 2010 and then nothing . I made some really bad decisions down the line for this , quit my internship , stayed at home and for the last 1 year , stopped talking to everyone , friends , relatives , cut out music , movies , books , was on anti depression pills and put on a lot of weight.

And lets not start on what I did to my health , I can barely go out for 3-4 hours a day and I collapse from exhaustion. I had to go through a whole lot of tests today morning.

And at this point I am so numb that I don't know how to get out of this , I have dug such a deep hole for myself , how do I get out of it. I know this is rock bottom because at least reading was the one thing I could still find a bit of pleasure in but thats going away too . All that is left is a huge pressure on my shoulders and no way to let go.

I know I should probably find a way to make an effort to get a job or something but I can't seem to write anything in my resume because I can't see any worth in me or anything . It's like I'm zero and worth nothing.
So this maybe self pity , a cry for attention , make me a horrible person , whatever , I just wanted to share this with someone.

4tmbh7,4,2016-07-19,My girlfriend has a history of guys flirting with her and she just told me that she'll always keep wanting more attention from others. Do you think she'll eventually cheat on me?,TonTrapper,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4tmbh7/my_girlfriend_has_a_history_of_guys_flirting_with/,"My girlfriend has a history of letting guys flirt with her. The first time it happened was at this internship we had. There was this older co-worker who kept flirting with her (he got physical at most times) and she just brushed him off. She never even bothered to tell him that she had a boyfriend at all.

We're on an LDR now and a few months ago, I felt this weird, sinking feeling in my gut. There's this guy who keeps commenting on her posts and stalking her (CREEPY IKR). He even takes pictures of her without her consent and tweets them, ALSO without her consent. So I snooped into her Facebook account (the first time I actually did this. She does it to me usually) and found the conversation she had with him. 

Turns out he was sending her kiss emojis (a lot of them) and has been calling himself her ""Mr. Perfect Boyfriend."" Although this time, she did acknowledge that she has a boyfriend, he still continued to mess around with her and she just blatantly let him. When I confronted her about him (without me telling that I sneaked into her account), she just brushed it off, got mad, and told me he was just a weird asshole. 

Next time I checked her account, she deleted the conversation. I believe that this is a sign of cheating -- *emotional* cheating, at the least.

Just now, she told me that she'll always keep wanting attention from others and that mine won't be enough.

What do you guys think?"
4tmdzq,4,2016-07-19,"Looking for suggestions on how I should invest ~$15,000 for 6 years",hippiecow,portfolios,https://www.reddit.com/r/portfolios/comments/4tmdzq/looking_for_suggestions_on_how_i_should_invest/,"Hi all,

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this kind of question, but I thought I'd try anyway. I'm 22 now. I've just graduated undergrad with $15K in subsidized student loans, and will be going to get my PhD in the fall. I will have made enough money from my internship this summer to be able to pay off the student loans in full, but since I can defer the payment of the loans while in grad school, it seems wiser to invest the $15k now and pay off the loans once I graduate. Since the government will pay interest on the loans in deferment, this sounds like a good way to end up effectively paying less on the loans.

Anyhow, I'm not sure how I should get started from there. It seems to me that I would want to invest this money in a way that's less risky, as I'll be stuck with paying the $15k in a few years. I probably won't be making that much during my Ph.D., but I'd like to invest a little bit per month and I'd be okay with having more risk on those investments. It seems like I have a few choices at this point:

1. Invest some amount of money in a retirement account, and keep the rest in a general account. For both accounts, I'd probably want to invest in vanguard mutual funds. The idea behind this is that I might be making enough from my stipend to pay off the loan without needing the initial sum of money that I have, so I might as well put some amount in now for retirement and let it accumulate over the next 6 years perhaps.
2. Invest the whole thing in a general account, purchasing a more conservative selection of vanguard mutual funds and bonds.
3. Invest $10000 in Wealthfront or something like that and forget about it for 6 years. To me, wealthfront seems like a waste if you have more than $15000 invested, as then you have to pay the .25% fee. But, I should be fine if I have less than that, right?

Any advice is appreciated - thanks :)"
4tmgvn,2,2016-07-19,What programs could I expect to qualify for (and other dumb questions)?,nufootball,academiceconomics,https://www.reddit.com/r/academiceconomics/comments/4tmgvn/what_programs_could_i_expect_to_qualify_for_and/,"Hi, I'm a rising junior at Yale university who is just now starting to think about grad school. I have only taken 5 econ-related courses thus far, because I changed my major from computer science to econ/sociology to now just economics. I have a 3.88 cumulative GPA and a 3.76 GPA in Economics. I did a 4-month IT internship last summer and I'm currently doing a 2-month internship with a Hong Kong legislator. I have no research experience, but I am going to try my best to find an economics research opportunity this fall.


Unfortunately, I got a B in intermediate microeconomics for reasons outside of my control. I overloaded my schedule by taking an extra class and doing theatre. On multiple occasions I was forced to pull two near-all-nighters in a row, the first to finish a paper, the second to finish my microeconomics pset. I slept through my alarm on two separate days on which homework was due by the end of class at 10:30am, no exceptions. Full blast, right next to my ear for two hours, my body was so exhausted that it wasn't enough stimulus to get me conscious. If I had been able to hand in my work, I would have gotten an A-. I was also matched for a bone marrow donation and my roommate had attempted suicide that semester and had to drop out of school. Is there any way that I could let an admissions committee know about these circumstances? Would they be valid enough to counteract the B? Are there any courses that I can take to improve my standing?

I took Calc 3 freshman year and ended up taking it pass/fail, because I was never taught how to study math at my rural public high school and wasn't planning on needing it for grad school. Last semester, I finally figured out how to study math and got an A in Linear Algebra. I am planning on taking a calculus/linear algebra theory course and then Real Analysis. Would A's/A-'s in these courses counteract the pass/fail Calc 3 grade? 

The courses I am planning to have taken by graduation are intro micro/macro, intermediate micro/macro, econometrics, general equilibrium theory, game theory, calc 3, linear algebra, the calc/algebra theory course, real analysis, some electives, intro to computer science, and a senior essay. If I get A's/A-'s in all of these (except calc 3 and intermediate micro), what can I expect to qualify for? Should I take additional classes?"

I am a student from India, graduated from an IT degree from a mid-tier college here. I regret wasting these past 4 years of my degree, not trying to improve myself as a programmer while others in my class have netted great great jobs and are far better than me. I do not have any personal projects apart from coursework. The only good project in my coursework was some QR Code scanning Android App and a Small VR Demo in Unity, both of then not share-able on Github because they are not that of good quality.


I stumbled upon this subreddit a few months ago. I always lived in a bubble where I thought I was a decent programmer, but now it has become evident to me where I lie. Everyday I come to this sub, I see threads where people share their personal project ideas, their resume. Their projects are so so good and they have done a few internships, I just cant help but be discouraged about myself. Where do I stand really? 'I am close to 22 and these people at high school in America are so much better, where the fuck do i even stand'.


I will be coming to the States for graduate school soon, and when I see LinkedIn profiles of many other people who have moved to USA for graduate school, I get even more discouraged. These guys have done awesome projects and published papers, maybe being a bubble and being so introverted and reserved didnt help me in college.

In short, I am literally the embodiment of the CS Graduate Meme you see circulating on 4chan. 

People tell me, my parents try to motivate me saying, 22 isn't too late, you can still improve, but theres this huge mental block I have in my mind which is really getting hard for me to beat. I just came to know about books like CtCI and PIE only just recently, one can only imagine what a reality check I had, how far behind I am in this rat race.


I want a decent job, I really love software development. I am currently interning right now at a place where I am not doing much, but the projects involved are really good, this is the first time I am looking at production level code, I am struggling a bit to understand. Typing this right now has really helped me, I have not been able to sleep properly at night due to this. The cycle of unproductive days and sleep isnt helping either, apart from the 'showing up' at my current internship work I am doing.

How can I improve in 2 years while I am in the states? Am I only kidding myself? Even if I give it my all will I get there? ... all these questions scrape the corners of my brain.

I am sorry for this rant but it has been plaguing my life for a long time and I wanted to share this with people who are in the same field as me or be a speaker for those who have been struggling the same way. I love you guys and what you have achieved and like you, I love computer science that is why I managed to maintain a decent GPA of 3.6 and but I cant help but put myself down compared to you guys.

TL;DR: I am 22 yr old IT grad from India, literally shit at programming, want to improve to get a good job after my masters, mental block because I cant stop comparing myself to others and cribbing about the past.

4tn01y,23,2016-07-19,Thank you /r/accounting,qc900,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/4tn01y/thank_you_raccounting/,"Just wanted to say thank you to all those professionals that have contributed to this sub. A lot happened in my life and didn't land anything full-time and was struggling to keep up my grades. I had a 3.9 when everything was okay but dipped when SHTF to a 3.0. It was a big uphill battle but I chugged through and graduating with honors &amp; 3.6 gpa. I knew I was good at interviewing and in general a solid candidate (had quite a few good internships) but after graduating, I decided to humble myself and start with the basics again and viewed myself as a complete novice. Some things I learned in the process were the importance of asking good questions, strengthening the ability to sell yourself, and really digging into the company/position to demonstrate your knowledge to the interviewer. I know these are basic things but they can really be a game changer, I often focused on my pitch/talking about my resume/behavioral questions. The other things, like being able to talk about the job and the organization and good questions were the things that mattered more IMO because they allow you to make a human connection. Your resume/behavioral questions are just filters mostly, they already got you the interview, it's time to make the human connection. 

I know I am still a beginning in my career but this is what worked for me (and might work for you):

* It was definitely not easy for me, even with a good GPA/internships, I recommend people in this position setting goals for themselves and constructing a detailed plan on how you are going to conduct your job search. For me I set quotas for how many jobs I wanted to apply for/people I wanted to network with/contact. 

* I know online applications are quite slim but I focused on what I like to call 'professional sites.' This includes, linkedin, cpa job boards, employer websites. I felt things like monster/indeed were complete trash. When applying on employer job boards, I tried to find a person in HR on linkedin with that company, just send them a hey, can you tell me more about X position, I am interested in finding out more, this automatically gives you a leg up in the application process (assuming you meet the qualifications). 

* Record every thing in detail, places you apply, responses, interactions, account information, etc. I used an excel spreadsheet and a notebook. 

* Start on a professional cert. in the process of your job search, this is obvious but you can't spend all day applying to places. If nothing pans out you still will end up making progress towards something that makes your job search easier (acquiring the cert.) 

* Allocate time in your day to yourself and keep up your physical health. 

* Make a 'Interview template.' What I mean by this is, make a print out that you fill out before your interviews. I usually make a company profile with fast facts that I can read before the interview, I put a list of questions I want to ask the interviewer. I put answers to possible interview questions, just to refresh my brain. I put things about the organization such as their mission/vision, 'buzz' words they use on their website a lot. This helps me know which words to use in the interview. I usually cater this to every company because your answers/questions change depending on the company. I make the print out, read it the night before the interview, and read it in the morning of the interview. 

* Make a pre-interview check list and always use it no matter how obvious you think some things are. List simple things like cutting your nails, wear matching socks, bringing the RIGHT resume (I have 3-4 different resumes), etc. The little things matter. 

In the end, I ended up landing a position in IA development program, although I wanted B4 originally. The people I met are great and I actually like the company. I start at 15% hire pay than b4 in my city, good bonus/401k match. And most importantly, amazing international travel to some really cool places with a good amount of variety in work. I will hopefully be able to exit into Ops/Finance at the end up my program. Thank you again to everyone, I hope to be able to contribute some day. Some quick numbers. It took me roughly 60 days from graduation. I did 400 applications before I ended up with this. I contacted maybe 50 people in total (cold emails/calls). I had around 20 interviews with like 12 places before getting an offer. (I took every interview for practice even if I wasn't 100 percent interested in the job). Sorry for the long post!

We've known each other for 13 years, since the 1st grade and for the past 4 and a half years we've been in a relationship. Considering that I'm 20 and she's 19, that means we've been together during high school, so a lot of my memories are related to her.
Sex is some important part of our break-up, considering that we haven't had it and we are both virgins. 
During the last five months of the relationship, she began to slowly decrease her interest in me and despite her sayings, it was obvious that she !!!kind!!! of wanted to break-up.
The problem is that she didn't literally want to break-up, yet she didn't try to do anything about her lack of interest in me, so I was kind of friendzoned, being in a continuous stress and also, a lot of pain.
A few days ago, some guy (long story, he is a liar) told her that me and one of her old friends are friends with benefits and she told me that this hurt her even if she doesn't care (lol) and it was the last time we talked because I told her that if she still cares, she should give a try (sounds like I was begging for forgiveness, but I didn't do anything wrong) and I came to the conclusion that I don't want to talk to her anymore and try to live my early years in a nice way, not suffering for her indecisiveness.
I've been talking to her since March (when we broke up), thinking that she will change her mind and she will know what she wants, but I always ended in a gray area of ""I don't know what i want."".
Right now I'm trying to get over it, but it's pretty hard to do that. I got myself a job (internship, actually) to keep myself busy, but still there are moments when I can't think to anything but our relationship and also, I tried to hang out with some girls, but I don't feel like it and besides that, I'm afraid of having any sexual intercourse with someone but my ex (bc hey, in 4,1/2 years I thought that we'd both lose our virginity one to each other so..)..

I don't know, I feel like I covered the whole story, but if there is anything that doesn't make sense, just ask.."

4tn0sz,1,2016-07-19,recent college graduate Beyond Frustrated and do not know what i am doing wrong,SPAZZEH,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4tn0sz/recent_college_graduate_beyond_frustrated_and_do/,"I graduated in December 2015 with a Communication Degree with top honors (Summa Cum Laude) and am trying to land an entry level position in Human Resources. I have had SO MANY interviews with no luck. So far I have had a company interview me on June 8. They are still trying to make a decision on who to hire. They will not even tell me if they are not considering me anymore or what. I am done with them. I have interviewed with people who have said that my qualifications are impressive, but I still don't have the credentials for the job; however, my credentials meet or exceed the qualifications on the job description. I have held an internship over the Summer of 2015 in Human Resources, and have taken a SHRM HR course through UCF. I cannot get anymore experience if no one will give me a chance to prove myself. I am still having interviews with potential employers who interview me, tell me that they are interviewing other candidates and will get back to me in 2 more more weeks. Sometimes I don't even hear back. Other times, it is the same ""you aren't qualified enough"" for an entry level job! Some of these jobs only require a high school diploma. When I ask for feedback after a rejection, employers ignore me. How do I make this madness end? How do I get an employer to give me a chance and offer me a job?"
4tn8kx,2,2016-07-19,Just turned 21 with almost no meaningful job experience. what can i do?,embdepthrowaway,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4tn8kx/just_turned_21_with_almost_no_meaningful_job/,"Let me give you some background about myself. (TL;DR at the bottom)

I finished school at just before turning 17 in 2012 (not left, finished) and had no clue what I wanted to do with myself being so young. I got into college but left after a couple of months since I was so overwhelmed. I decided to take a year off in 2013 and figure out what I wanted to do. I did some volunteer work over 2013 and 2014 but got nowhere finding an actual job. 

In 2014, at 19, I decided to retake my country's (Ireland) final exam year. I tried finding a part-time job but because my schedule was so packed and the importance of the year (employers thinking I wouldn't prioritize them), I got nowhere. I had to leave halfway through the year in January 2015 because my grandfather fell ill and my mother needed another source of income in the house even if it was just a €100 weekly welfare payment. 

I saved up for a while and in May 2015 I did a short barista training course thinking it would help me find work. I applied to a lot of coffee shops but initially got nowhere. Last September I also started a 1 year college course in software development to get into university for computer science. That December my luck finally changed. I got a part-time job in a coffee shop near my college. It closed two months later and the manager ignored my calls to ask for a reference and my tax cert.

In February I was back to the drawing board. I graduated my course at the top of my class in early May and it looks like I'll be accepted into the top computer science course in the country as a result. I continued looking for part-time work with no success. I got two interviews between losing my job and now. One for a tech consultancy that I noped out of after the interview (turned out to be really sketchy) and a coffee shop that I didn't get. 

I've been applying almost everywhere I can. I turned 21 last Thursday and I'm getting seriously depressed now. I have absolutely nothing to do and the longer I'm out of work the more difficult it gets. Even positions that supposedly require no experience ignore me. I've even tried lying to a couple of places to no avail. I know that's wrong but I'm that desperate. It's not even about the experience and the job anymore. I just want something to do. I've mostly been applying for retail positions since they're the most common part-time ones but most of them want at least two years experience (I see the words experience essential a lot). The local convenience store has been hiring kids with less work ethic than a spoon over me since I started my job search over two years ago. I tried having my aunt pull some strings with her colleagues (she managed a department store concession) and that didn't work. I honestly feel like giving up. I'm just so...tired of it. 

I will note that I did find an unpaid internship in IT today that's willing to accept part-time. They cover expenses and it does seem like great experience but given my family situation at the moment and going to university soon, I don't know if I could afford to work for free for up to 6 months. 

TL;DR - Just turned 21. Been searching for a job for over two years. Got one but the place closed soon after. Now I'm back to square one and the experience I have apparently isn't enough. "

4tnqlx,1,2016-07-19,F4A - The Dark Journey To Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4tnqlx/f4a_the_dark_journey_to_fame/,"

Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

--------------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up (would love her to look like Madison Ivy)

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S also looking to role play Marvel/DC, Game Of Thrones, The Witcher and Mass Effect

4to85k,2,2016-07-19,Found out I've been catfished long time ago and turns he killed himself a year ago.,rsoffmychest,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4to85k/found_out_ive_been_catfished_long_time_ago_and/,"Hello, I want to get this off my chest, I just want people to know but I can't really talk to anyone about it, I just want to tell this to someone so here I am. throwaway cuz reasons.

I used to play the game runescape, for those unaware it's an online game where like World of Warcraft and you meet random people while you play.

So it's about 2010, I've been friends with a few people, 2 of which know eachother in real life. my life was kind of boring, I was doing a boring internship and my life just consisted of going to the internship and playing runescape every day. One of my runescape friends was a girl, who we'll call Alex. Alex was smart and nice and cute, played games and seemed like my type both personally and looks. Because my life was so boring this girl kind of became my 'light in the darkness' and I started looking forward to talking to her and spending online game time with her (we both lived in different countries). 

And sure enough I fell in love with her eventually, for a long time actually.. I told her and it was more like 'it would never work we live apart, lets stay friends'. And our friendship/my love continued for probably 2 more years or so, after a while we both stopped playing runescape due to college and I felt heartbroken, I dind't have any contact information about her except for an email address. 

I email her a few years later (2013-2014 or so) and to my suprise I get a reply! At that time I was 'over' her but I just loved that I was able to catch up with an old friend. Suddenly email contact stopped and I sent her a few more emails over the span of a few months but received nothing. I decided to go full sherlock holmes and try to find out who it was, I did reverse image searching and so much shit the FBI should hire me. 

Eventually sure enough I find her on facebook, I send her a message saying hello and stuff she replies saying that she's afraid she has no idea who I am or what I'm talking about and that she never played runescape. So I was like 'okay fuck, I've been catfished for sure'. That alone is fucked up enough but I really had to know who it actually was, I would even be able to look past the catfish part and just be happy to continue a good friendship because I had fun talking to her while it lasted. But I'm at a dead end, I have no idea who it is and where to look.. 

Then yesterday I get a reply on a youtube video that I commented on a long time ago asking if he was still active. (the other person that knew Alex in real life). Because of google plus comment I see his real name in my mailbox (I was already aware he was part of the catfish aswell obviously). So we both log on and he immediately says he has to tell me something, I'm like okay here it goes, I excpect him to say it was all fake and he wanted to end the lie, instead he says this

*Alex killed herself a year ago* 

I'm like what the fuck, I tell him I know his real name and that it was all fake. He opens up and tells me more, how and why some things happend but Alex was a boy and not a girl and he really did commit suicide. We talked a bit more on Facebook and he showed me a photo of Alex.

I dind't really feel anything at first, how could I? I haven't spoken to him in years..
Part of me had hate for Alex and I thought some mean things. But I also feel pretty shitty, a good friend of mine died and I wish he dind't live the lie he did, maybe things would have been different and it's a shame. I don't know how to deal with this kind of emotion because I don't know how to feel about it so I just wanted to tell you guys..  I think my biggest wish concerning this situation is that I wish before he died that we could have settled this. The more I think about it the more it saddens me, even thought it was all fake it was a big part of my life those couple of years..

May you rest in peace alex, you will never be forgotten in my mind."
4torpz,2,2016-07-19,Profile Review T25 for the Fall of 2017,MBAadmit,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/4torpz/profile_review_t25_for_the_fall_of_2017/,"Hey guys I am looking for a little bit of help as I am considering applying to MBA programs this fall. Right now I am more or less curious to see how high I can go. If I can't get the programs I am most interested in and feel like I am selling myself short, I could potentially hold off for one more year. However, I feel I can contribute to an MBA program sooner than later. The question really is how realistic am I being and how high can I go? 

Work experience:

- 1 1/2 years: Internship at a regional insurance company. I was able to network and create my own job within the company. They had never hired an intern before. I convinced them I could add value and they gave me a shot. After holding the internship for more than a year in college they've hired at least one intern per year since then. 

- 1/2 years: Financial Analyst Internship at a fortune 100 company. To add some context it is one of the biggest aerospace companies on the fortune 500 list. 

- 1 1/3 year: Big 4 Public Accounting. This was my first job outside of college  Before moving onto my next role I was able to senior a benefit plan with 3 staff under me.

- 1/2 year (current): Senior Analyst at a fortune 500 company. I work a lot of their P&amp;L's and do a lot of presentations with management. At the time of starting the MBA I would be close to 2 years in this role. 

Extra curricular activity:

- Vice President of my college's accounting club 

- I volunteer at multiple places that deal with underprivileged youth education 

- Led a team to the finals of a business ethics case competition at a major university 

- 4 years of intramural sports

Undergrad school/major:

- Bachelors in Accounting with a 3.7 GPA from a mid-sized private university

Other education/coursework/certifications:

- I am a CPA 

Race/nationality:

- 24 year old / White / Male 

GMAT Score:

-740

Goal of MBA:

-Big Picture: Every chance I've been able to be a leader I've cherished and enjoyed the opportunity. Although I've gotten a taste of leadership at a young age I want to put myself in a spot where I can really learn a lot more about myself as a leader and teacher so I can take that next step and really drive results in a positive, fun, and creative way. 

-More Specific: I want to be able to make the career transition from accounting and finance to the consulting side and then a few years down the road go off an do my own thing. I want to work with or found a non-profit that targets children who may not have access to the education your or I did. These kids need to understand that growing up may be a struggle, but education can be their road to prosperity if they're given the correct resources. 

Target schools:

-I am looking primarily at the top 25, ideally I want top 15. Darden and Ross are two programs I have my kept my eye on. I've also been doing some research on UCLA. Are these legitimate options? Should I focus on reaching for a few schools higher, or maybe I am just dreaming with these three to begin with. 

Thanks for the help in advance. "
4totns,2,2016-07-19,Been looking for my first job for months part 2,aggressiveplayer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4totns/been_looking_for_my_first_job_for_months_part_2/,"Hey all. So I've made steady progress each week working on my side project and learning some new technology. For those of you that don't know about my current situation, you can read about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4p27q6/took_a_break_and_have_been_looking_for_a_job_for/). Now, I have a couple of questions given the situation I'm in. 

1. **Do I continue working on my side project, or do I practice algorithms and data structures, or both?** I feel like currently algorithms and data structures are somewhat of a tossup for me. Depending on the question, I might be able to  work out a good solution for it, or I might not be able to. But I think for the most part I can't write completely bugless code on whiteboard in one sweep. I usually make mistakes and I sometimes get confused or stumped in the process of writing code because new details emerge that I haven't thought about when I write it out.

2. **Is it okay if I still apply to software engineering internships given my circumstances (graduated, haven't found a job, had previous software engineering internship experiences)? What do I tell recruiters if they ask me why I'm applying for an internship rather than a full time position? Also, if an internship states that they usually want people who are about to graduate or something of that sort and I've already graduated should I apply to those anyway?**

3. I ask the above because from my personal experiences it has generally be easier to get an internship. For my previous internships which I got offers from, they asked fairly easy algorithm questions, and I think they weighed more on my passion (previous personal projects) than seeing if I could solve algorithm problems. Internships also didn't hand out all these coding challenges on HackerRank and things of those sorts (which I usually fail because of the time limit and how you need 100% correctness and are usually somewhat difficult), although some companies did back then when I applied. Nowadays this seems to be a standard. The algorithm question that I was asked was probably just to check and make sure I knew how to code at all. This is also why I'm debating whether I should work on algorithms or my personal side project, because maybe I can get lucky with a company and they're looking for someone with more passion rather than focusing so much on problem solving abilities. So this leads me to my last question, **how comfortable should I have to be with algorithms and data structures?** I guess I'm really just trying to ask **what would make the best use of my time: working on my side project and learning new relevant technologies that companies want or data structures and algorithms)?**

4. I've noticed for the past 2 weeks there hasn't been many new jobs, and this is especially true for software eng. internships where there has been virtually none at all. **When will new openings start picking up again and when is the best time for me to apply?**

Sorry for the long post. I applaud you for reading this far and I appreciate any advice you can give me because I really don't want to be jobless any longer."

Did around 6 years of Taekwondo. I don't think I'll put this since I quit before middle school.

Tried out in Science Fair. Highest I've ever got to was 3rd place in school and honorable mention in regionals.

I was in fencing club for 1-2 years.

Probably won't be a semifinalist for national merit :(

I did nothing over the summer except going to a week-long music camp.

I like making video games. I've never finished making a single game, however.

**Schools:** (Computer Science Major and maybe composition as either minor or double major)

Carnegie Mellon (This is the only college I know that has the best comp sci AND music programs), MIT, Stanford, UT Austin, Georgia Tech. I would really like to expand this list with more colleges with good comp sci programs that aren't reach schools. Any suggestions?

Thank you for any help. Feel free to ask me for your own chance me thread reviews. To all other incoming seniors, GOOD LUCK!"
4tovol,76,2016-07-19,Freshman Please Be Prepared to Fail,Th3HoopMan,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/4tovol/freshman_please_be_prepared_to_fail/,"TLDR: Everybody here fails something at some point. THWg.

So every year this subreddit gets freshman making posts about 6 months before they even set foot on campus looking for advice, which is fine, but every year it's seems like a lot of the advice given goes through one ear and out the other. That's fine, a lot of stuff you need to learn on your own anyways, but there's one thing I really need you guys to do. Be prepared to fail. I can't stress this enough. The reason I'm making this post is because we as a campus are trying to help students with stress and depression, and failing at things for the first time really can hurt.

Now I'm not saying you will fail, I'm just saying be prepared. I hear FASET leaders, teachers, students say this every year and it still hits a lot of you like a sack of bricks. We understand you were valedictorian, you were class president, you're ""technically a junior"" by credits, that's cool, but Tech is beast and it will take you time to tamenit. 

I'm not going to go into extreme detail. Just know that failing isn't the end of the world, but please learn and don't make the same mistakes. Don't be afraid to ask for help. I'm going into my 4th year, currently working a summer internship, getting paid pretty well to do so, and I asks my manager questions every day, and I'm becoming a better software engineer because of it. Please reach out to your Professors, TA's, peers, or whoever for help if you're struggling with classes. If you're looking for the magical answer to start performing better in a certain class, this is it.

Don't be discouraged to be active. If you don't get into a certain organization that you saw on Tech Walkway, try another. There are plenty of awesome groups that welcome in new members each semester, and a lot of times you may fall in love with a group you never expected to.

When the career fair comes around, don't be angry if you don't get an internship because you don't have enough experience. Take that as a call to action to obtain more experience.

For those of you who took time to read this please heed my advice. Be prepared to fail. And if that time does come, don't beat yourself up over it. It's happened to all of us. Learn from these upcoming experiences and make yourself a stronger person through them. Can't wait to have you guys on campus in a few weeks.

&amp;nbsp;

During my time so far in this internship, I've come to realize that I do not find accounting to be enjoyable nor does it suit my interests.
&amp;nbsp;

I always had an interest in technology and would love to pursue a career in tech consulting. I find it to be an exciting field to get into especially considering how technology is impacting today's business environment.
&amp;nbsp;

With this in mind, how would you approach this situation and what recommendation would you have for me going forward? I understand that I may not have a favorable outcome so I would love to hear different perspectives on this matter!

TLDR:
&amp;nbsp;

- Interning at Big 4 in an accounting role
&amp;nbsp;

- interested in consulting (most likely tech consulting because of background)
&amp;nbsp;

- Be vocal or not? Pros &amp; cons?
&amp;nbsp;

- Any stories whether successful or unsuccessful regarding a transfer?

4tp5pt,3,2016-07-19,Education- India and America,indian_in_texas,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4tp5pt/education_india_and_america/,"I am an undergraduate student a large university in Texas. I did 14 years of schooling in a CBSE affiliated school in India. Having spent a considerable amount of time in America, I thought it would be interesting for some folks here to read about a comparison of the educational system in India and in America. I'll post the things that I like better in America in this post, and if there is any kind of interest, I'll post about things which I liked better in India.

* Classes
My university has one of the best CS programs in the world, so my views might be colored slightly by that. However, I have many friends in all kinds of universities in India- from IITs and Delhi University to Indian colleges people would likely not recognize here. Similarly, I have friends in places like Stanford to American colleges that people won't recognize here.
The point is this- the American colleges are *better*. Not just the 'ivies', not just the Stanfords of the world. Even if you go to a place like ASU, which is very easy to get into, you would probably end up getting a better education than most colleges in India. I feel like this comes down to basically two things- American colleges having a lot more resources, and the respect given to professors in America. India is lacking severely in both these fields.
* Opportunities
Getting the same opportunities that one gets in America in India would require one to have much, *much*, ***much*** more intellect. This summer, I was able to score an internship through which I will be earning more per day than an intern at Infosys will earn in a month. Earning this sort of money working is simply not possible in India as a college student. More than that, there are ~easy~ opportunities to work with professors and organizations. There are thousands of events one can attend for self growth. There are thousands of student organizations that one can join to give oneself an advantage. For example, I will be an officer at a machine learning club next semester, and we will be doing things that actual data science experts do at their job, not just hold events like ""data science quiz"".
* Personal Space
There is a lot of respect for a ""personal bubble""- which is not just a physical but also a mental boundary around a person. So, you wouldn't squeeze 5 people in a place for 3. You wouldn't ask someone how much they earn. You wouldn't try giving relationship advice to someone you have just met. You wouldn't give people ""birthday bumps"". I know that a lot of such Indianisms are glorified and cherished by some here, but once you get used to people having respect for your personal space, it is kinda hard to go back.

These were just some things of the top of my head. If anyone wants to know anything about the differences between the Indian and American education system, feel free to comment and I'll answer it."
4tpc9u,22,2016-07-20,I am not able to sleep ( xpost /r/cscareerquestions ),epicboar,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/4tpc9u/i_am_not_able_to_sleep_xpost_rcscareerquestions/,"I want to pour a lot over here, as a person who wants to be a great developer and as someone who loves computer science. I am a student from India, graduated from an IT degree from a mid-tier college here. I regret wasting these past 4 years of my degree, not trying to improve myself as a programmer while others in my class have netted great great jobs and are far better than me. I do not have any personal projects apart from coursework. The only good project in my coursework was some QR Code scanning Android App and a Small VR Demo in Unity, both of then not share-able on Github because they are not that of good quality.

I stumbled upon this subreddit a few months ago. I always lived in a bubble where I thought I was a decent programmer, but now it has become evident to me where I lie. Everyday I come to this sub, I see threads where people share their personal project ideas, their resume. Their projects are so so good and they have done a few internships, I just cant help but be discouraged about myself. Where do I stand really? 'I am close to 22 and these people at high school in America are so much better, where the fuck do i even stand'.

I will be coming to the States for graduate school soon, and when I see LinkedIn profiles of many other people who have moved to USA for graduate school, I get even more discouraged. These guys have done awesome projects and published papers, maybe being a bubble and being so introverted and reserved didnt help me in college.

In short, I am literally the embodiment of the CS Graduate Meme you see circulating on 4chan. 

People tell me, my parents try to motivate me saying, 22 isn't too late, you can still improve, but theres this huge mental block I have in my mind which is really getting hard for me to beat. I just came to know about books like CtCI and PIE only just recently, one can only imagine what a reality check I had, how far behind I am in this rat race.

I want a decent job, I really love software development. I am currently interning right now at a place where I am not doing much, but the projects involved are really good, this is the first time I am looking at production level code, I am struggling a bit to understand. Typing this right now has really helped me, I have not been able to sleep properly at night due to this. The cycle of unproductive days and sleep isnt helping either, apart from the 'showing up' at my current internship work I am doing.

How can I improve in 2 years while I am in the states? Am I only kidding myself? Even if I give it my all will I get there? ... all these questions scrape the corners of my brain.

I am sorry for this rant but it has been plaguing my life for a long time and I wanted to share this with people who are in the same field as me or be a speaker for those who have been struggling the same way. I love you guys and what you have achieved and like you, I love computer science that is why I managed to maintain a decent GPA of 3.6 and but I cant help but put myself down compared to you guys.

TL;DR: I am 22 yr old IT grad from India, literally shit at programming, want to improve to get a good job after my masters, mental block because I cant stop comparing myself to others and cribbing about the past."

I do very well in school and potentially have a shot of getting in, but as these schools are really competitive I was wondering how much coding experience I would be expected to have. I led my FIRST programming team last year (we made it to the world competition) so I have some Java experience and have done some image processing stuff. On my own I've learned some basic web development, Python, and Haskell stuff, but I haven't really done any major projects. I see a lot of the kids applying to these schools have gone to hackathons, built apps that win awards, and have internships, while I haven't even taken a CS class yet. Basically I'm just wondering if I would have a shot at all with my minimal coding experience."
4tpgnx,0,2016-07-20,My wife is applying red pill tactics to our marriage,Annndyhrow,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/4tpgnx/my_wife_is_applying_red_pill_tactics_to_our/,"My wife has started applying RP tactics to our marriage 

We're both 26. Got married in April. Have been together since we're 21.  

She has been withholding sex for a good two months. She works long hours some days and has to do work when she gets home sometimes. That's fine. When work is getting too much for her she started to tell me she's just too tired for sex, she has a lot of work to do get done, deadlines, etc. She's a technical writer so she gets a lot of big projects. So around March, after we haven't been sleeping together for two months, I ask her if she knows when our sex life will go back to normal (we had a pretty active sex life). She doesn't take the conversation seriously, says we don't need to have sex everyday, I yell at her, she yells at me, she goes to bed. Few days later I ask her again, she rolls her eyes, says I'm acting like a 14 year old boy and she's not interested in sleeping with someone so immature.

My wife comes with me to a work function. Stupid dinner thing. There's this hot ass intern there. She flirts with me and I do it back. It's all friendly so I decided why not flirt with her in front of me wife a bit. I do, but my wife just has this smirk on her face and looks like she's trying not to laugh. I mention on the way home if my wife liked her, and she said ""Yeah, she's cute. She was really nice"". And our convo ends. Still no sex.

Fast forward a couple weeks and we go out to dinner with a bunch of friends. My friend brings his girlfriend, we'll call her Emma and she's showing us photos on her Instagram account. She shows a photo with a bunch of girls we don't know, and I figure why not try some more dread. I point out one of the girls, hot brunette, 22, and say ""Who's that?"" It's a friend from work apparently. I say ""Hm, you should have brought her tonight"". My wife looks at me, snorts and laughs and goes back to eating. 

Still no sex. Fast forward another couple weeks, Emma wants to go out again to dinner. My wife has her on loud speaker when she asks us to go out. We're free so we say yes. I say, ""Will you bring your friend from work? That girl you showed us?"" Emma asks why. My wife snickers at me and shakes her head and says ""Yeah, bring her. I wanna met her"". I ignore her reaction. Still no sex.

So we go out to dinner again and Emma, her boyfriend, and her brunette friend, we'll call her Cara, are already there. My wife has no problem greeting her and being friendly. I spend some time flirting with Cara in front on my wife but she doesn't care. Me and Cara go off to order more drinks, but my wife insists she tags along. I roll my eyes, we go to the counter, some college kid is there, frat boy looking kid, my wife openly flirts with him in front of us. She's got a dress which shows a good amount of my tits, and my wife always does this thing where she plays with her necklace and then touches the skin there. It always makes me look. It makes this kid at the counter look too and he just smiles smugly at her. My wife tells us to go back to the table and that she'll order. I say I can stay. She makes a face at the college kid and does a little eye roll. She says ""So clingy"" and literally giggles at this kid who laughs at me. I don't say anything. We order. Go sit down. He comes with our drinks (even though I'm pretty sure it was someone else's job) and my wife touches his arm. They whisper to each other about something, and I try to talk to Cara but my focus is on my wife. They laugh about something and he goes back to work.

When we drive home I ask her what that was about, this is how the conversation goes:

""So what was that about?""

""What?""

""You were flirting with that guy"".

""Yeah"". And she says this like its so obvious.

""Right in front of me...""

""Yeah... And?""

""And? That's all you have to say?""

She shrugs. ""It was innocent. He gave me his number but I probably won't even call him. We'll see.""

I didn't even know what to say to her, so I just keep mouth shut until we get home.

I ask her to apologise. She laughs and goes to bed. I sleep in the guest room.

Fast forward next day.

""Has that guy texted you?""

""Which one?"" (I didn't realise until later that this might mean she's texting more than one guy).

""That guy from the restaurant?""

""Oh Tyler? Yeah."" She literally smiles when she says his time.

""Did you text him back?""

""Yeah, he's funny. We might go out with emma to the movies this weekend"".

""Are you fucking him?""

""Nope"".

""Do you want to?""

She smiles at me. ""Why wouldn't I want to"".

""If you're gonna keep acting like this we can just get a divorce."" (I was being dramatic, I know)

She cringes. I think she's gonna apologise. ""Good luck getting a better lawyer."" (She makes more money than me and she always jokes about it even though I tell her not to). 

""I'm being serious. Is this because I was flirting with that girl the other night? You can't be that fucking petty"".

She shrugs. ""Don't be so dramatic. I was just flirting with him. Learn to sort your insecurities out before taking them out on me"".

I'm so fucking angry at this point that I just leave the lounge room. I couldn't handle how annoying and disgusting she was being. I don't know what to after this. She does not give a shit. She's always shown some signs of being a fucking sociopath but I didn't know it was this bad. It need advice.

As a CS student, I'm applying to the same companies every year.

What I'm worried about is the fact that if I've received internship offer from a company multiple times, and I turn them down every year, it'll look bad and will hurt my future chances of working there.

i.e. Apply for internship every year for 3 years, every time they accept me, I decline. Does that look bad?

My first two years were as a CS major, third year I switched to Operations Management &amp; Information Systems, fourth year back to CS and now on my final year of CS.

My third year I felt like I forgot everything I had done in the previous two years.  My fourth year I managed to get an A in my data structures &amp; algorithms class, but I feel like I didn't retain much... Also had a 5 month internship doing .net development over the spring semester, as well an A in my assembler class.

In the fall I'm taking computer architecture and a .net class.

I haven't really done anything outside of the classroom and my one internship.  I also don't really know what my favorite portion of CS is or what I want to go down as my career path.

Is there a list of essential things that I should know like the back of my hand to help stand out to the various companies at my career fair, even if I'm not exactly sure what I'm after yet?  Something I can practice everyday until I get to the fair?  I know it's not a whole lot of time but would there be anything in particular I should focus on?

I have a few friends and I have my family and I have a boyfriend, but I don't have anyone to talk to anymore. I feel like everyone is getting sick of my complaining. I feel like no one will ever understand how awful I feel constantly.

I have so much to say that I am not really sure where to start. I just want to talk to someone and get it out. I am 20 currently. I was a self harmer for many years in high school and early college. I have not cut myself in about 8 months, but honestly the only reason I haven't is because I don't want my boyfriend to call a hospital or something if he sees it. I haven't told anyone this, but I think about cutting literally every day. I fantasize about doing it again. I don't think I will, but I just think about it a lot.

 I just hate myself so much, I can't even explain it. I know I have friends and family who love me, but I feel like such a burden to them. Like they would be better off if I just disappeared. I work at a restaurant right now as a waitress, and I honestly believe everyone at my job hates me and it sucks the life out of me every fucking time I go into work. I am not exaggerating when I say that literally all of the other server are friends and go out together after work. I am the only one who isn't invited. They specifically never ask me. I have overheard them talking bad about me before. Saying that I'm annoying and no one likes working with me and that I should shut the fuck up. I try to be nice to people. I have only had a direct conflict with maybe one person there before, but I don't complain and I do my job. I have worked there for 4 years and during that time haven't made one friend. At this point, I honestly believe that it isn't them: its me. I am annoying. I talk too much about things no one cares about. I have a very loud voice and its so hard for me to control my volume sometimes and I know its annoying and I try so hard. Just this past Sunday a group of servers and hosts were gossiping up at the host stand and when I walked up there, they all just stopped talking, you know like people do when they are talking about you. I pretended I just went up there to grab some napkins and walked into the back to do my sidework. Later on I heard one of the girls who was at the host stand tell another girl who wasn't there that they thought I overheard them. I didn't, but that confirmed they were talking about me. It makes me want to die. I am so serious when I say that. It makes me hate myself so fucking much.

I know what everyone is thinking, ""why don't you just quit,"" and I honestly am thinking about doing it. But I am really worried about finding a new job that will accommodate my hours. I go to school full time and I am on an academic team at school that I end up traveling around the country a lot for (as in I sometimes have to take 3 weekends in a row off of work to travel). The one thing I like about my current job is the managers are nice and always give me the days off I ask for without giving me shit about it. I doubt any other job would accommodate that schedule and honestly being on that team is so important to me. Its one of the few things I feel confident doing and that I look forward to. I don't want to give it up. I don't know, this restaurant job is the only job I have really ever had other than volunteer jobs and internships. Would other places that are minimum wage typically let me take that many days off? Is this job my only option?  I just am not sure what to do.

I feel like a failure at almost everything, not just my job. I feel like no matter what I do with my family, my boyfriend and my friends, like I always fuck up and get someone mad at me. 

I also am worried about my future. I have always been a very sensitive and emotional person. I cry really easily at everything. When I get embarrassed, I cry. When I get angry, I cry. When I get flustered, I cry. When I get frustrated I cry. I have tried so hard to keep it under control, but I am so bad at it. I really want to go to law school some day, but I have had so many people tell me they don't think I have the personality for it or I'm not cut out for it. I interned in a public defenders office this past summer and I love the internship and working with people and helping them with legal issues and learning about the law, but what if everyone else is right? I just feel like so many people look down at me and don't respect me because of how emotional I am and it really hurts. 

I hate myself so much. I hate myself more than I've ever hated a person before. I hate the way I look, how loud my voice is, how easily I cry, how I can never seem to find the line between asserting myself and being a bitch, how I have a really hard time not speaking my mind, how no matter where I go and how nice I try to be, I always end up being that one girl that everyone thinks is annoying and talks too much. 

I feel like I'm drowning constantly.

I know no one will read this whole thing, but it feels good to get out, even if it is on a throwaway. "
4tpmtc,1,2016-07-20,Married student looking for advice on housing (rent vs buy),zholl,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4tpmtc/married_student_looking_for_advice_on_housing/,"Hello PF! Sorry for the wall of text, but I'm trying to work through a lot of information, and I want to make sure I cover as much as possible. My wife (26 y/o) and I (23 y/o) are currently trying to figure out what to do for a place to live, and there's a bit of a debate now on whether we should actually go ahead and buy a place. I figured I'd come here and ask for some other perspectives on the matter.

I'll go into more detail further down, but a little background first: I am currently an undergrad student working on my electrical engineering degree. I'm working full time through it, so while I'm about halfway through, I still have about 5 years before I finish the program. My wife is not in school. We are currently living with my parents after I took a few months off of working at my previous job to focus on school and getting an internship in my field.

As for income, she works part time making $17/hr, and is currently looking for additional work to bring her up to full time. I work full time as an intern making $12/hr, and expect to be kept on long term based on my 90-day review (I did ask about long-term employment, this is not an assumption from a positive review). I currently have 6% going to my 401k to receive the full 3.5% match. Additionally, we have a 26% share of a small S-corp which we took home about $2200 at the end of last year after taxes.

We have absolutely zero debt at this time. Both of our cars were paid off before we married, and I've been able to work through school to avoid student loans. We also have four shares of stock in my father-in-law's company, which were gifted to us December 2014 when we married. At the time they were worth about $7000 a piece ($28000 total). I do not know the current value, though knowing what I know of the company they should have appreciated some since we received them. We have a little over $17k in the bank right now. About $5k is our emergency fund, $4k is for tuition, and $2k for other short term savings goals. The rest is either allocated to other expenses or not yet budgeted.

&amp;nbsp;

Our typical monthly income and required expenses (minus rent) when we're living on our own looks about like this:

&amp;nbsp;
Take home - $2740

Groceries - $250

Gas - $150

Eating out - $120

Medical - $300

Tithing - $274

Phone - $60

Internet - $60

USAA - $113

Utilities - $160

Misc - $100

Everything else (after rent) goes towards various savings goals, starting with tuition.

&amp;nbsp;

What we're ultimately trying to figure out is whether we can afford to buy a small house at this point, or if we should stick to renting for the time being. The issue we're running into is the cost of rent. Rent here in Colorado Springs seems to be coming up very quickly, apparently driven by Denver commuters. For example, the apartment we were renting last year for $800 would now cost us about $1300. We've found some similar apartments in less convenient parts of town for around $900. If you look at anything much cheaper than that, you're starting to look at complexes that seem to have a lot of issues with crime, pests, or other issues that make them much less desirable. Even then, a lot of these sketchier apartments seem to still start somewhere above $700, at which point it seems like we might as well tighten up the budget to live somewhere we'd be a bit more comfortable in while we try to bring my wife's income up a bit.

On the other hand, there are a number of homes for sale in the area in the $100-200k range that are in decent areas of town and that seem to be in decent shape.  They'd also be a bit bigger than anything we can get in an apartment, plus we'd have a lot more flexibility to make a house our own space than we would with an apartment. For reference, we can get a 30-year fixed rate mortgage for $170k at 3.375%, assuming we can sell our stocks for about $30k as a down payment on a $200k home. All said and done, a mortgage on a home ranging $100-200k would come out to $309-752/month. Because of my current school situation, we're pretty much guaranteed to be here for the next 5 years, so it's not like we're looking to hop around much for a while anyway. Also, average property tax for El Paso County is about 0.5%, which I'm pretty sure would top out at only $1000 if we're in a $200k home. 

Unfortunately, I don't have a good grasp on the rest of the expenses that go into owning a home, so it's hard to make an apples to apples comparison to renting. So I ask the Redditors of PF, would it be better for us to keep renting at this point, or does it actually make sense buying? If we buy, what all am I missing that I need to keep in mind when looking for a place? "
4tpn8y,2,2016-07-20,Unpaid Internship After Graduation,jwlls,PublicRelations,https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicRelations/comments/4tpn8y/unpaid_internship_after_graduation/,"Hello everyone!

I posted here about a month or two ago about how I was having trouble finding an internship or job after graduating in December. I got some help with my resume (thank you to those who reached out to me) and had a tad bit better luck getting interviews.

I was able to land an internship in Chicago. It's unpaid and I would be there two days out of the week. What I am happy about is that it is a true PR internship, something I have not had, and I am so eager to learn. 

The problem is: it is unpaid with a stipend at the end of the internship. I have had 4 other internships which were all paid but that wasn't enough to find a job post-grad.

At this point I am willing to do whatever it takes to get the true PR experience I need so that this can be my last internship. 

Will a two days week, eight hours a day, 4-month internship be enough to get me an entry-level job? My other internships have been at a news station, a transportation corporation, a marketing agency and an events coordination internship. 

Any advice is welcomed! (Just a FYI-- my degree is in journalism with a minor in PR) 

THANKS!

It's not an impressive resume by any means but I'm just looking to see where I stand. For my personal qualities of interest, I don't mind a large scale school in city environments. I prefer to stay in-state though I'm open to out of state colleges. The main trait for colleges I'm looking for is quality of education and relative location of said college in terms of internship and job opportunities. Any suggestions of reach, match, and safety colleges are greatly appreciated.

Interviewed with a B4 firm and got offered an internship position in the Tax department. Unfortunately for me, Assurance wasn't necessarily in need of interns since its a slower season while Tax is looking to have their hands full in August-October. My goal was to get internship experience at a B4 firm and this at least gets my foot in the door. Still going to give me hands-on experience in the meantime.

My question is for those who have been in a similar situation (interested in assurance/offered tax and vice versa), did you accept the offer? If so, how did working in another department than your choice work out? Did you learn to like it, changed your preference to that particular department, or did you end up finding out you really didn't like it? Thanks."
4tpu9y,3,2016-07-20,Are there internship opportunities for older people pursuing a CFA without a finance background?,AlkaloidSwag,CFA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFA/comments/4tpu9y/are_there_internship_opportunities_for_older/,"tl:dr 

Unemployed chemist looking to start a career in financial analysis business analysis by getting an internship or a small position. Looking to fill the void of unemployment with an internship or an entry level position. What opportunities are there for older (24 yo) college grads to get my food in the door in finance? 


Brief Outline of my situation:

I've been unemployed since late march so about 4 months this week. Most of my time is spent studying for the CFA, building a portfolio in python and SQL, and applying to jobs in the city. 


Brief Background:

1. Boston U class of 2014 chemistry B.A no honors but 2+ years of research. 

2. Had a Job as a Chemist in Mass for about a year and a half and then half the company got laid off with me in there. 

3. desperately took another job closer to home in Newark (I'm from NYC). things didn't work out after 3 months, i got 'let go'. 

What I'm trying to achieve: 
I'm trying to land an internship or a position at a company or a startup as a way to break into financial/business analysis. 


Current Plan:

I think my current route if I don't meet anyone or land a job is to try for the Recurse center once I build up a decent portfolio and work on a project for 3 months. After that I should hopefully have passed my CFA level 1 test and the recurse center attempts to place you in a programming job by the time you finish the program. I think with some programming experience especially in SQL and a CFA candidacy I can move on to a SQL developer/business analyst position within the year. 


What opportunities are there realistically for someone like me to get my foot in the door in financial analysis?"
4tq0e8,6,2016-07-20,Can't decide which server to get as my new 'main' server. Any tips appreciated.,AcidNoiz,homelab,https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/4tq0e8/cant_decide_which_server_to_get_as_my_new_main/,"Hello Homelabbers,

&amp;nbsp;


I just graduated and lived in a dorm for 5 years. Since a few years I have had some servers in my room. The main server was a whitebox server. (Fractal Define Mini case, intel s1200v3rps, e3-1220v3, 32GB ECC, 4x 2TB WD RE, 2x 250GB SSD) This server ran proxmox with my pfsense VM, a lot of linux VM's for testing and school stuff, an xpenology VM as my NAS and would be on 24/7 since it served as both my NAS and router. Additionally, I have 2 DL380 G6's to run an openstack environment to test stuff on for my internship. All the equipment connected to an Eaton 5px 3000VA UPS. As I lived in a small room in a dorm, all the stuff would just sit on the floor next to my desk.

&amp;nbsp;


Now that I live back at my parents house, I picked up a 24u APC rack for 50 euros and decided to order some rails and mount the UPS and the DL380s. The fractal case can obviously not be rack-mounted and the 32GB RAM and CPU won't suffice much longer (I'll need more VM's that my family can use too and will add a few VM's for friends to host game/web servers on), so I decided to sell the server (without the drives) and look for a new, more powerful, rack-mountable main server. The main server will also provide storage to my test cluster on the DL380's if needed.

&amp;nbsp;


That didn't turn out to be so easy, so I was hoping you guys could help me to decide what to do. Some requirements:

* Low power consumption and low noise are a MUST. The DL380g6 servers are a good reference point. Mine are loaded with 36GB ram each, dual x5550's, dual 750W power supplies and 2x 146GB 15k sas. They draw about 130watts when idle/under light load and are silent enough since I removed the extra PCIe ethernet adapters. Anything that consumes less than this and is more silent is ok. On average, electricity costs me 0.2 euros per kWh. 150W load = 263 euro/year, 100W is just 175/year so as it runs 24/7 for 5 years, that would justify spending at least 450 euros extra now. 

* The server must be rack mountable 

* The server must have at least 8 RAM slots 

* The server must have at least 4 3.5"" bays for my 2TB drives and at least 2 extra 3.5"" or 2.5"" bays for the SSD's (I find a lot of great servers, 3.5"" bays seems to be a feature that raises the price dramatically). Preferably more 3.5"" slots to allow for more storage if needed - The server should support ESXi 6 and server 2012r2 (not sure which one I'll use yet) - The raid/hba card must support 6Gbit SATA connections (the p410i switches to 3Gbps when using SATA instead of SAS) and being able to do JBOD would be nice.

&amp;nbsp;


What I've considered so far: 

* DL180G6 with 14x LFF: would need an extra HBA/raid card than p410i, lower power consumption than dl380g6, no clue about noise levels, no esxi6 support? 

* DL380G6 with 6x LFF: would need an extra HBA/raid card than p410i, limited to 4x HDD and 2x SSD, almost impossible to find in Europe, no esxi6 support? 

* R510 with 12x LFF and 2x SFF internal: power consumption +/- the same as DL380 G6, no clue about noise, no esxi6? 

* R710 with 6x LFF: higher power consumption than DL380G6, also louder? limited to 4xHDD and 2x SSD

&amp;nbsp;


The servers listed above can be found for 150-400 euros depending on how lucky you are and what their specs are. I've also looked at the following server, for which I decided to limit my budget to 1500 euros:
 
* DL80 gen9: extremly low power consumption (+/- 60W), but lower clocked CPU. Also not that easy to find with decent RAM for a decent price. 

* DL380p/DL380e (gen8): not that much lower power consumption than the G6, but way better performance for the power that's consumed, apparently dead silent, not that easy to find below 1500 euros, but once every few weeks you can get lucky and find a dual 8-core machine with +/- 64GB RAM for 1400-1600 euros. 

* R720: almost on par with the DL380p, but more noisy? 

* R730: can't seem to find a good deal for the 3.5"" version

&amp;nbsp;


I have no experience with these newer servers, so if anyone can tell me more about them, or point out some important factors I should now about, please tell me. I've also looked at the dell C2100 servers, but apparently these are not great for small environments? I must have looked at a truckload of other models, but the ones listed above seemed to be the most popular ones. If someone knows a better server/solutions, don't hesitate to comment.

&amp;nbsp;


Many thanks in advance!"
4tq1z1,3,2016-07-20,My wife is applying red pill tactics to our marriage,Annndyhrow,askMRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/askMRP/comments/4tq1z1/my_wife_is_applying_red_pill_tactics_to_our/,"My wife has started applying RP tactics to our marriage 

We're both 26. Got married in April. Have been together since we're 21.  

She has been withholding sex for a good two months. She works long hours some days and has to do work when she gets home sometimes. That's fine. When work is getting too much for her she started to tell me she's just too tired for sex, she has a lot of work to do get done, deadlines, etc. She's a technical writer so she gets a lot of big projects. So around March, after we haven't been sleeping together for two months, I ask her if she knows when our sex life will go back to normal (we had a pretty active sex life). She doesn't take the conversation seriously, says we don't need to have sex everyday, I yell at her, she yells at me, she goes to bed. Few days later I ask her again, she rolls her eyes, says I'm acting like a 14 year old boy and she's not interested in sleeping with someone so immature.

My wife comes with me to a work function. Stupid dinner thing. There's this hot ass intern there. She flirts with me and I do it back. It's all friendly so I decided why not flirt with her in front of me wife a bit. I do, but my wife just has this smirk on her face and looks like she's trying not to laugh. I mention on the way home if my wife liked her, and she said ""Yeah, she's cute. She was really nice"". And our convo ends. Still no sex.

Fast forward a couple weeks and we go out to dinner with a bunch of friends. My friend brings his girlfriend, we'll call her Emma and she's showing us photos on her Instagram account. She shows a photo with a bunch of girls we don't know, and I figure why not try some more dread. I point out one of the girls, hot brunette, 22, and say ""Who's that?"" It's a friend from work apparently. I say ""Hm, you should have brought her tonight"". My wife looks at me, snorts and laughs and goes back to eating. 

Still no sex. Fast forward another couple weeks, Emma wants to go out again to dinner. My wife has her on loud speaker when she asks us to go out. We're free so we say yes. I say, ""Will you bring your friend from work? That girl you showed us?"" Emma asks why. My wife snickers at me and shakes her head and says ""Yeah, bring her. I wanna met her"". I ignore her reaction. Still no sex.

So we go out to dinner again and Emma, her boyfriend, and her brunette friend, we'll call her Cara, are already there. My wife has no problem greeting her and being friendly. I spend some time flirting with Cara in front on my wife but she doesn't care. Me and Cara go off to order more drinks, but my wife insists she tags along. I roll my eyes, we go to the counter, some college kid is there, frat boy looking kid, my wife openly flirts with him in front of us. She's got a dress which shows a good amount of my tits, and my wife always does this thing where she plays with her necklace and then touches the skin there. It always makes me look. It makes this kid at the counter look too and he just smiles smugly at her. My wife tells us to go back to the table and that she'll order. I say I can stay. She makes a face at the college kid and does a little eye roll. She says ""So clingy"" and literally giggles at this kid who laughs at me. I don't say anything. We order. Go sit down. He comes with our drinks (even though I'm pretty sure it was someone else's job) and my wife touches his arm. They whisper to each other about something, and I try to talk to Cara but my focus is on my wife. They laugh about something and he goes back to work.

When we drive home I ask her what that was about, this is how the conversation goes:

""So what was that about?""

""What?""

""You were flirting with that guy"".

""Yeah"". And she says this like its so obvious.

""Right in front of me...""

""Yeah... And?""

""And? That's all you have to say?""

She shrugs. ""It was innocent. He gave me his number but I probably won't even call him. We'll see.""

I didn't even know what to say to her, so I just keep mouth shut until we get home.

I ask her to apologise. She laughs and goes to bed. I sleep in the guest room.

Fast forward next day.

""Has that guy texted you?""

""Which one?"" (I didn't realise until later that this might mean she's texting more than one guy).

""That guy from the restaurant?""

""Oh Tyler? Yeah."" She literally smiles when she says his time.

""Did you text him back?""

""Yeah, he's funny. We might go out with emma to the movies this weekend"".

""Are you fucking him?""

""Nope"".

""Do you want to?""

She smiles at me. ""Why wouldn't I want to"".

""If you're gonna keep acting like this we can just get a divorce."" (I was being dramatic, I know)

She cringes. I think she's gonna apologise. ""Good luck getting a better lawyer."" (She makes more money than me and she always jokes about it even though I tell her not to). 

""I'm being serious. Is this because I was flirting with that girl the other night? You can't be that fucking petty"".

She shrugs. ""Don't be so dramatic. I was just flirting with him. Learn to sort your insecurities out before taking them out on me"".

I'm so fucking angry at this point that I just leave the lounge room. I couldn't handle how annoying and disgusting she was being. I don't know what to after this. She does not give a shit. She's always shown some signs of being a fucking sociopath but I didn't know it was this bad. It need advice.

I have approximately one more year until my inactive clearance turns into an expired one. I just recently learned that a lot of software engineering positions in the defense industry list *active* clearance as a basic qualification. I want to keep those opportunities open to me.

From what I have gathered on this sub, most companies prefer to take on upperclassmen for their intern positions; however, I will lose this clearance before I even begin my 2nd year if I don't take on a position that requires it. My coding experience is (relatively) very limited. I've recreated hangman, I've solved 34 problems on project Euler, and now I'm working on a fractal art generator. I only worked in java.

4tqox2,3868,2016-07-20,Dear Democrats: An open letter from a Sanders supporter to Democrats calling for “unity.” Here is how it looks from my side.,oct8ngle,SandersForPresident,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/4tqox2/dear_democrats_an_open_letter_from_a_sanders/,"Dear Democrats,

As the absurd Trump convention grinds on, somewhere in Philadelphia I imagine there is an army of volunteers inflating one hundred thousand colorful balloons. It is no secret that not all of us are going to be in a celebratory mood when those balloons rain down upon the heads of the new nominee and that of her husband, the 42nd President of the United States. My bittersweet moment of excitement will have come and gone by then. It will take place on Monday night, when Senator Bernie Sanders will make his speech to the convention.


Many have been the calls for unity before those balloons are released. Many have been the angry, accusatory columns written by Democratic columnists decrying the “Bernie Bros,” the “millennials,” the “unrealistic,” and the “naïve.” Just to be clear, I happen to not be any of those things. But what if I were? Despite being neither millennial nor naïve nor bro, I still resent every one of these slights. They are unhelpful at best. At worst, they are insulting, dehumanizing and marginalizing of the very best of human intentions. What exactly is wrong with being a millennial? Being hopeful and idealistic? Wanting everyone to get a fair shake? Being against war and for justice? Being concerned about the poor, the working class, and the middle class? Is it really so wrong to be disappointed with the way partisan politics, including on the Democratic side, has been going?


You can marginalize us and minimize our concerns, you can seek unity with us, but you can’t do both. Unity requires dialogue. It is in this spirit that I am writing this letter to you. 


Some things just won’t work. Pointing out your Trump card, who is actually named Trump, is not enough to achieve any sense that we are on the same page. All progressives are horrified at the prospect of Trump as president. That, however, is not enough to cause me to celebrate when those balloons drop. A common opponent is not unity.


So here is my little attempt to communicate across a divide. I am saddened, first of all, by the fact that I have no idea where to send this. To the email addresses of every superdelegate? To Debbie Wasserman Schultz herself? To the letters to the editor section of a local newspaper? To Slate or Salon, The Nation or The Atlantic? After this year, I have no idea how a progressive voter who has been dissatisfied with the Democrats for his entire life can hope to be heard. 


In 1992 I served as a delegate for Jerry Brown to the Vermont State Democratic Convention, when we were trying to beat the first Clinton. Bill won the presidency promising law and order and an “end to welfare as we know it.” He was so in favor of the death penalty that he left the campaign trail to see that a mentally handicapped man on death row was executed in Arkansas. As president he signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, the first of a series of “free trade” agreements that have destroyed the middle class in the years since. He signed the legislation that ended the Glass Steagall Act. He and his supporters ended whatever was left of FDR’s Democratic Party and replaced it with what was essentially pro-choice Republicanism. A kinder and gentler Republican Party.


Democrats rejoiced. After years of wandering in the wilderness of Reagan and Bush Sr., Bill Clinton had showed the way to win again. As a bonus, Democratic coffers surely filled with money from big business now that the party had so solidly come into their fold. 


I did not rejoice. Nor did Bernie Sanders. We wanted to continue the proud tradition of being the liberal party, the party of the working class.


An argument ensued, an argument that has not ceased to this day. The argument that unfolded between Hillary and Bernie this year was not new. It has been going on for decades. The Clinton forces argued that we could no longer be the party of the New Deal. We could no longer win that way. The country had changed.

Our job, the liberals countered, was not to give in, was not to emulate the Republicans in order to win, but to fight for our ideals, to educate. To bring voters back to us through consistency and truth.


A quarter of a century has passed and certain results are now in. The cries for “law and order” have left the United States with the most people in prison in the entire world, more than authoritarian China. That is shameful. The endless tax breaks for the rich and corporations have left our once great infrastructure in shambles. The calls for “free trade” have led to the complete decimation of our manufacturing base and of our middle class, just as was predicted. 


One can only wonder what might have been if the negotiations for those agreements had focused on protecting our workers and the environment instead of simply giving corporate America places to make their stuff as cheaply as possible. One can only wonder how much better things might have been if we had said to China, “If you want to make our gadgets, your workers must have democratic rights, the right to organize, and a living wage. Your environmental standards must be comparable to ours, both on paper and on the ground. We will not give up these environmental and work standards that our people have fought for, for generations, for a quick buck.”


So clear are the results of the Democrats’ twenty-five year experiment with Republican-lite, that even Hillary Clinton, one of the original champions of the so-called Third Way, now claims to be an economic progressive.


So here I am, dredging up the past and crying “I told you so.” Of course that can’t be the point. The point is that not everyone got these things wrong. The liberal and progressive voices of our party, who have been marginalized year after year, stand before you vindicated. Bernie Sanders stands before you vindicated. 


Your candidate says, “I voted for the Iraq war. I was wrong.” “I was for “free trade” agreements, hell, I was even for TPP not long ago. I was wrong.” “I called certain of my fellow Americans ‘superpredators’ and said we have to ‘bring them to heel.’ I was wrong.” But not only that. Not only are you choosing a candidate who consistently finds herself on the wrong side of history, you are choosing a candidate that is insincere even in her flip-flops. If you were wrong about the Iraq war, then why advocate for the Libyan one, creating yet more chaos and yet more space for ISIS? If you were wrong about “free-trade,” then why won’t you sign off on an anti-TPP statement in the Democratic platform? If we are honest, we all know the answer to these questions.


So why? Why should we continue down this terrible path? Everyone knows the answer to that too: money. Money that comes out of the pockets of working Americans and goes into the pockets of the rich and powerful. Money that is diverted from building the modern infrastructure that our country needs to succeed and goes instead to paying for tax-cuts for the wealthy. Money that is desperately needed to pay for healthcare and education and instead is squandered on prisons and foolish military interventions. Money that should be fairly paid by the rich as taxes that instead is spent on lobbying lawmakers who then pass rules that send that same money to stockholders and executives instead of workers.


Since all of this is known to all informed adults in this “our” party, am I really out of line when I point out that one of our major candidates has made, with her husband, 153 million dollars for giving speeches in the last 15 years, including 6.7 million dollars for speeches since the beginning of 2015 alone, and 2.7 million dollars by Bill *after Hillary officially kicked off her campaign,* while the other seems satisfied to live on his Senate salary and social security?


Bill and Hillary Clinton are not Bill Gates or Steve Jobs. They did not bring the world Windows or the iPhone. They did not create thousands upon thousands of jobs. Their income derives simply from their political influence. It may be old-fashioned, but many people still feel that the political influence of a member of the liberal, we the people’s party should not be for sale.


As of today, neither candidate has gotten the nomination. According to the rules, neither of them has gotten enough pledged delegates to win. It will be the superdelegates who will decide. It was profoundly wrong and undemocratic for hundreds of them to declare their allegiance to Clinton before a single vote was cast. That is done, but before they finish the job and vote at the convention I feel obligated to point out yet another thing:


Having a candidate or president who always skirts the rules has very negative effects on everyone in the United States. This goes beyond the simple selling of influence, which unfortunately remains legal in this country. 


We all remember the impeachment of Bill Clinton. We were all horrified that the Republicans would abuse their power in such a blatant way and drag us all through that sordid affair over what was essentially a private matter. I certainly do. The loss to the country in dignity and time wasted and policies not considered can never be measured. The fact that the Republicans shouldn’t have done it does nothing to change the fact that the President of the United States should not have been having sex in the Oval Office with an intern who was 22 years old at the time. He should not have lied about it to the public. He certainly should not have lied about it under oath.


The Republicans have proven that given the chance, they will do these things. The simplest way to avoid this kind of destructive situation is to elect presidents who are honest and dependable, whose character and decision-making are unassailable. People like President Obama. People like Bernie Sanders.


Hillary Clinton should not have tried to shield her emails from public recordkeeping laws, FOIA requests and congressional investigations. However unimportant you believe it to be, the fact remains that she did so for approximately six years. She only turned over these government records when asked to by the State Department. This is only the latest of these highly questionable personal decisions that seem to constantly come up when she is involved. You can be sure that when she is president, Republicans will spend ridiculous amounts of time and tax-payer money on these so-called “issues.” Our political process will again be hijacked by this endless, needless, utterly unproductive argument about her character. This is just what is meant by the term “Clinton fatigue.”


There are those who say that this is just what makes her a great candidate. She has been “vetted.” She is tough and has taken endless attacks and abuse. She is “ready to fight.” That is a ridiculous argument. The fact is that these kind of issues are a waste of the people’s time, their money and their good will. They are completely unnecessary. 


For proof that they are unnecessary, look no further than President Obama. He is as hated by Republicans as Hillary is. Yet he is not under investigation. The FBI has not recently called him “extremely careless” with state secrets. He has not been caught in multiple public lies this year. Surely the Republicans would gladly do to him what they have done to Clinton if given the chance. The fact is that he has not given them the chance. He is clean. This makes a huge difference, both in terms of what a president can accomplish in his or her limited time, and in how the world sees the United States of America.


By ignoring this, you are condemning the United States to an unending and destructive argument about the Clintons’ decisions and character instead of a focus on important issues. This need for us to focus on issues is why Bernie Sanders famously declared that he was “sick and tired of your emails.” The Republicans will have no such priorities. Bernie Sanders, like President Obama, is clean. His presidency would have been one about the issues facing the American people.


As I have said, the high point of the convention for me will be Senator Sanders' speech. I am sure many of you are hoping that his speech will be full of effusive praise for Secretary Clinton and an exuberant declaration that she is the one true answer to all of the problems that America faces. I certainly hope not, for that will rob me and millions of others like me of even that bittersweet moment. Rather, I hope (and expect) that the senator will decry the destructiveness of Donald Trump and the importance of keeping him out of the White House, a position I agree with wholeheartedly, and leave it at that. 


I expect the rest of his speech will be the very same one that he has been making for all of the last year, and really, for decades: full of broadsides against millionaires and billionaires who should not be able to buy the U.S. government along with everything else that they have usurped, cries for justice and dignity for the poor and the working class, a hopeful list of the things that we can create if we just all pull together: a single-payer Medicare for all healthcare system, free public college, a new and modern infrastructure instead of the sadly crumbling one we now possess. All of the greatest hits.


Bernie has said many times over the course of his campaign that it isn’t about him, it is about us, about millions of people coming together to say “enough is enough.” That is true. It is also about policy. It is about finding real solutions to real problems and then fighting for them everyday. You Democrats are angry at me for saying that this is not what you have been doing all along. I am angry at you for all of the reasons I have listed. 


Can we unify? Maybe. Perhaps not by the time you celebrate your balloon drop, but over the course of the next years as all of these young awakened people come into their own and use all that they’ve learned in the past year to fight for a better world? Maybe.


For us, it will begin with your party showing us that you want it to be our party too. 


We can find unity if together we can field honest, ethically-clean candidates. Candidates who have spent their careers in service to the public, not to their own personal power and their wealthy contributors. Candidates who are ready to stand up to the economic royalists, as FDR so rightly called them.


Bernie Sanders and the rest of the progressive wing of this party are ready to move forward with the momentum that they’ve gained this year. Will you treat them with respect? Refrain from marginalizing them? When in the majority will you give their bills a vote on the floor? Will you work with them to create a better, more progressive America?


I hope so. That will be what I call unity.


Edit: Thank you /u/KennySnyder and all of the other kind strangers for the gold! I am honored! Also thank you to all of the folks who have participated in this conversation in a reasonable and respectful way, whatever your viewpoint. Reasoned political discourse is where it's at!


For any who can afford it, please remember to give some of that real-life gold to the cause. Zephyr Teachout and Tim Canova, among others, are running to continue our political revolution!"

I was waiting for the 480 after markets and 1060 benchmarks, but I recently picked up a rather good deal on the Radeon R9 Fury and it changed up my build quite a bit. I think I am ready to pull the trigger on the rest of my parts, but I want to make sure that nothing will be bottle necking my performance before doing so.


**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

I play video games about as much I work or go to school. So quite a bit. I plan to use this PC to play, stream and maybe record games for the most part. Games include League of Legends, Rust, Fallout, and a little CSGO. 

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for?**

 I will most likely be playing at 1080p, but most likely go for a 144 Hz monitor. Above 60FPS when I am not streaming, around 60 or as close to as possible while streaming. It would be nice to play on ultra graphics settings as much as possible.
Replace this text with your answer.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

I am a college student, and still have monitors to buy. So keeping it around where its at, ($1000 maximum) would be much appreciated.

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

I am currently in China for an internship, but I am purchasing my parts from the US and will have them sitting on my desk when I arrive :)

4tr7gs,1,2016-07-20,2 Departments 1 Internship,Helpmyfriendzach,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4tr7gs/2_departments_1_internship/,"Hey all 

Background:
 Last November got an internship/Co op program where I would work part time during the school year and full time during breaks(summer, winter). The company that I work for originally was looking for 2 different interns, but hired me and split my time between departments. Which I spend 25 to 30 hours a week during the school year. 

Before accepting the position I was working at a place where I was the only engineering person. (small manufacturing company).  Where I was on salery (29kish/yr), detail that doesn't really matter but I feel that is note worthy, but i  was working in the mornings going to school, then working at night from home. It was a lot and there was a lot of harassment that I don't want to go into. But the experience I was getting was great. During school it was way to much for me, to the point where my GPA was around a 2.3ish. So I quit to work for this new Company,to cut down my work load from 50hrs/week to 25 to 30 at first. My overall GPA is around a 2.6ish,but if my classes go well this final 2 semester I should hit the 3.0 mark. 

New Company issues:
When I was in the discussion process of accepting the internship, both of the managers who would be my bosses said that I would be mostly working on project to gain experience. 

Boss A has not given me a single project or anything that I could put on my resume. Everything is data entry, no thought process literally looking at a piece of paper of what the employees did. Type it into the program and out pops a number. Boss A is also the head of the Industrial Engineering department (2 other people and me) , I am an IE major. I hate my time with the boss, even when I suggest projects I could look into instantly gets denied. The work I do is constant work that has a due date each week for pay roll. 

Boss B is great, she gives my projects where I am learning the machines, the process, and a lot of other things to do with my major. Boss B is the head of the business side of things and I am working with her to adjust the costing of the processes. The projects I have been doing do not really have any sort of due date. 

Issue:
This semester due to time limitations I will only be able to work 15 hours a week. I have the feeling that they will cut out the time with boss b completely, because it usually will take me the full 15 hours to do all the work with boss a. I do not want to work for boss a the full time during school. I do not gain anything on my resume from working with him, and I generally hate the work. 

Is there any way I can word it to ask my bosses to only work with one boss during the school year and not the other? The work and departments do not overlap at all. 

Thank you reddit."

It uses SQL to grab items based on the user input. All this information is stored in an excel file on the local machine, it is updated every time they enter new information. This program runs on about 20 computers and I'm looking for ideas to connect all these excel documents. All the machines are on the same network so I have considered making the program on every computer put the excel doc into a shared folder, then just adding all the data into one excel file from there. The output does not have to be in excel, I could change that. 

So basically I have a program that collects data from multiple users on different computers and I want to have all this data in the same place. 

Side note I am an intern and work independently, so I don't have anyone to go to for questions like this.

4trlgw,2,2016-07-20,Need some advice on signing bonuses and the strings that come with them/offer negotiations,Imadoctah,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4trlgw/need_some_advice_on_signing_bonuses_and_the/,"I'm an engineering student and I've been hoping from internship to internship for the last few years to pay for the last bit of my schooling.  This morning I was offered a new job at a company I would love to work for (I think) with the best hourly rate I've ever had to date.  To top it all off, it comes with a $1500 signing bonus.

My concern is that I was reading through the offer letter, and the signing bonus comes with a 1 year ""No quitting"" condition, and I'll have to repay it if I leave within the year.

I am already commuting an hour one way to $CurrentCompany, and $NewCompany would be no different.  I don't particularly mind the commute, but I had applied to a different location at $NewCompany in the hopes of loosing the commute, sadly their opening was here, so the commute remains.

While I think I will love it at $NewCompany, I worry about not being able to leave if things turn sour.  I don't foresee myself being able to hang onto the $1500 as just-in-case money as I am a student barely making my rent and tuition payments as it is.

My question is if anyone has ever had any experience turning down a signing bonus.  I was thinking of asking for an additional 50cents on my hourly in return for declining the signing bonus, as this will mean I cost less yearly at $NewCompany so they might be more inclined accept me rejecting the ""No Quit"" clause.  But at the same time in my experience interns have very little negotiating power.

Any and all advice is appreciated.

**EDIT:** Its not that I would blow the bonus on nonsense, wages from $CurrentCompany are no longer making ends meet as they have put an indefinite stop to OT, and I was working 50+ hrs weekly.  If spent, the signing bonus would go to pay of CCs that have been run up in the interim while looking for new work with better pay."
4trqx7,5,2016-07-20,Today marks my 10th anniversary for WoW. Wanted to take a moment to reflect on some of the great times I've had in Azeroth and how it affected me in the real world :),Bpc501,wow,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/4trqx7/today_marks_my_10th_anniversary_for_wow_wanted_to/,"I remember the first time I stepped into the universe of Azeroth. I was eleven years old, and it was July 20th, 2006. I was a Night Elf Druid. This was a new outlet for me to submerse myself in, as I was escaping the reality of an abusive father and countless bullies during middle school.

I met friends that guided me through challenges and quests, and introduced me to an entire new concept of social involvement. I joined my first guild, &lt;The Ghosts&gt;, and I remember dominating Goldshire for years into Burning Crusade with them. Those were happy times, and for the first moment in my life I felt like I belonged to something greater than myself. 

In 2009 I attended BlizzCon where I found a new home among thousands of other people who were just like me, and I knew that I was no longer an outsider in the real world. Come the end of Burning Crusade, I was a Draenei Shaman where I moved on to new friends and said farewell to old ones as life continued. I remember being on the wrestling team in high school and finding several other teammates who played WoW. 

We started a guild, and a fairly competitive one at that. We raided through Wrath of The Lich King and had our first Lich King kill at a local LAN center. The night was a frenzy. Viewers gathered around us as we championed an all-nighter to defeat Arthas. That moment went down in the books as one of the most significant moments in my life and WoW career. I had accomplished one of the most difficult tasks with hours of commitment among friends who loved me, and a family that lasted through the years.

As Cataclysm came around, this was the first time I took a hiatus from WoW. I met a girl, fell in love (several times as puppy love is known :)), and was finally coming to terms with who I was as a human being. I owed my new confidence and moral values to the obstacles I conquered in WoW. My mother was in a better place after the divorce of my father, and my family was finally in a healthy mindset. I remember signing back in and testing the new raid finder option. Killing Deathwing sparked my fire (pun intended) once again and I was back.
 
Now as a Human Warrior I moved through Mists of Pandaria with new allies and focused on PvP. In season 13 and 14 I struggled so much and could not manage to break a 2k rating. Once season 15 came around I finally managed to find a Rated Battleground team and the night I cleared 2k was one of the most amazing moments in my PvP career. I fell in love with this new gameplay style outside of PvE and made so many new friends along the way. Towards the end of 2014 I was a college freshman when Warlords came out. 

The nights of stress were relieved with arena matches, when pledgeship took a toll, I found a moment to breathe exploring Draenor, and when my heart was broken time and time again I was able to clear my mind with an all-nighter of rated battlegrounds. I succeeded another 2k rating as a Gnome Warlock and took some time to retire from the game and play the auction house every few days.

I am currently wrapping up an internship and hoping to build a career in film. World of Warcraft has given me the passion to pursue storytelling, and I found that love through filmmaking. I aspire to be a Director of Photography, Writer, and Journalist after my college years. In August I will be heading back to my third year to wrap up my film major and business minor, and begin the upper courses in my journalism major. I’ve taken a lead role in my fraternity, and have become highly active on my campus. All of my ambition started when I first stepped into Teldrassil at 11 years old. I owe all of my success and future to the morals and values I have built from this game.

So finally, I want to give a thank you. Thank you to Blizzard for creating a world for those to grow up in. Thank you to the noobs who run around like a chicken with their head cut off that bring back the nostalgia. Thank you to the community who are open for adventure and are so inviting to new friends. It is because of this world that I was able to follow an intelligent path in life and not falter to the abusiveness from my childhood. I look forward to playing with you all in Legion as a Demonology Gnome Warlock, and the future journey to come for the next ten years!


TL;DR - WoW taught me morals and values through a rough childhood that has lead me on a healthy path :)

Me: did you log off your computer?

Cowowrker: I closed it when I left yesterday, and I logged in.

Me: Okay your laptop probably just goes to sleep. You need to actually log off.

Me: You click the start menu and select ""log off""

CW: Then what happens?

Me: It logs you off then you need to sign in

CW: So I hit the start menu again?

Me: No. I'll just show you.

So we walk back her computer and on they way she tells me that my email was too confusing and nobody understood what I meant by logging off (even though several people told me moments after it went out they logged out and in and it worked for them). So at her computer she shuts down

Me: Oh you didn't need to do that, but it will log you off, so it'll just take a bit longer.

She logs back in then asks if they just need to click Start and log off, and she logs herself out again.

Me: Yes but you didn't need to do that, you logged off when you shut down

CW: Okay I'll tell everyone to do that.

I'd normally not care if she couldn't figure it out, since she comes to me with a lot of questions, but her acting like just because she can't understand means it's confusing to everyone bothers me more than it should."

First, some background about me. I recently graduated from a Computer Science bachelor's program, but I think I have relatively good experience for a fresh graduate. My previous encounters with bioinformatics are: an internship with the department of Computational Science and Engineering at QCRI (which opened my eyes to the field), and my senior project was about feature selection for microarray datasets. After those two projects, I was excited about continuing in that track and pursuing a career in bioinformatics, but I'm kinda lost and need some advice.

1- Is there a chance that I can get a job in something related to bioinformatics, given that I never studied it in my university?
2- Where should I go? do you know a company, research facility, or a research team in a university who might accept me?
3- I also want to have a master's degree (or even a PhD), can you recommend a university with a good bioinformatics program?

I recently started taking bioinformatics courses on coursera (about to finish bioinformatics 1), and I got some books I knew from this subreddit to read afterwards.

I hope someone will help me with this, and thanks in advance.

I’m currently a software engineer intern at a small company. Everything is going smoothly and my co-workers are nice people. I had a meeting mid-season report meeting about my performance basically he said I have great technical skills and I do good work. 

However, my “communication and team work” skills could need more work. I interpret that is being social and having small talk.
I tried to improve those skills over the week, but found out that it just isn’t “me.” I simply don’t really care about how your dog, your new bathroom model, or what new restaurant you are going. I rather not fake being someone I’m not. 

I have no problem communicating or being social with people when we’re actually working together. I just don’t seek it outside the confines of work.

At the moment, I’ve finished my intern project, fixed all of the bugs my mentor gave to me, and just “trying to be productive.”  I decided that I just don’t fit in with the company’s culture. It’s one big room with desks that all face each other. I can hear all the conversation’s (personal and work), and It constantly distracts me. I tried using headphones, but my boss doesn’t allow me to use it cause it makes me look unapproachable.

My father has constantly belittled and undermined my mother for years. He has been unofficially diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder. The diagnosis came when I was in middle school and visiting a physiatrist for anxiety related problems. My doctor asked to meet with both of my parents a few times during my therapy. During the sessions between my psychiatrist and my dad, my doctor noted that my father displayed almost all of the symptoms of someone who suffers from narcissistic personality disorder. My doctor then gave my mother a book about NPD and my mom said that the behavior detailed in it was strikingly similar to the behavior my father displays. My father is totally unaware of this. 

Anyways, my dad has recently started taking his aggression out on me as well as my mom. He regularly puts me down and has taking to bullying me. When I try and stand up for myself he becomes enraged at the suggestion that he has done something “bad” to me. I’ve told him how specific things he’s done impact me, and he apologizes. However, he cannot seem to translate “my daughter felt bad when I told her that she movie she wanted us to see was ‘immature’ (it was the new Jungle Book)” to “my daughter feels bad when I call her pathetic because a girl her age should be, as he put it, an all around pioneer who can sew a button back onto her brothers pants.” His apology is for the specific situation I bring to his attention and not for the behavioral pattern itself. It is sort of like he lacks an emotional memory.  

 Because of his behavior, I try not to engage with him if I can, but my withdrawal only seems to provoke him more. He desperately wants me to like him, but he has no idea how to interact with me! He tells me that my interests are not important (belittles the YA book series that I’m reading by writing it off as “stupid”) believes that the best way to get me to do something is to scream at me (instead of asking me to do the dishes he starts swearing and yelling at me if I do not automatically do them) rejects all of my attempts for the two of us to spend time together, and goes on and on about my poor work ethic (I have a paid internship and I’ve been the honor role at my school for the past two semesters). 

And on an unrelated note, sometimes being around my dad makes me feel a little unsafe…sexually. He is NOT a predator but every once in a while (and I do mean VERY infrequently) he’ll just do or say something that makes me feel really uncomfortable. For example, when I was little I used to kiss my mom and dad on the lips. No big deal because we were all comfortable with it. When he dropped me off for school back in the fall, he turned and kissed me on the lips in front of the entire airport. It wasn’t gross; he just hadn’t done something like that in a long time and in that moment both the act and the location made me really uncomfortable. Occasionally, he will also comment on my appearance in a sexual manner. For a little while instead of telling me that I looked “cute” or “pretty,” he was telling me that I looked “hot” or “sexy.” When I told him that I was super uncomfortable with those words and that he should say I look cute he told my then 17-year-old self that “you are about done with being cute” and  “so you don’t want me to compliment you?” He doesn’t do that anymore and I don’t think he meant anything when he says that sort of stuff.  I think it goes with the whole wanting me to like him (so he “compliments” me) but having no idea how to interact with a teenage daughter who is growing up and taking the first steps towards becoming her own person who can stand on her own (so the “compliments” are inappropriate). 

I’m anxious whenever I’m around him. I think he is threatened by me because since I’ve left for college I’ve grown more independent and self-sufficient. He doesn’t like woman very much (he hates my mother and often says sexists things about women in front of me) and I think seeing me moving towards young adulthood is scary to him because he thinks I’m leaving him and joining “them.”  For example, he is always accusing me of hating him and “parroting” my mother. 

I don’t really know what to do because I don’t think being around my dad is good for me right now, but I don’t want to up and leave because of certain commitments I’ve made, such as my internship.  I also would also like to keep my dad in my life going forward because, to be honest, I want him to like me and I want to like him, but his presence in my life is so toxic that I’m afraid that cutting him out once I’m old enough (graduated college and financially independent) may be the best option. If anyone has gone through a similar situation with a parent I would love to hear your thoughts! Thank you for reading this post that turned into an essay!

I've had a few programming-based internships and right now I'm building interning at AOL but I still feel like I'm missing some of the core CS principles because of my lack of CS degree but still want to get a developer job when I graduate.

I wanted to solve my ""lack of education problem"" by applying for the Technology Analyst program at JPMorgan, because part of the program is that they put you in a boot camp for 6-10 weeks to learn their tech so I thought I could learn a lot there and then take those skills to future jobs. The problem is that I heard that finance or banking tech jobs get a real lack of respect in the tech world and now I'm doubting the decision. What do you experienced developers/tech professionals think? Are there any other programs that you know of that train you in tech before you start?

Thanks for your help!

TL;DR - Don't have a CS degree but want to be in CS, is a job in finance that has a bootcamp beforehand a good option?"
4tset5,2,2016-07-20,job search anxiety,goofsngaffs89,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4tset5/job_search_anxiety/,"I have always had bad anxiety, as long as I can remember. For a period over the last couple years, it actually improved while I was in school, but as graduation approached and I started thinking about getting a full-time job, things kind of fell apart. I finished school with good grades but I haven't been looking for a job until now because of my fear of the whole process.

A little background info, I have a bachelor's in Computer Science. I'm 28 years old and finished school later than most because I put it off for so long - again, because of anxiety. I have no professional experience in my field which just adds to my fear of interviews. I know I'll be asked why I don't have experience (an internship or a big side project) and I don't know what to say. I know I'll be asked why the gap between high school and college, and I don't know what to say. I feel like I'm where a 21 year old should be, and I'm almost 30. It makes me feel so much worse about my situation.

As I write this, I am waiting for a call back from a potential employer to set up a job interview soon. In reality, I am hoping they never call back, so I don't have to interview. The whole idea of sitting in a room being interrogated by a few strangers and having no idea what to expect is terrifying to me.

When I explain this to people around me they say things like ""there's nothing to worry about, the worst that can happen is they say no."" I don't think people understand that my feelings are not really something I can control and that I can't just ""think"" my way out of feeling it. To me this feels like I'm facing down life or death, even though I'm not. The last time I had interviews scheduled, I had a panic attack and cancelled them all, saying I wanted to ""focus on academics"" (this was a few months back before graduation).

Should also mention that I was on medication for anxiety before I became ineligible on my parents insurance and had to switch to a different provider. I could get an appointment but even that is a major source of anxiety to me, both because it scares me just to make that call and also because the appointment probably won't be for a few weeks, and my parents would probably be so disappointed if I postponed my job search until then.

I don't know what I'm expecting anyone here to do. Just needed to vent."

I'm about to enter my senior year as a CS/Econ double major. I've been fortunate enough to have two very solid internships in software development, and I have a couple of small independent projects I've worked on.

I live on the east coast in NJ, and my internship this summer is in NYC's financial district. I really love new york, and want to live in the area right when I graduate. Cost of living is, of course, astronomical and I want to make sure I'm making what I think I'm worth. I work for a bank now, and based on recent grads I've talked to who have accepted full time offers after the internship, it looks like (provided I receive an offer of course) it would be ~75k and a 15k signing bonus. I'm not sure if there's any annual cash bonus.

This seems like a low offer to me. I'm not saying I'd be able to get a job at Google making six figures right off the bat, but my goal was to make closer to 85k or 90k starting, especially if I want to live close to NY in say Jersey City. Looking at salaries/companies on Glassdoor this seems attainable with my resume.

So my question is, for any grads who now have jobs in NYC, what salary would be considered ""good"" for an entry level position if you want to live in the area? Am I right in thinking 75 is on the lower end?

Thanks!"

4tt4k9,355,2016-07-20,Kitty's Devolution,ms_hyde_is_back,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/4tt4k9/kittys_devolution/,"Hi FPS. Hyde here with a story of a ham I did not realize was a ham until just recently. She was not as overtly narcissistic as  the hams we’re used to, but inconsiderate and self-centered? Absolutely. Let’s get ya’ll introduced.

Kitty and I met during the summer of 2006, at literature camp. We were rooming together, and we were equally relieved to find that the person we’d be sharing a living space with for two weeks was not, at first glance, a total monster. We parted from literature camp on friendly terms, and were randomly reunited on the day of college orientation. We lived on opposite ends of campus, and had very different majors, so we did not spend an enormous amount of time together, but our friendship was warm and open and I really enjoyed her company. She was a short girl with a bit of extra padding, but not terribly large then. She blamed the weight on her lupus medication. Lupus is no joke, and neither are the drugs to treat it, so I’m pretty sure this was a plausible explanation at one time.

It was several years later that her hamminess started to develop.

Kitty was (and is) obsessed with Cheesecake Factory. Almost every time we made plans, it would begin or end with lunch at the Cheesecake Factory. Lunch was always an appetizer, an entrée, and cheesecake. If you have ever eaten at Cheesecake Factory, you’re aware that the portions are massive. Kitty would clean every plate, and devour basket after basket of the free bread and butter. One day, I excused myself to go to the restroom and came back to find her putting the bread in a Ziploc bag to take home, before asking the waitress for more bread. 

Some days, Kitty would declare she was on a diet. She would consume the entirety of her appetizer and cheesecake, but only eat half of her entrée and talk about how it would make a good meal later and she was so proud of herself for showing restraint. Meanwhile, she continued stuffing her face with bread. 

Her table manners were atrocious. She chewed with her mouth open, smacked her lips loudly, and talked with a mouthful of chewed food at every turn. I know I keep returning to the subject of the bread, but it seemed to be the focus of some horrid behaviors. Instead of buttering a piece and taking a bite, Kitty would butter it to within an inch of its life and shove the entire piece into her mouth – before trying to continue the conversation around the sticky wad of dough in her cheeks. 

Slowly but surely she ballooned. Her car began to smell from the fast food wrappers she abandoned in the backseat, enough to make her passengers turn a little green. We once took a road trip to Santa Barbara to visit a friend (Becky) in grad school there, and I counted upwards of 43 [Filet-O-Fish]( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/ronaldmcdonald/images/7/72/Filet-O-Fish.png/revision/latest?cb=20151206171258) wrappers when I finally got sick of the garbage and cleaned it out during a pit stop. 

During the visit, Becky told us about a place that made legendary nachos. We decided to go get some for dinner. Kitty unabashedly claimed the entire nacho platter (enough to easily feed 5-6 people) and asked, “What’d you guys get?” between mouthfuls. Becky and I were too dumbfounded to respond, and quietly ordered our own nacho platter. 

At the end of dinner, Becky and I had our wallets out and were making small talk when Kitty interrupted.

&gt;“Ohhhhhhhh noooooooooooooo, guys, I toooooooooootally forgot my wallet!”

&gt;“Oh. Ok, no problem – we’ll cover it. You got breakfast tomorrow though, okay?”

&gt;“Oh my goodness ABSOLUTELY.” 

Kitty left to go to the bathroom while we paid. She took a really, really long time. Becky was about to go check on her when she came rushing towards us and demanded that we leave immediately. We complied, somewhat confused. On the car ride back to the dormitory, the smell hit us. Either she had gotten shit on her, or she hadn’t cleaned up properly. Becky and I opened our windows and stared stoically at the horizon while Kitty prattled about nothing. Looking back, I presume I must pity the poor soul who had to clean up after her. 

The next morning, Kitty bought us a box of Poptarts for breakfast. There are eight in a box. She ate five.

On the way home, I fell asleep in the front seat, and was woken up by Kitty drifting about and jerking the wheel to maintain a straight line. 

&gt;“Kitty, what are you doing?”

&gt;“The car is acting weird.”

&gt;“How long has it been acting weird?”

&gt;“For about an hour, I think.”

&gt;“… Ookay … Kitty, it feels like you have a flat tire.”

&gt;“Yeah, some guy told me I did.”

&gt;“What the hell – why haven’t we pulled over?!”

&gt;“Because I don’t want to stop! The GPS says there’s a Dairy Queen in 23 miles and I want a Blizzard!”

&gt;“PULL OVER!”

Kitty finally pulled over. 

&gt;“Okay, I pulled over. Now what?”

I looked at the GPS. We were still several hours from home. I didn’t trust the spare tire to get us that far, especially with Kitty driving.

&gt;“Call AAA.”

&gt;“I don’t have AAA.”

I called AAA. Then I called her mother (she lives at home with her parents), explained the situation, and the cost. Her mother said she’d reimburse me the cost of the tow. 

The tow driver was very kind. He also put up with more nonsense in the several hour drive back home than I’m sure he’ll ever have to put up with in a lifetime. Kitty, enthralled by her captive male audience, went *insane*. She flirted. She chattered. She begged him to stop for Dairy Queen. She sang show tunes. She randomly listed all the presidents. She pressed her rolls up against him and giggled about how tight of a fit it was with three people in the truck. It was the most bizarre display of behavior I’d ever seen from her. 

When we finally reached home, I was barely conscious enough to be polite to her parents, who, for the record, are lovely people.
I did not hang out with Kitty for a couple of months. She called me up and asked if I wanted to have lunch and catch up. My frustration with her had abated a bit, so I agreed. We met at Cheesecake Factory (of course). Apparently by “catch up” Kitty had meant “come sit with me and listen to me detail the love life I don’t have”. 

This requires some explanation. Kitty grew up in a very conservative Christian home. She was in church every Sunday, Bible study every Wednesday, and choir every Friday. She did not believe in having boys as friends, because boys were for marrying, and the only man who ought to be around a woman was either her father or the man she intended to marry/intended to marry her. Men ought to pursue women, men ought to be pillars of integrity and godliness, men ought to be the spiritual leader. Men ought not have any familiar – or unfamiliar – vices. Men must be boring, soulless drones. (That last bit was my translation, not something she actually said.)

You can imagine how incredibly full the dating pool was for Kitty.

She told me about a young man from her church who appeared to be interested, who appeared to be all the things she wanted in a man. She prepared herself to be wooed and pursued. When the young man announced his relationship with another woman, Kitty was devastated and confused, but declared that she would stand “strong in the face of deceit, and know that at least *I* held on to my integrity and purity.” She wrote me emails full of shitty prose about maintaining the sanctity of womanhood. 

Kitty was now in the range of obese. She ""dieted"" on and off, but when I expressed concern about her health she claimed the weight gain was because of her medication, and that when she went off the medication the weight would just drop right off. This delusion was strong, and seemed to excuse all of her terrible eating habits, because ""it would just fall off when I'm done with my meds."" 

For Christmas, she excitedly proposed the idea of doing a “12 Days of Christmas” gift exchange. I love Christmas, and this seemed like a really fun project. We set a budget limit, and I went to work. I painstakingly picked out 12 really nice gifts for Kitty, including a beautiful pair of clip on earrings (to accommodate her not believing in piercing ones ears). I wrapped them all up, put them in a makeshift “Santa’s toy sack” and excitedly waited for our gift exchange. 

Kitty went first, and oohed and aahed over the creative and thoughtful things I’d picked out for her. I was really happy to see that she was excited about the things I’d chosen. She immediately opened the bag of Mozart Chocolates I’d gotten her (my absolute favorite chocolate) and ate three immediately. Then I opened my gifts.

I would estimate that five of the twelve gifts were from the Dollar Store, 3 were re-gifted items, and the final four were things she picked up in a panic. The only thing I opened that remotely she’d thought of me: an Estee Lauder eyeshadow palette, which she openly admitted had been an unwanted part of a gift set her mom had gotten. “I know how much you love makeup!” she gargled through a mouthful of delectable marzipan. 

I did not bother agreeing to participate the next year.
 
Several months later, I invited her to the Renaissance Faire when the person who was formerly attending with me got sick. She agreed enthusiastically. When I picked her up, I was astounded at how much bigger she’d gotten. She opened her purse and said, “I brought snacks!”

Kitty proceeded to make a crumby, cheese-fingerprinty mess of my car. I, anticipating the deliciousness of a giant turkey leg and a “monkey tail” (chocolate covered frozen banana), did not partake.

In spite of my best planning, we got caught in terrible traffic. It took us an hour and a half to get into the park, and another half hour to find parking in the open lot. I was hot, dusty, cranky, and desperately looking forward to a cold drink, some Faire food, and some great entertainment. We weren’t there 15 minutes before Kitty started to complain of hunger. I bit back a retort about how my car still sported the carnage of her last feast, and agreed that it was time to eat.

&gt;“What should we get? I’m definitely getting a turkey leg, but there’s a stall over there that has – “

&gt;“Actually, I was thinking Mexican food.”

&gt;“… What?”

&gt;“There’s this SUPER GOOD Mexican restaurant right around the corner from here, we should totally go!”

&gt;“… You’re serious?”

&gt;“Yeah! They have great portions, and the food is soooooo good.”

FPS, I’m ashamed to say that I let her have her way. 

We went to the goddamn Mexican restaurant. She ordered an entrée and a side dish. Her two dishes alone nearly covered the table. I got two tacos, but was too upset to finish them. She put them in her to-go box “for later”. The table was a huge, smeared mess. She was a huge, smeared mess. 

We did not go back to the Faire. She said it was too hot, she felt like she would get heatstroke. I didn’t want to go back *with her*, so I just forfeited. 

The *very last* time I hung out with her, we hadn’t seen each other in a while. We met, of course, at Cheesecake Factory.
She spent several hours talking about how she’d signed up for the free trial of ChristianMingle.com. She showed me her profile. It was mostly accurate, except for the clear body-type catfish. Lots of angled face pics and filters. 

&gt;“It’s a free month on this dating site for Christians. It gauges your compatibility with a color wheel, and it is soooooooooo advanced. But you know what, if my soul mate doesn’t find me within the time period, then I’m not keeping my membership. I feel that if God wants me to use a dating site, he’s going to show the man I’m going to marry my profile and he’ll contact me. Also, what is with guys looking at my profile and then not contacting me? I mean, if you’re looking, why aren’t you talking to me?”

&gt;“…Kitty, you realize that online dating is similar to shopping, right? Instead of getting to know the person, there’s a short blurb about you, then your photos, and based on those things, a guy either thinks you’ll be worth a shot, or not.”

&gt;“Well, I am a beautiful, educated woman and that kind of behavior just makes me an object.” 

To punctuate this statement, Kitty cut her slice of cheesecake in half and attempted to wedge it into her mouth. 

&gt;“I don’t think online dating is for you.”

&gt;""We'll see.""

&gt;""Why haven't you included a full body picture? You dress really cute.""

&gt;""Because, I don't want men to love me just for my *body*, obviously. Anyway, how's your love life?""

I gave her a brief overview of how well Muscle Shirt and I were doing, and how we were apartment hunting. She scoffed between slices of bread.

&gt;""Wow, I never took you as the type to willfully live in sin.""

&gt;""... ""

Since completing grad school, Kitty had been bouncing from unpaid internship to unpaid internship, still living at home. She had gotten even bigger. She sent me pictures of her days old new car. I laughed when I saw the McBeetus detritus already coating the floor mats in the backseat. 

Our last interaction was via email chain. Kitty thought it would be a *great* idea to have a girls day at an expensive spa. She sent out an email with a link to the spa. It was 45 minutes away from me, not including the inevitable traffic. $50 admission, everything else extra. I shot her an email back suggesting we all go out for manicures instead. No, no, it had to be this spa. ALSO, we’re going out to eat before. ALSO, we’ve made reservations for 1:30pm … on a Thursday.

I’m pretty sure my monitor flickered in fear at the look I gave it. I’d been struggling financially for a while, but even if I hadn’t been, this would have been ridiculous.

I wrote Kitty back.

*Kitty, I can’t afford to spend $50 on a spa day, or even to go to lunch. This place is pretty far away, that’s a lot of gas. Also, I work full time – Monday through Friday – from 8am to 5pm. It’s really not possible for me to attend, but thanks for the invite.*

She emailed back.

*Don’t be SILLY, $50 is no big deal! And as for work, just call in sick or something. We’re meeting at Cheesecake Factory on 16th Street at noon for lunch, okay? See you soon! P.S. I’m changing my name to KitKat, it’s cuter, don’t you think?*

I did not respond. If I had, it wouldn’t have been nice – and it would have asked why in the world she, a 27 year old woman, intended to ask people to call her a stripper name. 

Needless to say I did not show up at noon on Thursday. I got one text.

*Heyyy, we’re all here, where are you?????*

I ignored it.

She emailed me utterly horrific pics of herself in a bathing suit (thankfully it was a one-piece) sitting in a mud bath, lounging at a pool side, and sipping what was probably an incredibly expensive carbonated water in a too-small bath robe. The robe did not close over her torso, and the cinch was tied in a bow over her belly. I was in stitches. In the mud bath photograph, her rolls and chubby cheeks gave her the appearance of a very gleeful hippopotamus. 

Apart from a sporadic text message, “KitKat” and I have not hung out since. 

**tl;dr:** I saw a guy playing Dean Martin's ""Volare"" on an accordion yesterday. Pretty awesome stuff.

Edit: Added greentext to break up wall of verbosity."

I've been trying to figure out mostly how to make another service we're working with transform and communicate the RDF to Solr. I just spent the last three weeks reading everything I could find on Solr, building a Lucene analyzer for it and testing it against our instance. I'd never worked with Solr, Lucene, Maven or any other major Java framework before and haven't used the language in over three years, so I was feeling pretty good about myself as an incoming senior in college with very little actual dev experience having figured this all out relatively quickly (by my standards anyways). 
Until today. The PhD I'm working with pushed a big chunk of code that did everything I wanted to, and more. My code is basically scrap now, all of it. I may be able to parlay some of it into a more bulletproof version of what he added, but I doubt that. Before this, I had another big chunk of my work eviscerated late June - early July (it was an ontology). None of what I wrote was bad, it was all just superseded.
I don't know how I should feel right now. I know I feel gutted, I put so much damn work into this including overtime hours to make sure it was ready for a demo we're trying to build by early August. I realistically don't have much time left in my internship, and I felt like this was my chance to do something meaningful. Instead I just feel kind of empty now.
Has anyone here had something like this happen to them? How do you bounce back from this?


EDIT: So point of clarification, this is a kind of collaboration between my school and where I'm working. Our school's side is trusted to handle the application (e.g. me and this other guy) so the coordination was ultimately down to us. The blame for what wound up happening is strictly between the two of us, and I feel like I share a good chunk of that. The other guy has been kind of off the radar the past couple days (starting a new job somewhere) so that probably led to most of the confusion. We really should have been talking more over the weekend than we were. I'm kind of over it, it just sucks to see most of my work shelved, ostensibly for reasons we could have avoided very easily."
4ttdyv,3484,2016-07-20,That time the CEO sent another CEO a wrong link and it nearly cost the company a $6million contract and then he tried to blame me,ThatOtherMonster,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4ttdyv/that_time_the_ceo_sent_another_ceo_a_wrong_link/,"I used to be a lead project manager at a startup that managed a video content management platform for things like corporate training videos and live all-hands meetings.

The biggest client was $corp, a giant company with offices across the country. On this occasion we were gearing up for their first digital all-hands meeting -- the CEO, CIO, and CTO of their company were going to have a ""town hall"" meeting live via webcast and we were handling the platform, including registration, tracking participation, etc.

To make things easier we had already set up a portal on their website at a subdomain: video.$corp.com. We'd worked well with their web masters and network people to make sure it worked on their corporate network and across the internet for those working at home.

This event was a big deal; it was a public company that was undergoing a restructure, and this was the Chiefs' chance to explain how it all works. We knew that they had sent out the live URL to several press outlets the night before.

The event starts and the QA guys are watching it and everything is fine. They start talking and it's crystal clear.

Thing is, there are only about a dozen people watching it, including our four QA guys and myself. We had anticipated 4000 to 5000 people, but were peaking at maybe 16, tops.
My company's CEO, $bigBoss -- who, it should be known, barely knew how to send a text -- comes screaming into my office going completely bonkers.

""ThatOtherMonster, we're down. Nobody can see the broadcast!""

I point to my monitor where it's playing and say, ""you mean this one? It's working.""

""No it's not! I just got my ass chewed out by their CTO. All of their clicks are redirecting to Disney! We've been hacked!""

What!? That made no sense.

So I go down the hall to find the web dudes. This entire time the CEO is following me around shouting about how I assured him we tested, did a dress rehearsal, that the servers could take it, everything, and that if I didn't get it working now that I'm fired.

So I'm talking to the web guys and they have no idea what's going on. We can get to the portal remotely. The guys in the east coast NOC see everything fine, too. We check all over the country and it works. We realize that only the people at the company and its remote locations are having this problem -- and those are all the people who are supposed to watch.

So I call up the network/IT guys at $corp and ask if they're having a problem. After all, we had tested it out the day before and an hour prior to the start of the town hall.

""It's fine here,"" he says. ""I'm watching it through my firewall. We have no idea why the users are having trouble.""

Now we're even more confused: Their techs can watch it, we can watch it, but regular users can't? We spend a few minutes going over everything, from soup to nuts.

Then my phone rings and it's the same $corp IT guy.

""We figured it out, you sent us the wrong URL,"" he says.

""What!? What URL? It's right at the video.$corp.com subdomain, right where it's always been.""

""Well, someone at your company named $bigBoss sent an email to our CEO talking about how excited he was to finally get this live stuff off the ground. He reminded them that they could watch it at $corp.video.com at 3PM yesterday.""

""I don't get it. So?"" And then it hit me. Our portal is at **video.$corp.com**... The CEO messed it up. **$corp.video.com** (or, really, [whatever].Video.com) is owned by Disney.

I say into the phone, ""Oh my god. Thank you."" I hang up.

I walk into $bigBoss's office, where he's yelling at my $upervisor about how he's going to fire me and then kick my ass.

""We figured out what's wrong. You're not going to like it.""

""Tell me about it later. Just fix it now!""

""We can't. It's working fine. The problem is that you emailed the CEO of $corp and included the wrong link to the broadcast, which he then forwarded to everyone in the company and all the press outlets. The link you sent them redirects to Disney. Their entire company is clicking on a link that takes them to Disney.""

I see my $upervisor turn red. He made sure this worked as hard as I did. He's also part owner of the company, so he lays into the CEO right there.

The CEO shuts him up and tells me -- and this is the best part -- to ""redirect that link now! Make it point to our stream!""

I thought my $upervisor was going to deck him. ""We can't redirect from a URL we don't own. We don't own video.com, Disney does. You messed up by sending out the wrong link. We spent six months getting everything on video.$corp.com working and you messed it up with a shitty marketing email.""
""Why didn't someone catch this before!?"" the CEO yelled.

""How would we catch it!? You didn't clear it with anyone. You just did it. Because you're an idiot. The only way to fix this is for you to email the $corp CEO again with the right link and hope that it's not too late for him to send it out.""

""We can't just, I don't know, hack the URL? Change it from Disney?""

""You want us to hack into the DNS records of a multibillion dollar corporation that could eat us for breakfast, hijack their rightfully owned domain name, and redirect it like a shining beacon of guilt to our client's website because you have no idea how your technology company works?"" I ask. (Or something to that effect.)

""Well, can't we just change how the links work to get it right?""

""You want us to somehow change how the internet fundamentally works because you went against protocol and had an unauthorized tech conversation with your client? No We can't do anything. You have to do what I just said. Or we lose this contract, period,"" $upervisor tells him.

$bigBoss kicks us out of his office, closes the door, and writes the email. About two minutes later it shows up in my inbox as a ""draft"". $supervisor and I check it out, fix the typos, double check the URLs, and send it on its merry way.

Somehow $supervisor got on the horn with $corp's CIO and explained that the CEO's intern that was writing the email as dictated by $bigBoss but messed it up, and that had been fired (which was all made up bullshit) and saved the contract. The rest of the town hall went perfectly.

That was the last time we let the CEO get involved in any event at all. He wasn't a bad guy, just an idiot who knew how to raise capital and hire smarter people than him.

4tthxa,15,2016-07-20,"Birth Story: Induction with foley, cytotec, pitocin and an epidural at 38+5 (induced early for hypertension and SI joint issues)",powertoolsarefun,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/4tthxa/birth_story_induction_with_foley_cytotec_pitocin/,"[Picture at 1 day old (from the hospital photographer)](http://imgur.com/a/4yVAr).  

Background:  I have some pre-existing joint issues that were painful but didn't limit mobility the majority of the time.  Pregnancy made this much worse - so that I spent the end of pregnancy stuck in bed, using a walker to get 20 ft to the bathroom.  I got steroid injections in the SI joints which helped a lot and I was able to get around more easily (but still not well) for about 2 weeks - and then they started to wear off.  My doctors agreed to induce at 39 weeks because of the SI joint problems and limited mobility.  Then at my 38 week appointment (38+2, last Friday) my blood pressure was up a little.  It had also been up earlier in the week when my physical medicine/rehab doctor checked it.  The OB decided to move up the induction to Monday at 9PM.  We were told to call Monday at 8 to make sure they had space for me - since I wasn't an emergency.

Monday at 8PM I called the charge nurse to see if they had space.  They said yes, we headed in.  We arrived around 8:50 and started the check in process.  We ended up waiting in the waiting room for almost an hour.  And then spent an hour waiting once we were transferred to a room.  They started to antibiotics because I was GBS+ and said they would have an OB come check my cervix, decide a strategy and start the induction promptly.  Then there was some sort of emergency with another patient and we waited another 3 hours before we say the OB.  

They OB did a cervix check.  I was 1 cm dilated.  2 cm thick at -2 station.   They decided to start with a foley bulb and cytotec.  The intern attempted to place the foley bulb and failed to the chief resident did it.  The intern placed the cytotec.  Foley bulb placement was an uncomfortable process - made worse by the intern - but in the grand scheme of labor and delivery wasn't that bad.  They said they would come back hourly to give it a tug and see how things were progressing - but they didn't actually come back hourly.  Note: if they are putting in cytotec, they don't let you stand up for an hour - so pee first.  

I started regularly cramping pretty immediately after placement of the foley.  It felt like contractions to me, but they weren't showing up on the monitor as contractions.  2.5 hours later, when they hadn't yet come back, I got up to go the bathroom and while I was on the toilet the foley bulb fell out.  I called the nurse - who had them come back and recheck my cervix.  It was at 5 cm and the cramping was pretty uncomfortable.  When I had my daughter I managed pain with a lot of movement (walking, swaying, etc) and because of the SI joint problems I was stuck in bed.  I decided to get the epidural at this point since I knew I wasn't going to make it through labor without it this time.  They also broke my water.  

The epidural seemed to take better on one side than the other, but contractions essentially stopped so it was hard to tell how much difference there was between the two sides.  About 2 hours later there had been no progress (still 5 cm, -2 station), so they started pitocin.  Contractions started again almost immediately.  They figured out what was going on with the monitor so that they showed up.   At this point it was evident that the epidural was not effective almost at all on the one side.  We called anesthesiology - and the attending (not the resident who had done the original) gave the epidural a boost and had me lay on my left side.  After about 30 minutes, the epidural spread to the left and things were good again.  I could feel definite tightening and pressure during contractions - but not pain.  I watched some TV and read reddit.  Two hours later (around 11am) I was started feeling a lot of uncomfortable pressure (pretty serious discomfort).  I told the nurse.  The OB came in and checked my cervix.  I was at 9.5 cm (she said ""there is a small lip but you are otherwise there"") but still at -2 station.  She shifted the bed so it was more like a chair so the baby could move down and had me wait.  I really wanted to start pushing - my body was telling me to - but they had me wait for about an hour.  At 12 we started pushing.  At 12:24 my baby boy was born.  He was 7 lbs 12 oz and 20.5 inches long.   His initial apgar was 9.  He was very healthy.  

I work in healthcare (although I do data and analytics).  My boss (who was a nurse at one point) told me when I was having my daughter that May was an awesome time to be in the hospital because interns start in July and by May they know what they are doing.  This time around I was at the hospital in July and it was pretty obvious that the interns were not as qualified.  My epidural hurt going in a lot more than last time, they had trouble with the foley and a different person had to fix it.   I'm all for teaching hospitals and interns, but they are way better in May than in July.  "

4ttxwx,1,2016-07-20,Which Job To Pick,silkworm_supernova,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4ttxwx/which_job_to_pick/,"I escaped from my homeland after job market didn´t recovered from recession. Not to mention endemic corruption of political structures that penetrated so deeply into lives of ordinary people that it became almost impossible to get a job unless you are a member of political parties. If you avoid that (like I did) than a strange roller-coaster of all sorts of shitty behaviors comes right at you. I literary escaped suffering from what I like to call - unemployment PTSP (a state of worthlessness with absolutely no confidence, plus the traumas of seriously underpaid previous jobs with mobbing elements). Everyone from the South Europe shout out to you, you´ll understand.

I tried my luck in Western Europe where my degree and skills are obviously more appreciated. Plus the fact I am cheaper worker. So I got one nice graduate job right away. After the contract had been finished I moved to bigger city and applied for other vacancies. 

It happened to be that I passed trough all the interview/assessment rounds for two jobs I am very interested in. Don´t want to go in too many details, but it seems that I have good chances for getting both.

I found myself in a situation in which I have never been before. 

I feel completely clueless and don´t know how to make a good decision. I know this decision is responsibility of my own, but maybe some experiences and guidance wouldn´t be bad.

Oh yeah, just a couple of details. 

1.) So one job is corporate in tremendous IT company. I would actually work on interesting things and be paid very well. The minus is the high stress level I will have to deal with. I had some serious medical issues in my homeland that doctors believe are consequence of my incompetence to deal with stress (they couldn´t find any other cause). 
2.)The other job, in small company, is paid less. However, it seems that it is not that stressful and it is also interesting. 

My actual dilemma is that I am questioning weather I am repeating mistakes from my past where all the choices were made in favor of career/competitive spirit/prestige (college and some internships after) and none of my choices was made to be merciful towards my health and actual happiness. 

The first company would look excellent on my CV, the job is pretty decent - but I don´t know would this make me happy and healthy. Will I be able to deal with difficult situations/people on a proper way. If I choose it - am I doing it just because of others, to brag about my shiny new workplace?  The other company could give me a decent job with more peace but less challenges. However, challenges will probably grow with the growth of company and maybe my responsibilities, while in the corporate company I may be stuck in one position for longer period.

As it seems I´ll get the final decision for the second company within the few days. And for the corporate it might take them two more weeks (the process already lasts for months). 

If I turn down the second one and get the rejection for the first one - I lose both.

Maybe to go back in my jobless homeland... :D

I am so dramatic and full of shit. :) Nevertheless, humans help!

So here's the gist of my education and backstory:

Throughout my childhood I guess I was strong academically but due to focusing on school only I believe I dropped alot of hobbies and interests to focus only on the grades. 

During highschool was when I started to notice that people genuinely had other interests aside from school. I didn't mind that while I focused on my subjects, scoring high in attempts to get into my university of choice with a sort of goal for a healthcare career (Pharmacy, physiotherapy). From being one of the top students I neglected a lot of the social aspects in my entire life, my only real friends are from highschool. While I did study at the huge university for about a year and a half I let major anxiety, depression and rejection hit. I didn't properly address this, instead I complained that the school, major in general science wasn't for me. Stopped that school, immediately wanting to transfer out.

Come the next semester I actually applied to another school to study in computer science; Something I knew nothing about but wanted to find a job right away. After about two years studying that and a very odd and different internship I realized my issues with anxiety and depression run too deep that I was always in some rush to get out of school and find a job. In retrospect I think this rush makes me neglect true learning as I barely learn the materials for the tests and homework.

Anyways while studying computer science a bit I have also come to speculate I won't do well in the field to get any other type of job if I have no interest in the field, leading to not applying the work ethic.

I guess I'm pretty far into my education with an average GPA but low work ethic, scraping by with the bear minimum of work. Main thing I learned in college is the importance of initiation, networking and value of working hard in something you enjoy.

From here I'm thinking that I have generally no interest in anything and have not approached learning correctly. Also from CS I'm not very strong in programming or learning because I probably don't have the patience or detail to debug, practice, or build anything on my own.

From here I'm thinking alot of my issues is a bit of what I want out of a career, but also some personal issues to deal with. Now I'm having major indecision of what to do, coming back in the summer term for CS classes that I have probably cannot handle because of my piss poor skills in understanding the material, poor study habits, and poor skills to implement assignments.

Ofcourse there isn't a way out, I don't believe I can fake it through my current education to get a degree in computer science. Now I'm thinking back to my strengths and values, I still want to do something quantitative, but hoping I can somehow find something I'm passionate about to not let anxiety get in the way. This genuine interest could bring more motivation to study and practice, leading to good performance and work ethic.

I'm sorry if this was written poorly. Anyways thanks for reading reddit

So Husband and I got married in March of last year. I got into graduate school and start in August. We've been telling of all of the family members who harass us about children that we're going to try for them once I finish grad school. 

But I had a thought today. I'm only going to classes 13 hours a week, and Husband could adjust his work hours in order to cover the time that I was in classes. That way when I do my internship in 2 years and start working in 3, the child will be old enough that I would be willing to put the child in preschool (I've always known I want to stay home with my children until they're in school).

 So now I'm conflicted. I put it in my head for so long that I would wait until I was done with school, but now I'm just thinking of other options. 

We own a house, we're financially stable. We COULD have a baby tomorrow and be fine in that sense. I just don't know. I did run it by Husband and he shrugged it off with a ""If that's what you want"". We're 25, owned our house for 3 years, dating for 5 years, been married for a year, have a good and happy relationship.

4tupf2,3,2016-07-20,Is this the time to exit the Project or Stay?,dusty_archer,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4tupf2/is_this_the_time_to_exit_the_project_or_stay/,"Hello everyone, I want to read some of your thoughts regarding my situation.

Last year I had a job (my first job related to my career, computer systems engineering) after an internship in a small company in my city. I really never liked to be there and I was having a really tough year (university, family, personal problems, etc,) and by September I could not stand being there and decided to quit without having secured any job. Of course before leaving I sent my resume to some other (and bigger) companies but future was uncertain at the time. 

A month later one of this big companies offered me a job (as a web and mobile developer) and they interviewed me, but I didn't get the job. One week later the same company called me again for a different project (as an application support engineer) and I accepted because I thought that I could stay there some time and then move to some better project.

In this new job everything looked pretty well in the beginning. I am a contractor and I work for a company ""A"" through company ""B"". What I do is just run some database queries, look for files and assist users. That is not what I want to do and this doesn't makes me happy at all. I really feel like I'm wasting my talent, i know I can do more than just support stuff.

Now that I wrote all that stuff, the issue here is that my current project will have budget cuts, thus some members will have to leave. My leader told me that I could be one of those who could leave, but my manager doesn't want me to leave because I've been a really good resource. Also he asked me if I wanted to stay and if I was committed to the project almost saying that they don't want me to leave.

So, I see this as an opportunity to go and look for the job I want (as a developer and stop being a support guy) but at the same time I feel like is wrong to leave, I mean I could say ""I volunteer as tribute"" but they expect me to stay, they really want me there but that job is not my thing. This is one of this questions about what to do. What I want or what I should? I have like 9 months there and they spent 3 of them teaching me how to do stuff.
I have talked to my friends about this and almost everyone says ""leave and do what you want, what makes you happy"". But also I see myself and I feel weak, unprepared for something new, I just finished my career like 6 months ago. Also If I decide not to ""volunteer"" I think it will be harder to leave since I'll be more commited and will have more responsabilities that i really don't want.

So basically I'm unsure if I should ""volunteer as tribute"" and wait for what the future holds (could be better or could be worse) or just stay in a safe job (until it drives me crazy).

Finally, sorry if my english is not ok, it's not my native language.

Thanks everyone."

We've been telling of all of the family members who harass us about children that we're going to try for them once I finish grad school.

But I had a thought today. I'm only going to classes 13 hours a week, and Husband could adjust his work hours in order to cover the time that I was in classes. That way when I do my internship in 2 years and start working in 3, the child will be old enough that I would be willing to put the child in preschool (I've always known I want to stay home with my children until they're in school).

So now I'm conflicted. I put it in my head for so long that I would wait until I was done with school, but now I'm just thinking of other options.

We own a house, we're financially stable. We COULD have a baby tomorrow and be fine in that sense. I just don't know. I did run it by Husband and he shrugged it off with a ""If that's what you want"". We're 25, owned our house for 3 years, dating for 5 years, been married for a year, have a good and happy relationship.

What would you do?

4tuy2h,19,2016-07-20,I really need some help (professional exam).,ImAK93,GetStudying,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/4tuy2h/i_really_need_some_help_professional_exam/,"I am new to this sub but I have been reading some posts for quite a while. I am 23 years old and I am pursuing a professional course of Chartered Accountancy which considered to be one of the toughest in my country. I have been fortunate to clear the first two stages and I have almost completed my internship. But I'm stuck at the final stage and its creating uncertainty about my future.

Let me tell you the background. I am a student with decent intelligence and am sincere. My first attempt in the final was in November 2015 which I failed as I was a bit overconfident and casual in the study leave period. Many people (including family) had hopes about me but they were all disappointed. 

I prepared well for the next exam in May 2016, even the exam went well, but I got my results 2 days back and failed again. Fortunately my scores have improved and one subject has been exempt. So now I have to study 7 subjects instead of 8 and is really a good news. Most of my friends and acquaintances have passed in the last attempt and are qualified but I am lagging behind and am really depressed.

In order to pass the next attempt, I have to study for more than 10 hrs everyday for the next 3 months. I know the material that I have to study but I need help from you guys about being persistent and disciplined in my studies and not procrastinate and fool around.

This attempt is very important to me as my future will be dependent on it. Sorry for a wall of text but please share your tips about studying for long hours and how did you manage and get rid of negative thoughts/habits.Thanks!"

I just need to vent right now, and to ask for advice.

I love my boyfriend, I really do.  We met really early on in college and are about to go into our senior year, so close to 3 years now. I'm so in love.  My boyfriend and I have talked about long-term plans.  Commitment is important to me so I asked how he felt about proposing, and he said he'd want to do that before we graduate.  I was so excited about it, and couldn't wait to spend the rest of my life with him.

We both go to the same college but have pretty different plans for graduation.  The career I want requires a 2.5 year grad school program as a prerequisite, and it's a pretty small program so only a few schools offer it.  I'm planning to apply to most of them, and they're spread out in random places across the country.  My boyfriend is a programmer and is planning to apply for jobs.  I always figured he'd find one close to me and we'd get to have a little apartment together for a few years before getting married.  I was dreaming about it, and the thought was getting me through this current LDR period (4 months).  

But my boyfriend is really fucking good at programming.  He has a very good internship now, and has gotten some modest attention at very known companies.  Of course, this doesn't mean that he'll necessarily get a job at one of those companies, but he can do very well for himself and make a solid career, likely making 6 figures.  My career will never make that much, and is nowhere near as prestigious.

The more I think about it, the more heartbreaking our choices are.  If he chooses the job over me, we spend 2.5 years apart (which is really going to hurt me) and there's no guarantee I can find a job where he is.  If he chooses me over the job, we'll likely end up in a hicktown (because I'm too stupid to get into a really prestigious grad school program) and his career will be on hold, possibly damaged.  I can't make him give up that on a clear conscience.

I'm wondering if it would be best for me to leave him.  It's killing me to think about, since I love him so much, but I don't want to make this decision difficult for him.  He should be focusing on himself and furthering his career, not on some chick that isn't even his intellectual or physical match anyway.  He could always fall in love with someone more suitable.  These days I just feel like a liability.

I've talked to him about this but am never able to get everything out without blubbering or crying.  The topic in general stresses my boyfriend out and he keeps asking to put it off till later, since he's already stressed from work.  So until his internship is over (3 weeks) I can't talk to him about this.

Do I just slow fade?  Clean break?  Do I not break up with him at all and try to make this work?  If so, how?

   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend and I are in love, but I'm afraid of holding him back in his career."
4tv2wn,2,2016-07-20,Was my childhood 'normal'?,theexplosivecandle,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4tv2wn/was_my_childhood_normal/,"I don’t want to make myself a victim. I don’t feel like a victim, but my childhood has been off and I need some closure. I’ve never heard a story that I can relate to about it. Honestly, I’m terrified in sharing it. The typical stories you hear about dysfunctional families are about drug addicted moms or physically abusive dads. My story is different. Mine is the story of growing up with parents who were irresponsible. They forged the illusion of wealth through debt, inheritance and reckless spending. 

I am growing up in an affluent white neighborhood, 20 minutes away from Manhattan, New York. I went to a prestigious private high school. I intern in an IT room. I am going off to a good college to become an electrical engineer. On the surface, my life must appear great.




However, I live in an extremely non-contemporary form of poverty. My parents married because they were getting old and their parents pressured them to tie the knot for social status purposes.  Neither were prepared or ready to support a family. My mom was a poorly paid hospital administrator, and my dad never worked in his life, despite having an MBA from Oxford, and a Law degree from NYU. My grandpa, a successful estate lawyer, supported them generously while he was alive, and more so from his will after his death. Grandpa bought them their house, their car, my nanny… Until I was ten, they spent prodigality on vacations and toys for my brother and me. It certainly was nice, but undeserved. After I turned ten, my family ran out of money. 






I guess you guys at this point must be feeling a form of justice. No one should be allowed to live so lavishly without earning it. 





However, I was along for the ride of all of this. 




It was incredibly shameful. Their house started to fall apart. A flood upstairs caused mold to grow on the floors and ceilings. The dishwasher broke. The washing machine broke. And apparently, without a maid, they lacked the ability to clean up. They couldn’t afford to replace anything, and they lacked the life skills to maintain a house. 






I distanced myself from those around me because I was scared and ashamed of my condition. I would arrive at school 40 minutes early so that no one could see the condition of the car that my mom drove. I would always change the subject when someone asked what my parents do for work. I would make up excuses for why I couldn’t go out with friends I made in school. The truth of the matter was that I couldn’t afford to go out. I would distance people if they invited me over to their houses because I knew they would eventually expect me to do the same. Poverty is isolating. 





I kept it all a secret for years. Until the day I graduated high school, I have always been alert. I didn’t want others to know. 







Now, I am finally going off to college. I will no longer be tied to my parents mistakes. I decided that I should have closure with myself over what has happened. There’s a lot I’m leaving out about my childhood… abuse, mental illness, ambitions, accomplishments, gardening… but that’s not important to the narrative I am telling. What I want to know is does anyone share my experience: having parents who lived decadently off of inheritance, and then revert to poverty. I can’t be the only one to have lived like the top 1%ers and the impoverished class. I want to know.

4tv5cl,3,2016-07-20,[M4F] New Intern at the TV Station [3rd][gd][e],[deleted],Roleplay,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/4tv5cl/m4f_new_intern_at_the_tv_station_3rdgde/,"All I started writing another role play. This is yet another romance theme. Have you noticed a trend through my posts? If you notice there is a bit of an age difference in this one as my character would be a few years older than yours. Let me know what you think of my first post below. As always if you want to change things up or just run with it, I hope to hear from you!


&gt;It was that time of the summer for Alex Rodgers. Summer intern time. They weren't all bad, but most were bad. Last summer in particular. It was a guy who cared more about his girlfriend and his image than the weather. The last Alex had heard the guy had dropped out of college after getting the girl pregnant. That had been a waste of his time, but interns were one of the things that the station required. It gave them a pool of people that they knew and could potentially hire from. There had been some cute girls and some pretty knowledgable guys in the last 6 years that Alex had been on TV in Chicago. It was a lot different than growing up in Texas. While they still had severe weather up here it was a lot cooler than Texas and a lot less flooding. All-in-all though he couldn't complain because he was in one of the biggest markets in the country on the best news network in the city.

&gt;The student intern was just starting her meteorology program in college. This was a rare circumstance as they usually picked interns with several years of college experience. In this case she had impeccable grades and had done a project with one of the other mets at the station. Basically all Alex knew was that her name was Lily Kim. Not that he was jumping to conclusions but that sounded slightly Oriental. The other met at the station, Sarah, had warned Alex that Lily was obsessed with weather. Not a bad trait to have, especially when you have long nights and lots of severe weather or snow.

&gt;Alex had gotten to the station early today so that he could have some extra time. The first days for the interns were always awkward because they were unfamiliar with not only the computer systems, but also the way the show worked, and were often shy. He can remember intern back in his college days with a TV meteorologist in Austin. The first day he was nervous because he was meeting a guy he had only seen on TV many times. A friendship eventually grew and to this day they would meet and have lunch from time to time with another one of their meteorologist friends. Alex still kept in touch with 3 of his past interns. 1/2 wasn't a bad record. He had actually been invited to a graduation just a few weeks past. While he didn't attend he did send a great old weather book and letter as a gift. 

&gt;The one thing this job did was stretch his personal life. Alex's wife worked as a school teacher so she was up at 5am and went to sleep around 9pm. Alex worked from 2pm to around midnight. That meant that the two rarely saw each other except for in the dark bedroom. While they had been committed to making it work the relationship had become a struggle as of late. His wife wanted kids, and so far they were not having success trying. There were arguments and the lack of face time between the two made communication difficult. He had even noticed when he told his wife that the new intern was a young lady a glint in his wives eye. It wasn't like he had picked her. The station did that, he had absolutely no say. It was only that look that had made his mind wonder to what it would be like to be with a young college woman. Alex had quickly pushed those thoughts out of his mind. It was unprofessional. Especially in his line of work. He could get outright fired by the station if caught. While his home life was a struggle, and he didn't often have time for friends, he was popular around Chicago. That, and the pay check was very good. Like really good! Chief Meteorologist in Chicago paid very well. Not that money was everything, but Chicago was also an expensive city. 

&gt;Walking in Alex draped his coat over the chair and sat down. He pulled up the weather models and began to look at them. While the National Weather Service put out two forecasts daily, Alex made it a goal for himself to make his own forecasts. He rarely differed much from the NWS and always checked their forecast to make sure he wasn't conflicting too much, but the customized instead of copied forecasts was one thing Alex prided himself for. The forecast was really benign with not much in the way of weather expected. Mild temperatures for the summer with maybe a passing shower by the end of the week. He heard the door to the studio open, but he kept his eyes on the TV screen. It could have been anyone as the Weather Office was located in the studio with the rest of the Weather set and the famous green wall."
4tvck9,1,2016-07-21,"took unpaid internship, need advice",cyanisis,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/4tvck9/took_unpaid_internship_need_advice/,"Hey guys!  First off, THANK YOU FOR THIS AMAZING COMMUNITY!  Seriously, its an amazing resource.  Ok, so heres the deal i just accepted an unpaid internship for 30 days.  The company has meh reviews on glassdoor.  The guy in the interview didn't ask me any algorithm questions, but then, no one has during my job search thus far.  He just went through the technologies he's come across while working there and asked me about my experience with them.  He looked at my resume at the end and said... well, I can't hire you on as a developer with this resume unfortunately.  he said that i could be an amazing hacker/coder but that it doesn't matter because i don't have any way to show that.  He didn't even look at my website, my github or anything, just my resume.  So he said he'd be willing to take me on unpaid for 30 days and if that went well, he's hire me on.  I accepted because i've wanted to program for my entire life and after doing sales and tech support and just basically going no where with my life, I jumped at my first real opportunity to really prove myself.  I'm 27.  Some facts about me to better assess the situation.

I just graduated from a code bootcamp in SF.   My experience is with ruby on rails, ruby, javascript, html/css of course.  I also know react native oddly enough.  I've made a decoupled app and a ruby on rails backend API using react native and submitted it to the iphone app store. In addition to my recent experience at a bootcamp I've worked at a major webhosting company doing tech support, so I have a lot of web technologies understood and down.  *I just haven't used them professionally*.  I know MySQL and Mongo.  My projects are on my website.  

I'm in phoenix arizona so the pay here is about 25/30k less/yr than it is in SF.  I've been applying on craigslist and had recruiters contacting companies for me for almost two months now and have had 4 interviews.  Two of which were just HR type prescreening interviews.  One of which I described above.  The other I haven't heard back from and its been about a week and a half.  It was for a PHP developer doing laravel work.  He didn't even ask me about any type of coding algorithms or anything.  He seemed like he was unimpressed the entire time and it was mostly the startup owner talking.  I did probably 5% of the talking.  I actually interrupted the owner because he just went on and on about how awesome the company was... I totally get being proud but I have to show you a bit about myself for you to know if you want to hire me, right? 

So /r/webdev my question is, did I get taken advantage of?  I feel like I'm in this weird space where I'm not getting interviews for the positions that i'd want, so I'm jumping at the opportunity to have some real work experience on my resume.  I'm worried the interviewer may have sensed that and took advantage of it.  I really need money at this point but I can hold out for a bit longer, especially if it leads me to the path of having a nice job doing something I've always wanted to do (programming).  I was about to take a tech support role that i'd likely get an offer for simply because I needed the money but am now doing this.  What does everyone think?"
4tvgpr,1,2016-07-21,"Me [19 F] with my boyfriend [19 M] 7 months, having trouble keeping summer long distance alive",zswizzlez,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4tvgpr/me_19_f_with_my_boyfriend_19_m_7_months_having/,"My boyfriend, John and I just finished our freshman year of college. We initially met each other through having 2 classes together first semester and getting lunch together all the time, and we soon became best friends. Our friendship then turned into us dating and we have now been together for 7 months.

John is incredibly smart, honest, caring and all around awesome, and when we are together he makes me feel like the most special girl in the world. He is extremely outgoing and people love being around him. During the school year, we have a really good balance between hanging out with each other, hanging out with other friends, partying and studying and we had very few problems. The only other roadblock that we hit was when we realized that we left the honeymoon phase, which was mild and we easily overcame it. 

Eventually, summer rolled around and we had no hesitation staying together long distance, even though he was doing an internship in a new city and I was going to be in Europe for the summer. Our relationship was so strong and we felt like we would be able to get through any problem that arose.

It was really hard being away from John for the first few weeks of summer while I was still at home. I was still very used to seeing him every day and spending time with him so much and getting to share a lot of my experiences with him first-hand. He started his internship and was busy for most of the day, but we would still text and lot and at the end of the day he would come home and we would Skype. 

After about 2 weeks of that, I left for Europe and we then had a 9 hour time difference and it became a lot harder to talk. I would still send him links to controversial articles to get his opinion and then when he woke up in the morning we would have a little chat about them. And we were trying to snapchat each other as much as we could and send pictures of things from our day and for the first week or so it was working out okay.

But, because of the time difference and the fact that we weren't together, it became harder and harder to Skype as often. We started to only Skype once a week, and it would always feel like it was just catch-up of the weeks events. We didn't text or snapchat each other as much during the day, and our conversations became noticeably worse. I brought this up to John and we tried to come up with ways to improve our communication, but he didn't like that I was openly trying to google situations because he thought it was inauthentic.

I just got back from Europe 2 days ago, and John comes back in 2 weeks. We have been planning to see each other for a couple days before we go back to school.

Today, John told me that he didn't know if our relationship was working anymore. To summarize our conversation, he said that he doesn't feel a connection between us anymore and doesn't think that our attempted solutions have been working. I know that this is because of our long distance and having a time difference, and I told him that I think that now I am back in the same time zone we can work hard to improve our communication. I expressed my disappointment with him not being the one to initiate conversations or buy into my proposed solutions. I reminded him about how great it is to be together, and recounted some of our best memories to him.

We agreed to stay together and try to improve our relationship through Skypeing more and trying to bring back more real conversations. But at the end of our talk, John told me that he is afraid that when we go back to school, this lack of communication will continue and it won't be the same as before.

We have been apart for 2 months now. I went back into our old conversations to try to remember what it was about them that made it such a great connection. It seems like we were simply able to talk about current events and random deep questions, but now we don't seem to be able to do that anymore.

Before college, I dated a guy for 2.5 years, and John is the perfect guy for me because he is the opposite of everything I hated about my ex. John, in contrast to me, has never had a serious relationship before, and I feel like that factors into why he is hesitant to look for ways to solve this problem. He hasn't really ever come to a roadblock in a relationship before.

I'm looking for suggestions to help bring that spark back to our relationship so that when we are together it doesn't feel like we are distant. I know it can come back, but I'm not sure what concrete actions to take to help bring it. I'm really scared that we won't be able to make our conversations real again in the next few days.

   
TL;DR: Long distance relationship this summer with my boyfriend has made us lose our connection. How do I bring the spark back?"

4tvwr2,1,2016-07-21,"I never loved her, but I still tried",throwaway07624,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4tvwr2/i_never_loved_her_but_i_still_tried/,"I went through a break up with my first girlfriend a month ago.

It all started a few months back, we had been in a group together for about half a year when she confessed to me. She was sweet and kind and sincere, and even though I did not have much feelings for her, I was taken aback by how sincere she was. We started dating within a week.

Months passed, and from the start I knew something was wrong. She would call me during late school nights and beg me to come over to her place and stay with her, saying things like ""wasn't I her boyfriend"" and ""God has blessed you with me"" (we are both religious and she really abused this). I have always put my studies first, and so it was difficult to put in these hours for her. I did so anyway.

Our relationship began to get more and more strained. In each disagreement we had, I would always apologize for my wrongs and try to see how I could improve myself for her and my sake, but she would never reciprocate, leaving a lot of arguments hanging and not apologizing for when she hurt me. I really tried, even though I didn't love her, because I know how much it hurts to really like someone and not have that reciprocated.

On the weekend before finals, we had a date planned. I forgot about the date and mentioned offhand to a friend in front of her that I wanted to study all night to prepare for exams. She got pissy at me and gave me the cold shoulder, and did not allow me to take her out, and did not apologize or try to understand that I forgot about our date because of the stress of finals.

After the semester, we returned to our homes, and she began having trust issues as well. Even though I would explicitly tell her whenever I would be hanging out with another girl, she would always prod me to see if I was cheating or if there were any pretty girls at my internship. I told her it was painful to hear that she didn't trust me and she just said ""it was a cute Korean thing"", and that I was being too sensitive.

We had another dispute over Skype where she did not apologize again, and I had enough, and after a painful fight, we broke up. Since this was my first girlfriend, it was also my first breakup, and I was not prepared for how painful it would be, and how much I would miss her. Worse, I have heard from a friend that she is now badmouthing me to the friends in our group as well as sending screenshots of our Facebook chats. Now, some of the girls in the group are hostile to me as well, and many people think that I am full of myself and an asshole.

If you've made it this far, thank you for even reading. Really. To be honest, many of my friends (and my parents) told me that I was too good for her, and I think I did let it get to my head while I was in the relationship. It just hurts so much to see it end like this despite how hard I tried to be kind to her, and I really just want to know what you think - am I full of myself? Did I do something wrong? I don't know what to feel right now. Thank you again for reading."

4tvx7w,14,2016-07-21,My dog died and I can't get over the grief,sydnerella11,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/4tvx7w/my_dog_died_and_i_cant_get_over_the_grief/,"I've been having a rough time in general, but I had to put my dog down last week. In a weird twist of fate or just shitty luck, my car broke down too. So I've been stuck at my parents while this is happening, and I stay up extremely late in grief. I don't like crying in front of other people, but I stay up way later than everyone so I can. 

I never quite felt like I fit in or belonged anywhere. Or that I was worthy of love. I've gone through trauma in my past, made some bad decisions, and I tend to be a loner. 

But my dog, he always loved me no matter if I was a mess or a saint. He didn't care. He was there through every break up, every friendship gone bad, every family drama, every bad decision. He always greeted me with love. He never judged, he always just loved.

My parents weren't very good dog owners. They weren't bad, but my family is very dysfunctional. They were bogged down by trauma too. But they didn't walk him regularly. I always did during the warm weather, and he would grab his leash and try to walk himself. He never once ran away. But during the winter, I hated the cold. So I didn't walk him then. And then when I went to college, I don't know if he got walked at all. I tried to come back as often as possible, but during my senior year, I got caught up with juggling internships, classes and projects and looking for work that I didn't come home as much. 

His hips went bad. I finally started coming home more regularly when my schedule died down in May. His hips went bad during that year I was almost permanently away. But it was too late. No more walks. 

It didn't even matter that toward the end of his life that he was growing old and all his parts were hurting. He could feel it, but if I walked in the door I would hear him struggle to get up so he could greet me with a smile.

When he went to the bathroom I'd have to hold him up as he did his business. Otherwise, he'd fall down. And maybe people don't believe dogs have emotions, but I could see and feel his embarrassment when that happened. So I held him up and told him he was a good boy so he wouldn't feel weak.

On his last day, he ate all the cheese in our fridge. I wanted to get him a cheeseburger, because drive thrus were always some mystical narnia of yum to him. But I didn't because I knew the vet was coming in two hours. I wanted my time with him. I feel bad about that.

We took him outside because he loved being there. He couldn't really move well but he laid in the sun and he seemed happy. I pet him until the end too. For hours. He fell asleep with his head resting on my foot and that's where he died. I told him he was a good boy and when the vet said he was gone, I didn't register it. It didn't matter what she said, I kept telling him he was a good boy until I saw his eyes. It looked like he woke up and was sad.  I don't know if that's normal for death. 

He was the dog who loved his stuffed toys like they were babies. He would bring us animals like rabbits and even a Canadian goose alive because he wanted a little pet too. He always wanted to cuddle, and if you were petting him and took a break, he'd slap you (as gently as a big guy could) to remind you to continue. He loved everyone and everything. When I look at the world around me and all these fractured people, I remember that he wasn't like that and all he had was love.

I feel guilt and grief. I am drinking and smoking too much. I don't even care about my health anymore. I feel really alone.

So I'm looking at the only 1060's that are available (i.e. in stock) in my region, the cards in the title. 

The Asus card looks to have the same clock speeds (1620/1847 in OC mode, and same memory clock as well) as the G1 card, but the Asus card is $60 more. But looking at the [comaprison table](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/4tqwax/aftermarket_gtx_1060_comparison_table_lets/) in this subreddit, the card runs a little cooler. Is the extra fan worth $60? I'm personally sceptical, and my previous experience with ASUS coolers (for AMD) has left me with a rather sour taste... So what would you guys recommend?"

I'm currently writing this a 2 AM because I am unable to sleep because of this. So I'm posting this because I'm seeking advice and trying to calm my thoughts by taking them out of my head.

A bit of background about me. I'm a fairly socially awkward person who has fair amount of difficulty expressing myself. I sometimes wonder how I even managed to get a girlfriend in the first place. I spend most of my time on a computer and would consider myself a loner for most of my life. However I have the self-awareness to realize this is a problem and I took steps to be better. I spent most of my high school days playing World of Warcraft and had a small group of friends. I kinda like to use this as a excuse to my stunted emotional development. I believe I missed all the basic growing experiences you are supposed have in high school. I came to this realization in community college and quit video games entirely to focus on transferring to a good school. After I successfully transferred to one of my top choice schools, I moved on to the next part of myself that I thought was lacking: emotional development.

One of my main goals I set for myself after transferring was to have friends and meet girls. So I put on a mask. My default mode was to be withdrawn and not bother with interacting with people. I changed my attitude and forced myself to appear outgoing and meet as many people as I can. Although I was a transfer student I was able to stay in the dorms with the freshmen. I believe this was a major thing that set my current state into motion. I was actually fairly successful at meeting many people and I was friends with nearly everyone in my building within the first couple of months. The experience was very overwhelming for me. I went from near to 0 ""real friends"" (I never hung out with my friends in high school outside videogames/at school) to girls just giving me their numbers. I had about 4 - 5 girls texting me constantly (which at that point I didn't have ability to distinguish whether they were just being friendly or flirty). 

But there was one girl that was more aggressive than the rest. She made major efforts to get my attention the most. I was fairly immature at this age (around 20-21 compounded with my stunted development) and was actually focused on just getting one thing from girls. This aggressive girl seemed like my best chance at getting that. So I said things that I may have not meant and I got what I wanted and I was no longer a virgin. 

I still had a conscious and I felt guilty so I went along with it. We eventually ended up in a relationship. I initially didn't put very much effort into it and was considering breaking up within a couple months. We didn't really have much in common, we lacked basic interests and we didn't really connect on various things. We came from very different backgrounds, had different ideas about ethics and morality. We also had very different senses of humor. But then one of her ex's came into the picture and I stepped it up. I didn't want him to take her away from me. It wasn't a matter of ""I wanted her more"" but more of a pride thing. I also created this odd rationalization that I wanted to ""appear"" to be the best boyfriend because I found some of her friends attractive. I wanted them to see me as boyfriend material when we eventually broke up.

Over the years multiple things happened. I actually learned to love her, she made me feel special and I cared for various small things about her. We learned each other's humor and found a common ground. I lost all my friends, I drifted back to my default mode and didn't maintain the friendships I made in college. I rely on her for all social outings and my only friends are through her. There were multiple instances where we came close to breaking up but I would salvage it. There were instances where I wasn't sure why I tried so hard to save it. Maybe I was afraid because I was alone and I knew who I really was (a loner).

Fast forward to now-ish. I'm much more confident and I have accepted that I can maintain a couple good friends. I feel I'm fairly successful with my career and have most aspects of my life in order. 
I feel as though I have lulled into a comfortable routine. Many of my friends have started getting married. Some of them have been together less than us and the pressure is on. She hasn't actually put the pressure on me directly but I can tell she is also feeling it. There has been small fleeting moments where I felt ""Yes I must go buy a ring now and propose"" but the majority of the time has been that dragging procrastinating feeling. I try to dig deep and feel where that feeling is coming from but it's been muddied by the years of being together that it's hard for me to know the root cause.

Recently we hired an intern at my job. She's very cute, smart, and funny and made me feel something I didn't think I could feel after being in a committed relationship for so long. The feeling was like being shaken awake and made me realize that maybe I'm not making the right choice. A couple key things made me realize that maybe this won't work out in the long run.

Red flags I learned over the years of my girlfriend

* She's abusive to animals
   * This scares me, one of the pets at my place is deathly afraid of her and she admitted to hurting it to me because she ""just doesn't like it""
* She lacks empathy
   * She's one of those people that will hug the bumper of a car in front of her even though people need to merge in
   * There have been multiple instances where her philosophy is ""if she can get away with it, then go for it"". Not because its wrong but because shes afraid of being caught
* She is bad with money
   * I try to help her out and teach her about budgeting but she overspends constantly (buying 300 dollars shoes) and has resulted to taking personal loans
* She can't hold a job
   * She's been fired/laid off from multiple jobs, some of which where she was at fault

There is some definite chemistry between me and the girl at work and I'm having a hard time determining if the lust is clouding my mind or if I actually did start to open my eyes.
   
BTW this is really difficult to post

**tl;dr**: Red flags are blaring now for my girlfriend after a new girl at work boosted my ego"
4twd7g,8,2016-07-21,"On Peridot, Kindergartening, and Character Development in ""Too Short to Ride""",The_Recreator,stevenuniverse,https://www.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/comments/4twd7g/on_peridot_kindergartening_and_character/,"So I just watched Mr. Greg and Too Short to Ride again, and after ~~re-examining my humanity~~ ~~not weeping openly~~ nitpicking the latter episode apart, I noticed a couple of things:

* The first thing on Peridot's ""Cheepr"" profile? Certified Kindergartener.
* Right as Amethyst tossed Peridot's tablet into the ocean, Peridot shrieked ""It's all that I am!!""
* After Peridot discovers metalbending, she keeps her tablet afloat beside her.

Why do these things matter? First off, Peridot's not just some random IT technician or a spare intern to be sent off to fix a problem in a server cluster in the neighboring county. She's an *expert* in the process of incubating Gems. Homeworld sent her to Earth to check on the Cluster and the fusion experiments. If Homeworld sincerely wanted to do this data logging right, they'd want to send someone qualified in the matter.

There's a theory going about that Homeworld has a conspiracy to keep its population under control by feeding them lies about what they can do. This would definitely fit Homeworld's M.O., but that's not a sustainable conspiracy. It's easy to picture the Homeworld Gems as a bunch of like-minded drones, but we have ample evidence that each Gem has a personality of her own. Certainly at least *one* of them would be a curious sort… a Gem that sees all the Era 1 Gems flaunting their shapeshifting and weapon summoning and decides to try it for themselves. More to the point though, somebody's gotta incubate the Gems. Homeworld's got a field of work dedicated to that - Kindergartening. The Diamonds aren't going to waste their time personally managing every Kindergarten in the empire, they're going to delegate the task to a set of experts and check up on their reports to make sure production is going as planned. Peridot is one of those experts, and she was given enough latitude to do her job on her own - right up to the point where apparently any knowledge of the Crystal Gems' survival got stuck on Earth with her. ^Side ^note: ^Homeworld ^thought ^the ^Crystal ^Gems ^were ^completely ^eradicated.

In order to do her job right, Peridot would need to understand *every* aspect of Gem production. She'd need to know ideal insertion points, best incubation periods, a way to find suitable Kindergartening grounds, and so on. Peridot should also recognize when a Gem she's produced has deviated from the norm, whether the Gem is smaller than expected or simply lacks the capabilities she should have.

Well wait: perhaps the Diamonds loaded Peridot with misleading information? Maybe Peridot doesn't really know what a ""proper"" Gem should be like? To me, that seems like the White House asking NASA to fly to the moon using a sanded down 13th century ruler as its measurement standard. Peridot is an engineer, a scientist. She's working with verifiable facts, *logic* to produce results. It's possible that she's so sheltered that she can't recognize a full-fledged Gem with powers when she sees one, but then you have to accept that the Gem Empire's top scientists are going around managing a Kindergartens using a book of false formulae. It's like baking a cake using pus instead of eggs.

Besides, Homeworld already has a conspiracy to keep their Era 2 Gems in line - their reliance on technology. Peridot, and presumably most other Era 2 Gems, assumes that she can't function without technology. She reacts to the loss of her limb enhancers and her new tablet the way one might react to losing a limb. She's been raised to believe she's nothing without her technology (and by induction, Homeworld's tech infrastructure). All the Diamonds have to do to shut down an Era 2 Gem rebellion is flip the remote on/off switch on all their tech.

This leaves a potential hole: why wouldn't Peridot recognize that she can metalbend? Science is fickle like that; just because we use logic to examine our daily lives doesn't mean that we have all the answers just yet. It took humanity years to map the human genome, to figure out what was destroying the ozone layer, to examine the secrets of aging. It took us *centuries* to develop an advanced enough understanding of our solar system and propulsion science to send probes to Jupiter and the like. We had to debunk some pretty crazy theories along the way too, like the idea that everything in the universe revolves around Earth. Gem science might be much the same way; perhaps Peridot only knew to look for signs of shapeshifting powers and the like in the Gems under her care. Her discovery of metalbending would probably earn her a PhD in Kindergartening.

That all said, there's a more subtle point I'd like to address. I've seen several people suggest that Peridot's ferrokinesis undid the potential for character growth. We could've seen an arc about Peridot learning to appreciate who she is instead of straining herself to be something else. Instead, she used her new power to save her tablet and win a few games of ring toss.

Note though that we've already started to see a new side of Peridot via her metalbending. From the moment we met her, she's had a strong affinity for technology. She doesn't just prefer tech over more archaic solutions though, she literally uses it as an extension of herself. The very first thing she did with her new tablet was fashion a way to attach it to herself (like her old limb enhancers). We don't see her carry it around - to her, the most natural way to use it is to graft it to her arm.

When Amethyst chucks her tablet into the ocean, Peridot screams as if she's about to lose all that she is… but she discovers that she doesn't need technology to have some effect on the world. Sure, it's not the revelation we'd all prefer (Peridot applying *logic* to win the ring toss game would've been pretty great), but we do get a subtle sign that Peridot is learning to accept her pure self a little more: she uses her mind powers to tote around her tablet instead of her Velcro attachment. She's learning that she doesn't need her crutch to be physically grafted to her. :3

I suspect I'll come back to this post in the morning and find that there's a bunch of areas where I failed to apply logic, but let's throw this to the wolves: /r/stevenuniverse, what do you think?"

THE only reason possibly THINKABLE is that there other app ingress (or whatever) also uses the entire globe for the map. But everything else is/ should be COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. 


&gt;The pokemon hunting is not only broken because of three steps bug, but isn't even done correctly in the first place! You shouldn't find a Gyarados in the middle of a fucking city, you shouldn't find a Charizard in a fucking train station and you shouldnt find that places like nature preserves and secluded lakes are GODDAMN EMPTY. Not saying nothing should spawn in cities, but we all know that this shit is allllllll fucked.


&gt;The combat is MENTALLY FUCKING HANDICAPPED (spread the word to end the word). NOTHING about the STEAMING PILE OF SHIT that is this combat system makes sense or is anything like the pokemon we know and love. And the worst part is that the turn based system that would make it so much better and more pokemon-like would have been a FREEBIE to put into the game, miles easier than the shitstorm they have. 


&gt;And then you get down to the bugs. The server room they have must be in the Google interns toilet, yet they INSIST on pushing the ABOMINATION they are trying to call a game on more people. The other bugs such as the perma-curve, frozenballs, security issues, gps and api failures, the three step bug already mentioned, the list could literally go on forever. The app (refusing to call it a game in this state) has so many huge bugs that you log on with such a minimal chance to do anything that its fucking pointless to waste the time only to be so let down. 


&gt;And to top it all off, they aren't saying a A FUCKING WORD to all the people who were promised an amazing and nostalgic filled experienced, that waited MONTHS for any news, RUSHED to download as soon as they could, to find that Niantic had literally just tricked them in to eating up a GIANT PILE OF SHIT. It makes me think how the fuck or who the fucked picked these guys to make the app? All the mentions I see about their other game say that they are terrible at communicating and don't fix bugs well if at all. It honestly seems like none of them know what pokemon is. And I'm not saying that meaning I don't think they have ever played one of the 'mainstream' pokemon games, I know this isn't intended to be anything like that. It really does seem like they just had never encountered anything pokemon related, they don't know how any of it works. So why are they making this app? You would think that if fucking google and the pokemon company were backing it, they would pick someone who would actually make AT LEAST A PLAYABLE GAME. Hopefully even a good one with a hypothetically very large budget. Even if Niantic could make the game serviceable, they didnt. I DONT GIVE A FLYING FUCK that it is still early and they have time to improve it, that time is called a beta, and THEY are the ones who decided to release this piece of shit. If it wasn't ready DONT RELEASE IT FUCKHEAD, FINISH YOUR FUCKING JOB BEFORE TRYING TO GET PAID. As many are pointing out, if a big name had released this, the entire dev team would have been castrated publicly and on video by now. Even google should be ashamed to have its name on this disgrace.

I find almost all those around me as materialistic, seeking satisfaction in the next gadget, item of clothing, or branded *thing* they are going to buy. Only to possess it for some amount of time before it gets boring, 'old' and is succeeded by the next trend/wave promoted to us by massive corporations only looking to move the money from our pockets to theirs.

So I turn away from this materialistic nonsense and look to achieve happiness elsewhere, ultimately I concluded that I would be happy far off in the middle of nowhere enjoying nature with a nice view of something, with those that I love. The only thing I need to get there, is of course, money.

Being in the situation I am in, coming out of college, I am so afraid. Afraid I'll be trapped in a 9-5, 40 hour working week putting on a mask everyday. I am an introvert, I can't put on that mask for that many hours in one week, I need time to decompress. I know that any job I take will challenge me in the first days, weeks or possibly even months, but I also know that I am someone who will get bored of things quickly and start to hate it. The job will become dull, and sooner or later, I'll be in a rinse and repeat cycle where my life is literally on auto-pilot while I watch the years fly-by. I already know this is going to happen as I've been in a full-time corporate role before during an internship. I know I won't be able to take it for periods of 20 years or 30 years to retirement. How absurd is that? The fact that you're spending more time awake earning money so that you can spend it in your own time with those you love.

Which brings me to my next point, I'm young, I have a girlfriend, and we've been together for a few years. She honestly has been there for me every step of the way, supportive, kind, gorgeous, I couldn't ask for more. She's challenged me so much through the years, but like with everything else, it's starting to feel the same. There seems to be a cycle of the same conversations. Responsibilities build up with her, who's going to do what, who's paying for what next, and so on. I would love to spend the rest of my life with her, but that decision is so difficult to make as I don't know what it would be like. I don't know if I would end up happy on the other side, I don't know if there's more room for the relationship to grow and develop. It's starting to fall into a cycle and I am genuinely scared.

There's just so much pressure. I would say I have been successful through my life so far, good schools, good grades, good degree and I'm doing well coping with it all. It's just the fall from here is so high, I'm so ready to give up and throw in the towel. I just don't see the point to it all? Just so I can be another cog? And what if I do make it and land a successful career or have a successful business? What if my relationship falls apart? Then I'll be all alone with no one to spend my time with. The odds are stacked so highly against us its not fair. The chance of screwing up is so much greater than the chance of actually getting everything right.

I have a whole life ahead of me and I don't know how to begin. Help?"
4tx8yu,38,2016-07-21,Crazy Carla's Father Dies (and she has to be the center of it all),throwawayfaraway17,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/4tx8yu/crazy_carlas_father_dies_and_she_has_to_be_the/,"So after the last post about my mom Carla, I decided the best backstory on her to start with are the deaths of her two parents. I'll tell them separately because they're shit-shows individually.

Carla's parents used to live in our state; then they retired to Florida because that's what people do. We'd see them probably twice a year; they'd come up in the summer, and we'd go to them for Thanksgiving. This was pretty much how it was my entire life.  Carla's brother and his family (who live in a third state) would do something similar.

As Carla's parents got older, it became really hard for her and my uncle to go to Florida every time one of their parents needed something, so they sat their parents down and told them they could either move to be close to Carla or move to be close to my uncle. They chose to be near Carla since that's the state they're originally from. Carla pretty much set this up though; she promised her parents she would see them more if they lived closer (read, like once a week), etc. Basically trying to make up for the fact she had gone like 15-20 years only seeing them twice a year. Carla's mother deems this an appropriate task for her daughter, and Carla and my uncle schlep the parents up north.

Fast forward. Carla and my father divorce. I start college. Carla lives 50 minutes from her parents. Carla's parents are not getting any younger. They complain she is not seeing them enough. Carla tells her mother not to call more than once a day. Carla's mother cries to me regularly. I call Carla to tell her. Nothing changes.

Carla's father gets sick. I visit him before I leave for a summer job 4 hours away.  Carla calls me every few days to tell me he's going to die. I call my aunt. My aunt tells me he's hanging in there and he's not going to die any second like Carla is insisting.

Carla starts calling insisting I come home. She is sitting by his bedside. My aunt insists that it's not worth leaving my job and to hang tight; she will call me when she thinks I need to be there.

Carla continues to remind me how she is sitting by my grandfather's bedside while I'm off 4 hours away working in a different state. Aunt insists Carla is ""waiting for grandpa to die"".  Meanwhile, I call grandpa because I'm afraid I won't get to speak to him. It's great. Carla is not pleased.

Aunt calls me one day while I'm out with my dad and step-mom who came to visit. She says ""Grandpa isn't doing well, you should plan to have to get up here in the next couple days."" Then a few hours later she calls and says, ""I'm so sorry, he's gone. The funeral is going to be tomorrow.""  Carla is PISSED that Aunt told me Grandpa died. Whatever Carla. Carla insists on calling everyone on planet earth to tell them her father has died. Carla makes multiple posts on Facebook that her father has died. While these things piss me and everyone else off, everyone grieves differently, and I let Carla's Facebook things go.  Carla also insists I absolutely cannot bring my dad to the funeral. I have no car in said city, I tell her, and dad is here and willing to take time out of his vacation to drive me. Carla insists he is not welcome even as a comfort to me and that I should ""fly there"" and dad can pay for it. My distant cousins contact me (because my Aunt called them and explained my dilemma); they live in the same city I am currently in and tell me I can ride with them the 5 hours to the cemetery for the funeral the next day.

Distant cousins and I schlep 5 hours in the car (one way) to my great-aunt's house, where we ate food before the funeral. Carla has brought her obnoxious male friend (not boyfriend, just a friend). I stay near my aunt, uncle, and their two daughters during this lunch because Carla is hovering over my grandma (her mother). Finally I approach Carla to hug her (only because I want to hug my grandma). Carla tells me she's disappointed that I did not come sooner. She asks if I will be coming back to home state with her after the funeral for the memorial service at the nursing home, and to sit shiva. I tell her no, that distant cousins need to be back in the city tonight, and I need to be back as well since they are my ride. She deems this unacceptable. Grandma pulls me aside and tells me she's glad I came up at all, and that I do not have to sit shiva if I need to be at my ""very important internship"".

Funeral time comes. We drive to the cemetery. It is raining. It is June. It is hot, and muggy, and basically disgusting. We are all in suits and dresses. We have a grave-side service. Carla and uncle stand together with grandma, closest to Rabbi and the casket. I stand with aunt and her daughters, behind Carla. Everyone else is behind us. Uncle gives a very nice eulogy. It's Carla's turn. Carla makes this super weepy speech about...her. And yes, some stuff about Grandpa's accomplishments, but mostly about her.

Then it is time to lower the casket. This is when hell breaks loose. It is raining very hard at this point. Uncle is holding an umbrella over grandma. They go to lower the casket. It almost falls off the supports, it's going in crooked, it's basically the jankiest thing ever. And kind of horrific to watch. They manage to straighten the casket and get it in the ground. Then, as is tradition, everyone shovels dirt into the grave. My uncle helps grandma, then escorts her under cover. All of us take our turns. Except Carla. Carla starts bawling and says she cannot possibly watch this, turns, leaves, and goes 500 feet away to sit in her car. The rest of us (it's pouring by now) stay to fill in the grave as best as we can. It's muddy, my one cousin ruins a suit, another ruins shoes, we're soaked and cold.

Once we finish, it's time to leave to go back to great-aunts to change and drive back to the city. I say my goodbyes to everyone, thank them for coming. Carla is still in her vehicle...not thanking people. I approach her car. She rolls down the window. I say ""bye Carla, get grandma back safe, I'll see you soon."" She glares at me and rolls up the window. She says goodbye to absolutely no one.

I get a call the next day from Carla. She is furious. ""You did not stand next to me at the funeral. You did not comfort me. You are a horrible daughter. And you aren't here now where you should be."" I'm taken back. Number one, I stood back because that was appropriate. Number 2, my one cousin who is younger was crying, and I felt that since I was standing next to her, it was probably good for me to comfort her. Third, fucking Carla hid in her car while the rest of us did what was necessary. Carla had always taught me to suck it up and deal with it, even at funerals when I was a child, so like the fuck Carla? She proceeds to tell me how disappointed my grandma is in me and how I have been a bad granddaughter.

I am seriously hurt. Not by Carla, like fuck that. But I call my grandma when I know Carla is away and ask her about what Carla said. Oma insists this is not at all what she said, and that she loves me very much, and that Carla was already going through Opa's things and told me if I wanted anything to call Aunt, because otherwise Carla was going to give it away or throw it out.

I come to find out that at the nursing home memorial service, Carla was a complete terror to everyone. Friends of ours who could not attend the funeral went, and were ashamed of how Carla behaved. She was yelling at the nursing home staff, scolding my grandma, complaining about how I wasn't there, and telling everyone who would listen how distraught she was over the loss of her father. Aunt insists this is ""Jewish guilt for neglecting your grandparents for so many years"".

I did not speak to Carla for a few months after this incident.

TL;DR - Carla makes deaths about her and blames everyone else for her issues."
4txevl,3,2016-07-21,Need some life/relationship input. How do I climb out of this hole?,Sureiforgotsomething,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4txevl/need_some_liferelationship_input_how_do_i_climb/,"Throwaway, but I like the username so much, I might make it permanent.

Things have been really tough for me over the past year. I'm on the verge of breaking every day. Don't worry, nothing suicidal. I just need some advice/support from people who are dealing with similar issues.

I met my wife during our freshman year of college while on a camping trip with our friends. I was immediately struck by the fact that she was beautiful, smart, and fucking lightning quick with a retort. I was an engineering student with an internship at one of our local military bases. I'd been accepted to a 4 year university and was planning on going there after finishing the pre-engineering program at my local state college.

High school was no problem for me. I didn't even have to study. After I met her, I started struggling academically and began to fail, putting my state sponsored academic scholarship in jeopardy. The science was getting over my head. I thought it was too tough for me. Coupled with the fact that I had a new girl who was occupying ALL of my thoughts, it was too much. (I hope you guys realize I don't blame any of this on her)

At this point, I'm 20. I decided to change my major to business. I figured I could handle that. How hard could it be? I also decided to go to a different university. (Many of you can probably guess it's the same university that my wife had left for the semester before. My parents say me down and told me that if I decided to go through with the change, they wouldn't help me move or support me financially when I got there. (Poor little white boy, I know) That didn't matter to me. They were true to their word though. I had to get a full time job as soon as I got there. Big mistake. Next thing you know, I was working 40+ hours a week (sometimes my shifts were from 9am-11:30pm) and still trying to keep up with a school career and an increasingly serious relationship. With all of my savings, I bought her an engagement ring, went and talked to her parents, and proposed. I assured her we would be finishing college before we got married to start our lives off right. We set a date and started planning.

Grades in business began to drop. I began to fail, which put me on academic probation and I lost my scholarship. Another major change? Sure. Communications/PR was sure to be the right for for me.

At this point, I'm 24 and as the next few semesters went on, my grades got worse. I got kicked out of my university. It was a (very small) wake up call. I went before the academic board and plead my case. It was the scariest thing I'd ever done. Very humbling. ""We"" decided I should quit and focus on school. I was readmitted and starting making As and Bs. The wedding date was near and, in what I can only assume is an act of faith in me when I hadn't shown any reason to have it, she agreed to become my wife. 

We moved in together. She had already graduated and started working. I finished my degree with nothing lower than a B after getting kicked out. We moved back to our hometown to search for jobs. Public sector jobs in this city are non existent. No one told us college students the job market would be so saturated that a lot of us would have to take minimum wage jobs right out of college in order to survive. I was a teller.

I'm 25 when the wife gets pregnant with our son. We had no clue how to be parents. Hell, I didn't know this then, but I didn't even know how to be an adult. I stayed at the bank and my wife had to work right up until the day before our son was delivered in order to maximize her leave after the baby arrived. (Don't get me started on paid family/medical leave) My son is born and things don't change. Stuck at a bank teller job making nothing.

Wife gets pregnant with #2. (We didn't figure out what was causing it until after the second one popped up) At this point, I know I need to start making more money and consider a career change. What something really easy I could start doing very soon? Teaching. In the state of FL, all you have to do is pass a certification test to start teaching any grade/subject. Middle school science? I'm all over that shit. How sad is it that I considered a teacher's salary a step in the right direction? 

When my wife has our daughter, I sign on my benefits website and add my daughter as a dependent but since it was during open enrollment, I also had to add her manually to the insurance policy. (all things I'd never done before and didn't ask for help with) Guess what I didn't do. No insurance for my daughter. Medical debt adds a new layer of fuckery to the entire relationship. Everything just sort of stagnates until October 27, 2016. 5 days after my 33 birthday.

I'll pause and tell you that she had been telling me I needed to be better and make/do more this entire time. There were so many issues (her ring, our house) that led to October 2015. All of them similar issues though. Just me not doing what I should have done from the beginning. You know, when I actually type this shit out, it's even more apparent how clueless I was.

In October she told me she didn't think she loved me anymore. She told me that I had put her in a position she never thought she would be and she didn't think she wanted to be married to me anymore. She thought someone else would be able to give her the things she wanted and I would never change. It felt like all of the life had been pulled out of me. How can she not see how much I love her and our family. It's clear now I wasn't showing her the way she needed to be shown. I convinced her to go to counseling and guess what our therapist caught on the second appointment. I got diagnosed in February.

I've been on meds (Adderall) since then and things have improved with regards to my work ethic, but we stopped going to counseling. My wife didn't like it. She's very angry and resentful right now. Understandably. The problem is she won't stop being angry and resentful. I finally (took nearly a year) had to come to the realization that if she was going to find someone else, it was her choice and I had to let it happen. I started to see I was going to have to start doing better for me first.

A couple of weeks ago, I applied to a state university's college of engineering. That's right, it's like 15 years ago all over again. This time I know it isn't too hard though. This time I know I'll be an engineer within 3 years. (I already have a lot of the prereqs done since it was my original major) My salary will be tripled. Maybe more.

Here's the issue: I have to start back to work at my teaching job in a few weeks. I'd like to find a job working at night and hopefully it won't be too difficult to keep contributing what equates to a teacher's salary on that kind of job while going to school during the day. 

My wife is done supporting me emotionally. At least every other day she tells me she's done with me and wants out to be free to find someone else. She won't pull the trigger though. When stress occurs, I hear it. When things are okay, I hear, ""I love you."" I can't express how much I love this woman. I don't want it to end, but it's causing me to worry about how she feels constantly.

I know if I quit my job, she will be gone forever. I know if I don't get my ass in gear, she will be gone forever. I really want to be an engineer. I've discovered a love for science while teaching it and my medication has allowed me to learn so much more than I could before. I'm literally a new person, but because of so many screw ups in the past, she can't see it. What do I do?

I know it was long so feel free to ask for clarification on any issue. I'm not proud, so I'll clear it up.

TL;DR A string of bad decisions have left me in a dead end job with my marriage hanging on by a thread. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. How do I get to it?

Edit: Words and I also don't want people reading the comments and think I am in any way saying my wife has caused these issues. My complaint is that she isn't letting them die either by leaving or deciding to forgive."

4txjbc,3,2016-07-21,Need advice for credit card debt,indy_throwaway4,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4txjbc/need_advice_for_credit_card_debt/,"Fairly simple, at least I hope.

I have a credit card, had it since I was a junior in college. I am a year into my career after graduating. At one point when I was in college, I racked up a lot of balance on it but paid it off thanks to my internship. (To attach numbers, I put about $1500 balance on a $4000 credit limit, but again I paid that off)

When I graduated and got my own place and car and stuff, life happened. I now have a $7000 credit limit but a little over $4000 balance...

I consistently make the minimum payment of around $130 each month. This has been consistent since I even got the card, except for one time I used a different card to pay the balance and it didn't update and it was weird but I managed to pay it nonetheless, barring a late fee.

Question is: are there any consequences that this provider will be coming to me about that I should know of, for maintaining this balance for about a year, or do I just keep making the monthly payment (and more) in order to eliminate the debt? Consequences including legal action, demanding debt payoff, anything like that. I am expecting (and hoping) the first comment is a simple ""No.""

tl;dr - have a credit card with $7000 limit, $4000 balance, wondering if there will be any incoming legal recourse or if I just need to keep eliminating the balance.

edit: just thought of credit score implications and I already have a good credit score but I expect it may drop over time. If that's it, no big deal, just need to rebuild credit."

I kind of feel low and left out, because I hardly ever know what they're talking about. Also, I'm a girl and guys don't seem to want to generally include us in normal conversations.

Sorry for the rambling.

But yeah, do I HAVE to program competitively, and is the language really important?

4txjy2,87,2016-07-21,"""Everything happens for a reason"" &lt;--- Yes, NO, yes...",secondsaturdaysally,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/4txjy2/everything_happens_for_a_reason_yes_no_yes/,"Long time lurker, first time poster. Wanted to share a little of my story. A former anxious atheist, I converted @ 18* from a messed up and toxic non-religious family, and was a superstar TBM for the next ~20 years. Met my husband at a university ward in the eastern US. Water balloons were exchanged. I ran. He chased. 11 months later (one week after we both graduated) we were married in the temple.  None of my family were present. One of the most traumatic experiences of my life.* 

After college, we moved to Utah for graduate school. It was hell for a New England girl.  I had the temerity to pursue a graduate degree in engineering. I was asked multiple times why I was still in school since I already had a degree. When was I going to get to the REAL woman's work of starting a family? 

Then there were the in-laws, with whom we met at least once a week for the 4 years we were in Utah. My husband is from hands-down the most judgmental and hypocritical TBM+ family* I have ever heard of. It doesn't matter if your heart is prepared, or your thoughts centered on Christ---if you don't take the sacrament with the right hand, you are WRONG in the eyes of God. Father-in-law worked for the church for 30+ years. Scads of kids, close to 50 grand kids. I will perhaps share some of their stories at another time. 

Worst of all was the toxic culture though. Husband and I were never able to get pregnant. The never ending pressure, the damned proclamation reminding me at every turn that my one great purpose in life (to give birth to and love and raise children) was thwarted. I grew to see myself as an abomination, worthless in the eyes of God. Everything happens for a reason though, so in my mind God was trying to protect His precious spirits from having me as a mother, knowing that since my childhood had messed me up so badly, I'd probably be a terrible mother. Rather than seeing the environment / church as the problem it was, I turned the blame (and concomitant shame) inward. Huge amounts of depression / anxiety. Suicidal ideation. I had one NOMish friend, without whom I would not have survived. My husband and I both graduated and moved.

We did internships, got jobs, moved every few years but never back to the Moridor. I got a LOAD of therapy from someone (not LDS) who legitimately changed my life. All through this, staying 100% faithful, attending the temple despite the distance, holding leadership callings in RS presidencies, YW presidencies, even in a stake YW presidency. But always the infertility. Always the knowledge that as a woman, I was less. Always knowing the promised blessings of eternal children were a load of CRAP. Why then was it so vitally important for women to make babies in this life?

After 10 years, we were finally in a place where we could adopt. My mom had been adopted, as had numerous other family members. I thought this gave me added insight into the long term issues / impacts. We went through LDS family services, trained and expecting an open adoption of a healthy infant. But the first person to contact us was a single mother of a 3 year old looking to place her daughter.* We felt the Spirit tell us to fight for her, so that's what we did. And are doing. There's a book in this experience. I'll spare you the details for now. Suffice to say, we have had our daughter in our life now for 5+ years. She is a complex trauma kiddo (oppositional defiant, ADD, RAD, alphabet soup). This experience completely opened my eyes to another side of the universe. Forced me to face the idea that ""everything happens for a reason"" is pure bullshit. How can I begin to believe that God is somehow in charge of who gets born, where /when / how?  I saw the ugly underbelly, the intersection of poverty, mental illness and abuse. We love our daughter. But we fight a war every day for survival--ours and hers. It is not easy to love a child whose only bone-deep survival skill is to NEVER trust adults for any reason ever.  Suddenly it became very clear that everything does not happen for a reason. God doesn't reward righteous women with fertility. Near as I can tell, some of the most fertile people in the world are those least emotionally / psychologically competent to meet the needs of the babies born to them.* And there are literally millions of these kiddos all over the world, in the system, not yet identified by the system, living in orphanages or worse. My world view was decimated as I learned about the long-term impacts of early childhood trauma. It literally rewires the subconscious part of the brain, in many cases making it impossible for many of these kids to reason through decisions or (as we like to call it) ""exercise their moral agency"". My daughter has passed the age of accountability and has absolutely no impulse control. I cannot leave her alone or unattended without her destructive tendencies kicking into overdrive. The spiritual narrative of ""free will"" took a big hit. 

Fast forward to our most recent move, right after we adopted our kiddo. Around that time, a dear friend of mine introduced me to Feminist Mormon Housewives. Suddenly I discovered I was not alone in my suffering. I began to think to myself for the first time, ""maybe it's not appropriate for my church to dictate how / where / and when I wear my underwear"".*  I realized my terrible experiences at the temple were not at all unusual. That there were systemic problems even greater than the ones that nearly drove me to take my life. I reached out to friends who left the church. Found Mormon Stories, A Thoughtful Faith, the CES letter, and finally Thoughtful Transitions. I was a NOM for about 2 years.

Finally, after the November policy, I could no longer rationalize that the church was mostly good even if I no longer believed it to be actual truth. I continued attending til after Christmas so as not to drop the ball on my music calling. And then I got out.

And then the funniest thing happened. After ~20 years of believing that the bad things that happened in my life were punishments.....after over 15 years of infertility and blaming myself for not being righteous enough to deserve to get pregnant...I left the church.....and two months later (without doing anything) I was pregnant. And it sounds so stupid, but I really do believe THIS TIME that it happened for a reason. I believe that being in the church environment created a toxic amount of stress around the need for perfection, the importance of motherhood, and my sexuality. I felt the weight of the world drop off my shoulders when I no longer had to battle for survival in the church building once a week. I could finally and fully be my authentic, uncensored self.  Then (and only then) I was finally able to conceive, for the first and, given my ""advanced maternal age"", last time in my life. 

And that right there, childish or not, is the greatest piece of it all. I don't have to say a word. My in-laws have always been terrible to my husband about me (always have been)*. Especially when they found out I had left and that my husband had doubts. But now I can flip them all off without raising a finger. ;) I have my pregnant belly (now nearing the end of the second trimester) as a testimony that God does not sit around punishing the apostates for funsies. There are natural consequences for all choices, including membership in a church that teaches you that perfection is the only way to gain acceptance in the eyes of God. 

Just want to say thank you to so many here. I've been reading your stories at least daily (often more) for over a year. I've been drawing strength from your authenticity, your humor, your undeniable goodness. Thank you for that. &lt;3

4txrpv,1,2016-07-21,Some advice would be helpful :),SiL3NTK0D3R,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4txrpv/some_advice_would_be_helpful/,"Hello reddit,

First of all, let me provide little background about me. I am 22M, currently in University studying Software Engineering, going into 4th year. I am passionate about computers and technology in general, hence my decision on taking soft eng. I am passionate about it and is my primary hobby. I am constantly programming, always working on something. I love gaining knowledge. I started off freelancing when I was in high school, worked on few small projects for clients. 

When I was in 2nd year, I was programming in class one day, just doing my own thing. One of the classmate saw me working everyday, he invited me go to a hackathon with him, didn't win but it was a fun and educational experience. He is really good with networking with people, he has lots of connections with various people. So he asked me if I want to work on contracts with him; as a mean of opportunity I said yes and he got us our first contract together. We would split the pay 50/50. 

The contract was with the dean of the university, who had a client looking to create a huge software. So ended up signing the contract. Now he is also in the same program as I, soft eng, so I thought it will be fun working with other developer because all my previous contracts were independent. So the project started at the start of the school year in sept 2015. I have lots of experience, so I had no problem starting off by myself. We would have meeting with the client every 2 week with progress. 

I also had 6 courses first semester and 6 courses second semester. The contract was for the year. I worked on it every single day, during class, after class, before class, basically whenever I was free/had time, I was working. Few weeks went by, my colleague didn't really do anything. He would show up for the meeting, all was fine. I just continued working by myself. He never contributed anything to the development. Months went by, I still kept working. School started to get hectic, assignments, projects, exams, tests, papers + I had to work on the contract. I started pulling all nighter every other day working. I started sleeping 2-3 hours a day. 

I am a hard working person, I dedicate all my effort into the work, doesn't matter what type of work it is. I have worked in various field, even did labour jobs for few summer. It started to affect my school but it didn't bother me much because I was never good at school. I was constantly self-teaching myself from the internet, all the technical aspect. During meetings, he would pretend that we did equal work, so he would be like ""we worked on this feature last week, it was tedious but we pulled it off"", stuff like that, so the clients were always under the impression that we both were working on the system. The school year was coming to an end, and so was the contract. We were little behind because I was the ONLY one working on it, but the clients really liked the work and decided to hire us as interns for the summer of 2016. 

In the meantime, he also brought in another project. Which would be working in a startup. Again I said yes because I wanted experience. Started working on that at the start of the summer while still going to internship (8AM-5PM). Again for this project also, I was working by myself but he gave the impression to everybody else that he is also working on it and that we are working on it together. So I would go to work on that after I come back from work, as soon as I got home. I worked till late night, from 7 PM - 1 AM/2AM/3AM even pulling all nighter. 

Now the dean that I was working with for the year also had a project of his own that wanted developers so he asked us after the contract period to work on that. We took it, again only me working on it. I also had various people wanting me to work with them on their ideas and projects. 

So at internship, we go to work everyday. Its a private company, so there are only 3 employee working including myself and my colleague. The client had 4 projects that he wanted us to work on for the summer, along with the project that was ongoing the entire year. Again I was the only one doing all the work. Every time the boss delegate the tasks, he would just send me those tasks to complete so the boss still thought that we both were working. He is also getting the same pay as me and I feel like he's getting paid for doing nothing while I put in all the work. 

It has been 3 months at internship and the startup. He hasn't done single development work but everyone still thinks that we both are working. I am the type of people who doesn't like to brag so I never say anything. He always pretends that he did lots of work and that he is tired by the end of the day, whereas here I am sleep deprived working almost 20 hours a day. I have a lot of experience, so working on these projects are not an issue for me. 

I am a silent person, so I don't talk a lot. I just do my own thing. I am starting to hate my workplace, because I have to constantly work on my tasks and his so he can show my boss what he did for the day. I don't mind the work itself, because its something I am passionate about, have experience and am good at it. I don't talk about my feelings to anyone because I don't really have someone close that I can freely talk to about this. I don't go out anymore because I don't have time. I am constantly working 7 days a week just so I can get the work done on time and meet the deadlines. The entire summer I would go to work, come back and spend the rest of the day working from my room. 

I now have a month left till end of summer and internship and I can't take it anymore. I am not the type of person to just go out and tell the boss the truth because that would expose him in front of everyone. I also feel obligated to keep working and not say anything because he was the one initially that found work for me. I also get a lot of high pay job offers but I can't take it because I still have to finish school.  I don't know what to do. I am constantly tried, feel like zombie but still perform my best to meet the deadlines. 

Also during school year we decided to team up for projects and labs, but even those I was the ONLY one working on it.  

I am sorry for my long post but I felt like I needed to vent. Any advice would be appreciated."
4txvms,4,2016-07-21,"Never been so confused, should I take the job offer?",herpinator69,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4txvms/never_been_so_confused_should_i_take_the_job_offer/,"I am a computer science senior that graduates next month. So much has happened in the past two months that I am confused to which path I should take in life. Two months ago I got a scholarship and funding to attend graduate school. Sadly, most of the graduate school deadlines had passed and I could not apply to the places I wanted to go but, my school made an exception. It’s not a great school but, it is an accredited state school that I wouldn’t mind going back for my Masters. My plan was to get my Masters in a year and a half and continue practicing algorithms in order to interview at the big four. However, I got an internship this summer at a big oil company and now I am confused. 
At first, I was in it for the money since they were offering 7k a month as an intern. However, the more I am here, the more I am starting too like it but, I still have some doubts in my mind.

**The pros of working at this large company.**

* Pay is good, 80k+ starting in Houston where cost of living is low. It is a lot better than many other people from my graduating class who are making around 60k.

* Great benefits, everyone seems happy and there is a great life to work balance. Many people here have stayed with the company for a long time.

* Although it’s not the best city, I like living in big cities and it’s close to home. 

* I am working with a team that I like, but they do let you move around if you wish.

**The cons of working at the company.**

* Wasting my graduate school scholarship. It lasts until I turn 25, so I have five years to decide but, I feel like I won’t go back in the future. I don’t mind graduate school, I enjoyed taking courses as an undergrad.

* I feel like I will be stuck here, never get to work for my “dream” companies over at the big four. I got calls from two of them last month asking to interview (I’m surprised since I am not from a “good” school). However, I would have failed the interviews and told them I would contact them in a few months when I am prepared. I have been doing a lot of top coder, CTCI and was planning on taking a lot of AI/algorithm courses next semester.

My boss wants me to stay full time starting next month since they are looking for someone to add to the team. My recruiter and boss have been asking me what I want to do. However, I’m not sure if I should accept the offer, I feel like I shouldn’t waste the opportunity. What if I am not good enough to get into the big four or I don’t like it there and I want to come back? I wouldn’t mind going back to graduate school either, even if I stayed in the company I would get a 10k+ raise with a graduate degree.

Graduate school or job at big company? WHAT DO I DO!!!

Can anyone shed any light?

4txys0,6,2016-07-21,How hard is it to actually get an internship/job in San Francisco?,themooseexperience,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4txys0/how_hard_is_it_to_actually_get_an_internshipjob/,"So I'm still going into my sophomore year undergrad, but if there is one thing I love more than CS it's the Bay Area. Every time I have been there (I have family there) it has just... I don't want to get sappy, but it's somewhat ""called to me."" I know that's where I want to live. 

Let's say, for all intents and purposes, I'm a ""very good candidate"" by graduation. Top 20 CS program, some few side projects and a few internships, etc etc. Not a rockstar, but very good. How intense is the job hunt really in San Francisco? I know that obviously it is kind of the center for tech right now, but with that I feel like comes a lot of companies that are looking for employees. So, for those of you working in SF, how was your job search? 

Alternatively, I'm going to start applying to those internships I hope to have by graduation soon. I would LOVE to intern in San Francisco, but go to school in Wisconsin... Is there any sense in applying to / inquiring about internships in SF? Anyone have any experience with that? 

Thanks!! "

I have a 3.3 unweighted GPA after Junior year, around a 3.6 weighted I think. I'm expecting to score a 1400 at least the next time I take the SAT.

Some extracurriculars I participate in are Robotics club, Rocketry Club, Bike Team, and I play music around my city along with being in orchestra. I also work as a services intern managing data flow at a local healthcare IT company. 

With these academics and extracurriculars, can I safely plan on attending University of Michigan? My ideal goal for college is to get a dual/double degree in Computer Sciences and Jazz Studies.

Should I be concerned?,MassW0rks,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4tybpj/only_12_week_internship_should_i_be_concerned/,"I'm about to be a senior in my Networking program. I've only had one internship. It'll be over in a couple of weeks and it's only lasted 12. I hear some people tell me that it's not enough experience to get a ""real job."" Should I be worried? I really don't know how to find a part time IT job during school time. Most places want full time employees.

EDIT: I also have the possibility of doing some unpaid work. I would do it, but I've been told that employers sometimes won't count that experience because there's no proof (like a W2) of you working there."
4tyfpd,1,2016-07-21,"I [23 M] am really interested in a [29 F] woman, but don't know if I should start something serious w/her",srhreddit,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4tyfpd/i_23_m_am_really_interested_in_a_29_f_woman_but/,"I had made this post a few weeks ago on the dating section, but did not get very many responses and wanted to see if I could get more advice on this situation, so I will post it again since I will be meeting this woman I'm interested in very soon. 

Hello /r/relationships. As you saw from the title, there is this girl that I'm interested in and I don't know if it would be worth it to ask her out. If I do decide to ask her out, I still wouldn't know how to approach her. Let me explain a little about myself and our history together.

I'm an U.S. undergraduate student that has just finally been able to travel around the world with money from my job. I met this girl in Berlin, Germany this past December. We were both in the same German language class together. I had asked her if she wanted to hang out sometime and she said yes. We hung out from time to time during my stay in Germany (3 weeks) and became very good friends. I found out that she is Russian and originally from Moscow. She is currently getting ready to head back to Germany(more specifically in Potsdam) in the month of August to go to the university she got accepted to there. I will also be heading back to Germany this August because I got accepted for a year-long exchange program through my college. However, I will be heading to Bamberg instead since that's where my university is at. Bamberg and Potsdam are only a 3-hour drive from each other by car (I will have some sort of my own transportation while in Germany)

Moving on from this past December to March. This girl invited me to stay w/her in Moscow for my Spring Break, which I did. I stayed in her apartment for the week. Most of the time she was working, but we would go out together some nights. It was during this week I really started to develop a crush for her. Whenever we were together, we would always have something to talk about. We would always talk about interesting stuff too like philosophy, our families, and even math. It sounds a bit cliche, but I think I have a crush on her because she's smart, funny, and very independent. I don't think she has a crush on me, but I know she finds me smart and funny at least from what I've observed from our conversations. Also, I don't think she views me being at her level of maturity either if that makes any sense, so I guess I have that going against me as well.

Moving on to now. I'm in Novosibirsk, Russia for an internship this July and will be heading back to Moscow during the last week of July. She will be in Moscow during the same time period I'm there. She's said she wouldn't mind meeting me for lunch.

I'm not going to lie, it would be nice to have a serious relationship w/her and have something long distance while we are close to each other in Germany during this next academic year coming up, but I don't think that would be very realistic or even practical for either of us. She is the most amazing woman I have met in my life so far, so I think I would be fine with just taking her out on one serious date just to have that experience with her.

What advice do you redditors have for me on this situation? Should I try to start something serious w/her while in Russia or when we meet again in Germany(she has said she wants to meet again in Germany). Or should I just take her out on date and see what happens from there? I know this post seems a bit disorganized. It is because my thoughts on this situation are (still) disorganized as well and I don't know what to do.

TL:DR Met an amazing girl that is older than me and we got to know each other these past few months. We will both be in cities that are close-by to one another in Germany this next year. Should I try to start a serious long-distance relationship w/her, just ask her out on one date and see what goes from there, or do nothing at all and wait till I meet her again in Germany to figure something out? Thanks in advance to anyone that can help me out."
4tyh6p,156,2016-07-21,The Other Mother,Lisichki,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4tyh6p/the_other_mother/,"There's no doubt my daughter saved my life. Like a red, wet, little angel she came screaming into the world; and she saved me. 

Alright, I might not be dead by now, (I'm only 38, after all) but my self-destructive tendencies would certainly have lead me somewhere...else, darker. Or, left me in that warehouse, unknown and unloved, maybe to die or simply, horrifically, be forgotten. 

You see, Casey, my girl, she came into the life in a less than...usual situation. You don't end up in a disused warehouse ragged and wrecked, with a bundle of damp baby in your arms and a knife in your hand, recently sacrificed umbilical cord trailing away from her, without having made some, er, unwise life decisions.

It was just one of the ways she saved me, the circumstances of her birth. Being a baby-off-the-books, as it were, made things a little complicated legally— more so than they already were. I had no money (that much should be evident by now, my 26 years had not been spent exactly productively) so the hiring of a lawyer was out of the question, as was going straight to the hospital or police—I had just found her, to have her ripped away from me into the arms of ""authority"" and ""legality"" would certainly have killed me. 

So, I took it into my own hands. After heading to my flat's resident ""Grandma"" (Gramgram Dorothy, rest her soul, such a kind woman) I had Casey clean, safe and wrapped up warm, perfectly healthy despite her less than pristine entrance. I had my various injuries cleaned, but I was mostly just exhausted. And then I went to work. It was draining. I had very little help; I looked after Casey most of the time and studied the rest of it. I hit the books at every opportunity and, relatively quickly, had the necessary knowledge to make Casey a fully fledged paper person-birth certificate and all, with my name proudly displayed. The only other name. 

I must admit, I didn't transform immediately. We still needed money, then more than ever — formula and diapers, school trips and text books, they add up! So I was still...less than saintly, but I came clean as soon as I got my first internship (unpaid) and supported us by doing odd-jobs around the office.

My drive clearly paid off. You can look at us now; Casey has started upper school— private, thank you very much, none of that common crap that I grew up on— and I am currently the strongest candidate for partner in the entire law firm. None of the others have my hunger, my reason. I should be head partner by the time Casey goes to college.

I specialise in family law, close to my heart, for obvious reasons; I do a lot of pro bono work for disadvantaged girls, girls who could do great things if only society would look through their criminal past. 
This morning, Tim (my colleague) handed me a case ""built for me"". Tracey Wilson, 34, a runaway youth turned florist. Had a baby at the blossoming age of 22, but, with the street world of drugs and crime whirling in her head, lost the baby.
No, the child didn't die; the mother lost her. Weak and wretched, pathetically she had been unable (or unwilling) to keep the girl form being taken form her.
The woman had hired a private detective—when she finally had the money— to help her track down the child that had become a phantom, another's reality. Now, though nebulous, the detective has some information to go on and Tracey is seeking legal help in the hope of the day she sees the girl that never was, in the hope of taking her.

Now, I swallow thickly as I read her file once more. This is impossibly hard. The photograph (presumably included to garner sympathy) echoes back to me through the years. Sure, her eyes are more sunken, her hair limper and her face more worn (a contrast to my full features and fresh skin, in spite of the age difference), but I can remember the reflection of our situation. I can see, from above, the pathetic wretch on the floor of that stale warehouse, young face wracked with pain and tired delirium. I can see that bundle of bloody rags cupped to her belly; I can see the flash of the bone handled knife my Grandad gave me for Christmas, can see the glint as it cuts the tentative cord of blood. I can hear her feeble screams as she looses; looses blood, looses a life.

I feel vaguely sick. I look at the gap-toothed grin of Casey, beaming out at me from her frame on my desk. The grin that's been the glory of my life for 12 years.

I look back at the file in my hands. I don't know how I'm going to do this— but I have to take this case."

I'm a university student nearing the end of a 16-month internship. I had to move for this internship and I'm renting a basement apartment near my place of work from a retired couple. 

In the contract for this apartment, it stated it was all-inclusive. Specifically relevant to this AITA is that internet was included. 

8 months ago, the couple I'm renting from decided they wanted to have a long visit in Florida for the winter. They told me they would be gone for 2 months and asked if I would be willing to pay for the internet while they were away, as I would be the only one using it. I agreed at the time because it was within my budget to spare an extra $150 for the two months of internet service ($75/month).

However, the wife had an accident near the end of their stay in Florida and ended up staying for an extra 6 months recovering. They just got back yesterday. Today, she asked me for a cheque for the $600 for the 8 months of internet.

Am I the asshole for not wanting to pay for the extra 6 months of internet service? "

4tynyn,6,2016-07-21,Creepy Guy At Work,Droidbeast,creepyencounters,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyencounters/comments/4tynyn/creepy_guy_at_work/,"I'm currently an intern at a physical therapy and rehabilitation center that doubles as a gym, doing mundane tasks like cleaning and resetting equipment and restocking supplies. I get access to the whole building with the exception of the men's restroom; I therefore see a lot of folks coming in and out during my two hour shifts, including my mother.


To give some idea of what the place looks like as it will be important later, it's essentially one large chamber with large glass panels along the two outer walls holding the exits and entrances to the building. There's a receptionist desk in the front, and to the back is the break room, showers, bathrooms, and laundry room. There is equipment lined up in rows horizontally in the center of the main room, with handheld equipment and larger machines arranged along the glass walls. There are several large mirrors in front of the treadmills, meaning you're still able to see the whole room while facing away from the entrance.


Now to the story, one that happened about two weeks ago:


My mother dropped me off in the parking lot as usual, and I was making my way toward the front entrance. I pass by two people exiting the building, but then I notice something strange. Along the sidewalk, just behind one of the pillars holding up the canopy, I saw a young man who looked to be in his early 20's. 


This didn't click as creepy for me as we get people young and old in the facility, so a young adult was nothing to fuss about. What was weird to me was that he seemed to be deliberately trying to make himself scarce, like he didn't want to be seen. I have anxiety problems and am also autistic, so understanding the difference between danger and safety is difficult for me. I tend to assume the worst of strange characters, so I was obviously more alert than usual. I decided, just in case this guy wanted a piece of me, to look confident and put my short but meaty appearance to good use. I walked by a little nervous, but without incident. 


Once I got to work, I chalked off the sight as some nervous guy waiting for a friend or maybe an opportunity to enter the building without other people around-- if he was anxious about meeting new people, I couldn't blame him. 


About 30 minutes later I was making my rounds on the center equipment, mostly exercise bikes, cleaning the seats and handles and collecting forgotten trash. There were only a few people in that day including my mother, so the environment was pretty peaceful. 


That same guy showed up as I was heading to the receptionist office to shred some papers. I hadn't noticed him waiting to check in and had never seen him before in my time there; I knew just about every patient who came in during my shift, either by name or face, so this was pretty strange. 


The stranger was sitting on one of the exercise bikes, just... playing with the handles and staring at me as I walked by. I only then noticed that his white shirt was blotched with stains, wearing ratty looking jeans and sandals. I didn't know what to think, so I just carried on with my chores and keeping an eye out for any more weird behavior from the guy.


After my mom had left to go pick my sister up from college, I lost sight of the man and decided he'd gotten bored and left. We typically allow people to just walk in if they're not due for an appointment, so I figured he was some weirdo athlete checking the place out and decided it wasn't to his liking. 


The creepiest part of this whole thing was when I saw him standing in the middle of the parking lot. He wasn't waiting on a car to pass or anything, he was just... standing there, looking down, perfectly still with his back facing me. I couldn't help but stare for a little while, partly to try and understand what I was looking at and partly to make sure I had him in my sights. Alarms are going off in my head at this point, and I'm mentally preparing myself for anything by now. When nothing happened, I headed back to the laundry room to collect my nerves and wait for a bit.


The guy must of wandered off at some point, because when I came back out there was no sign of him. I was on edge for a while after, going as far to make sure I was in the company of another person at all times for the rest of my shift. I didn't tell anyone about it because it didn't seem like anyone was in danger, I was just a little spooked. 


Definitely not the most eventful encounter in the world, but definitely one of the creepiest things I've experienced."

4tyrbk,1,2016-07-21,[20/m] struggling to cope with a shared past and not sure what do about my [20/f] bisexual lover's issues with male-female connection,TheCrunch96,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4tyrbk/20m_struggling_to_cope_with_a_shared_past_and_not/,"Hi everyone, I'm going to pose my question here and then for those who really are interested below it will be the massive context to the situation.

I was emotionally abused by my parents growing up who both struggled with mental illness and other issues. This led to me for years being closed off and afraid of any physical contact, intimacy, or vulnerability. (I couldn't hug anyone without feeling sick until I was 17.) Besides this, I have always been very normal, with plenty of friends and I know I am not unattractive, but even as I've made massive progress through the years, I still struggle with initiating intimacy or allowing vulnerability around friends and those I care about.

This past semester I met [20/f] and we had an instant, much deeper than sexual, connection to each other without ever speaking. When I asked her out for coffee we divulged our life stories and deepest secrets, things we both had never told anyone let alone someone newly met. We found out that we had similar traumatic upbringings, although hers was heart wrenchingly awful, marred with sexual abuse, physical abuse, being institutionalized and told by psychiatrists she'd never live a normal life, and struggles with coming out of the closet to her conservative parents.

The first night we spent together is agreed upon by both of us as the most cathartic, healing experience we have ever felt, and while she was the first person I had ever sex with, it was the first time she had ever been able to take, and enjoy, penetration for more than a minute. We literally cried afterwards, and since then we have a mutual understand of how special and important that is to us. She had recently come out of a toxic two year relationship with her past girlfriend, and had never had an emotional connection with a male before, so we have taken things very slowly with care, not assigning labels or creating any expectations until she recently went away for the summer for an internship. I know she has been struggling immensely with her sexuality her whole life, and that substantial, beyond sexual feelings towards a male is very difficult and new for her. 

However when she went away, continued with no rules or expectations, but both of us were wondering whether we should be exclusive or not. I assumed because she was around these gorgeous, Instagram model looking outdoorsmen and women that she would want to be open (she has needs that I cant attend to when I'm 1500 miles away obviously). But she initially wanted to remain monogamous to each other while she was away. Eventually obvious sexual tension arose and I sensed it, and we laid ground rules down for openness while she was gone; most notably that if one of us did hook up with someone, we'd tell each other immediately, and that if she were to hook up with someone I'd prefer it to be a girl because of how special and meaningful to us our sex was.

Her internship in the mountains of California is exceptionally important to her. It's the first time she's ever been away from her horrible family life, away from an area with so many bad memories for her, and an experience she gets to have only years after doctors told her she would never even be able to graduate high school. This is her time to heal and come to terms with a torrid past, and I have tried to give her as much space as possible to grow. I must admit, I fucked up a bit by going overboard by using her as an outlet for all of my negative thoughts once I started dealing the depressive episodes I get like clockwork when the summer comes around, but I had gotten so used to divulging everything that I fear I overwhelmed her and caused her to over evaluate our relationship. We'd have beautiful phone calls in the few moments she was free and had phone service, but it's very obvious there's a growing disconnect caused by the distance and lack of face to face interaction. In a two week span she went from abruptly calling me just to tell me that she didn't ever want to alienate me and make me feel like I was ignored, to falling off the face of the earth during her 8 day break, intentionally ignoring me while I plunged into a (unrelated) irrationally anxious depressive episode, culminating in a bizarre, rattling text that clearly spooked her. 

When she finally called me, she admitted that she had been ignoring me and felt bad about it, but that she needed to ""focus only on whats going on around here."" I asked her if I had been dumping too much baggage on her and she said that yes, she can't handle it right now, which I fully understand. 

Here are the things that concern me. She was partially avoiding me because she had sex with a male coworker and didn't want to hurt me. She realizes how much she despises home, and even though she is returning to our college for the fall semester, she wants to study abroad immediately after to escape.[u]Most important however is this: She explained that she feels the intimacy and connection we have fading from just text and phone calls, and she's beginning to wonder if that emotional connection that she had never had with a guy before is there.[/u] She doesn't know if she feels for me as a lover, or as a best friend, and says that the biggest difficulty is that it doesn't ""feel the same as it did with my girlfriends."" I pointed out that this made sense because its a whole new dynamic she has never experienced before, and she conceded that its possible that is why. We both agree that the lack of intimacy from phone calls and texting, plus the distance in general could easily be whats causing this, but we are both afraid of losing what we have. When she get's back she wants to try and go back to the way things were before she had left, no labels, physical intimacy and spending the night, and also that monogamy (at least with males). The problem is that she wants to try, she --hopes--, but doesn't know if she has it in her, and as an INFJ (for all you psych nerds) I fear that she's going to ruminate over it in her head over and over until she makes a conclusion before she even comes back.

I truly believe that the distance and lack of face to face contact is what's causing this, I am NOT an optimist, but when she sits on top of me (not during sex) in silence, gazing at me with wide eyes filled with incredible warmth for, smiling in a way I've never seen someone smile towards another person-- sometimes for twenty minutes at a time, I know [i]THAT[/i] connection is there, and I know its alien to her, because its so alien to me, but I feel like the distance and time is fading that from her memory. I can only imagine what someone who struggles with their sexuality goes through when trying to discern their emotions for someone, but I don't want her to come back with her mind made up because she over thought it.

I'm having another phone call with her tonight about it, What should I say to her? How do I handle this and deal with the fact that I'm emotionally invested and need to take a few steps back to match where she is with her partial emotional availability?

I loved where we were before, I'm very unorthodox and labels aren't important to me, I just don't want this beautiful connection to simmer out because of distance and emotional crisis.
____________________________________________________
I don't really know where to start with this so I may as well get the baggage/backstory out of the way first. My earliest memories are of emotional neglect and abuse from my parents. Both suffer from severe mental health problems but have managed to keep themselves enough together to function as part of society, but the impact of the neglect and trauma I experienced in my childhood has made intimate physical contact and emotional vulnerability a daily struggle for me. After surviving Hurricane Katrina both my parents withdrew entirely from the physical world; my mother attempted suicide infront of me multiple times, and my father became an alcoholic due to PTSD. I was left isolated by to deal with a new pain on top of the old trauma. 

I became emotionally numb, I felt nothing below the surface for those around me and I never was able to experience romantic feelings despite physical attraction, and my fear of vulnerability rendered me incapable of expressing my inner feelings towards those close to me. After I kicked my father out of my house at 15, I experienced an emotional awakening during a cathartic return to where my home once stood in New Orleans, and have been slowly come to understand and transform myself ever sense. I was unable to hug others without feeling ill until I was 17, and first felt the thrill of having feelings for someone during the winter of my Freshman year of college. My best friend, who was a large catalyst for helping me heal and improve, came onto me while she was having a mental breakdown. She told me she loved me and brought me to dinner with her parents where they told me to transfer closer to home from the college I attended a thousand miles away to live with them, so they could provide for me (my parents are not supporting me financially) and that I could be with her. (I know this is dragging on, I'm sorry that this seems to be going no where) Sadly, she suffers from the worst clinical depression I have ever seen and refuses to take her lithium. She found her brother after he had committed suicide when she was 12 and her family has been unable to cope with or support her own clinical depression ever since. I was seriously considering the transfer and move when after weeks of not contacting me, she confessed that she didn't believe that she loved me and as much as she wanted to didn't think she ever could, citing her mental breakdown as the reason for this behavior. What hurt the most was that she said that although she genuinely cared for me and physically wanted me, she had let me become ""my own little science experiment""

Needless to say this crushed me, and it crushed her too. She broke off all contact with me out of shame, and her downward spiral has continued to this day as she has never been mentally sound enough to attend college ever since. I returned to school violently depressed, lost 30 pounds and caused permanent damage to my stomach and inevitably lost my scholarship, transferring home to the school I now attend.

I slowly put myself back together and feel stronger and more alive then I ever have before, and I met [20/f] this past semester in one of my classes and we instantly felt connected to each other in a way much deeper than physical attraction without knowing each others names. I asked her for a cup of coffee and we divulged our life stories to one another, something neither of us have freely done with another person--let alone one we did not truly know. 

Her mother is a schizophrenic who does not believe in western medicine and psychiatry. She's from Korea and is about as hard line conservative and christian as you can be, so she naturally attributed the voices and behavior she acted out on to demons inside of her. She believed she was possessed and had her young children watch her undergo an exorcism (20/f was only 6 at the time), and would physically beat, bite, throw, and emotionally torment her children. Her father was a high ranking military official and turned a blind eye to this, as her parents themselves physically abuse each other. She spent most of her childhood at church, where she was sexually abused by clergy there.

When she was 13 she came out as lesbian to her parents and they temporarily disowned her. She would return home from school to members of her Korean church encircling her, holding bibles to her head and praying away the ""demons"" inside of her. I can only imagine how traumatizing that was and I assume this contributed to her nearly losing her sanity in life in the following years. The next part I do not know much about as it's very difficult for her to speak of, but she began to hallucinate disfigured monstrosities and  hear demonic voices. She self harmed, lived in a trance like state, and was forced to drop out of school at 15 to be institutionalized. After being diagnosed 8 different times, they told her that she had paranoid schizophrenia, that she'd never be able to return to school, never be able to hold a job, and never be able to live a normal life. I don't know how much time past between that verdict and what happened next but one day she woke up and miraculously it was all gone. She graduated high school late and began college this past year. 

Relationship wise she has only dated girls--most recently ending a toxic two year relationship in December. She says that while she's attracted to and has had sex with guys, she has never felt the emotional connection with them. The night I invited her to spend the night at my place was incredibly cathartic for both of us. We didn't intend to sleep with each other that night, we just needed the comfort of holding someone who understood what we had both endured. We kept holding each other tighter and tighter and just kept saying ""oh my god"" until it happened. It was my first time, and she told me it was the first time she had been able to be penetrated for more than a minute without hurting. We both held each other and cried because it meant so much more than just the sex. It was the first time in my entire life I've felt cared about by another person. We continued having very passionate and intense sex, and she eventually confessed that I was the first guy she has ever had romantic feelings for and that she could see us eventually in a relationship. The last two months of the semester we divulged things we've never said to anyone, and very carefully talked about what our needs were for there to be a relationship eventually. We remained monogamous but without a label because she was both not entirely over her recent relationship, and because she had accepted an internship at AmeriCorps in California for the summer and obviously no one wants to start a relationship long distance.  

This internship is extremely important to her, it is the first time she's ever left home, and escaped the family and area we live where she has had so many terrible memories. This is someone who only a few years prior was told they'd never be able to enjoy life as a person, so I knew that she needed and wanted some space and time to begin to heal old wounds.
 When she left we didn't really address whether or not we were going to continue staying monogamous, or be open while she was gone. Eventually I asked her if we were, seeing as she was on the other side of the country surrounded by Instagram-looking men and women, she said she liked our monogamy and wanted us to stay that way. A few weeks went by and things seemed more silent than usual, considering she is in the mountains and has phone service 4 hours a day. Eventually I asked what was up and she said that there was indeed sexual tension between her and some of her coworkers, and that she was afraid she would act out and end up hurting herself and me. When I asked why she didn't suggest openness in the first place she swore she thought that it was what she wanted at the time. 

The ground rules we set in place were that: 
1. both of were free to sleep with others while the other was gone, 2. We only would sleep with someone if we were sure we wouldn't regret it afterwards 
3. We would tell each other immediately if something did happen
4. Because of the fact that what our sex together meant was so special, if she did sleep up with someone i'd prefer it be another woman

Things were good and we both agreed to this, and up until the past week things were fine. We had plenty of multi hour heart to heart conversations, one in which she recently called me and told me that she never wanted me to feel like I was ignoring her. During a phone call just to see how I was doing, she told me she had 8 days off and would be free to talk much more during that period. Instantly she went AWOL and seemed to be ignoring me. Its not uncommon for her to go on hikes or adventures on her off days with coworkers, but after she told me that she would call me last Friday night, no call happened and she ended up being in Reno, Nevada. That night, I had a stomach flare up from my previous injury that ended up causing me to have an anxiety attack. I have been off prozac for a year so it made sense that having a random anxiety attack would trigger the worst depressive episode I've had in half a decade. Right in the middle of it I stupidly decided to send a text to her saying that ""im tired or not feeling like me, I'm tired of knowing that when you talk to me i'm probably doing poorly, which I know drains you and worries you when you're finally getting the solace and emotional healing you so badly need."" I instantly knew it freaked her out, and after that she seemed to be obviously ignoring me because I could see that she had the internet and phone service through facebook and spotify. I gave her a day or two to decompress and take it all in, and after no response I finally texted her saying ""something is obviously wrong please talk to me.""

She called last night and she apologized for ignoring me, but told me that she is really just focused on what is currently happening out there, and that she's been trying to not think of what has been going on back home. She felt guilty but said that she simply couldn't deal with the amount of heavy shit I had been throwing at her recently, which I must admit has been quite a lot since I usually struggle with depression during the summer. She had also been avoiding me because she slept with a guy and didn't tell me because she was afraid it would hurt me. I'm not happy about it, but its not the end of the world, we're open right now. What hurts is that we explicitly agreed to tell each other, even if it was a guy I could accept it as long as she [i]told me.[/i] 

Finally, she explained that she didn't feel the same intimacy and connection we had from just text and phone calls, and that she was beginning to wonder if there still was that emotional connection that she had never had with a guy before and if she ""had it in her."" She doesn't know if she feels for me as a lover, or as a best friend, and says that the biggest difficulty is that it doesn't ""feel the same as it did with my girlfriends."" I pointed out that this made sense because its a whole new dynamic she has never experienced before, and she conceded that its possible that is why. We both agree that the lack of intimacy from phone calls and texting, plus the distance in general could easily be whats causing this, but we are both afraid of losing what we have. After all of these issues, we both agreed that we're clearly not ready for a relationship with each other, but we're worried that the dynamic we had before she left will be altered because of her uncertainty with her feelings. She cares deeply about me, and still wants to be physical and intimate with me when she returns, and we'd both like to return to the way things were before she left--as two people enjoying each other through a very deep, spiritual connection. The problem is she doesn't know if she'll be able to, and that scares me because I know there is so much more there. When she sits on top of me in silence, gazing at me with wide eyes filled with incredible warmth for, smiling in a way I've never seen someone smile towards another person-- sometimes for twenty minutes at a time, I know [i]THAT[/i] connection is there, and I know its alien to her, because its so alien to me, but I feel like the distance and time is fading that from her memory. I can only imagine what someone who struggles with their sexuality goes through when trying to discern their emotions for someone, but I don't want her to come back with her mind made up because she over thought it."

It was a run of the mill development job... using agile development, they were assigned tickets and used java programming skills to fix all problems and create solutions to make a program that ran on google play devices. Pretty cool stuff. I pretty much saw that and knew I wanted to be in java development. 

Now that I'm graduated and started working my first job, I'm having some weird thoughts. My job works with the Java language and creating software for the recording industry(titles, land deeds, etc.). I don't know exactly if this is what I want to be doing. The line of work seems boring but I feel I could gain a lot of experience with databases and SQL working this job. But the content is just soooo boring to me. I am still in the training phase. 

If I want to continue being a Java developer, should I tough it out? Or continue to go through the training so I can see A. If I like this job more and/or B. How to use SQL queries and database structures? It's been a tough decision for me lately. But also am I on a good path in the computer science industry? What are you guys doing? 

Any of your replies will be great help. Thank you and happy coding everyone! "

Am I paying too high taxes?,SatansLettuce,tax,https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/4tz7o0/college_student_with_an_internship_am_i_paying/,"I'm a 21yo college student with a full time (40 hrs/wk) internship living in the Bay Area in California. Last year, I held an on campus job in which I filed exempt from taxes. This year, my summer internship pays considerably more (30/hr), but I'm getting absolutely rocked with taxes. I completed my paperwork filing as ""single"" because I saw that if I was making over 10k/yr I couldn't file exempt anymore. I'm paying almost a third of my paycheck away in taxes. Is it possible for me to be getting more of this money right now instead of filing for a return next year? Or should I just leverage my student status and limited income when filing my return? A bit more info - I didn't plan on itemizing when I filled out my tax papers at work and my parents are still claiming me as a dependent when they file. Any help or suggestions would be appreciated! I'll comment with more info if necessary. Thanks!


UPDATE:
I clicked through the calculator on IRS.gov. For my income, working only 3 months out of the year, I got 11 allowances! This seems like a lot, but I called a tax professional and they told me that it sounded reasonable. I put 11 as the total allowances on my W-4, checked ""single"" and resubmitted.
https://apps.irs.gov/app/withholdingcalculator/

For the California DE-4 I simply went through the calculations in worksheet C and came up paying roughly $400 for the year in state taxes. The DE-4 worksheet C functions much like the calculator above, but for state taxes. I looked at how much I had already paid, subtracted this from $400, divided it up between my remaining paychecks, and put this number in line 2 (ended up being about $30 per paycheck)."
4tzgjs,2,2016-07-21,Seeing a trend of low-paying jobs. Culture fit problem with companies that pay decently?,lowpayjobber,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4tzgjs/seeing_a_trend_of_lowpaying_jobs_culture_fit/,"I live in the midwest, and locally, new grads here typically get $55k-$65k a year to start in software engineering. I never took any internships, started with $12/hr eight years ago, and most recently I made $50k annualized as a contractor with no benefits. Word out there says that, because juniors typically make $55k, I should be pushing at least $90k because of my experience. 

Right now I have one offer lined up, but it's only $30/hr, again as a contractor. Even though they don't pay benefits either, the employer finds it hard to consider bumping me it up to even $35/hr. It's weird that I am not seeing the salary perks that most software engineers are enjoying.

I'm not a frequent job hopper, but I do end up spending time unemployed in between jobs, usually due to sudden company layoffs. When I get offers they're always low paying ones that don't offer any sort of additional compensation beyond contract work or a stipend. 

So basically I have gone over 7 years without saving any retirement funds, and without health insurance. How do I get the bigger, fortune-500-ish companies to blow up my phone to give me those great comp packages and all that jazz? I'm starting to think it could be a culture fit problem, since I have never worked at any place with more than 100 employees."
4tzjei,20,2016-07-21,GSU Financial Aid /Classes Tips,britteatcar,GaState,https://www.reddit.com/r/GaState/comments/4tzjei/gsu_financial_aid_classes_tips/,"Hey ya'll I wanted to leave some tips that I've accumulated during my 3 year experience at Ga State. Feel free to ask questions, add things and or correct me. 

1) If you still have not received your HOPE Scholarship due to Financial Aid delays, don't stress! Go go GA411 and fill out an application for Hope. Hope needs to be filled out each year (It normally auto renews with your FASFA but if you're flagged for verification and it's taking too long, you can use the GA411 application instead).

2) If you can't pay tuition, visit the Financial Aid office and ask about a payment plan. Be persistent. That is the key to getting things done at State. 

3) I don't recommend it, but you can pay for tuition with a credit card

3)Now, is the best time to call the financial Aid Office... it will be 100x busier in August. Wednesdays are the best time to visit. 

4) Seriously look at the GSU Scholarship Portal and apply to the scholarships, I've received $3,500 in free money by writing 300 word essays. Hardly anyone apply to them so your chances for wining are pretty high (plus it's a low opportunity cost)

5) Only take out what you need in loans and don't waste your refund check trying to flex with cool Macs and clothes. Chances are, no one cares what you're wearing or the tech you have in class. Save your refund check because chances are you'll need it down the line.

6) Use PantherCareerNet to search for jobs and internships. You would be surprised the companies that have posted on there for interns (Verizon, LexusNexus, Google, Mercedes, Federal Reserve Bank) and I know fellow students that applied and got internships for some of the following companies
7) Go to the internship fairs and get on the career services email listing. They email specific internships and jobs that match your profile.

8) Do go to the Career Services Center for resume help! There is actually a second center only for upperclassmen in Dhalberg and they helps you get internships and figure out what field or career you should consider.

9) Be creative in the job/Internship search! If your major is Political Science, or film, don't restrict yourself to positions that specifically state you need that certain degree. If you feel like you can complete  some of the duties and are willing to learn, then go to the Dhalberg Career Services and have them help you tailor your resume and cover letter for that position. 

10) PARTICIPATE in class and talk to your professors during office hours, you would be surprise how they can help you get connections, recommendations, graduate assistantships (if you plan on going to Gradschool for a discount), advise, and jobs. Also, in my experience professors are typically more understanding when they know you personally. 

11) There is free therapy with PHD psychologists at 75 Piedmont (Testing and counseling Center), you don't need an appointment and you can go there for ANYTHING! Abuse, stress, fear, bored, eating disorder, etc. It is completely confidential. I went there last year during a breakup, and I'm a better person for it. There is also free rapid HIV testing. Wear condoms! You can get cheap STD testing at the campus clinic.

Campus Clinic is free! You only pay for lab work. If you have insurance with your parents, just take the prescription and get it filled at the Walgreens or CVS on campus

12) If you are a freshmen and don't know ANYONE on campus, then I recommend living on campus your first year. I guarantee you will make a friend. State can get very lonely, when you commute. Freshmen housing sucked because I shared a room with a psychopath, but it was also my funnest moments! So many great friends and memories made, I definitely think it was worth the $5,000 loan for the experience. 

13) Brings me to my second point, avoid any independent apartments  labeled student housing, because 9 out of 10 it's a ripoff. Westmar sucks. 

14) Don't trust advisement. Use the academic evaluation tool on Paws and the course catalog for the year you enrolled to make sure you are on track to graduate.

Excuse the grammar, I quickly made this.

Edit: Don't be the idiot who buys the 200 dollar books before class starts. Use Rate my professor to see if you need the book. Search for ways to download the books online. Some professors are jerks and will make you buy a book you NEVER use.

Edit 2: Ladies, you can get birth control prescribed to you at the Health Clinic!"
4tzmjj,2,2016-07-21,What should I do? College student emotionally abused by parents for years,madelinda,emotionalabuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/4tzmjj/what_should_i_do_college_student_emotionally/,"So, this is going to be long and I'm sorry in advance.

I am a college student and I believe my parents, especially my mother, are highly emotionally abusive. Just for some background, we are a decently well-off family in the DC area. I have one older brother who I believe my mother loves much more than me. We live in a nice house and I went to private school and a very good public high school. I had good grades in high school and got into a lot of good schools. I never drank in high school or did anything even remotely wrong throughout my childhood/ teenage years. Yet I have always been treated as a disappointment: screamed at, cursed at, blamed for family problems, treated basically like I was the cause of all of my mother's anger. I have never seen anyone scream as much as she did when I was a kid, or go into such a rage. She never physically hurt me when I was a kid, but the emotional pain was bad enough.

Anyway, like I said I did well in high school and got into a lot of good colleges. All throughout high school I was told I could go to ""the best school I got into"", but when it came down to it I was forced to go to one of my lower choice state schools because it ""wasn't worth it"" to send me to a more expensive school across the country. I would have completely understood this argument, but basically how it went down was I was literally screamed at until I accepted the state school's offer online. Seriously. Throughout all this time I had to endure my mother shitting on my choice of major (environmental science), which I am still putting up with today.

Anyway, I got through my first year of college and decided that I might want to transfer to my brother's college (another state school) because their environmental science program was better. I was accepted and came home for summer break with my mind not completely made up. I had a boyfriend at my college and lots of friends, and I expected to be allowed to make the decision myself.

Apparently not with abusive parents! Here's where shit really gets crazy. They literally did not let me leave the house until I accepted the second school's admissions offer. I realize now that since I hadn't decided I should've just locked myself in my room for two days until the offer expired, but at the time I thought I could take it back. I probably could've, but as the summer dragged on it basically became impossible for me to go back to the other school. I didn't withdraw from school one with the hopes that I might be able to go back. When my mother found this out she became physically abusive and shoved me in my room by my neck. She then signed a withdrawal form for my first college WITH MY SIGNATURE and sent it to them. At this point it didn't matter since I was essentially withdrawn from the school anyway and would not have been able to go back, but it shows a complete lack of respect for me as a person and a lack of respect for the law. 

Anyway, my first semester at the new school was complete shit because of some of the craziest roommates in history (that’s a whole other story). I moved into a dorm on campus for the last two weeks of classes and made plans to return to my first college, which I told my parents about. Just as a side note, it’s a lot easier to return to a college than you would think. I told my parents I wanted to go back to the first college, and they said they wouldn’t pay for it (should’ve mentioned this above, but the schools are pretty equal on all fronts). I submitted a $150 deposit of my own money to my original college, with plans to talk to my parents about the tuition payments. Anyway, the tuition bill was sent to them, not me, and they FLIPPED OUT. I was at my boyfriend’s house at the time (he lives pretty close to me), and they started harassing me and his parents, calling their office about 25 times and demanding that they “give them their daughter back, or they would call 911”. They came to his house and rang the doorbell. When no one answered, they used the extra car key to take my car. Crazy ass shit. 

Anyway, they said that they would not pay for the next semester of college unless it was at my brother’s school, where I’d had such terrible experiences with the crazy roommates. So, I went back (if I had un-transferred schools my classes would have been in the wrong order anyways). That semester (this past one) was much better and I made some real friends. However, I still do not like that school as much as the first one, and I’m not with my boyfriend as much.

This summer and more recently their new thing has been to criticize my internship searching process (I have had an internship in environmental policy both summers in college, and a high-paying job on the side). They insist with flawed reasoning that I have to work 40 hrs/wk during the summer. Nothing less than 40 will do. They say that this is a “rule for living here”, but none of the money goes to them and I have never heard that rule before. They criticize me spending time with my boyfriend and keep insisting that I get an internship in a different city next summer (I think they don’t want me living here, and I think they also don’t want me spending time with my boyfriend). Now they want to have a “talk” with me about my career options, as if I know nothing about the field of environmental science. They keep suggesting highly boring job options. I think their version of an ideal job for me would be me sitting in an empty cubicle and making 200k a year. They don’t at all care about my self-satisfaction. Keep in mind I still have two years left in college.

Throughout all of this my parents have highly criticized my boyfriend (we are still together), yelled at him, and yelled at me in front of him. He and his family are the only thing that keeps me thinking that families can be a good thing. His parents let me stay at their house all the time and even offered to give me a loan when my parents wouldn't pay for the semester of college mentioned above. Basically, they’re saints. 

On top of all this, my whole life I have dealt with varying severities of OCD, hypochondria, anxiety, and depression, which I have sought help for at college (and which are often brought on by this horrible family dynamic). I once told my parents (while crying) that I had gone to a psychologist at college for depression, and they never talked to me about it again. Basically, they give zero shits about my emotional well-being. This has all led to incredible indecisiveness that severely affects my life. I also have a serious, but not dangerous or urgent, physical medical need that needs to be addressed that I simply cannot talk to them about for fear of being ridiculed. 

Most people I know would never suspect any of this about me; when around nice, normal people as I was this past semester I am decently happy and am very outgoing by nature. I was involved in many activities at both schools and have good relationships with professors. I make friends pretty easily and come across as a normal student.

Basically, my parents have no reason to think that I won’t succeed, but they think I won’t succeed. They are emotionally and financially abusive and I can’t put up with it anymore. They insist that I am not an adult until I'm 21 (I've repeatedly told them that it's 18) and not until I'm financially independent (so they can make decisions for me as you would for a child). Some mornings I wake up with suicidal thoughts and it is increasingly difficult for me to live with them and take their money. I want to be financially independent from them, but I also want to be a normal college student and salvage what is left of my college experience. I have considered going back to school number 1, even now. So reddit, what should I do? Should I take a year off and become independent (financially and possibly for the purpose of the FAFSA)? Should I move in with my boyfriend’s family for the rest of the summer (they wouldn’t mind)? Does anyone have a similar experience or suggestions? Should I just take their money, finish my degree, and high tail it out of here? (my brother moved across the country when he graduated, by the way). I really just wanted a normal college experience, but that has already been ruined from me. Thoughts? Writing all this has been pretty emotionally exhausting so please be kind.


tl;dr I have emotionally and financially abusive parents and am trying to figure out if I should become independent from them in some way, and how to do it

We've been together 5 years, married for two. We're very touchy-feely, have a great sex life and share many hobbies and interests.

I'm a very social person but like most humans I do need some time to myself. Summer is a slower season for my husband, and it's he works a physical job in a shop with no a/c so he goes in a few hours a day and does design work at home the rest of the time. He is home every day when I leave for work and back before I get home. He spends weekends doing projects around the house. He doesn't have any hobbies that involve leaving home that he likes to do without me.

I work in a busy office in sales and have to talk to people both in person and on the phone all day. It's draining, and sometimes I just want an hour or two to myself, maybe once a week.

I've told my husband this. He is very loving. He's one of those people who are BRILLIANT but ditzy. I can ask him if he'd maybe like to go out with a friend to give me some alone time and he'll agree but forget to make plans. He used to do a tabletop game night once a week at a friends house and I loved it. That friend moved away and now it's at our place. Instead of zero other people in my apartment on Thursday nights there are 6. We also have a college kid doing an internship nearby who's staying with us for the summer. Last weekend two friends in town for a wedding ended up staying with us as well.

My husband is such a sweet man but I don't think he understands. I think he's hurt when I say I need some time to myself.  I feel like I'm losing it. I sit in my car on my lunch break even though it's 1,000 degrees out just to have some quiet. I think I'm drinking too much just to keep from snapping at him.

On Sunday it'll be three weeks since I was not in the presence of another human. I asked him to get groceries (normally my duty). I had 23 minutes. It was glorious.

TL;DR! My sweet, caring husband is always home and I never, ever have alone time. I think he's hurt when I ask for it. Any advice?

I feel like an awful girlfriend for saying all this but it jsut eats me away because I had an interview at that same company and he got it and I didn't and so it just makes everything worse knowing that I could have had this amazing fun exotic summer, when instead I am just sitting like dry shit in the sun.

No matter how hard he tried, the rope only seem to get tighter. I can't give up, thought Kibler. I have to free myself. Just then someone opened the door and turned on the lights, only wearing a dark robe. Before revealing himself, Kibler already knew who the man was, he saw the smile, big and wide. ""Brode..."" said Kibler, who still kept on struggling, ""where are my friends what have you done to them?"" ""Oh, you'll see soon enough."" Brode then ordered two men in robes to carry Kibler to his next destination. When Kibler was freed, he quickly punched one of the men in order to escape, but Brode was faster, and instantly knocked kibler down. ""You though you could escape 'dragonmaster'?"" said Brode with a mocking smile, ""I guess we're going to have to do it the hard way."" Kibler was slowly losing conscious. He thought to himself, how did it end up like this?

Kibler had recruited 3 guest to his house. As each of them entered the house, there was a waiter waiting for their request. First came Kripparian, who said, ""I'll have orange juice. Thank you."" Then came Reynad, ""I'll have strawberry juice"" he said. ""Sorry we ran out,"" said the waiter. ""That's just my RNG"","" complained Reynad. Finally came in Trump who said, ""I'll have the drink that can provide me with the greatest value per ounce of liquid"" The waiter nodded confusedly. After all the guest had sat down, Kibler said, ""do you know why I've gather you all here?"" The guests didn't know. "" Because as we all know the priest class sucks right now. But there's a deck. A deck that is tier 1. Famously known as Ben Brode's Unicorn Priest™."" ""You're insane right?"" said Kripp, ""we all know that deck is impossible to find."" The others agreed. "" Even I couldn't find it,"" said Reynad, "" and I have my most talented researchers looking for decks in the meta snapshot, available now at TempoStorm, where you can go for all your legendary needs."" He smiled and gave a wink at no-one in particular. ""Calm down, Calm down,"" said Kibler, ""I have a plan that just might land us where we need to be."" He told the guests each part of the plan they were responsible for and they set out to do their jobs.

*

Kripp was ordered to go in Arena and play as priest. This would help them understand which cars synergize best with priest. As he was drafting he had a choice between wisp, target dummy, or murloc tinyfin. Pretty unlucky, as expected of Kripp. But his HearthArena app said something strange, it said: although each of these cards are 0 mana, I would recommend you to look behind you. As Kripp turned he was punched in the face and knocked down. ""Never lucky,"" he whimpered as he went down.

*

Trump was researching on one monitor, analyzing games on the other, and playing Hearthstone on a third one. A surprise visitor came. ""Hey trump, I heard you were researching,"" said the familiar voice. When he turned around Trump was surprised. ""Oh hi Ben Brode, you know, I'm just here researching, but yeah I could use some help."" Just as trump turned around, Brode tied him up and put a bag over his head. ""How about we go to a more 'private' place?"" asked Ben Blode as Trump wiggled and struggled, his voice muffled by the bag.

*

Reynad had the task or going to blizzard HQ, infiltrate and try to find any data. At the door he found Frodan. ""Sorry Reynad, I can't let you pass."" ""Come on,"" Reynad said as he got close to Frodan and whispered in his ear, ""I'll give you a 15% discount."" Frodan got a little nervous for a while, a tempting offer, but he had to refuse. ""Let me make you a deal Reynoodle,"" he pulled out two dice, ""if you roll a 5 or more you win, and I'll let you in."" Reynad agreed a rolled the dice... he got a -2 somehow. ""Son of a -OOOF!"" Frodan punched Reynad in the gut and knocked him out. ""You know what? Maybe we WILL go in after all,"" he jested as he entered the Blizzard Building.

*

Kibler wondered what happened to the others. He received an e-mail that said: you want your friends back? Come to Blizzard HQ, we'll discuss it. Kibler the righteous thing, as he always does, and went to Blizzard HQ. An intern was waiting for him by the door and said, ""Mr. Brian ""please don't call me Brian ""Brian Kibler"" Kibler"" Kibler, right? I'll take you to your destination."" He handed Kibler a drink, ""here for your thirst."" As they started walking Kibler took a sip of the drink, it had a strange taste... TOO strange. Immediately he was drowsy and passed out. Next thing he knew, he was in a dark room, his arms tied behind the chair.

*

When Kibler woke up he was in a room tied to a machine, next to the others. ""Where are we?!"" said Kibler. ""In my secret laboratory of course,"" said Brode with his usual menacing smile, ""you see that machine you're tied to? That's the NERFINATOR! When I push this button *points at big red button* you will all be NERFED, but don't worry, I wouldn't destroy the soul of the card now would I?"" Ben Brode accompanied by Frodan and his henchmen started laughing. All hope seemed lost. Not now, thought Kibler. We were so close. ""You know what the sad thing is, you weren't able to find my secret priest deck, which is clearly on top of my desk in my office, but since you are going to DIE now, I'm SURE that me telling you this would have no consequences at all in the near future."" Ben Brode laughed again and started the count down before pressing the button. 10. Kibler had remembered when Brode was younger, purer, he was a good man, but ever since he had nerfed undertaken he had seem to change.9. The same smile he loved to see would be his doom. 8. Kibler though about his family, his friends. 7. He looked at Kripp which had somehow sneaked a popsicle and was eating while slowly sobbing. 6. He looked at Trump and his inspiring face as he kept smiling, as if to raise the other's spirits. 5. He looked at Reynad who said, "" use code tempo to take 15% of the pain away."" 4. Well this is it. 3. He would die here, without ever finding the unicorn priest. 2. Kibler sensed something... no someone. 1. Before Brode had time to press the button, Kibler's dog and most loyal beast companion pounced on Brode and took out to henchmen. He quickly dashed and bit off the ropes of Kibler and his companions, saving his life. ""I knew I could count on you Shiro. Come on guys! Lets get out of here!"" Kibler and the others, including Shiro ran. ""After them!"" Commanded Brode after getting up. ""OK here's the plan,"" said Kibler, "" Reynad you build a salt wall."" ""On it,"" said Reynad as he used his hidden ability to create a wall of salt. ""Kripp get us a ride and meet us in the front."" Kripp left. ""Shiro... DRAGON FORM!"" Shiro transformed into a dragon and led them faster to Brode's office. There, he transformed back into his normal form already exhausted. Kibler looked for Brode's file and held it tightly. At the front door Kripp was waiting, but a group of guards were standing by the entrance. ""Trump! Go Prison Trump!"" Trump transformed into Prison Trump, and just his plain aura was enough to incapacitate the guards. They went off on Kripp's vehicle and left at 200 MPH. ""CURSE YOU MEDDLING STREAMERS!"" groaned Brode as he saw them leave. ""Oh well, I guess it's back to designing cards! I bet a 4 mana 7/7 would be just what priest needs"" he went back to his office with a smile. His deck was taken, but Brode still had that jolly smile, as if it were part of his soul.

*

Back at his home everyone was at the table. ""Come on Kibler, show us the deck,"" said Kripp. ""Yeah,"" Trump agreed. ""Ooh"" Reynad said with joy, ""I want to post it on TempoStorm, where you can become legendary with our decks. Check out our shop to, by using the code 'Tempo' you can get 15% off your final purchase."" Reynad winked a gave a little smile to no-one in particular again. ""Alright boys, settle down, settle down."" Kibler pulled out the deck from the envelope and all of them gasped. ""So the legends are true,"" he said. Ben Brode's Unicorn Priest™ had a 99% win rate according to the charts included with the deck, the only 1% lose was against a mirror of itself. They couldn't believe it. An OP priest deck that wrecks all class. This **Yogg-C'thun-Deathrattle-Reno-Dragon-Shadowform** priest deck was insane."

I'm trying to make a career change from non-CS position with non-CS Bachelors into CS, with the end goal being Ruby or Java developer position. I've been self taught for the last year, and since my resume isn't terribly impressive, and this is the only real CS job bite I've gotten in the last three months of looking. It's a pay cut, but possibly the opportunity to learn different technologies of the company... maybe. I've tried asking the recruiter what exactly is a reports developer, and I haven't gotten any hard answers, yet. Just ""HTML and JavaScript"" From what I've looked up online, i see there might be SQL needed, which i have zero experience.  I have an interest in QA and automation testing, just haven't pursued it.

So my question is:

1) should i bite and be grateful for the opportunity, take the pay cut from my current non-CS position and view it as an internship, gaining experience [i can take the salary hit, its only a minor consideration]


2) will I be pigeonholed as a ""reports developer"" and have to make this my career? Is this a good launching point to JAVA / RUBY / flavor of the month language. Or what other careers might I be able to look forward to using this as a start?


3) how painful will this be not having any experience in this sort of position at first? i'm very adaptive to change, but I'm sure i'm going to feel really dumb for the first few weeks. I've been repeatedly told this is an entry-level position and room to move up if i'm coach-able.

I recently found this sub and it scared me a little bit to be honest. It seems like I have not made best decision regarding career. I worked part-time QA job while at university and now have an internship at a big bank in London. They are not using in-demand tech though(Perl) so it is a bit disheartening to me. Also, I am envious of finding out the money US, Australian companies pay to developers and was thinking to seek fortune there. However, I am not a hot rockstar engineer like a lot of people in this sub reporting being paid that much, so was considering to maximize opportunities in Europe.

I admit that as a new grad, my concern of pay should be secondary to the experience and growth provided by the company. I was looking at most popular software companies like Google, Amazon but honestly, at the moment, could not hack their interviews if my life depended on it. The questions seem hard and from this sub, I found resources like CTCI &amp; EPL books as a source of practice. I looked at some Leetcode problems and can hardly solve any medium/hard problems.

What steps can I take, besides preparing for technical interviews to maximize my chances of pay/experience at a company? For pay, Switzerland or Germany seems better options. One is more expensive but pays more than UK and the other pays less but cost of living is also a lot less than, say London. Regarding experience, the former seems to have mostly banks and companies like Google, whose interviews I cannot hack atm(and not sure if I could in the future) and Germany with tons of less known companies. I am also considering going back to my home country(central Europe) because it is not bad to work in IT there but I and my parents spent a lot of money to study in UK and I need to maximize my pay in order to repay them. I would prefer to not stay in UK though because I am tired of it + Brexit uncertainty."

So I am currently a International Business student and I have to do my internship in about 2 months. I have got two job offers; one at one of the biggest corporations in the world, and one at a small/medium sized company in the home country of my girlfriend.

Some background info:
We met (in RL, not online) and have been together for almost half a year now. We met in a country where we were both studying for half a year (exchange). We separated our ways but decided to try this from LD. We were looking into opportunities for me to live/work in her country, so I started looking for internships there. I found one, had a job interview and got an offer.

The other job offer is in my home country. So, far away from her (±12 flying).

Now I have to make a life-changing decision.. Go work there and live with this amazing girl that I love so much, or go for the opportunity to work for one of the biggest companies in the world. Financially the option to live with her will increase my study debts (compared to the other option), but I am willing to make that sacrifice.

Any advice?.."

Sometimes all of the above. But I'm in my late twenties, attractive and athletically built. Everyone notices me when I hobble in, even walking with a limp I cut a striking figure at six-foot-two, with close cut brown hair, a light tan and sparking green eyes. And, most important to our story, a totally-fucked-up right knee. A backyard rugby match got a bit rowdy and I ended up with a torn ACL. Fantastic.

So now I'm spending two evenings a week at the clinic, doing frustratingly simple exercises in an effort to slowly rehabilitate myself. My girlfriend isn't thrilled that she's on her own for dinner those nights, but what can I do? It's not like I can just walk it off. So I'm kind of stuck with this, at least for the time being.

But I've missed the obvious question in all of this. Who are you? Are you a high school intern, hoping for some valuable experience during the summer break? Perhaps you're my therapist, who finds herself tempted to push the boundaries of acceptable treatment? Or maybe you're a fellow patient, some MILF-esque hottie who twisted her arm at tennis and hasn't gotten to play with balls for some time.

You'll have to tell me. I'm just sitting here in the waiting room, my nose in my phone, not contemplating the fact that I'm about to get a hell of a lot more out of my $30.00 copay than I ever imagined.

If you're intrigued, describe your character and send me an opening post!

I considered between Germany &amp; Switzerland and after having talked with a couple of friends who study for PhDs in Zurich, Switzerland seems to be a good place.

I am EU citizen, have some experience in internship working in a London bank. I am worried whether Swiss have demand for graduate developers, i.e. ones without much experience. Additionally, I am aware of an act passed by Swiss citizens which is going to curb immigration from EU in 2017.

I only know of banks and Google in Switzerland. I am yet to qualify for Google because I need to work my ass off for a few months to prepare for technical interviews. Honestly, I am not hard-bent on getting into either banks or Google, hence I am wondering what kind of opportunities there are in Switzerland. Also, regarding cost of living: will I save more in Switzerland than in London? I can expect to get around 40k GBP ~= 51k CHF in London as a new graduate but with ridiculous rent prices and other expenses I may save like 10-15K a year at most. I know that places like Zurich are even more expensive but do you end up saving more? From my reading so far it seems like Switzerland enjoys lower taxes and higher wages.

Any advice regarding that? Any people who made it to Switzerland as a graduate? I am interested in experiences."
4u2yqj,5,2016-07-22,Going back to school for accounting and CIS. I have some questions.,OH870,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/4u2yqj/going_back_to_school_for_accounting_and_cis_i/,"Quick background about me: I've been out of college for about a year, thinking about what I want to go back for and finish a degree in. I was previously in the aeronautics program at my college, but due to color vision issues I had to quit ( 2 classes away from my B.S. in flight technology, commercial pilot and had started CFI). I'm 27 years old. 

My plans: I have decided after a year of down time that I want to go back and finish with a dual degree in accounting and computer information systems. I like the sound of I.T audit and data analytic types of jobs ( our college of business just introduced a data analytics minor this semester, actually). I'd like to get a decent internship before I graduate and then hopefully get a big 4 job doing I.T. audit or risk assurance, stay there a few years and then use that experience to move somewhere. All my lurking on here over the past few months seems to suggest that that's the way to do it- put your time in at a B4 and then use that experience to negotiate a position at a smaller firm. 

Also worth noting is that I have a 2.92 GPA (thank you early twenties me), but I've calculated it out to to where if I get mostly A's and a few B's in the remainder of my classes I can graduate with around a 3.3 ( not stellar, but it seems pretty respectable). 

My questions: 

1) Will my age hamper me at all? I'll be 29 or 30 when I graduate. I still feel like I'm 18 in terms of energy and drive ( just smarter and much more focused now), but when applying next to 22 or 23 year olds, would a B4 recruiter, or any other HR hiring person push my resume to the side in favor of youth?

2) Is low 3.0 range good enough to crack a B4 or any other good accounting job? I know it's not valedictorian level GPA, but I'm hoping it's not damning, either. From what I've read, it seems like firms are jumping at people with IT + accounting knowledge, so I'm hoping that my eventual 3.2 or 3.3 will look more appealing with that dual-degree knowledge. 

3) I've got a good idea of what risk assurance and IT auditors do, but can anyone explain it in some detail? An ELI5 version maybe?

4) What is a reasonable starting salary to expect with this area of work? I'm currently in NE/Central Ohio. Close to Cleveland/Akron/Youngstown. 

5) If anyone has any other general advice/pointers/knowledge please share. 

Thanks in advance for any help or info. "
4u3197,4,2016-07-22,My[26M] girlfriend [26F] of 5 years broke up with me because she is lost and needs time to sort herself out.,swarley8989,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4u3197/my26m_girlfriend_26f_of_5_years_broke_up_with_me/,"This is still very new and I am currently struggling so much with it. I thought I would post about it, because I know when I talk about it, it always makes me feel better. 

**Let's start with some backstory.**
We met when we were 20 during our studies (me in health, her in law) and we've been together ever since. We have gone through everything together. Problems with parents, deaths in the family, change of careers, uncertainty of the job markets. And we have always stuck by each other. I was her rock and she was mine. We have always talked about the future, and I never saw a future without her. We both agreed that we wouldn't move in or even get married before we had the sufficient funds to do so. This last year, however, has been especially tough on both of us, career-wise. My field has currently no job available where we live, and that unfortunately pushed me to look elsewhere and I found a position about 5 hours from my current location, which would pay me very well and let me gain experience. I always kept her in the process and validated her feelings. If she had told me that she didn't want me to look elsewhere, I would have stopped and taken a temporary position in a heartbeat. Even though she was heartbroken, she understood and I promised her that the long term plan would be for me to get as much experience as possible and come back here when a permanent position would open. I wasn't going to leave anytime soon as there have been administrative issues that has pushed back my start date to at least this fall.  On her side, she was starting a new 6 month internship in January. Her being renewed after the internship was never guaranteed, but she knew this going in. In July, she was told that she wouldn't be renewed and this devastated her. There was nothing I could do to cheer her up, but I was always there to support her, encouraging her to explore other avenues since I was leaving and nothing was making her stay here. The option of coming with me was always on the table, but for her to take the bar again knowing that our long term plan was to come back to our hometown was something I could not ask of her and she was glad I didn't. 

**Breakup**
A week ago, my ex-girlfriend of 5 years came over, and I can see something is wrong. However, it didn't affect our conversation or our interactions. We were kissing, cuddling and spending time and I'm sure if someone compared us to when we were in our honeymoon phase, they wouldn't know the difference.

Then she started crying, because she couldn't hide it anymore. And she starts by telling me that she feels like we are in a rut and that we have taken each other for granted. She admitted that she has noticed that I have been very distant, that I look bored with her and that I don't try anymore. This completely took me by surprise. I did not share these feelings at all and I felt like it came out of nowhere. She even added that it has been a few months she has been feeling this way. Automatically, I went into cynical mode. I immediately thought someone has replaced me in her life and that she has fallen out of love with me and in love with someone new. She immediately got mad, saying that I disregarded her feelings by insinuating that she can't think for herself. I explained that there's been this work buddy that she has been talking about for months now. For me, it was always normal and platonic. I've been there, when you start a new job, you want to make friends. And because she always told me everything, I never thought more of it. I did get jealous of how much she was talking about him, but he was the only one that made her feel welcome at the office. And because that made her happy, it made me happy. She admitted that one of her friends has told her that it was a weird friendship and that she was probably trying to validate that friendship by me leaving soon to another city. When she told me this, I reassured her right away. I told her I trusted her and knew that she wouldn't cheat on me (emotionally or physically). She was so glad I understood that it was because she wanted to make friends in the workplace. The friendship sometimes made me feel very uneasy. Towards the end of her internship (when it was looking like she wasn't going to get renewed), they hung out more, knowing that they might not keep in touch. And seeing how affected she was by not being renewed, I let her do what she had to do. They went out to dinner a couple of times and stayed for hours talking. This made me feel sick to my stomach. I suddenly became the jealous boyfriend and couldn't sleep until she texted me when she got home. And the couple of times were always around 2-3am. The way she was talking about him, seemed very platonic and I didn't think more of it. 

Back to the discussion now. She immediately reassured me that it wasn't because of this guy. She told me that she currently feels really lost with no job to go back to and she doesn't know how long until she will finally gets another job. This led her to questioning everything in her life, including our relationship. She continued by saying that she might need some time for herself because she wasn't happy with who she was right now and that also meant, she wasn't happy with the relationship. I went into panic mode. We talked it out and we said to each other that we would see how it goes until the end of the summer. I wanted to be part of her solution and help her through this. It was tough, but I was so happy she agreed. 

This last week has been a lot of soul searching and a lot of dedicating myself to this relationship, even though I didn't think we were in a rut, taking each other for granted and bored, I understood how she could feel this way. I know very well that if I were going to just dismiss those feelings, I would lose her immediately. We started having conversations that we should have had months ago. I admitted to her how jealous I was of this new friendship and of her going out to dinner until 2-3am. She confessed something that I wished I heard when these feelings of jealousy started: she never had fun on those dinners. She stayed until late because it was nearing the end of her internship and she was so appreciative of having a friend like him in the office. She reminded me how much she valued friendship and people that do give a fuck about her. She tries to hold on to them, because some of her friendships in the past were based on lies and ended up giving her trust issues. With this out of the way, we concentrated on us and solely us. And it felt like we were turning a page. 

Until two days ago. She came back to me and said that she wouldn't be able to last until end of the summer. With her ex-office pretty much confirming that they wouldn't hire her, she felt even more loss and she couldn't be with me during that time. She said that she's been trying to impress everyone for so long, she lost track of who she was. Impressing coworkers, impressing bosses, impressing me... She was tired and she couldn't do it anymore. She felt she lost her identity. I answered that she should take all the time she needs, away from everyone, even if that includes me. I suggested taking a trip alone either locally or internationally to clear her head. It seemed like I didn't understand correctly: she meant that she needed to break up with me. And she was honest. She told me that she felt like right now, she was staying with me, because I made her feel safe. Truthfully, her heart was not completely devoted to the relationship and she thinks I deserve much better. She reassured me that I have been the perfect boyfriend and that I did nothing wrong. She just needed to go away, and that it also meant she needed to be completely away from me. She couldn't find herself if I was still in her life, because she knows I would be hurting and hurting me would kill her. She made sure I knew that there was no one else in her life right now and that she has not fallen for her office guy friend, that this was all her. 

Because I was (kind of?) prepared for this, I reacted very calmly. I replied that I understood. I did tell her that she means the world to me and that I am here for her no matter what. She told me that I shouldn't wait for her. Unfortunately, I replied saying my heart doesn't work that way. I have completely devoted myself to this relationship and and I told her that I will end up waiting for her, because she told me she still believes in us, she wants us to work but that she needs to find herself first. For me, those were reasons enough not to give up on her, especially in this time of need. She actually told me before we went our own respective ways that she wished I had screamed at her, because that would make it easier. I simply told her: I'm not going to make this decision easy on you. I want you to know what you are potentially leaving forever and if this is just a ""phase"", I want you to come back to me because you know I'm the perfect person for you.

Since then, there has been one last contact. I wrote to her quickly to say to never forget how I love her and that I am always here if she needs me. She replied saying I love you too and that it meant so much to her to read those words. Now we are on day 2 of no contact... It's been the toughest. I feel kind of delusional for still believing in this relationship. I wished so much that after one day she would come back to me. But realistically, she might never come back and she might need to find herself for a while.

I have been scouring reddit for the past day looking for hope. And there has been as many success stories and tragic stories. I know some users are more aggressive and have suggested to people in my situation to just get the hell out of there. And I already know that finding oneself could mean going to find another dick to ride on, or even try a new relationship, or could just be she wanted to find the nicest way to break up without being blunt. And I dread the day that I see a new profile picture with a new guy or hear that she has moved on. But right now, even though my head is screaming to move on and leave, my job doesn't start for a couple of months and I am stuck here thinking about this and her until then. I have projects to keep me busy (including working a lot on myself) and friends that have been there since this has happened have contacted me to see me. I have been fighting myself to not send her any message. From 24/7 constant contact to nothing has been so tough. I am constantly typing out messages and erasing it. I just want to tell her that I am here and that I miss her and that I want to be there for her. I am glad to see that she is online sometimes and that means that she is currently talking to friends to help her through this. It is delusional, but I really hope this is just a phase and for now, I don't want to give up on someone who just needs to find themselves.

   
**tl;dr**: Been together 5 years. Now ex-girlfriend broke up because she feels she lost her identity and needs to find herself. Still loves me with all her heart and admitted that she still believes in us and hopes that I'll be there when she does find herself. Am I just kidding myself?"

I have a few ideas I'd love to play out. Kinks include public fun, femdom, girls in cute outfits, being seduced. Not into non-con, violence, or bathroom stuff.

I'd really love to be seduced and dommed by someone. Maybe in an office enviornment. Maybe a manager, a secretary, an intern or consultant could all be ideal candidates. I just love the idea of someone manipulating me and taking control. Fem Dom isn't a deal breaker but certainly something I'd like to play out. 

Another idea I have is something along the lines of a girl house sitting for me while I am away on business. I end up taking an earlier flight home but forget to tell you I'll be home early. You, thinking you have the house all to yourself tonight, decide to sneak into my liquor cabinet and look at naughty stuff on the web. You are so distracted you don't hear my car pull up or the door open. The first thing I see as I walk into my home is you in some cute panties and a tank top teasing yourself in the living room. We can pick it up from there. 

I'm open to your ideas as well. PM me and let's have some fun. "

4u3lsi,1,2016-07-22,I'm 22 and I'm feeling like I'm never going to amount to anything,Brisholine,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4u3lsi/im_22_and_im_feeling_like_im_never_going_to/,"My whole life I've been average. Went through school just getting C's, struggled to graduate college with a 2.5 GPA, always made the B teams in sports (hated sports anyways), have never gotten 1^st place in anything, I've never won anything except a bunch of Pokémon plushies at Burger King one time but my parents gave them away.

Sometimes I feel like I'm trying too hard or that I care too much and it's having an opposite affect on me. I try not to overdo it but I end up overdoing it anyways.

I also just graduated college with a degree in computer science and haven't gotten a single job offer. I started applying during my sophomore year for anything at all and I couldn't even get an internship. I have no work experience to my name except a crappy high school job which means nothing to employers. I've had at least 10-20 interviews since I began applying so it's not even a resume issue, employers just don't like me.

The worst part is that I decided to pick one of the most naive dream jobs I could have chosen, game developer. I bet right now you're facepalming or cringing, believe me I'm right there with you. The only problem is nothing else interests me and I don't feel like I'd be happy anywhere else. I'm aware my chances are pretty much less than 1% and even if I get into it I'll be worked to the bone then fired. However, absolutely nothing else interests me. I'm 22 and still haven't found anything to replace my dream job. I've even taken it a step further and developed my own personal game just to make sure I was actually interested in it.

So now that I've told you my life story I should explain why I think I'm never going to amount to anything. Lately I've been on a bit of a history binge. I took a computer architecture course for my last semester which was essentially computer history. Every important figure we learned about was already doing important things either right out college or sometimes even before. I've also been watching documentaries and again and again the successful ones were already on their path to success in their early 20s.

I have no path, I've searched for it as hard as I could but it's like I'm lost deep in the jungle or out in the middle of sea with no land in sight. I just want to be happy and do something important with my life. I'm not in it for the money or anything like that, I'm just sick of being only average.

Also I completely understand being average sometimes is perfectly okay. But the keyword there is **sometimes** and in my case it's all the time.

I try to surround myself with influential material. I follow YouTube channels that cover topics in my field. I'm on /r/programming, /r/gamedev, anything else related to what I want to be better at. I've done projects in my spare time, I've made an app, I've even made a game. However, I feel like I'm not making any progress. In fact I rarely understand any of the YouTube channels, subreddits, even the stuff I've made. I basically stacked multiple tutorials on top of each other for the things I've made. I hardly even understood the stuff when I was learning about it in college.

If there's anything I'm sure of it's that I'm most likely going to end up working at McDonald's and rot the rest of my life away. Often times I feel like I would be better off just ending it because I'm just going to end up a failure anyways.

I'm sorry that my thoughts are pretty scattered in my post. I've just been holding a lot in and it just kind of all came out at once. I'm just desperate for some guidance or advice."
4u3stn,7,2016-07-22,Choosing University,KaanFresh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4u3stn/choosing_university/,"Hey Everyone !

I'm 20 y.o guy who lives in Turkey. After 2 years of adventure* I joined University Entrance Exam (something like SAT in U.S) and next tuesday I need to choose a university. with my grade from the Exam I have 2 options:

* Istanbul Kultur University - Computer Engineering (Private)
* Karabuk University - Computer Engineering (Public)

I cannot decide, so I will write their pros/cons and seek for your opinions.

Firstly, **Istanbul Kultur University** :

This University as you can understand from its name located in Istanbul, Turkey. Unofficial capital of Turkey and maybe world itself. (according to Napoleon Bonaparte) IKU is private university which you need pay. Fee's are approx. 32.000,00 Turkish Liras but due to my Exam Grade I have %50 scholarship. If I write IKU at the first place of the list (You send a list to examination center for which universities would you like to go.) I'll get +15% scholarship from university. With the taxes and everything it's around 13.000 Turkish Liras for the school. 

I live in another city so I need to find somewhere to stay. University has a dorm but it's expensive. You need to pay 7.7 thousand liras for 10 months (1 Education year) to stay. I've found some houses 650 Liras per month studio flat. All bills etc included to rent.

Even tho it's expensive there are some good things to consider. It's really huge city. Official population is 14.03 million people but true population is approx 19-20 million people. There are lots of companies, many place to work, places to have fun. So many opportunities. I can work while I study or it will be a LOT more easy to find internship.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Karabuk University** :

[Wiki Page For Karabuk City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karab%C3%BCk)

University is new, founded in 2007. 2 of my friends are studies there. As far as I know city is too small, there is nothing to do. Locals are strong conservative people. I do not know what to tell because city is small and I've seen lots of people who hates this school (alumni). Only thing about this school is you do not pay for anything. I've found a nice super luxury flat (as they say :P) near school. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I do not know which one should I choose. Actually I really want IKU but I cannot decide whether it's worth to study with all of difficulties about finance. I do not want to push hard my dad. (BTW he earns 4000 lira per month if there is anyone who'll do the math.)  

Also I have two cousin. Both of them Software Developer. Big brother used to work in Microsoft at Seattle/Washington, now he started to work in Snapchat in Cali. Other brother used to work at CERN/Switzerland, few weeks he'll be moving to Canada to work at Amazon. I really love and admire both them. They're saying me that go which university you want. ""Important thing is how you improve yourself while you study."" they said to me. I know this, I've been working hard for 3-4 months for learning programming. I know that I can not do another job. I'm determined about this. It's my childhood dream. Not hacking or gaming. My dream was create something or make something better.

Please give me your opinion guys. It's more than important.

Thanks."

The inspiration for the service was to improve the Reddit replay-watching experience from basic gifs and gifvs. With this tool, you can easily find and clip your Xbox replays, add your gamertag as a watermark to the video, and optionally mute the audio if you want. The result is a clip that auto-loops, runs smoothly on every device, and loads faster than gifs do.

I’m in charge of managing this tool for the summer, so any feedback you may have would be super valuable. We’ve already got some really cool stuff in the works, and it's all pretty heavily tailored to the gaming community.

A bit about me and an inventory,independentset,MakeupRehab,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupRehab/comments/4u44lo/greetings_everyone_a_bit_about_me_and_an_inventory/,"Hello everyone! I came across this a few weeks ago and decided to do an inventory and say hi to everyone.

A bit about me, I'm in the middle of university and started buying makeup after high school, and always had a job for disposable income, so I never had much to hinder my shopping. What got me to join here was that I'm spending the summer in Seattle for an internship and did a whole lot of shopping, since I'm from Canada and a lot of things are harder to get a hold of, or more expensive, so I may have gone a bit too crazy. 

Over the last little bit, I put all my makeup I have here in Seattle (and some from home I can remember) into a [spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Aeq2zly4naz79fQLmbz_qMrexpRzY4KJMytwuRy8y4M). I based it off a lot I've seen here, but added my own row of time estimates. How long would it take to use up a product (in months) with daily-ish use. I don't think I'll be needing to do any replacement shopping even for about 2 years at least.... and I'm literally set for life for eyeshadow and blush. I used generous estimates, but I have more at home too.... 

My plan is to now just use what I have an go on an indefinite no buy. The inventory has helped, since if I see a new eyeshadow palette, I know I literally have decades worth of eyeshadow, and it's much easier to say no. I plan to go cruelty free, but that will be a gradual process, as I slowly use up the things I have. I have my own short project pan going, and will join in others from here on out!

Never done this before but please bear with me: I am a recent college grad who just turned 24 male and live in Chicago. I studied marketing and international business. I specialized in sales and began my sales career 1 month after graduating. I am good at sales due to my training and personality but I have been through 3 jobs already and I am pretty sure I hate sales. I started as a recruiter for an IT staffing company and making 70 cold calls a day; it was mind numbing for me. I appreciate how hard other recruiters work and it is not an easy job but every day I was having an existential crisis sitting there calling people. I left on good terms just said it was not for me and they let me call it an internship which was nice. I then sold a database for a start up and did really well. I always beat my quota but I hated sitting on the phone making cold calls all day it was boring and I would never commit more then 8 hours a day then run for the door. I left there 5 months in only because they went back on their word for my commissions and I couldn't even pay rent with how little they were giving me (contracts are important, I know that now). Which leads me to now where I am a Marketing Director for a building that provides care for the disabled. I like doing the different tasks and cold calling doesn't bother me as long as I do not have to do it every single day non-stop. I like parts of my job but I am not money hungry enough and sometimes I wish I was because I would put more effort into my work.
I feel like I need a job that is a little more analytical and less repetition if something else exists. I have been trying to figure out what I should be doing and I am looking for any advice out there. According to Myers Briggs which I heard is overrated and I try not to put too much stock into it but I am an ENFP personality even though I am an ambivert or between the introvert/extrovert classification. I am thinking about going back to school to get a masters in business analytics which I could complete in 1 year and would lead me into the IT world. I justify this decision because I could still be more on the client facing side and not purely working with the coding/database admin which I know that I would probably hate. Also it would be a secure and high paying field and I know I am bright enough to work with the technology and hopefully leverage my skill set to positions that are not 60 hour work weeks. I just want to make decent money and to feel somewhat secure because I do have a medical condition that could some day take me out of the workforce. Which is potentially losing my eyesight. Here are some more fun facts about me which may help:
- I am a prolific reader (Faulkner-Dostoyevsky) I read the news and articles religiously. I love random information and could read random subreddits all day
- I am good at connecting/socializing with most people 
-I am quick on my feet and can come up with answers quickly which helped me in sales 
- I am not detail oriented ( I try to be but I just miss things)
-I am getting more organized but still not pretty. I do not forget appointments.
-I like to have a plan but I would rather go with the flow then freak out over every little step and action
- I can talk but I enjoy listening to people. Everyone has a story and if you want something from someone the only way you will get it is by listening to them to find what they need.

I am kind of at a loss because I feel that I should be more passionate about what I should go into but I am studying for the GRE which the school accepts. I am taking the GRE also just in case another masters program appeals to me. 

Do you guys have any advice? opinions?

Please forgive me for any grammar mistakes as I said I am not the most detail oriented person. Thanks guys.

But, my new boss hates me and boy is she a real piece of work. She has an “inspirational” poster in her office with a bunch of pictures and a quote about perseverance from none other than herself. It literally says “hardships teach you how to survive without things we consider necessary to survive” – (her name). To make things worse, she’s also a Pakistan People's Party supporter, which is to say she’s an idiot that supports crooks. 

But anyways I was chilling with some interns today and we were talking, not any louder than anybody else in the office, but we were in the wrong. We should’ve been working but it was a Friday and we were pretty much done. Now, this guy who is one of the loudest in the office–so loud I have to wear headphones to focus–comes up to us and asks if we can keep it down since we’re distracting some people. I've never asked him and his friends to keep it down but I digress. We said fine and quieted down and I spot my boss give me the dirtiest look. Later on, I get back to work and she loudly starts complaining to someone how “these interns don’t do any work and just sit around and make noise.” Mind you, my department is quite laid-back and noisy, it's not like we were abnormally loud. A minute doesn’t go by without my boss yelling for something or a group sharing a laugh and what not. And what work are we going to do when she barely gives us any to begin with? The other interns and myself were just doing what everyone else does, chilling for a little while, sharing a laugh, and then getting back to what little work we have.

But I guess my boss couldn't tolerate this when interns do it and she reported us to HR. She didn't say a word to us directly, didn't even approach us, she just called someone in HR to complain. I fully admit we did something wrong and had she confronted us and said something, I would've apologized and moved on, but her pettiness warranted petty revenge.

So I was called up to HR to discuss the incident. The lady there was very understanding and even told me that it didn't seem like what we were doing was out of the ordinary for the marketing department. She did say, however, that this will likely result in a negative evaluation from my boss and there was nothing she could do about that. I couldn't give a single fuck about a negative evaluation. I was never planning on working at this bank again, certainly never will after today. I just want the sweet line for my CV and then I'm outta here. But onto my revenge.

I went back to my boss after my meeting with HR to apologize. I went in, explained my position with her barely paying attention to me. If she looked away from her computer, it was to check her phone. After I'd said what needed to be said, I asked if she had anything to say to me. She told me no and to leave. Now, I accepted being her punching bag up until this point, when I'd had enough. She didn't even acknowledge, let alone accept, my apology. So, I left and called up my uncle. My uncle happens to be the CEO of this bank. I told him what happened and he agreed that while I did something wrong, her reaction was not warranted. At the end of the day, everyone is getting ready to leave when my uncle walks into the department. He comes to where the interns sit and greets us and starts chatting the same way we'd been doing before. He didn't greet anybody else in the office besides the interns but my boss and her boss soon came to ask what he was doing down there. He said that he'd heard some marketing interns were having fun and he wanted to check it out and said that if the interns weren't being given any work what did they expect to happen, especially on such a happening floor. He also asked if he needed to re-evaluate his entrusting of his nephew with this department. Suddenly, my boss' demeanour towards me completely transforms as she realized I was his nephew. The look on her face was priceless. Its good to be king, but it's great to be the king's nephew.

**TL;DR Raging bitch of a boss complained to HR over a very minor incident. I used nepotism to scare her shitless.**"

My financial life story so far goes something like this: Mom and dad had a decently successful company at one point, well over $120,000 to spend on random shit if they felt like it, no considerable debt.

When I was 5, my mom learned that her cancer was more or less guaranteed to kill her within the coming 6 months, so she divorced dad, went on a shopping spree, ruined both dad and the company financially and ultimately committed suicide a few weeks before the cancer would kill her anyway. I don't blame her, I'm a ""Never commit suicide no matter what""-kind of guy but she had a really rough life for all of her 35 years.

My dad was heartbroken after she died and never really got over it, and was a hopeless gambling addict until about two months ago. My mom's life insurance went to me alone, so on my 18th birthday I got access to about $42,000. After graduating high school I decided I didn't want to go to college, get a job, or do anything worth mentioning at all really. Most of that money went away, my dad borrowed about $20,000 for ""rent"" and ""car expenses"" (read: gambling), he partially repaid that debt eventually but it had been at a standstill for quite a while until he managed to quit gambling two months ago, and has repaid quite a bit this summer. The debt is currently at about $7,000.

I'm currently living off of social security but I have an under-the-radar summer job at the moment, I've managed to save up $1,800 so far and will probably have increased that amount by at least $800-900 at the end of August. I'll start studying to improve my high school grades in August and will do so for two semesters, so about a year, before advancing to a college-level school. I currently have my eyes on a 2-year programmer/game designer education with 25% internship, but I don't think game design is what I want to do in the long term, I'm also very interested in finance, science and AI. Nevertheless, I have an eye for programming and I don't think those two years would be a waste of time, especially as it would mean a student loan of about $42,000 with an annual interest of only 0.6%. Getting a bigger return than that shouldn't be a problem (Swedish savings accounts currently go up to 1.5%), so whatever I manage to not spend on meaningless shit should be nice starting money for financial progress.

Now, I'm not really sure what to do with these $1,800 I currently have, right now they're just bills in a drawer, putting them into my account means no social security (which I won't get anyway after I start getting my student loan in August, so that's not a huge issue). The whole compound interest thing sounds really appealing to me so my first instinct is to throw it all into a savings account, but I'm unsure about the whole ""Throw your money in here, get 1.5% interest a year, you aren't allowed to touch this money for 3 years""-thing. I figure I might need the money for one reason or another during my student years, or find a way to make a larger profit than 1.5% a year. I know even the craziest compound interest starts small and investing while you're young is a good call, but $30 a year isn't going to cut it, I want to be someone who owns millions in his forties. 

Another thing I'm considering is getting eye surgery and/or a new phone on a payment plan. The phone I have my eyes on is $35 a month for three years (monthly call, text and internet expenses included) and the eye surgery would be $220 a month for two years. My current phone is shit (slow, overheats etc.) but I don't really *need* a new one, that's why I'm unsure about getting one. The eye surgery would be wonderful, never having to worry about glasses again would be amazing, but $5280 is not a small amount of money, especially not for someone with ambitions to become a multiple millionaire in a decade or two. I might need that money.

So...what do you guys reckon I should do, any tips?"

But I'm not where I want to be. I am doing an internship at a big researchproject at my university, but I just can't get myself to do anything productive. The last two weeks I've basically just browsed my entire day away there (mainly reddit, newssites, political commentators/comedians like Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, Seth Meyers, Samantha Bee and the like). On my laptop at home I have a browserplugin to prevent me from visiting reddit (except r/stopgaming) and youtube for more than 10 minutes a day, but I am not able to install this at the university computer and I need to be at the university network to access the subject data files. 


This endless browsing is essentially functioning in the same way as my gaming addiction: Just bury my head in the sand to avoid feeling the fear of starting my part of the researchproject. It is getting me nowhere. So... I want to commit myself to 3 months of not surfing any newssites, youtube or reddit (except r/nosurf and r/stopgaming) until 22 october. I know this is going to be really hard, possibly harder than stopping gaming itself. 


Please let me know if you have any further tips!

4u53b3,4,2016-07-22,"Senior CS Major in Undergrad, no experience or skills, VERY lost",esym,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4u53b3/senior_cs_major_in_undergrad_no_experience_or/,"I'm a CS major at a top undergrad school. I did extremely well in my first few courses. I chose the degree based on practicality, but because of a lack of interest and passion I began slacking off. I am clever enough to do well enough on exams and get decent grades, but because of this I haven't learned much since my lower-division courses.

I have not done an internship yet. I am graduating early (3 years vs 4 and do not have the option of staying longer) and I decided on my major late, so I was using my summers to fulfill degree requirements. I don't have much practice in coding as my most recent classes have been theoretical. My upcoming courses are of the same nature.

I am completely lost and unsure of how to move forward from here. I have just picked up a personal project but I'm moving extremely slow and have many dumb questions, but don't know where to ask them. I don't see myself programming in the long-term, only as a means to pay off my debt and get me started off before I move on to something that I am more passionate about.

I have a competitive GPA but I know I will do poorly on any coding interviews. Any advice on how I can become a proficient programmer and a competitive recruit would be great. I have basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms. And limited knowledge of Python and Java."

4u5fwu,1,2016-07-22,Need advice on majors/student loans,collegehelp16,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4u5fwu/need_advice_on_majorsstudent_loans/,"I'll try and make this post as short as I can. Sorry if it seems jumbled. I'm going to talk to a school counselor about all of it, but I'd love any kind of advice I can get.

I'm 23 (F) and have been at a community college for the past almost 4 years. I was at a religious university that I disliked for a few semesters and ended up failing my freshman year. I come from a poor family, but my mom recently remarried and now I don't qualify for financial aid as my step dad makes too much money. He does not help pay for my schooling and I don't expect him to. My mom gives me a set $600 / semester which only equates to 2 classes + books. I throw in what money I can after my own bills, so I've only been able to take 3 classes per semester. I'm going to try and look into student loans so any advice on that would be helpful, too.

I was set on becoming a nursing major when I started college, took the prereqs for it and then decided it wasn't a good fit. Since then, I've been struggling on picking a good major. The problem is, given my poor GPA (2.6) and money issues I'm planning on not transferring to a 4 year. I know an associates degree will not open many doors, if any, but I don't want all of these factors to hold me back from continuing my education. I lost hope and decided to go to a very cheap trade school for dental assisting this summer and it doesn't feel like the best fit for me either, so I want to continue what I was doing at my CC. However, I'm glad I'm taking the dental classes because it can serve as a backup if I ever needed it. The truth is, I have pretty bad anxiety that I need to have checked out. Being in a healthcare job comes with a lot of responsibility and honestly, working that close (in another person's mouth) is very nerve-wracking for me. I didn't realize it until I started taking the dental courses and working as an intern. I felt the need to point this out because I think it weighs heavily on the kind of job that would be best for me. Another big factor is my fiancé's job can take us to any city in the future, big or small. I would need to find a career that can work with that kind of plan.

My list of potential majors:
. English (or Journalism)
. Business (Marketing/Small Business Entrepreneurship)
. Communications
. Psychology 
. Early Childhood Education
. Kinesiology (or physical therapist assistant)

I know those choices are all over the place, but I can see myself in a career pertaining to any of those listed majors. I have many different interests. I've always had a love for writing and am pretty good at it. If I decide to go the English/Journalism path I have great connections at my local 4 year university. The same goes for the Kinesiology route. Though, I don't know of any schools that offer a physical therapy assistant program. I'm considering business because I've always been told it's a good degree to have. I also knit and create small things such as candles, bookmarks, and jewelry that I'd one day like to sell, so business may help me gain more knowledge with that. I'm also very interested in photography and have been told that getting a degree in business would be better than one focused on photography. Psychology is still listed up there although the amount of schooling I would need turns me off to it. Early Childhood Education is another one I'm considering because I work well with kids and if I decide to not go to a 4 year I could still find a job, though I understand it won't be a good paying one. 

Again, sorry if this post is jumbled! Hopefully I explained my situation clearly. Any advice would be extremely appreciated."

I can go to school this semester and receive financial aid.

4u63j9,9,2016-07-22,ENTP needing some insight on my INFJ and advice on how to be firm without making her close off more,saintsfn27,infj,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/4u63j9/entp_needing_some_insight_on_my_infj_and_advice/,"Hi all,

The girl I've been dating from college has been out of town all summer on an internship and things have become incredibly strange over the past few weeks. The internship is incredibly important to her as a time of healing and discovery, due to it being her first time away from a terrible childhood home. We decided to keep things without labels for the summer, and agreed to be open sexually while she is gone, and things had been going great until last week. 

At the beginning of an 8 day leave from her work, we had a great conversation where she was her typical, warm and invested self, encouraging me to talk and write to her as much as possible during that period. The day after she suddenly went silent, and did not speak to me at all for four days days. I didn't contact her after the first day of no response, suspecting she needed time to decompress and possibly that she was out in the mountains (its an environmental internship) without service. After that four day period she admitted to ignoring me and feeling guilty, but her language and tone has completely changed and she refused to talk via phone (which she prefers) for days. After some prodding (which I've grown used to doing as part of our dynamic) she finally told me that she wanted to ""focus entirely on what's going on here and the happy place she is emotionally"" and told me that she needed to detach from everyone back home, myself included, on her own terms.

I understand this completely and I could use some time for myself, but It really alarms me that she went from the most receptive and inviting we've ever been, to as cold and dismissive as she's ever been in a four day period. I have tried to be as respectful and conscientious of her boundaries as possible, but she has grown increasingly nasty and snippy towards me at my request for some clarity on what over that 4 day span caused her to completely reverse on what she wants from me, and everyone back home.

I'm constantly paranoid of being blunt with her because that's my nature, but i'm distressed by her increasingly self-absorbed behavior and disregard for my emotions. I've been walking on egg shells with her until now, treading with care because I support her, but I need that clarity out of self respect.

How should I handle addressing this? Also any insight into what might be going on in her mind from you INFJ's here?"

**Work Experience**

* Internet Page - Director of a publishing website in Spanish and Portuguese delivering over 60 million page views per month (up from 6,000 views per month total when I started), as well as reaching 20 million people a week on Facebook. Job duties include all aspects of running a major publishing page, with strategic decision making for development (front and back end), content (text and video), advertising, and social media being primary day to day responsibilities. To put it simply, aside from actually writing the code and stories, I do everything else for the website. I manage about 25 employees total in LATAM (primarily Brazil and Argentina, where I travel to frequently).

* Soccer Marketing - Worked with family in creating marketing decks for sponsors wishing to be part of a major soccer event. Within that, I additionally utilized the overlap in audiences for the event and website to develop interesting projects that can create recorded actions online for sponsors - something traditional billboard advertising has difficulty in generating. I can expand on other actions I have done here if necessary.

* Farm - Assisted in the planning and realization of a family farm. This included deciding on animals to raise, how to sell goods, the type of goods to produce aside from beef/poultry/pork, services we could offer outside of purely raising animals (hunts, etc), and other facets of running a farm (primarily financial-related).

* General Store - Needing an outlet for the farm's produce, we rented out an abandoned storefront in a local town. This allowed the farm some leeway in the form of vertical integration and developed a sales channel for our goods. Currently working on increasing average customer spending and generating greater margins as well as increasing sales in non-perishable and compact goods. This and the farm together are generating over 500k/year

* PWM Firm - Summer Analyst for PWM Firm, received training on investment philosophy as well as tailored investment portfolios.


**Extra-Curricular**

* Compete in Powerlifting (Next competition in November, current maxes of 455/345/545 on S/B/DL)

* Racing (Attending Bondurant after R1 applications go through)

* Scuba Diving

* Free Diving/Spear Fishing

* Target Shooting

* Sports (Football/Volleyball/Basketball)


**University - Top 20 School**

* BS in International Economics

* Recipient of competitive Honors Certificate (competing with Master's and MBA students)

* Undergrad GPA - 3.2  (mediocre, I'm being fair here, and I identify this as the weakest part of my application. The average econ degree during my time was a 2.9-3.0 due to the curve only allowing 10-15% of students per class to receive A's, but that is irrelevant. My GPA is the main reason why my current goal for the GMAT is a 750 or higher)


**Goal of MBA**

* Network, Learn, Absorb - I really want to go to the West Coast as a goal for my MBA as working with Technology in any facet has been my calling. I've taken basic HTML/CSS and Comp Sci classes (the latter from EdX), and even since my time working at Goldman as a high schooler I was in the Technology department. Ideally I'd like to sell the website I run and get into technology consulting, because I worked a few times with people who were absolute geniuses and had amazing products but were myopic in how they approached bringing it to market and its true functionality. Also working with people smarter than me is always inspirational. Sounds silly but it gets me working.

* Target Schools - H/S, Sloan, Haas, Tuck, in that order.

Is this normal/legit?  What kind of experience can you get from working as an intern from home besides how to be on reddit even more hours?"
4u6emw,0,2016-07-22,Star Trek Beyond Stupid,flossdaily,startrek,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/4u6emw/star_trek_beyond_stupid/,"SPOILERS AHEAD  --- SPOILERS AHEAD  --- SPOILERS AHEAD  

Okay, so I read a review the other day that praise Star Trek Beyond for being TRUE Star Trek, a character-driven movie that really captured the spirit of the original.  So I went to see it.  It was bad.  It was so, so bad.  
I’m going to spoil everything in this movie, so if you haven’t seen it, stop now.  
If you liked the movie, and want to go on liking the movie, stop now.  
**If you thought the movie was so stupid that you need to commiserate about it, read on:**

* The title is stupid.  Star Trek Beyond might make sense if anything in the story was thematically or literally beyond anything.  They didn’t.  The went INSIDE a nebula… and if you really want to force it they went beyond the barrier into the nebula… but this was in no way relevant or important to the story.  In other words, the title is complete nonsense.

* Jim is sick and tired of being captain after his long career of… 3 years.  They’re trying to parallel the Star Trek II, where an age-appropriate Jim laments his promotion to admiral.  It just doesn’t work at all with this brash new captain still in the prime of his career.

* The movie shows the first sign that it might go off the rails when Jim is on a diplomatic mission that quickly devolves into unfunny, G-rated slapstick.

* JJ keeps showcasing his own personal Jar-Jar with Scotty’s little alien buddy… who now sneezes the world’s most caustic acid.

* So a vessel comes out of the nebula and asks for help.  Jim and the enterprise are sent to help because they have the best navigation equipment.  There is no mention of sending any of the presumably dozens, hundreds or thousands of other ships that must be docked at their huge space station.  All they have to do is follow the enterprise.  They don’t need to do their own navigation.  NOPE.  Better to send the Enterprise in with no hope of sending backup or a rescue party.

* The writers display their boundless scientific illiteracy by showing us that they think a nebula is the most densely packed asteroid field in cinematic history.  Google “nebula”, gang.  That’s not what they are.

* The movie begins to morph into a mindless action flick when a swarm of tiny ships destroy the enterprise, completely bypassing its shields, and using kamikaze attacks to slice parts of the ship off.  No explanation is ever given as to why shield have no effect.

* We officially cross into full-blown stupidity when we meet our villain.  This part is so stupid I need to break it down into subsections:

**a.**	It’s extremely disappointing that we have a villain at all.  This is the third rebooted Trek and each one has had a villain, like Bond movie.  Star Trek shouldn’t be about Good vs. Evil.  Historically Star Trek’s finest moments have been about true moral ambiguity.  There is none of that here.  This villain is a bad guy.  We know it from the moment we see him.  How do we know?  Read on:

**b.**	We know he’s evil because he LOOKS evil.  It’s not enough that he just launched an unprovoked attack on the enterprise.  No, JJ Abrams didn’t want any confusion at all here.  The bad guy has to have demon eyes and rotten teeth, and generally be a monster.
  
**Let’s really think about how insulting this is to the audience, here:**  JJ Abrams thought that the context of destroying the enterprise and indiscriminately killing hundreds of his own people while he’s at it wasn’t enough to let us know that the bad guy is a bad guy.  He literally had to be made up to look like a monster.
 
I imagine JJ Abrams watching Game of Thrones at night with his wife: 

“Honey,” he says, “That Ramsey Bolton sure seems like a nice guy.”
          
“JJ, what are you talking about?  He’s absolutely the most sadistic and evil character in a show full of sadistic and evil characters.”*
         
“Nonsense, dear,” says JJ, “Just look how handsome he is.  He doesn’t have fangs or claws, or weird, black demon eyes.  So he must be a good person.”*
          
“But JJ, he tortures people indiscriminately, and does it for his own personal pleasure.  He delights in causing misery.”
          
“Impossible,” says JJ, “Just look at that full head of hair.  He must be a great fellow.”

**c.**	Our bad guy makes it immediately clear that this whole attack is because he wants to get his hands on “the artifact”.  This seems like an odd way to go about it, no one seems to really care much about the artifact.  He probably could have bought it or stolen it without destroying the ship and murdering a bunch of people.  But that wouldn’t be evil enough.

* So as expected, our main characters are somehow the only three people in the entire crew who evade the drones that capture literally everyone else.

* Scotty lands his escape pod on the edge of a cliff, where he jumps out just in time and literally hangs from a ledge.  Because that’s what the new Star Trek is all about… engineers being athletic superstars.

* Jim and Chekov land with the lying snake who tricked them into going into the nebula in the first place.  Even though she has just brought death and destruction upon the entire enterprise, they don’t kill her, because killing is bad and wrong.
* Scotty gets mugged by the only three people on the surface of the planet.  Wait, wait, there is ONE more person on the surface.  She’s there too.  Fortunately she’s a ninja, with magical technology that lets her be in three different places at once, and she saves Scotty.  This future technology of hers is absolutely amazing.  I wonder where she got it from.  No, seriously, I wonder where she got it from.  They never tell us.  Turns out she lives on an ancient federation ship that crashed here long ago.  I guess they had advance super technology back then?  Or… did she steal it from the bad guys who show no sign of having that technology?  Maybe she’s a native of the planet? And they all had superior technology, but were wiped out by the inferior tech of the Bad Guy?
* Our Bad Guy… is his name Krull?  It was something like Krull.  I’m going to call him Krull.  Krull is apparently pretty lonely, and pretty stupid, because he feels the need to tell his entire evil plan to Uhura, who for some reason he didn’t kill on sight.  It’s okay, Krull, she’s totally not a threat to you, even though she just killed a bunch of your minions.
* We cross from full-blown stupid into Unforgivably Stupid when we find out that Krull is a vampire.  Yeah, an actual vampire.   “Wait!” you say, “I saw the movie.  He was NOT an actual vampire”.  Yes he was, stranger.   He suck’s peoples “lifeforce” out of them, leaving them as bloodless, emaciated corpses.  But instead of hanging upside down like vampires do, Krull hangs his victims upside-down.  What a twist.

   One die-hard trekkie intern in the writers’ room must have had a fit at this point and kicked over lunch buffet screaming, “THERE ARE NO VAMPIRES IN STAR TREK, YOU ASSHOLES!”, because in the end they never actually refer to Krull as a vampire, and instead of sucking people’s blood with point fangs, he sucks their blood magically with his hands.

* Since the movie was already Unforgivably Stupid, JJ Abrams said, “Hey, let’s have a scene with with Captain Kirk on a motorcycle.”

“But JJ, why would there even be a motorcycle in the future?  And if there was one, why would it be on this alien planet?  And how would it even work without any gasoline?  And also isn’t this the goddamned stupidest thing you’ve ever suggested?”

To which JJ replied, “Hey peon, I’m still wiping my ass with all the hundred dollar bills I made from the last Star Trek movie I made.  Just do what I say.  Make it happen.”

And so we have a scene where Captain Kirk stages a rescue of his crew, by riding around and doing stunts on a motorcycle—a piece of technology so outdated that it would be like a modern day action hero opting to use a penny-farthing.  If you don’t know what a penny-farthing is, do a google image search, and imagine Captain Kirk peddling around on one.

This would be stupid enough on its own, but we’ve already established (for no apparent reason) that everyone on this planet lives underground.  But it’s okay, you can disregard that, because again for no apparent reason, they’ve moved a bunch of prisoners to the surface to sit in a cage.

* So they escape, and Scotty’s friend, the ninja girl, almost gets revenge on the dude who killed her father.  Not because she went looking for him, but because by a lucky coincidence on this entire planet, he just happened to be the guy guarding these prisoners.
* A bonus dash of stupid:  Even though our heroes crashed randomly on the planet without any guidance whatsoever, they all ended up just a few hours walk from each other and from the remains of the Enterprise.  Just super lucky I guess!
* Okay, so we’ve been in Unforgivably Stupid territory for a while now, but that’s not enough for JJ Abrams.  NO.  Not this time.  This time, we’re going Beyond Stupid.  So how do we do it.  Well, let’s start by looking at Scotty’s girlfriend and the fact that she lives in a ship that she has hidden with cloaking technology.  What’s stupid about that?  Nothing.  It’s totally in the realm of the Star Trek universe that she could use a cloak to hide a ship.  

   What makes this so insanely stupid is that the guy she’s hiding the ship from… IS THE GUY WHO CRASHED THE SHIP IN THAT EXACT SPOT.  Yeah.  Really.   Dude crashes a starship, then she comes along decades later and throws a cloaking device over it, and poof, he doesn’t know where it is anymore? 

* So Scotty and the gang fix this ancient and crashed ship using nothing but what they find on board, and even though this thing has been rotting away over the decades they get it working better than its original crew did.  Oh, and they do this in an afternoon.

* The ship is an old star ship, which they go out of the way to explain isn’t designed for in-atmosphere flight.   But then 3 minutes later Chekov is talking about the velocity needed to create sufficient lift to fly the thing… this thing that is not at all designed for aerodynamics.  It would be like talking about the lift needed to fly a skyscraper.  If it’s not designed to create lift, it doesn’t matter how fast it’s going.  Stupid.

* We found out earlier that The Artifact is a superweapon.  Krull is going to attack the big starbase nearby with it, because… reasons.  No, really.  He babbles about unity, and stopping the expanding boundary of the Federation, and about conflict making people strong… but there’s never anything approaching a coherent motive behind his plan.  He’s just an evil guy.  We know he’s evil, remember because he looks evil.  And he’s a vampire.
* Since we’re already well Beyond Stupid, JJ doesn’t even try to explain why Krull lets Jim and his ancient spaceship fly past his overwhelmingly superior armada of ships while they make their attack run.  This is a guy who just a couple days ago made sure that not even a single escape pod got away from him.

* Krull’s ships are absolutely mutilating the Federation starbase.  I mean, they’re just ripping this thing apart.  Krull, meanwhile tries desperately to get his superweapon to the central heart of the station, where it will kill everybody.

  Think about this for a moment:

   Krull has been waiting for decades? Centuries? On this nearby planet with his massive armada of invincible war ships, and he’s only been holding out for this “superweapon” which really has about the same effect as any nasty chemical weapon.  I mean, it moves and spreads slowly like a gas, and it kills people.  BIG DEAL.  The “superweapon” is NOTHING compared to Krull’s army of drone ships.

* Beyond Stupid doesn’t even begin to describe mindlessness of what happens next:  Spock discovers that the swarm of warships must communicate with one another somehow.  *GASP* And so their big plan is to disrupt the communications by “broadcasting on a frequency they wouldn’t expect”.  So they… I wish I was kidding… decide to blast The Beastie Boy’s “Sabotage” over the radio.  I need to break down this idiocy into subsections:
* * 	TODAY in 2016, we KNOW how swarm behavior works.  In birds and in fish swarm behaviors are NOT controlled by communication.  They’re controlled by each independent animal responding to the increased or decreased proximity of the other animals around it.
* * 	If you’re going to disrupt communications, you can’t just do it on “a frequency they wouldn’t expect” you have to do it on the frequency THEY ARE USING TO COMMUNICATE.  Jim’s plan is like trying to break up a heated family argument by blowing a dog whistle.   Dude, no one can hear you.
* * 	These drone ships have fewer safety features than my Subaru I guess, because the second they lose the ability to communicate, the start crashing into each other and exploding.  
* * 	That’s it for my specific criticisms of this scene, but **I feel we should all have a moment of silence to appreciate this all-time low in the Star Trek franchise.**  “Let’s have Kirk kill all the bad guys by playing Beastie Boys really loud at them” is an idea that should have be laughed out of the room immediately.  This is an idea so monumentally inappropriate and brainless that it makes the Kirk-on-motorcycle stunt look brilliant and inspired.

* The stupidity isn’t over.  You see, Krull, or whatever his name really was… it turns out that he isn’t an alien space monster.  It turns out… he’s a human.  He was the captain of the old federation ship that crashed.  Just as we’re figuring this out from old video tapes that the crew made on their VHS camcorders, Krull drinks some dude’s blood, and for the first time in the entire movie starts to look like a human.   Because reasons.

    Let’s talk about this for a moment, because it’s important.  Krull’s wishy-washy motives for killing the federation now make absolutely no sense whatsoever.  He … went insane because he got sucked through a wormhole and got stranded… but then he somehow was able to tap into federation communications, and never sent an S.O.S…. but he’s mad because the Federation doesn’t care about him? 
   
   Also, he somehow managed to take over an entire planet, despite the fact that his technology was pathetically inferior to the people he conquered?

   Also, he spent the entire movie being evasive about the fact that he was human?  Other than to give JJ a big third act reveal, this served no logical purpose whatsoever. 

* Jim and Spock save the day.  They decide not to quit Starfleet.  The Admiral offers Jim the rear(or vice?) admiral position based on the fact that Jim just saved the station… NEVERMIND THAT HE SAVED ALL OF PLANET EARTH A COUPLE YEARS AGO.  Jim then rudely rejects the promotion, which doubly rude since he requested it in the first place.

* Spock has received a box full of Old Spock’s stuff.  In it is a photograph of the original Star Trek crew (likely a publicity photo they did during Undiscovered Country).  It is a jarring moment where we the audience who is generally happy with the recasting is forced to admit that the old crew looked almost nothing like the new.   In its way it is a well-intentioned tribute to Nimoy and the rest of the old guard, but given the unforgivable crapfest that was “Star Trek Beyond”, it felt almost insulting.

Right?,hdmibunny,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4u6mrp/the_user_was_right/,"After spending a few months working as a Audio Video tech I got a new job at an IT consulting firm. It's great and the users are just... well they're funny let's tune into my first week story shall we? 

Our story beings with me doing some manual labor, as the new intern I totally get it and no issues with that, I'm the FNG. I hear $coworker on the phone with  $user and I'm asked to go do some intern stuff (trash needed thrown away needed some stuff moved etc) and after an hour I return to see that  $coworker is still on the phone with  $user. Finally $coworker ends the call and promptly shuts down his pc in a brief fit of rage. 

$boss: did you just shut off your pc because you're f***ing pissed?

$coworker: yup I have to go on site to fix the issue and I think this will take a while.

$boss: ok well take hdmibunny with you 

Fast forward to us sitting in the car

$me: so what happened?

$coworker: well these people are crazy cheap wouldn't let me sell them a new switch. And now they want us to figure out where their ethernet cable went to.

$me: they lost their ethernet cable?

$coworker: I asked $user to unplug the cable from their switch and plug it back in the router to bypass their switch but $user said it disappeared.

We arrive on site and meet $user, a sweet elderly lady working out of our client's building. Sure enough the ethernet cable was plugged Into her pc.... but when we looked at the router it wasn't there. Their  ISP had fished the wall to get the cables down neatly and so I popped my head up above the ceiling tiles and I realized what had happened. When the internet service provider ran the client's ethernet cable they ran it an extra 200 feet to one side the building and then brought it straight back to the office where this lady works instead of plugging it directly into their router. When $user unplugged the ethernet cable it flew right back up the wall into the ceiling.Our solution? Plug in a cable from the computer to the router that was literally 15 feet away on the other side of the room.

TLDR: User says Ethernet cable vanished and it literally did. Cable was so tightly snug that it flew right up the wall and into the ceiling."

I am currently a math major, and far into it, but have come to realize that a math major on its own provides little value on its own but a lot of value when coupled with something else that is analytical. I took AP computer science in high school, got a 5 on the test, and was able to code some simple games in Java. 

By some miracle this summer I got a software engineering internship through a professor at my school, but it is unpaid and the company understands I have very little programming experience. As a result, they don't really have me coding; instead they had me go through a crash course in machine learning, which I am now using to help them with image processing (as much as I can help). 

But as a result over the summer I haven't been getting any better at writing code. My skills in Java are super rusty. To review basic principles I went through the Codeacademy course in Python, which I found very easy; things like classes, loops, conditionals, etc came back easily. Still, though, I feel so weak in my programming that I feel like I can't really create anything USEFUL or interesting.

I am taking a class in C++ and a class in algorithms and data structures in Java next semester. When do you all think I can say, as a student, that these languages are skills of mine, ie when is it resume worthy? How much more would I have to do with python beyond codeacademy to make it resume worthy? I don't want to oversell or undersell myself, and it is causing me a lot of anxiety.

4u6zte,3,2016-07-23,I have a few questions about whether the National Guard would be right for me.,whirlpool138,nationalguard,https://www.reddit.com/r/nationalguard/comments/4u6zte/i_have_a_few_questions_about_whether_the_national/,"Hey, I don't know if this would be the right place to ask but I figured you guys on here could give me some good advice on joining the National Guard. 

Within the next year I will be graduating from a SUNY school with a double degree in Environmental Studies (B.S.) and Anthropology (B.A.). I'm not really sure what I want to do once college is finished and have been thinking a lot about joining the military, this is something i've wanted to do since I was young but got caught up with taking classes and going to school (started with an associates degree from community college). Sometimes I regret choosing to go college instead of joining the army straight up after high school.

Anyway, I am seriously thinking about joining either the New York Air National Guard or Army Guard. I have pretty good grades in college for both my majors (mostly B's and A's). I have helped create a docent education program for a local aquarium, completed  an archaeology field school for my anthropology practicum and will have an environmental internship completed before I graduate sometime next spring or fall. 

In between earning my associates degree and getting in SUNY-UB, I took some time off from school, joined the Americorps and did a gap year down in Florida with the Conservation Corps. When I was down there, they put me through classes to get certified as a hand crew on controlled/prescribed wild land fires, I worked on archaeological digs, helped with disaster relief/public outreach, worked with the United Way/Red Cross and a ton of other conservation stuff that was all over the place. Now I work at Niagara Falls State Park (in NY) while I am finishing school. It's a good job but nearly impossible to move up state level.

The problem though now is that I am a bit older than the average person who enlists. I will be 29 on December 30th and am worried that it's going to be too late. I feel like I am physically fit for the training and can take on whatever kind of job they throw at me, but I am worried that my age will hold me back. Another concern is that I have a girlfriend with a 9 year old daughter that I both plan on marrying and adopting (although this isn't happening till after school, one thing at a time). The New York National Guard seems like it would be a perfect fit for what I want to staying with the New York State Park Service. 

What is it like to go through basic training and AIT afterwards? We have talked about me going through with it and both of them are prepared to me being away for a while, but is there anything that I should know? I really have no idea what the leave time is like. What is the process like to be drilled or called up to active duty?  

Thanks for any responses, I know that was long winded but I appreciate every response."

*****
&gt; The Washington Post&amp;#039;s Paul Farhi explains what&amp;#039;s next for Fox News and the Murdoch family, now that Roger Ailes is out as chairman and CEO of Fox News.

&gt; Within weeks, Carlson would be out of a job, and a cascading series of events, unfolding with dizzying speed, would culminate in the public shaming and resignation this week of Ailes, one of the most influential executives in American television history, as well as a primary architect of the modern-day Republican Party and conservative movement.

&gt; Three of the women were speaking about their allegations for the first time, including a 2002 Fox intern who says Ailes grabbed her buttocks, and a Fox employee who says Ailes touched her and tried to kiss her against her will at his office in 2004.

&gt; Many of the allegations that have become public - first in New York magazine and then elsewhere - are clustered in the decades long before Ailes became the founding chief executive officer and guiding light of media mogul Rupert Murdoch&amp;#039;s new Fox News Channel in 1996.

&gt; The message from Ailes was unmistakable, the former staffer said: &amp;quot;I want to see her legs. I want the viewers to see their legs. I want people to watch Fox News even if the sound is turned down.""

&gt; The former staffer said, Ailes made &amp;quot;Jokes that he liked having women on their knees. The tone he set went through the organization.""

4u7ezy,14,2016-07-23,looking for help.,paatrickk,DecidingToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/4u7ezy/looking_for_help/,"EDIT: wall of text warning, sorry!

to begin, i am not sure where this post belongs in but this seems one of the most supportive subreddits, i hope you will not judge me and offer genuine help.
I [21M] have BPD (borderline personality disorder) and am struggling with addiction to various substances. I go to university and am currently working an internship for a tech company.
 I have decided to go straight edge for a minimum of 6 months as of this post. I believe this will give me clarity and help me deal with my issues in an adult manner, as well as overcoming my addictions ( i am no longer a frequent user, although i used to be, especially of substances which helped boost my self confidence and made me feel sure of myself). 
My greatest issue is self confidence, this creates problems for me in all areas of life. I constantly feel worthless compared to every person i meet. I also struggle daily with an eating disorder - i am underweight but am afraid to eat. i lose my appetite regularly and vomit if i force myself to eat. I am neither anorexic nor bulimic, i realize how skinny i am and this disgusts me. However, any weight i am able to gain (a personal goal of mine) i usually lose after a few days because i cannot eat without vomiting. I have been to multiple doctors about this specifically, none have been able to help and most do not believe that i am not anorexic. this hurts me even more, because all i want is to not be skinnier than everybody i meet so they find me more attractive. This has been an issue for as long as i can remember, long before i started using /abusing any substances, including MJ which helps my appetite more than anything else. i prefer CBD products as i do not like the psychoactive effects of cannabis, but it enables me to keep my meals down and occasionally even eat an extra meal or munchies.
I have a loving GF [23F] who is the reason i am able to get out of bed in the mornings. She is aware of my struggles but i try to tone them down around her, because i don't believe it is fair to burden her with my issues and wish i could be the self-confident caring BF she deserves. she is fully aware of all my issues, but i try to make her think i am coping well because she is happier when she thinks i am doing well, and she absolutely deserves to be happy.
I have always, and still do, validate myself and my opinions based on other people. I feel that this is extremely harmful to me as i do not trust myself (or my reactions / thoughts) without first getting confirmation that others feel the same as i do. I constantly feel different from other people, as if i do not belong and am unable to connect with them. 
I was prescribed and took various antidepressants (first tricyclic, then SSRI) starting at age 15 and only this year [in january] ceased taking them, as i feel like they mess with my ability to perceive and express my emotions - they left me feeling constantly empty and unreachable to the world, and i feel i could not think clearly while taking them. i have been to several different psychotherapists / psychiatrists over this period of time, i did not feel like any could understand my issues or help me be a normal person. 
i am currently not in therapy, however i am still looking for a psychiatrist who i feel understands me and is willing to help me.
all i want is to stop feeling like everyone else is better than me, and be able to interact with people (on a social as well as professional level) normally without constantly second-guessing myself and worrying i have made a mistake or said something wrong. I also want to learn to simply be myself, i feel like i seek approval from everyone i meet, including strangers, and if i see people laughing, i usually think they are laughing at me. i realize this i egocentric, i know they probably don't care / haven't even glanced at me, however i still feel this way. 
i will be happy to answer any questions, this is my basic (oversimplified) outline of my issues. 
redditors, i would be happy if you have any advice for me, it is a big step talking about myself so openly, even as i read this i am strongly rethinking posting it. I am however going to ""go for it"", if i get downvoted or this is the wrong sub that's okay. 
Thank you in advance for having the patience to read this, and if you comment i thank you for your help, any positive response is highly appreciated.

4u879e,0,2016-07-23,Any Business Analyst here? I'd love to hear your story!,jdariansen,digitalnomad,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/4u879e/any_business_analyst_here_id_love_to_hear_your/,"Hi,

I am currently enrolled in a full time MBA program with a concentration in Business Analytics and working a full time internship at one of the largest companies in my town. I have given the big corporate thing a chance and realize that I don't like this environment. My job is essentially supply chain analyst but with a slightly different title.

Are there any people who are doing analytics work here? I'd really appreciate any advice or insight about your experience. 

I am not a strong coder but I do have broad business knowledge, an understanding of databases, the ability to build queries and advanced Excel skills. I've looked into UpWork and it seems like there is a pretty good demand for my skill set but I've just started to dig into this.

Thanks!

edit: I am using SAS Enterprise Guide in my internship and will be taking classes in SAS and SQL coding over the next year. I should have included that in my lists of skills"
4u88e7,417,2016-07-23,"You've been in a helicopter, so you're an aviation expert!",MexicanSpaceProgram,MaliciousCompliance,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/4u88e7/youve_been_in_a_helicopter_so_youre_an_aviation/,"Hopefully this fits the parameters of the sub.  I relayed a few horror stories in the comments of [this]( https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/4tov2s/hello_is_it_me_youre_looking_for/) post, and /u/a_few_flipperbabies and /u/Timidor said they wouldn't mind hearing more, so I'll give it a whirl.

Back in my days as a consultant I worked for a small company run by a complete penny-pinching shyster of a bloke.  He thought nothing of charging $30,000 to ""write"" a marine lifting operations for someone, by getting an intern or secretary to change the logos and do a find+replace for ""Bob's Drilling"" to ""Acme Rigs"".

This led me (and a lot of my team) to have to pull some completely illegal / unethical shit, a lot of which falls under the realm of malicious compliance.

So, a drilling contractor client of ours rings the boss up.  Classic thing.  The regulator went out to their rig and found a bunch of shit wrong and they needed to fix it all yesterday or get shut down, so they ring up consultants to deal with it in a panic.  Of all the projects I worked on as a consultant, this scenario was at least 30% of the business.  My boss of course would see dollar signs, and say very soothing things to the client while bumping up our rates.

Client needs an Aviation Management Plan to cover *all* of their fixed wing and helicopter operations in the Asia-Pacific region.  Well, they didn't *need* one (frankly), my boss told them they needed one, but that's a side issue.  Boss-man basically says ""absolutely, we can do that, we've already started"".

This is where I get summoned.

""MexicanSpaceProgram, stop whatever you're doing - you're flying to KL (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) tomorrow to write an Aviation Plan.  This is a priority project with priority rates.""

""Um, yeah...sorry?"" says I.  ""I've got 15 things to do, and I've never read one of these things before, let alone written one.  If we've got the job, can't we just sub it out?""

*Translation - ""sub it out""...i.e. hire someone who actually knows what they're doing and is qualified, pay them a crappy dayrate, and collect the difference.*

""Well you worked offshore, so you've been on helicopters plenty.  Plus, no time for that, and I told the client we can do it in-house.  Kim has booked your flights.""

Retire to my office.  Punch whiteboard.  FUCK.  Call around to see if my informal network has an example of one these things I can ""reference"".  Nobody does.  Double FUCK.  Fuck shit damn christ son-of-a-whore ass pirate dog-cunt.  Have to be at airport the next day at 5.30 in the morning to be an aviation expert in front of a client.

Call my assistant (and drinking buddy) in and give her the rundown.  She says the same thing ""FUCK"".

We leave the office at 2.00 PM to have a ""planning meeting"" about this.  Planning meeting consists of beer at the pub and bitching about how fucked I am, and by extension how fucked she is.

""Wait"" she says.  ""I have an idea!"".

""Bring a shotgun to work and blame it on stress?""

""Nah, mate - is Ross still around?""

""YOU ARE LIKE JESUS BUT REAL!  Fucking genius, mate!"".

Ross is an old mate of mine that I haven't spoken to in years since he got married (3rd time) and retired (twice).  He was also a career pilot for Bristows, flew shit in the army, and has been flying longer than most blokes have been staring at tits for.  Got his number from another mate, rang him up.

""Ross, you beautiful thing!""  How the fuck are you?"".

""MexicanSpaceProgram"" he replies.  ""Been good thanks, mate - have you been drinking?"".

""Yes!"" says I.  ""How would you like to make some money?""

""Mate"" he says.  ""You know I'm retired.  I'm not going sweet fuck all for any fucking arsehole"".

""How does $600.00 a day plus costs sound?"".

""Sounds, fucking good, mate.""

We organise our little plan.  Ross will book his flights on my credit card which I will expense because it's  easier, and he will invoice me directly for the hours and be paid in cash under my separate business name and expensed as well.  Assistant to handle details with promise of promotion if she and I can pull this off.

Project goes fine.  Client is very impressed with our aviation expert.  Client also very impressed that we were able to fix everything in a very short timeframe.  Client sends letter to boss-man back in Perth saying we are Gods and will pay whatever the bill is because the other option was having their rig shutdown.

So, I fly back, Ross goes home, and I submit my expenses.  Maybe half an hour later, get called into boss-man's office.

""YOU'RE CLAIMING $600 A FUCKING *DAY* FOR PER DIEM??"" he screams. (per diem is your daily allowance for meals etc.).

""Yeah, it's all there in the account"".

""THE FUCK DID YOU DO?!  EAT TRUFFLES OUT OF ELLE MACPHERSON'S ARSEHOLE?""

""Well, it was a priority job...""

""DO YOU HAVE RECEIPTS FOR ANY OF THIS SHIT?""

""C'mon, mate - it's KL - everything's in cash - you know that, you've been around"".

""THIS IS...I DON'T EVEN...HOW DID...THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?!"".

""Mate, we charged this out at $400 an hour.  I was doing twelve hours a day.  It's nothing, and the client is happy.""

In the end:

- Ross made about three grand in cash and saved my fucking arse.

- My assistant didn't get promoted, but I got her a healthy fucking payrise, a bonus, and a kickback for meeting her billable KPIs (which I fudged from my own hours, but fuck it).

- Client was happy and we got a lot more work out of them.

- I got a ""written copy of a verbal warning"" put in my file, which I took about as seriously as I do grown men that own poodles.

**TL;DR** - boss fucks me around by telling the client I'm an expert in something I've never done before, fixed the problem by cash-in-hand, everyone happy except stupid boss.

4u8eyi,7,2016-07-23,My Theory on Pokevision,HyperCoffeePanda,TheSilphRoad,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/4u8eyi/my_theory_on_pokevision/,"So I saw some posts yesterday saying that Pokemon only show up on the map if they're already caught by someone, though this theory was debunked.

What I actually think is going on: Pokevision only scans a small radius around you. However, it takes other scans people have done in a larger radius around you and add it to your map - even though it didn't actually scan that for you, it's all info its saved.

There are two reasons I suspect this: I live in a neighborhood where I don't see very many people playing Pokemon Go, and when I scan Pokevision, I only see Pokemon near my backyard. I was curious what would happen if I slowly moved the marker around my neighborhood, and saw more Pokemon show up - but the older Pokemon that showed up before stayed on the map, even though I moved the marker away and they should seem like they were out of range of my original scan.

Another reason I suspect this is because I intern at a University and scan for Pokemon there all the time. I found it strange that, even though I work on the edge of campus, a lot of Pokemon show up in a huge range around me - but far from a uniform circle around me. All the Pokemon that show up appear to be contained inside the campus - which would be where most of the Pokemon scans would be occurring: on campus. I also realized I could see Pokemon all the way across campus, when I can't even scan for Pokemon that far away in my neighborhood (which makes me really suspect that other people's scan data is being used as well). 

Any thoughts?"
4u8ioc,8,2016-07-23,Advice on getting a CS internship while getting a non CS degree?,spivey56,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4u8ioc/advice_on_getting_a_cs_internship_while_getting_a/,"I am about to begin my Junior year at college yet have not had an internship. My school requires a 3.2 GPA to be in the CS program and mine was around a 2.7(thanks physics and calc) for a while and I could not get it to 3.2 so my advisors recommended I move to another technical major that doesn't have a GPA requirement and I would be able to still become a software developer just won't be a CS major. So I moved to Geographical Information Science, which is like mapping and topology. And I'm pursuing a minor in Computer Science. 

This year I planned on going to my school's job fair and applying everywhere and really working on some personal projects on Github, but I feel like I'm not going to get any offers. I know I have potential to get some offers in the GIS field(which I do think is interesting) but I do not see myself doing that for the rest of my career like programming. I currently know Java really well and have made some smaller projects in other languages. But I still fear if I can even make it to an interview they are going to ask me why I'm not a CS major and the fact my GPA is low is going to turn them off from me.

Does anyone have any advice in getting a CS internship without a CS major?"
4u8qte,3,2016-07-23,I feel scared saying all of this so here goes...,throwawaymidway,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4u8qte/i_feel_scared_saying_all_of_this_so_here_goes/,"My dad's got anger management issues . My mom has clinical depression. She was abused as a child by her family - she doesn't say it in words, but she's hinted at it very strongly .My big brother has clinical depression, too. He also has ADD, and Asperger's. He never graduated from college, we have no idea if he ever will.We don't know how that will bode for his career, my parents' retirements, his marriage, our family's health, etc. He totaled one car (that my mom brought him as a bday present with her own money) and wore out the run-down one my dad had planned to give me for learning. My little sister has panic attacks and migraines. I'm the middle child, watching everything fall away from the center.

I graduated from college this May - one year early - to make up for my big brother's not graduating. My parents have worked so hard - we're immigrants, I'm the first one born in the US.  I graduated on a scholarship and no debt. I've done an internship, have two more underway at the moment, have an admission for master's, and am generally regarded as ""the rock"" of the family - the one who can be counted on to attend to her duties and uphold some honor without stirring trouble. But no matter how much I try to hold things up, I keep feeling like I'm falling short on all realms.

I got addicted to some hurtful habits in high-school. It abated when I came to college. Then started again, and it got worse. I went out with some guy for a few weeks. He got too possessive for me too quickly, I felt guilty for not being as quick about it as he. Then he gloated to me about some new chick he was utterly smitten with, and filled me with all his sob-stories about his difficult love-life and his psychiatrist.Things happened. Maybe I was raped. Maybe I made it all up.  When I went to the rape sub ,counseling, my school officials and some friends, they didn't seem to think it was made up. But the more people I told, the less I believed it myself, and the more convinced I am that I'm somehow exaggerating, somehow just earning piteous consolation from others. One of my family friends who I've known since I was at least 4 and she was 5 is decent friends with him. We're not really close at all, yet for some reason that connection really vexes me. My best friend - the only one whose word I usually count on - receded because my story got overwhelming for him. I was sexually assaulted again, this time even I was sure. I'm scared to death at the prospect of my family knowing. I pray they never do.

A friend of mine started hooking up with some guy, and she kept on calling me up to tell me how amazing the sex was, and how amazing it was that he always communicates with her to make sure she's comfortable. Hearing that made me really upset and bitter. I know she told me that with good intentions probably but it made me feel incredibly lonely for some reason.

I don't feel like talking might work anymore.  Thinking about a lot of certain people makes me bitter.I don't want to go back to the rape-sub, it makes me antsier. I don't want to go to my master's program. I have so many regrets that I'm afraid will somehow be my downfall, that I'll end up nowhere. When I was a teen I used to pen incredibly angsty poems raging with indulgent creativity. I don't feel like I'm being creative anymore, this isn't a story, it's a dry, undeniable set of facts. I cry for no discernible reason, get up during the night and stay up. I feel like someone inside me is trying to get out, but is stuck, chained to my mind like a prisoner to his ball.One month, two months, 3, 4, 5, 6, a whole year, nearly 2, now...I keep trying to convince myself there's something just 'round the corner worth keeping my hopes for.

4u8xma,12,2016-07-23,[NeedAdvice] Hard worker; lazy thinker,braindrain101,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/4u8xma/needadvice_hard_worker_lazy_thinker/,"I'm essentially a mindless drone. 

Let me preface this with my background: I'm 24, and graduated with an engineering degree two years ago. Had a forced gap year due to inability to find a job in my area. Worked in assortment of part-time/casual employment during that year. I've been doing my Masters for a year now and this is where things begin to unravel due to that fatal flaw.

I'm a workhorse when it comes to things I can make into a routine or algorithm. I've been a straight A+ student in my undergrad years due to my ability to tackle course material in a brainless, mechanical fashion (and a ton of anal-retentiveness, but I digress). In my time working in retail/service, I'm always trying to make myself productive, even during downtime or times where customers are sparse. I never text or loiter during work time (I don't even have a smart phone activated). Employers have routinely praised me for this attribute. At home (yes, I am still living at home with parents), I'm proactive about doing chores - cooking, cleaning, maintenance, etc. It's the least I can do for still being a leech.

But once anything requires an iota of thoughtfulness, that's where I stop. One huge way this has manifested itself is in writing. Mechanically, my writing is fine (in my years of formal education anyways). Generating content to write has always been a problem. This has been seen in my courses (lab reports, essays), where even though I do well grade-wise, those components always took an unreasonable amount of time, compared to my peers. Of course, this aversion to writing has been one insurmountable roadblock in my job search. Whether it be applying for internships during my schooling or entry positions after graduation, forming the cover letter has always been a struggle. Oh, of course I know what to put and what not to put into a cover letter, pretty much by heart. But as always, generating that content to sell myself is what made it so difficult. As you might have expected, the number of jobs I applied to was appallingly low. It's a no-brainer that I could not find a career-launching job.

For the past year of doing my Masters, it has been going just as you might expect from someone with my background. Endless procrastination, zero life outside of studies, utterly miserable, breakdowns - you name it. Yet, somehow I still managed to scrape an outstanding performance in my coursework (must be grade inflation). However, once the real test began - the actual research, I just dropped the ball. It has been several months and I have not one page written for anything. And in that same timespan, I have not been able to get one good night's sleep. Been procrastinating on games, reddit, the ol' combo. I am about to drop out, whether it be my decision or involuntary due to lack of progress remains to be seen. And that's one major opportunity squandered. 

If I drop out, I don't know what to do with my life. I recognize that the comfort of my parent's home is enabling this, hence I plan to move out when I drop out. However, my hometown has been in a huge recession lately, so finding a job - minimum wage or otherwise, is going to be extremely difficult.  I feel that I have the perfect mentality for a labourer, not a pioneer. Looking back, it is extremely disturbing that I did not find those minimum wage jobs degrading - I've actually enjoyed them to some degree. Some days, I would find myself saying ""I'd be okay with doing this for the rest of my life."" This, of course, is a huge huge waste of my education and most importantly, my perceived ability.

Needless to say, I feel like a disappointment of epic proportions - to my parents (from my study habits you can probably guess my ethnic background), my former teachers/professors, and my friends (I was the star performer in my circle of friends). 

Yet this uncertainty and desperation has not light a fire underneath me to just do my work. I'm not getting any younger - as research has shown that the brain stops significant formation after age 25. I feel I'm nearing the end and will be stuck in a life well, well, well below my potential.

Has anyone experienced their life similarly or have anything to impart?

P.S. Sorry if the writing is incoherent. It has not been my forte as I mentioned. "
4u8yc1,2,2016-07-23,"M4F - ""Sorry Boss, your wife is a little tied up right now.""",pornandpepsi,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4u8yc1/m4f_sorry_boss_your_wife_is_a_little_tied_up/,"I know this is a pretty common sentiment from workers everywhere, but man, fuck my boss! He’s a total piece of shit, in and out of work. I mean, I’m not an intern anymore, and he still expects me to do all his errands for him! “Roberts, pick up my dry-cleaning!” “Roberts, come park my car for me!” “Roberts, the sun’s in my eyes, go up there and extinguish it for me!” Okay, I made the last one up but you get the point.  
  
Man, I’m telling you, if it wasn’t for the fact that this place pays better than any other job I could get, I would have quit long ago. Oh well, life could be worse. I do have a date planned tonight, and she seems like a lot of fun! Oh shit, my boss is calling me over. I reluctantly walk over to where he’s standing, and he looks a little frustrated. “Yes, Mr. Lewis?” I ask, knowing that’ll he’ll probably want me to do a favour for him.  
  
“Roberts, I need you to do something for me.” Called it. “It’s my wife and I’s anniversary, and she’s booked a hotel room for us. Unfortunately, I need to meet with a few clients, and it’s absolutely urgent. Now, don't tell me to call her, because I can’t waste that time. So you have to call her, understand? Let me give you her number.”  
  
I hold back the urge to grin, “Sorry sir, but my phone’s being repaired. Looks like you’ll have to ask someone else.” I try to walk away, but he grabs my shoulder. “Not so fast, son. If you can’t call her, then you’ll have to tell her in person.” He fumbles around in his pocket for a few seconds before pulling out a card. “Here’s the room key. She’s at the Blue Lion, Room 45, got it? Now hurry up and get going!”  
  
And just like that, he walks away, leaving me with the card in my hand. Sighing and mumbling, I walk out of the building and begin walking. Great, guess I have to pass on my date tonight. Did I already say fuck my boss? Because fuck my boss, fuck him to hell and back. The hotel is about an hour away, but I'll make sure to take my time, just to make sure his wife gives Mr. Lewis an extra large chewing out later.  
  
Eventually, I make it to the hotel’s front doors, and briskly walk inside. I’ve got to admit, I feel slightly underdressed, compared to some of the people here. Most of them are wearing formal attire, and there's enough gold and jewellery in this place to blind you if you stared at it too long.  
  
After I walk around some more, checking out some of the expensive looking architecture I eventually decide I’ve had enough, and just want to get back home as soon as possible. I walk up the stairs and find the right floor, getting a fair share of dirty looks from some of the staff.

Damn, this is one lavish room! The drawn curtains are made of red velvet, and the carpets are obviously made of some other expensive material I’ve never heard of. I didn’t have time to notice the rest of the architecture, as one sight took my attention away from all the others. There, lying naked on the bed, was my boss's wife! And if that wasn’t enough to make me horny, she was wearing a blindfold, and had some handcuffs and rope on the nightstand next to her.  
  
Oh my god! I remember meeting her at one of the office parties, and thinking she was beautiful, but now? She is one of the most attractive women on the planet! What should I do? Should I tell her who I am? Or, should I pay Mr. Lewis back for his years of abuse, by doing the one thing that would hurt him most, fucking his wife. My dick seems to already have convinced the rest of my body, as I begin to disrobe, and walk up to her alluring figure.  
  
Once I’m naked, I stride over to her, and place my head between her thighs. Grabbing two gentle handfuls of her ass, I pull her pussy towards my face, and begin to plant soft kisses around the edge of it. The heat from her inner thighs radiates on my face as my lips brush against the outskirts of hers. Mmm, sorry Mr. Lewis, but somebody has to take care of your wife!

Hey there Ladies of DPP! For this prompt, I'm looking for somebody to play the role of my boss's wife.

4u953g,14,2016-07-23,"[Recent Grad] Should I get a part time job while searching for a software gig? If so, what are some examples of part times that would give me enough time to practice coding and apply to jobs?",CSCareerThrowaway223,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4u953g/recent_grad_should_i_get_a_part_time_job_while/,"I'm a recent grad in Computer Science from a large state school in the midwest and having a surprising amount of trouble finding an entry level software development type of job.  It's been 3 months since I graduated and I have no real luck or good leads yet.

As for experience, I had 2 internships and plenty of school projects on: C#/.NET, ASP.net, C++/Java/OOP, Python (server scripting, networking, and plenty of assignments), HTML/CSS/Javascript/jQuery, SQL and noSQL queries/modeling/stored procedures (and tons of related Excel stuff too), Git/TFS, etc.  Both website development and desktop application development.  I am not the most amazing coder of all time, I suck at design and have zero artistic creativity admittedly, but I am personable and well spoken in real life and would like to think I am good to work with in a team.

I've applied now to 70+ places, government, small business, megacorp, academia, and everything in between.  For both web developer and software developer positions.  And that number just keeps growing every day. I usually do only about 2-3 a day, but tailor my resume keywords and cover letter if needed to each one, making the application look great.  Have had my resume reviewed and critiqued by multiple hiring managers in the IT industry, as well as friends of parents who are professionals and well into their career, the resume is professional looking and I know the keywords are getting picked up correctly.  

Most of the entry level and junior developer type of positions I am finding seem to want a lot more experience than I have (3-5 years in enterprise level software, tools that I don't have access to, etc), and I'm not sure how to gain that experience without a job.  My skills are falling behind the times as the days go on, so it's critical that I find a software job soon or my skills will become ""stale"".  Recruiters have told me that I'm competing with other recent grads from the same program that have more experience than me or are just better coders and have a ton of projects on GitHub.  Kind of scary.  It seems that having the degree doesn't matter at all and people just need a superman coder with tons of experience in all of these things I've never done.  

I have CTCI and work through that occasionally, but honestly I am usually pretty okay in technical interviews and solving hard problems. Definitely going to try to keep up with my coding speed and accuracy since I haven't worked on any big projects in a few months.  

My dad is currently supporting me, so I don't need to get a part time job, but I feel bad for not contributing and feeling unsure of what I'm doing currently (applying for jobs somewhat repetitively every day and not getting anywhere).  **Should I focus my time on applying for more development jobs and practicing my coding, or should I grab a part time job to fill in the work history gap on my resume.**  

For example, I was thinking about pizza delivery driver, since that pays decent and I have access to a reliable but old car which needs to be driven into the ground, plus would give me time to still apply to dev jobs and practice coding.  I spent quite a few hours looking at freelancing jobs on UpWork, but honestly I didn't find much there that fit me or I was just getting beat out by other candidates who probably bid for a cheaper price, felt like I was wasting time there.  Alternatively, I was thinking about looking for administrative assistant, tech support, or desk jockey type of jobs at companies where I could lateral into a software dev type of position after they see that I'm smart and skilled in software and have a degree.

I'm stuck, I'm spinning my wheels and not sure of what to do.  Halp.  "

The relationship started out great with a lot of hanging out together and a couple of dates for about 2 months. It went really slowly in terms of the physical things, but I felt really good. Then the summer came and we both went back to our home city. (this is where the long distance part starts) 

I have never been very good at keeping up long distance relationships; my previous 2 relationships ended when they entered the long distance part. But when I'm with this girl she always manages to lift my spirit with the little things that she does. Like the ways she smiled and frowned, the emojis she types and the overly used sarcastic comments that even she wouldn't remember if it was intended to be sarcastic or not. 

During the long distance part of the relationship, I got to visit her once(it's a five hour train ride) and stayed there for a few days. In which we got to hang out during the morning and afternoon, but she would always go back at 5pm to attend the dinner that her father arranged with other people. I also got to meet her parents, and later she mentioned to me that her mother thinks that I lack ambition, which I do, and this topic came up about 2 more times in the next month.

After the visit, we went back to lots of texting but not that many skyping (I should have skyped more, but I was slightly anxious about staring at her face, it's weird I know). I noticed that the relationship went downhill from there. She started texting me less and used less emojis; I was always on a weird sleeping schedule because of the lack of motivation. But I still really liked her even though I didn't show it that much. 4 days ago, she skyped me and talked about how she can't see a future in us, since I'm graduating in a year and she will still be in school for another two years after that, and she said that she was choosing between breaking up or continuing, and that she will tell me a decision soon. When I kept bugging her about it(3 times?) she said she has made the decision and wasn't going to break up. Today, she broke up with me on skype, saying that after knowing me for this long, she realized that it won't last. She thinks that we have different values and interests and that we are incompatible(the word that we used to joke about all the time). But I really thought we were compatible, and felt like it would be really difficult to find someone else more compatible than her. She then said that we should remain friends.

 Honestly I don't like myself in the summer either, it's humid and hot, and I just feel like a pile of poop lacking motivation to do anything since I didn't get a summer internship. So now I'm feeling really sad and don't know what to do, and I don't know how to talk to her anymore. I kind of want to remain friends since she is very kindhearted and friendly, I also want to get her back some how if it's possible even if it's just for another year, but also logically this seems to be the best time to break up with minimum damage done. I don't know what to do, help!


   
**tl;dr**: me and my gf were in a 5-month relationship, and she broke it off during the summer when we are in different cities. I don't know what to do."

-He (my boss) is also my friend (or at least I think he is.)
-This whole payment thing was completely under the table. No paperwork or anything, just a promise that he'd pay me twice a week when he could afford it.
-I already posted about this in /r/business, but I don't feel like I went into close enough detail, so I'm trying again.

I'm a 15 year old computer tech intern in Ohio ""interning"" for a local computer repair shop. I'll call my boss Jim. I've been working at the shop with Jim for about 1 and a half years. At the beginning of this summer he said that he would pay me around 60 bucks a week (not much, I know, but to me it's better than nothing.) Well, so far I don't have anything.

Whenever I try to discuss the issue with him, he either postpones it, cracks a joke to distract me, or simply puts his hand on his head and sighs like I'm the nexus of all his woes. From this I assumed he was just manipulative and got over it, but now I'm broke and extremely pissed. Before I was afraid to go against him in fear that it would fuck up our friendship, but now I don't care.

To sum things up, I've fixed easily over 100 PCs, flattened all of the boxes in his storage closet multiple times, gone with him on several service calls, nearly had his asshole friend throw a bar stool at me, and have taken customer support calls for him. Not a dime came out of any of that. No, I never got hurt, nor did I get threatened, but this emotional rollercoaster is starting to seriously fuck me up. Any advice is appreciated"
4u9jkb,1,2016-07-23,need advice on job.,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4u9jkb/need_advice_on_job/,"For clarification on flair: I am considering leaving this job, but wanted more advice to see if it's the right thing.

So ~4 months ago I got my first job and it ended up being the last type of job I wanted. A restaurant job. The reason I took the job is because after 6 months, what feels like 1000 applications and interviews later, I was offered the job on the spot. The work itself is jist running food, cleaning, restocking, etc. so the actual work is not all that bad.

The first couple months were ok. The last 2 months though I have dreaded going in to work and have to fight this urge to quit every day I go in. The main reason I think would be my coworkers. I would safely say more than half of them are generally bad people to put it very lightly. I get yelled at and scolded my coworkers every day for stupid reasons. They also put you down all the time. When someone works lots of overtime and works really hard the first thing you hear is ""that's nothing"". Way to make each other feel good and want to stay. Also the place is incredibly loud. We have this DJ that comes in at night when I work(I cant get any hours other than night because it's not busy during day, I tried) and he turns up his music so loud I can't hear anyone unless they are within an inch of my face. This has lead to customers yelling at me for not being able to hear them, and the same with coworkers.

I also had surgery one time and I called in work and emailed my manager multiple times saying I could not come in for medical reasons, leaving messages and so on each time. he finally responded and accused me of never contacting him earlier. To be fair though the other managers are nice.

I always countered these things with ""I'm 18, any job I get at this age will probably be just as crappy"". Recently though I have been looking into minor positions in child care or camp positions because I have some volunteer experience in those areas. At my current job I have talked to my manager and we switched some hours up to see if it would fit better with me(I admire him for that) but it's not relieving my current attitude of borderline hating my job. In addition to all this I am starting college next month and have looked into their programs with finding internships that match with my degree choice but I won't qualify for it until sophomore year.

Sorry for the long post, I just felt all this info was important. I guess it comes down to should I stick it out at my current job or find a new job?

I tried asking this questions elsewhere and the comments I got basically called me lazy and whiny, no advice on actually how to improve the situation. So please provide advice and not do what they did. I am really trying to find ways to improve things, not just complaining about them."

4u9q3k,12,2016-07-23,"How do I choose between an assured technician position with the possibility of promotion to an engineering position, or an interview for an engineering position?",blueskiddoo,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/4u9q3k/how_do_i_choose_between_an_assured_technician/,"Background: I graduated with my BS in mechanical engineering in June of last year. I moved to a city a couple states away for a six month long internship. When that ended, the company didn't have any openings, so I've been job hunting since, for the last four-ish months. During that time, my savings have gotten low and recently decided I needed to get some sort of basic job just to pay the bills.  

With that in mind, while still applying to entry-level engineering jobs, I also started applying to slightly skilled labor positions. On the engineering side, earlier this week I had a phone screen for a Jr. engineering position that went well, and they said that they would let me know next week if I would be selected for an in-person interview. However, I'm not the most qualified for the position (they wanted 1-3 years of experience in that specific field, I have .5 years of experience in a similar but different field). A few days after that, I had an in-person interview for a technician position that paid slightly above minimum wage, but promised raises soon after starting. However, during the interview the interviewer mentioned my engineering degree on my resume, and said that while he couldn't give me an engineering position now, if I worked hard and did well on the production floor, really learned the product inside and out, I could move into an engineering position. And he assured me that the company was growing quickly, they recognize hard work, and that all departments would be increasing in size. And then at the end of the interview, he offered me the technician position. I thanked him, and let him know that I was waiting to hear back from another company, and asked if I could have a week to decide and get back to him. He agreed, and thanked me for coming. 

So here's my question: How should I handle this situation? As a recent graduate with not much experience, low on money and options, I really have to make a decision here. Obviously, the manufacturing position could chose to move forward with other candidates, which would make my choice easy. But if they do want to do an in person interview, what should I do? (Keeping in mind that according to Glassdoor the interview process with this company takes about 6 weeks, and I'm still in week 1). Do I; 

1) Tell the technician position that I'm moving forward with the manufacturing position, which will probably lose me the technician position? This path seems risky because obviously if the interview doesn't go well I would end up where I started, with nothing.

2) Just go with the technician position anyways and hope for the best? The pay isn't great, and while I was promised the possibility of promotion, that's a promise at best and I can't rely on that.

So please give me what advice you can, I'm really not enjoying being in this position. I think either way I go could lead to a great career, or to things just going poorly. In hindsight I wish I had pushed the technician interview back a week to buy myself some time with the other company, but of course I didn't know that there would be the engineering possibility or that I would be offered a job in the interview. And I don't mind hard work, I've had labor jobs before and honestly I enjoy it, but at the same time I would prefer to be making 2.5 times the money and growing my engineering career."

Now, I should probably make it clear that this relationship should definitely be over. We were both immature, and it was highly toxic and I had tried to end it a few times, but she always pulled me back in. We wronged each other plenty of times, but I was blinded by the fact that she was my first ""love"" and thought the good still outweighed the bad. On top of that, I'm someone who doesn't keep a lot of people close to me and we were very, very inseparable. 

She basically slowly broke up with me via text a month ago, right before she left the country for a two month internship. In person, she told me she just needed a break, and I agreed and thought maybe down the line (6 months to a year) if we had actually learned something about treating people it might work out between us. We share a ton of common interests and for someone who was never in a close relationship, that meant a lot to me. It also caught me by surprise because we had just went on a long trip together and it went seemingly very well. 

However, while abroad, she's been telling me it won't ever work out between us no matter how long down the line, but we should stay acquaintances since we're both apart of a student organization on campus and would see each other often. I try to hit her up every now and then, to make conversation, but that never seems to work out. 

On top of this, she's moved on really quickly. She made it a point to tell me she's not looking to date anyone in the near future, but has become very close with one guy in particular (a mutual friend). She literally went from hitting me up every day, telling me she loves me, interacting constantly on social media, and made a transition in two weeks to doing that with this guy instead. She tags him in pics, likes his old pics, frequently tags him in comments the way she was literally doing with me a month ago, and either ignores me or doesn't choose to contact me. She picked up a few of his interests, and is literally following the pattern with how she was interacting with me right before we started dating to a T. 

What makes it even worse is that she had been hiding from me that she had a crush on this guy for almost the entire time her and I were dating. I was aware of it about 6-7 months in, and we agreed it was harmless, but as our relationship got worse, she told me her feelings for him got much stronger. She used to hide texts and snaps from him, lie about sitting next to him in classes, and on one occasion, went to text him and call me a dick after we had a fight (very early on). 

I'm caught in a weird position where I'm not completely over her (both because she was my first relationship and I prefer to keep only a few friends close to me), we have mutual friends, we can't be on awkward terms because of our student group (which makes blocking her out of the question for me), and how she pretty much left me like I don't exist so quickly after breaking up with someone I've known well since middle school, no less. I know I can't control what she does, and it's obviously within her right to do as she pleases, but holy shit does that suck the most. I was hoping I would at least be comforted by her being single and not interacting with a guy for a while (something she told me she wouldn't do), but nope. 

I really just need advice on moving forward with her. I'm sure the simple answer is don't look at her social media, go hook up with girls, but coming from my point of view, this was a long relationship for me and her moving on so quickly and like a total savage has made me a fucking shell of a human being. I know eventually I will move on, but I need a way to take concrete steps to make that just happen sooner for me. The longer I keep waiting and seeing this nonsense on my social media, the harder every aspect of my life is becoming. This might not be unique situation at all, but I really just needed to get it off my chest and was hoping for some words of encouragement or advice moving forward. It's really imperative that at some point in the near future, I can tolerate even looking at her. Thank you in advance.

4u9ww3,15,2016-07-23,"Kind of back and forth between a decision here, would appreciate some help!",ProjectProgramAMark,backpacking,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/4u9ww3/kind_of_back_and_forth_between_a_decision_here/,"Hey everyone. So I'm in a bit of a situation. It might not seem like much of a big deal but it's been sitting on my mind for a couple of days now and I'd like to see what other people think. I'm just going to put down the thoughts in my head, so sorry for the disorganization, and if there is any more information you feel like you need please don't hesitate to ask!

Ok, so recently I heard my friends were planning to go to Costa Rica for a couple of days. I was coincidentally considering going to Nicaragua, and so I mentioned that I'd like to tag along if they would be down to go to Nicaragua as well.

A bit of a preface, we are all 20/21 M and this is their first time traveling anywhere outside of the country pretty much, while I have been gone for months by myself to various different places, including Nicaragua. They were very excited about me coming given my prior experience and knowledge, and obviously because I'm their friend haha.

So we went and bought the tickets to Nicaragua, and they are planning to go to Costa Rica for half the trip, the trip being 10 days total.

Now here's the problem. I'm in college, and greatly overestimated what I will be getting from financial aid this year (basing it off last year stupidly, since a lot of financial change has happened in our family that I guess made me ineligible for Pell grant) and I've just received an estimate of what I'll be getting. It's enough to pay for rent and tuition, but not much else, and I won't have too much time in the upcoming semester to make much (although I do have a paid internship, but it's more make my own hours, and the hours won't be much because of the rigorous nature of the courses I'm taking in the fall). I can most definitely make it work, but the money I save from not going would help a ton as well.

Another point is, I haven't been spending much time with my family for quite a long time because of school now, and I see this as my only couple of weeks that I can dedicate a lot to them. I am the oldest sibling, with a sister of 15 and a brother that is 11, and I'm starting to feel really guilty for not being there for them often.

Yet another point is I've been trying to start a side project for a little bit, and I see this time with little to no responsibility as a great time to gain momentum for it to continue in the upcoming semester.

Now, I will only be gone for 10 days if I do decide to go, so when I come back I'll have exactly 2 more weeks of ""relaxation,"" in which I can spend time with family, get the side project started, and generally take care of things. So really the only actual thing I will be losing out on is the money, which is not entirely a make it or break it kind of thing, because I understand that money comes and goes, and I would not come back to an insanely horrible financial situation, I just would have to budget for a bit.

I've been stressed out due to summer classes hitting me a LOT harder than I expected (never had to even consider I might fail a class before, but this semester has proven to be insanely hard), and I've fallen in a bit of a mental slump. I was dreaming of the day I can head out with my friends during the middle of the semester, now I'm kind of really anxious about it since I feel like it'll just add more stress and stuff on top of things.

There is also the notion that my friends were and are expecting me to go, and I gave them my word that I'm going. I will feel really guilty if I end up bailing on them, since they kind of gave themselves peace of mind about this trip since I will be with them (they have expressed they were quite anxious about the trip but are settled because they know I'm experienced in this kind of thing).

I am from Florida, so flights to Nicaragua are relatively very cheap, so I'm losing out on $120 (haven't bought the return ticket yet) which is OK to me.

Web dev intern trying to set up barebones uptime checker,CaughtInThefly,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/4ua2gn/help_please_web_dev_intern_trying_to_set_up/,"Hey r/webdev, I am a web dev intern who is still wet behind the ears. I am having an issue setting up this repo https://github.com/iloire/watchmen#installation for an uptime checker. My boss's boss asked me to try and get an barebones uptime checker up and running. He thinks its something that is super simple, and maybe for someone who has more experience that may be true. But I am wasting my weekend banging my head against my keyboard trying to get this thing to work so I have something to show him next week. 

I am having trouble at this step:

Running and stopping watchmen

Make sure you have redis-server in your PATH. Then you can run watchmen services:

$ redis-server redis.conf
$ node run-monitor-server.js
$ node run-web-server.js

I can't seem to get it to work or set up my path correctly. I tried doing this in my vagrant on Ubuntu, but then switched to OS X since I kept running into snags. 

Or Do any of you know anything easier to setup? 
I have another post related to this here https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/4sqy7e/help_intern_searching_for_a_barebones_uptime/

Any help is greatly appreciated. 

EDIT: Thank you for your help everyone. I ended up having to bring it into one of the developers I work with. There is a redis.dev.conf that needs to be used with redis-server redis.dev.conf instead of redis-server redis.conf when working with a dev environment. The documentation doesn't quite explain that, but all of you helped me delve a little deeper into this repo. So I really appreciate yalls help.

4ua382,11,2016-07-23,"My ""boyfriend"" is causing me hurt.. I'm getting to a point where I'm having trouble dealing with it... I feel used.",Im_oRAnGE,bisexual,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/4ua382/my_boyfriend_is_causing_me_hurt_im_getting_to_a/,"This is gonna be a kinda long story, due to our pretty unique situation. Also slightly nsfw.  
Let me explain... 

A little over a year ago I (19m) met this guy (21m) on a trip to Budapest. We had mutual friends,  which is how we both ended up there together. All in all six dudes having an awesome time in a cool city. We stayed at an airbnb host, there were 3 double beds and I ended up in one with that guy. Just two heterosexual guys, no big deal right? 

Well we got along really well, talked a lot and got drunk one evening. Back in the room he started complaining about a back ache and how much he'd love a massage. After some jokes and him massaging me first I returned the favor and all was okay. A third guy chimed in actually, it all felt alright. 

Only, I've been questioning my attraction to men for a while already. After returning back home I kept in touch and met up with him at the local pub a couple times. We'd always end up massaging each other in his student dorm room. Over time I started staying longer and cuddling for a bit. Cuddling longer and more under the clothes, all while talking and talking and exchanging half our life stories. After getting comfortable one day I just admitted to him that I was very into him and that I had a crush on him. He didn't take it too well, even though we've been laying together in our underwears and I've even slept next to him a couple times. He just said he wasn't into men that way basically. 

We still kept meeting up though, and eventually one day he allowed me to blow him. We both loved it and kept doing that for a while.

Soon after, summer holidays began and we stopped seeing each other. I started soul searching and came to the conclusion I was fully bi. I fired up Tinder and met up with 2 or 3 guys, the last one was pretty cute and I had a three dates with him, pretty romantical ones with kissing at a lake and similar. I didn't really feel a connection to that guy though, I was just enjoying the experience and thought I'd maybe feel more after a couple dates. 

I still wrote and phoned with the guy from University a lot though. When he heard about the dates I've been having, he pretty much cracked down and started crying and said he didn't want to loose me. It struck me pretty hard and the feelings I had about him came rushing back. I broke it off with the Tinder guy on the same day.

During the summer and the following semester we have been meeting a lot, not quite as much as in the beginning due to me moving into a shared flat and not having the same privacy as in the student home. But still as much as possible. 

Then, in April, he boarded a flight to the US (we live in central Europe), for an 5 month long internship. 

We knew it was coming since we started seeing each other, but it was still though. We both weren't out of the closet yet and had almost no time beforehand to talk due to exams and my nosy roommates. 

We skyped, and decided it was best for us both to be able to experiment with other people during the time, as long as we talked about it. Lo and behold, I met a girl, and he started meeting with guys from Tinder and Grindr. 

Now, the trouble. The fwb relationship with the girl didn't last all that long, and I met up with a guy from Grindr I found pretty cute. It was nothing special, I drove to his house, we pretty much had netflix and chill, and I drove back home. On the way home I messaged him about it already. He was shocked. Even though he has had at that point at least 2-3 guys that he was not only messaging regularly, but who have blown him already after lots of cuddeling.. He is shocked and I guess envious. 

We talked a lot and I guess I could calm him down. But still, I felt really bad about his sudden outburst of.. Envy and distrust and idk what. He tried arguing with me that me having actual anal sex (I'm a pretty exclusive bottom)  is a lot more meaningful than his cuddling and getting blown (reminds me, he even blew one of the dudes back, something he almost never did to me!) 

There's been another really hurtful incident in the meantime, maybe I'll write about that later. But the real thing that's bothering me, is the following:

The whole thing with the trying it with other people thing we mostly did because he wanted to find out if he was actually into dudes or not. The whole time he was with me he told me he was probably just straight and only liked me so much that he didn't mind my gender. Well, turned out he actually went along with other dudes aswell and enjoyed it. Great, right? 

I asked him last week what he thought about us now. If he would like to be my actual boyfriend, I mean, we've been pretty much having a relationship the last year until he left, and even then we wrote every day, called a lot and just still got along great.

His answer? He doesn't know, he hasn't thought about it, he's got so much work and, what would his parents say? Just lots and lots of excuses and so on. I was pretty devastated by his answer. We've been talking the whole day about what we'd do once he came back, how often we could see each other, how he'd love to meet my parents, and so on. I was sure he'd just say ""yea why not"" or something similar. 

I reckoned I'd give him a couple days to think about it. If he really liked me, he wouldn't need so much time, right? 

And now he's just been pushing it on and on. He's met a guy pretty much every day this week. He also has to finish his thesis in a couple weeks, which he barely even started. I often stayed up way in the morning to be able to talk to him about his dates and his work. Often until 5am or so. I'm just glad I've got free time right now, my sleep schedule is messed up to no end. 

Today is Saturday. He slept in, which I can understand. After waking up we talked a bit about his date yesterday and how he'd work on his thesis.  
Two hours later he sends me a picture where he's still in bed. He's just been wasting so much time. It's like 4pm already, and he has done nothing so far. I tell him to finally start working, when he sends me a screenshot from the guy he met yesterday. I know they only went on a walk yesterday because they had no private place. Well, apparently that guy now had his home to himself for a couple of hours. 

Now, instead of working on his thesis, he decided to drive there, probably to fuck him. I just got angry at that point. I asked if he has spent any time thinking about US over the last couple of days. His only response was ""not now."" and now he's not even looking at my texts anymore.

I don't often write here. But I'm feeling like I'm loosing the connection to probably the most important person in my life. My sister had been telling me to get over him for a while, but I've been ignoring it. I'm still so in love with that person, and he's often shown me the same affection back. But lately I don't know anymore, it feels like I'm getting used.. He likes me, but just wants to keep me around until some girl comes around that he can actually marry in this damn country and make his parents proud. That's what this whole thing is starting to feel like. 

I just don't know what to do right now.. It's so hard, I'm feeling so lost. I miss him so much. This distance is killing me, killing us. I just want him to come back and be my friend..."

I was wondering if anyone had good advice on where me and a friend could find apartments in our price range.

We are looking to stay under $1000-$1200 for two bedrooms. She attends DePaul and I have an internship in Lincoln Park by West DePaul so we would want something accessible to the CTA to get to our respective obligations.
We are leaning towards a Sep. 1 move in date. 

I understand walking neighborhoods is the best option but which neighborhoods?? Any advice? Or any leads you have seen recently? Thank you!!

4uaopy,63,2016-07-23,I recently completed an internship helping out kids in AP Computer Science. Here is a game programming tutorial video series in java for people at that level!,deery50,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/4uaopy/i_recently_completed_an_internship_helping_out/,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDzKX3djE-M

Info:

I recently completed an internship helping out an AP Computer Science class in high school and I learned a lot about what level of programming they are at. This series is made for someone who is at that level or has had some other kind of equivalent introduction to java. This game programming tutorial is not made to teach you java but is made to teach you game design and some different programming practices involved with game design....and java along the way.

I decided to upload all of the lessons I had so far into one video and then for anybody who cares about them, I can upload more of whatever they want. So be sure to comment on the video if you actually go through this! It would be awesome if you could recommend this to your friends who want to get into game dev but don't quite know where to start!

If you have already had any decent level of experience with game dev/made a complete game before then this is definitely not for you btw! This is for people who are just getting into the practice after any basic java course/introduction."

What shall I do?",The__Hans,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4ub17q/in_the_home_for_the_elderly_next_to_our_house/,"The lady does not scream all the time. Not even every day I think but I’m not sure. Sometimes she asks for help very loud for hours. Tonight she is just scream ""ahhh"" and sounds like she has pain or just suffers in a way. There is another man who is screaming a lot but he sounds rather funny but not so sad.

Once I went over to the retirement and aksed them if they know about the lady screaming. They said they are aware of the situation and find it sweet that I care about the woman. She is suffering from dementia, has been to the hospital recently and has difficulties to realign. They know about her. They can not do very much about her. I left then.

I once made an internship in a retirement home when I was 13 for three weeks. I know this a very hard job and the team is often unde-staffed. But even if everything with body of the woman is okay it appears to me that she feel scared or is suffering. I don’t know what do about it. 

* Should I insist they should check more often for her and take her serious? 
* Shall I offer my help? Should I ask if I can visit her once or a regular basis?
* Maybe she has relatives. Can I contact them?

Does it sound like negligence to you? Or is it the sad but inevitable face of dementia?"

WHEREAS the Legislature finds that the Supreme Court of the United States did say in *Tinker v. Des Moines* students do not “shed their constitutional rights...at the schoolhouse gate,” yet, while some of these rights have been proceduralized by the courts and in legislation such as The Higher Education Opportunity Act (Pub.L 110-315) and The Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Pub.L. 88–352), the Southern State lacks a comprehensive code enumerating the rights of students;

WHEREAS the Legislature finds that, while many of the rights of students may be enumerated or codified, be it by statute or precedent, these rights are typically prescribed to students of higher education, and that secondary students at the middle school and high school levels lack these rights affirmatively;

WHEREAS the Legislature finds that often the only viable approach to affirmation of the rights of students is litigation, which, for many students, is too costly or time-consuming to pursue;

WHEREAS the Legislature finds that disparities in the liberties of students persists throughout the publicly-funded secondary schools of the State, and that the existence of such disparities undermines the mission of public education, prevents the optimum use of all educational resources, interferes with the regular, day-to-day education of students for the prosecution of victimless crimes, burdens teachers, students, and administrators with undue ambiguity of the rights of students and the stress of conformity to non-necessitated restrictions on students, causes material and substantial disruption to students’ lives both in the classroom and in their daily lives, spreads and further perpetuates such disparities in all schools, and deprives students of equal protections on the basis of age in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution;

WHEREAS the Legislature finds that affirming, enumerating, and actively protecting the rights of students in full would have positive effects, including providing a solution to problems in the educational system created by enforcement of unfair rules, deprivation of civil liberties within public schools, and inequality in the opportunities of students, substantially increasing the student achievement, thereby granting greater merit to American schools, and ensuring equal protections under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution,

4ub7ja,4,2016-07-23,What can I do to make sure I have success in my 30s?,forceholy,datingoverthirty,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/4ub7ja/what_can_i_do_to_make_sure_i_have_success_in_my/,"I am a 27 year old man living in LA. I am writing to you guys for advice on how I can ensure that my 30s don't end up like my teen years and 20s did. 

So I don't have a lot of experience dating. I've only dated two people in my life, and the longest relationship I've had only lasted about a month. Both of these relationships I sort of stumbled into. Aside from that, I've never really dated in my High School and Community College years. When I finally transferred to a four-year university, I thought this would be a breakthrough in my dating life. Finally, after living in a boring suburb in the middle of the California desert, I would be around lots of young people who might not mind seeing people. Sure, I might have been a bit older than the average age (I transferred at the age of 25, it's a long story), but if both parties are willing, then what's the problem?

Unfortunately, college was pretty lackluster in regards to my romantic life. Sure, I kicked a lot of academic ass, made friends with my roommates and other students, joined clubs related to my interest, and volunteered and got some internships for my resume, but I still feel that I missed out on the ""wild and free"" years that one experiences in their late teens to mid 20s. Besides, being older and still attending college of made me just shut down in regards to dating college students. This is because I believe dating women in their early 20s as a dude who is several years older than that is fucking creepy, no matter how willing both parties are. It also didn't help that I was called ugly to my face by several women during my time there. So I pretty much spent college getting used to my hand.

So now I'm stuck in some sort of dating limbo. Back home, most of my friends my age have fallen to the sirens call of suburban living and are getting married and having kids. It's so strange seeing someone who was racking up notches and enjoying the single life, swearing up and down that they will never marry or have kids all of the sudden have a wedding registry and show off their ultrasounds on Facebook. I have no ill will towards my married/expecting friends and I wish them the best of luck in married and family life. That being said, I can't help but feel jealous of them. They got to enjoy their youth, they got to sleep around and gain fun stories and, more importantly, they got to learn from their experiences so they could meet the person they will spend the rest of their lives in. I'm just jealous and depressed I missed out on that.

I know nobody owes anyone anything and I know missing out on casual sex in my youth is entirely my fault. I've gone on a self-improvement kick lately: I've been working out, looking for a better job, trying to learn the guitar, attending therapy, and just trying to improve my standing. However, there are times where I feel like all this is in vain. What is the point of trying to improve myself when the time for no strings attached dating has passed? I'm too old for the club and bar scene and I know that I'm too ugly and chubby for Tinder. Dating has bigger stakes at this age; people aren't looking for fun at this point, they're looking for something serious. Unfortunately, I don't have the experience to follow through with that. Even then, if I have all my shit together, it's still a losing effort since I'm too old to experience casual sex. This is the stage in life where you're supposed to get serious about your love life and show what you learned with, ideally, 10-15 of dating and sexual experience. Since I don't have that, I don't stand a chance. Besides, what ambitious woman living in a large Metropolitan area is gonna want to get with some dude who just graduated in his mid 30s with very limited romantic experience?

So my options are: 1) Build myself up and try my hand in the shark tank known as dating in urban cities, where the first rule is ""There's always Someone better"", 2) Build myself up and hope that I'm noticed by women coming off their inevitable divorces into my 30s, or 3) Accept that I'll be alone for the rest of my life, adopt a few dogs, and become the guy version of a cat lady. 

I dunno, I'm just rambling at this point. When I read this forum, it looks like your sexual and romantic life gets better as you get older, but I have a hard time believing that. There no way a better life would have happened without years and years of having your heart broken, of being in relationships, and of casual encounters to sharpen your sexual skill. 

**TL;DR:**Missed out on young romantic and sexual experiences, jealous of friends getting married, feel like self improvement is pointless at this point, need help."
4ubeqk,1,2016-07-23,Confused with IRS withholding calculator for deciding how many allowances to put on W4,civeng1741,tax,https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/4ubeqk/confused_with_irs_withholding_calculator_for/,"Heres my situation: I am going in to my 4th year of college and recently started an internship. I've never filled out a W4 before so when i had to fill it out to start working I ended up claiming 1 allowance. As of right now they take out 148$ of my $826 bi weekly check. I felt like it was a lot since i might only be working 5 months out of the year and wanted to see if i can avoid getting a small refund next year and get the money now. 

I used this calculator: https://apps.irs.gov/app/withholdingcalculator/

And the results say that i have an anticipated income tax of $622 and if I dont change my current withholding arrangement I will have $1823 withheld for 2016. My overpayment will be $1201 when filing my return. It states that if i want my withholding to be closer to anticipated tax to claim 1 allowance and check the single box. 

When i filled out my W4 that is exactly what I had. I should also mention that I will be receiving $12000 in grants and spend  about $7000 in school fees. Am I paying the right amount of taxes or can I change my allowances to get less taken out of my check?"

We agreed on an open relationship for the summer because of the time and distance apart, and we're both completely OK with seeing other people while we're apart. 

When we parted for the summer I didn't expect to hear from him all too much because we decided to do our own thing, but we texted almost every day for weeks with him initiating most of the conversations. The first part of the summer we each did some traveling, and somehow we were actually able to meet up for a couple days. It was a great time together and we both felt closer at the end. Saying goodbye was definitely harder but we kept texting almost every day (to my surprise again). 

Now, he's at an internship in London that keeps him busy, plus the company he's working for is known to be involved with the party scene, so he goes out quite a bit. For a little over a week we didn't talk but was understandable because we're both working and enjoying the summer. Then he initiated a conversation, read my replies, but didn't respond for a couple days. I sort of called him out on not replying and he seemed caught off guard and kinda annoyed at this. I apologized and asked how he was doing, but didn't hear back. The next day I texted him again and he said he was really busy. However, I know he's using other social media. 

A couple of days later there was an unfortunate accident where I honest to God accidentally liked a new picture of him and a bunch of girls on Facebook. I took back the like immediately but I'm not sure if he saw it. Like I said, I'm OK with him seeing other people, but I don't want him to think I liked it out of spite. After a few more days of not talking, it was my birthday. He knew it was my birthday and definitely saw it on Facebook, but didn't say anything. This hurt more than I thought it would. Another 10 days later and still nothing, but he's been posting on social media.

So now what? Do I say nothing? Do I text him? Did I seem too clingy and pushed him away? We won't be back in the same city for another 7 weeks, and he left some stuff at my apartment so I know I'll have to see him again. Do I wait until the end of the summer to say something? I truly care about him and our relationship, but where do I go from here?"

I graduated from UCI in June of 2015 with a BS in Computer Science with a 3.39 GPA. (I finished the degree in 3 years) 

**Experience**

* I currently work at AT&amp;T as a Software Engineeron their Recommendation Engine.

* Before that I had interned for 3 months at Thales Avionics as a Software Engineering Intern, where I spear-headed the re-design of their data transformation pipelines to use a full distributed Hadoop cluster

* During my university career I worked for 2 years as the Lead Desktop Support Staff, managing the deployment and maintenance of campus-wide computers. 

**Senior Projects**

* A Netflix-like e-comerce web application, Fabflix, where users could create profiles, purchase movies, and browse a manually curated catalogue of over 5000 films.

* A course notes sharing platform, NoteShare, where authenticated students and faculty could create profiles and online class rooms for students to share class notes and have an informal forum to help plan and coordinate study sessions and homework help. 

I have unfortunately have not had the chance to take other courses at Coursera or Udacity, if that is a important factor, though I have expanded my skill set through the completion of several Lynda.com courses.

In terms of letters of Recommendation, I am not in touch with my core professors or my former colleagues though my instructor for my Senior Project (the e-comerce website) has graciously agreed to write a letter of recommendation for me. 

Also what are they looking for in the background and SOP. As in, what is the prompt or what are we trying to convey to them via it? Should I go in to technical detail about my previous work and projects or are they looking for something more aligned with me describing my passion about Computer Science?

Also I know the deadline is in September am I fine if I turn in my application by next weekend? And the people recommending me have until Sept to turn them in right? Should I put that I am interested in pursuing a Ph.D.? even though this is not a research/thesis based program?

Some of my key university courses:
Design and Analysis of Algorithms (CS 161)
Network Systems (EECS 148)
Information Retrieval and Data Mining (CS 121)
Machine Learning and Data Mining (CS 178)
Project in Databases and Web Applications (CS 122B)
Principles in Operating Systems (CS 143A)
Concept Programming Languages (CS 141)
Principles in System Design (ICS 53)

4ubwzy,9,2016-07-24,"Graduated, can't find a job in finance, and now I don't know what to do.",yxkns,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/4ubwzy/graduated_cant_find_a_job_in_finance_and_now_i/,"I'm a recently graduated business admin and finance graduate from a fairly decent state school. I completed my degree hoping to somehow break into the finance field or work in consulting. During my schooling I made significant effort to show my interest by contributing in a lot of extracurricular finance activities, competitions, and by networking.

Most finance and consulting jobs are elite, incredibly competitive, and have a time table for hiring. After applying for a bunch of jobs I started feeling like I'll never get anywhere close to the type of job I'd be interested in.

How it usually works for people entering the field is...assuming you have a high GPA, are incredibly accomplished, and happen to go to a target school for these fields you will get an internship. By target school I mean your Ivys and highly ranked business schools. Firms will only hire interns from these schools they have agreements with. Usually during your junior year you get hired on for an internship, do well, and get a fulltime offer. I attended a state school and couldn't get an internship during my junior year despite sending out a high amount of applications. During my senior year I worked on a lot of projects, cases, and my schools fund to be more impressive. Now I graduated and I can't find a job. I've applied for almost anything.

Any non finance but business related job looks at my resume, they're impressed by everything but turn me down because they think I'm either overqualified, not TRULY interested because ""it's obvious you're passionate about capital markets/finance and not this"" or they often think I'm just looking for a first job using the job as a stepping stone and will leave in 6 months. This has happened no matter how much interest I've displayed in interviews.

It's been 8 months since I've graduated and I feel my degree is completely useless and a paperweight. I'm of humble means, have been struggling and poor for YEARS and I was hoping this would improve my life. 

I hear nothing from finance/consulting type jobs due to how competitive they are. I've tried e-mailing people to network, applying, and everything I could. It's never worked. Most would say, ""Contact alumni"" but if you go to a non target your network is mostly non existent for these fields. Basically alumni hire alumni and keep the ""plebes"" out. I recently applied to a job and the HR manager straight up told me the head of the department I was applying for was looking for ""people with more of an Ivy League background."" Apparently my degree isn't worth the same.

Most recommendations to get into these fields if you're stuck is to get an MBA. Ok no problem, I can study the GMAT try to get an MBA. But that just leads to MORE problems. To get into MBA programs that hires for these sort of jobs you must again, go to an MBA target school. To have a shot with MBA programs you must work for at least two years and do something impressive or have a decent leadership job, I can't even get a regular job. You can't work at some no name place and go to a top banking target school. The schools are just as competitive as the jobs. So not only am I locked from finance jobs, I'm locked out of any future because I'll never get into any MBA program without a decent job. I can't get a job because I didn't attend a target, I can't go to a target because they won't let me in without a good job. It feels like the industry does its best to keep anyone else but the elite Ivy League type out. 

On top of that it's been months since I've done finance related things and I'm scared I'll slowly lose all my modeling skills and finance knowledge..it's happening to me. I'm at my wits end. I'm frustrated. I don't know what to do. I'm interning at a place right now doing telemarketing calls for FREE. It's brainless, depressing, and terrible. I pay my last few hundred dollars in gas to go to an unpaid internship that's useless to me.

I'm stuck. I'm broke. I lay awake at night till the sun rises reading about these jobs I'll never have, feeling anxiety, feeling inferior, feeling like there's no way out. There's always more hoops to jump, ""if you just get a CFA, if you just get an MBA, if you just score at the 97th percentile on the GMAT""

 I'm 25 and I'm getting old and losing the time window for these jobs being possible for me. I've been broke for years and I want to start my life. I feel like I've wasted my life. Like perhaps I should have majored in aeroforce engineering or software engineering something more technical.

 I have no idea what to do next from here. I'm willing to try other careers or jobs but I don't know where to go. Not being allowed to be part of the field you thought you were passionate about is heartbreaking and I'm becoming resentful towards the field.

I need an internship but they only hire juniors, seniors, or people in school. So I'm locked out of internships, jobs, and a target MBA program. Wtf am I supposed to do???

I'm willing to get into other fields but I don't know where I can go. Someone please advise me on what I should do next?"

Details inside.",Hramyzn,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4uc2k1/i_currently_hate_college_education_and_feel_like/,"Hello, here is a detailed version of my problems.

I've always been interested in IT and have been relatively good at it. I'm mainly talking about web and desktop development. But at the same time, I suck at high level math... *hard*. Being the genious that I am ^/s, I decided to study computer science at university and got in easily due to entrance exams being a choice between math or IT tests (and naturally, choosing IT). Remember how I said that I suck at math? Yeah...

The problem right now is, that the IT part of my education is currently below my level, while I can't handle the math at all. This leads to me being unable to improve my IT skills because: 

1) All I do in college is retread what I already know when it comes to IT.

2) I can't improve my IT skills outside of college because I have to focus so much on math (and despite that, end up stressing about it and failing the math exams).

I'm currently at a point where education is holding me back.

All in all, I'd quit college in a heartbeat and apply for internship or whatever at a company. Working for free to gain knowledge and experience would be no problem for me, but when you live in a country with a 44% unemployment rate, nobody will hire someone who needs training while there's a professional with 20 years of experience waiting to fill in that job. If there is no such person, there is always at least someone with a college degree.

So, does anyone have any idea on what to do?"
4uc3yx,2,2016-07-24,(US) 22 y/o new grad. moving for a job and i want a new car,trowewehe,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4uc3yx/us_22_yo_new_grad_moving_for_a_job_and_i_want_a/,"starting work as a software engineer in CA.  i have no debt (thanks mom and dad) and ~$17k in savings  from previous internships.  moving expenses will hopefully be covered by my $5k relocation stipend.  monthly take home (after 401k/taxes) will be ~$3.6k.  monthly expenses pre car payments/car insurance  are projected to be ~$2.2k(annual/irregular expenses also factored into this number).  looking at a 2016 civic, and the specific trim i want would cost $22k after taxes/fees.  insurance for the civic is $120 and depending on the down payment/APR, monthly payments over 5 years would be $300-$400.  this brings total expenses up to ~$2.6k/2.7k, so i'd be saving ~$900/$1k each month

&amp;nbsp;

on paper... i feel like i can afford it.  can i?  and even if i can afford it... is it a reasonable purchase?  22k is a lot of money to be spending on a car, especially before my career has even started

&amp;nbsp;

i want a new car because i will be moving to an unfamiliar area and i would like to minimize uncertainty (especially when it comes to transportation).  i don't like the slightly used/CPO route because for japanese cars the price difference between slightly used and new is minuscule.  there are new cars that are up to $5k cheaper, but getting any of those cars would mean sacrificing something (reliability, power for merging/passing, handling, features/luxuries) and i feel that if i am going to be spending money of this magnitude on something that i will be using for a while, it should be on something that i will be happy with."
4uchev,1,2016-07-24,New Associate in firm...social improvement tips for to consider while i grow?,AccountingGeek,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/4uchev/new_associate_in_firmsocial_improvement_tips_for/,"Starting in a CPA firm in January as an associate. I won't have much of a life during January-January(2018) because tax season &amp; CPA Exam.

I have identified a few key weaknesses and fears and was hoping for some tips. I worked as an intern previously at this company.

1. Awkward employees....some are awkward like me. Not wanting to say Hello first/at all. Walking by as if they are too in thought to notice you. I'm sure its not an arrogance thing, just a social thing. 

1a. I'm also sorta bad at this. I feel like if I don't say hello to someone first thing when showing up to work that I can't say it at all for the rest of the day. This can't be right because I feel weird as hell.

2. Interacting with new faces. We often have audit folk who are usually out of the office come in. I don't really know them or how to make conversation with them. These guys are usually quite conversational but are likely to duck out at the first sign of quietness. Best way to take these new faces head-on and begin establishing a relationship?

2a. Establishing relationships with everyone besides who I am working on a project with.

3. Mingling....How do people do this? How do you break into conversation groups? How do you jump from one person to another? Sometimes I feel like I have to stand and look at the side of someones head until they notice me and then do some really weird handshake introduction(if they are new to me). Either way I'm not very graceful here.

4. Making my way to the ""inner"" table. I say this because it is a rule of thumb that the person who radiates the most conversation sits in the midde(inner) parts of table. It is an unspoken rule and can be totally noticeable when large groups of us are together. Who do I become more conversational? I frequently find myself listening to others and then never contributing to anything they say or the conversation in any meaningful way because Nothing ever comes to minds, just finding there words come and go until I get lost in thought on something else. After a while conversations go on and I have no idea what the discussion is.

Finally, getting to know people. I have found out by now that conversation (and perhaps relationships too) depends on getting to know people better. In fact, I would say this is the second most important skill after a graceful approach. That being said, without being some awkward-bot....how do I go about this? 

Sorry for the huge post. And thank you!"
4ucu9o,4,2016-07-24,Finding Internship Opportunities,CyanideJay,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ucu9o/finding_internship_opportunities/,"I'm rather new into the field, I spent a large stint in the military that took me out of the IT field (I was previously in Networking and Help Desk specialities).

I'm currently enrolled in University through Penn State, but I live in between the Cincinnati and Indianapolis areas.  Recently I have been looking for something Entry level or with Intern work to develop experience to be able to go after the jobs that are typically posted on the job boards that seek 2+ years of experience (Which seems to be almost all of them.)  

The struggle that I'm running into is finding those entry level/internship opportunities as it seems that the market is very heavy for experienced work, but not so much for work for someone who doesn't actually have resident/hired job experience doing any type of coding.  I have just recently started to get going on Github as I actually didn't even know of that community until just recently.

The biggest problem I've had with finding an opportunity for internship through my university has been that the majority (almost all) of their internship opportunities that fit for developers are inside of PA itself, while I'm living in the Ohio/Indiana area and looking to get the ball rolling.  

The majority of my coding experience for web platforms is through PHP and MSSQL/MYSQL.  I have begun to learn and develop a skillset in C# as I was looking to transition over to become an application developer.  Am I making a mistake by looking for Application stuff, and should I go back to searching for Web Development, and if so what should I be looking into to become more current/caught up in that facet.

Thank you guys a bunch as I know the community here is very patient."

4ud1p3,6,2016-07-24,A note of encouragement for people starting Engineering later or those thinking they may not be smart enough.,SneakiusBritius,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4ud1p3/a_note_of_encouragement_for_people_starting/,"Hi guys! I thought I'd give a little background on myself, I'm from a small fishing town in the UK and while I was seen as in the ""Likely to be successful group"" in school, my grades were mixed. (3 A's, 3 B's 3 C's for GCSE's) my 1st year in College was mixed too, my first A-level exams consisted of a D, C and 2 B's in the first Semester and while improved slightly in second it really knocked my confidence as I was always bigged up to be better than I was apparently performing. My mother kicked my arse and said I was being short sighted and that I either get my act together or she's cutting the plug on my computer. She always did know where to threaten. So for the next year I essentially repeated all my exams and carried on with my second year A-levels at the same time. I managed, and pulled my grades up to something more respectable. (A in computing and 2 B's for maths and physics)

I took a chemistry apprenticeship with the lure being I could get a full degree and graduate without paying a single penny towards any tuition. 3 years later a little jaded with chemistry and at the end of my contract I decided to go to university full time to study Mechatronics and Robotics. I was reserved about it, I hadn't practiced A-levels in 3 years apart from my 1st year level chemistry. 

My first in-semester test for engineering maths I scored something like 40% and it really took me back. ""What sort of engineer can't do maths?"" So I doubled down and practiced, looking at the recommended books that were available in the library, relearning principles I understood 3 years ago, and applying the same ethos to my other modules to get ahead of the curve. At the end of my first semester exams, I had some promising results, with an 80% mark for my engineering maths module. The struggle however didn't end there, as 2nd semester I felt modules rolled up their sleeves and increased the pace. I was back to having doubts if I could really complete this degree. I steeled my resolve again and got back to it. I also bought a book called ""The Now habit"" as my biggest weakness was procrastination, that helped me to manage my time and get into good habits which helped **Big. Time.** 

Finally this year my efforts have payed off as I ended my first year with an overall 1st which will put me in an excellent position for summer internships after my second year! 

The message I'm conveying here is it doesn't matter if you have been out of the loop for a little while  or your confidence isn't at the highest levels, as long as you are determined this is what you want to do and you put in effort and ask help any time you need it. You will get there.

However it is also important that you review your successes to see any stumble you had along the way to make sure they still don't trip you up in the future! Mine was note taking, good notes that you can understand will honestly save you heaps of time and give you the fastest route to remembering something that was fuzzy in your head, and I believe it will only happen more often as you progress through your years of study.

So, I'll leave you with a saying my basketball coach said that always stuck with me ""Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard"", So get your head down, work hard! Reward yourself with that hard work though, so you always remember what you are doing it for!"

Refers to Bernie as ""the insurgency"" https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/4861

There is also one about sending a fruit basket to a DNC colleague in the hospital ""make it a $50 one, only worked for us for a year""

Also just for fun, search for Pablo, the guy is totally disruptive and pretty cool, and it is funny to read his career trajectory at the DNC and all the witchy remarks about him near the end by his colleagues

Admitting to closing polling places in RI, govenor is ""one of us"" and we need to ""cover ourselves""

Kind of colluding on the Sanders NV violence narrative: ."" Is it helpful for us to start putting out state party chairs who can talk about how peaceful their conventions are and that Nevada was an anomaly, or is that counterproductive? "" ""Lets Leave it alone""https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/13003

Everything on the Hillary Victory Fund is super shady. Also they are coordinating with Hillary campaign to get the same story for a politico story https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/7343

Ragging on a ton of LGBT Donors and hosts, one ex: ""Host Bill Jacobs. This event turned out to be a vanity project for Bill Jacobs . However, this event also encouraged Bill to pledge 66,400."" Search for LGBT Exit Memo -- it is an attchament, really juicy

Search for the attachment Millenial Outreach to see how out of touch the DNC is with anyone under 50

One nice thing: Politifact actual does what they say they do and are actually researching and reporting things unbiasedly to get at the truth

DNC doesnt ""have fully bilingual staff who can write in Spanish, and no budget for translations."" Guess that is why Kaine is so needed https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/12735

On a MSNBC story called "" Bernie Sanders faces a ‘then what’ problem"" DWS asks ""This is a good story. Did we get them the info near the bottom?"" Her Press Director responds ""Yes, and Hilary sent part of that."" https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/11712

I am currently doing an internship overseas and will be returning back to the US in 10 days. To reward/spoil myself I am building my first PC (http://pcpartpicker.com/list/kdGf9W) and am hoping to have all the parts at home soon after I arrive.

**Question**
About a week ago I picked up the Sapphire Radeon R9 Fury for $275 (newegg deal), but I think it is overkill for my current build. I can't afford to switch much up on my build, so my question is.. Do I keep the fury and let it run without reaching its full potential? Or do I see the fury, maybe make a few dollars, and buy an aftermarket 480? 

**Reasons to keep the fury**
1. I don't know if I could actually make any money off it/where I would sell it
2. During holidays I might be able to purchase a new monitor and actually use the fury 

**Reasons to switch**
1. As a college student, saving any dollar counts
2. I don't know how soon I will be able to upgrade my system, and I have heard the 480s are solid for future proofing

Scott Lang was a career criminal and a father to Cassie Lang. When Cassie had a heart condition that threatened her life,Scott stole the Ant-Man gear from Hank Pym to rescue Dr.Erica Sondheim from Darren Cross so she could save her. The suit allows Scott to use Pym Particle to alter his size and talk to ants. Pym was so impressed by Lang's skill and use of the suit that he let him keep it. Since then Scott Lang has been Ant-man and member of teams such as the Avengers and the Fantastic Four, started up a small business, and is currently in jail...again.

However, when I came home to visit them they said I looked disgustingly fatter than the last time they saw me a couple months ago. They keep thinking that it's the medication because there's a common theory that it causes weight gain but I've been told by my doctor that it's a myth. I personally believe I gained weight because my work does catered meals twice a week and I eat out with my friends once a week, and I am a software developer intern so my job is mostly sitting down. I do go to the gym 3 times a week but I know that's not a lot. I told my parents that since there is no proof anywhere that taking a break from this medication would be beneficial, I didn't see why I had to stop taking it. I asked them to show me evidence from studies and they said doctors can be wrong and studies are ""meaningless"". I grew up being controlled by them, whenever I didn't do something my mom wanted she would throw a tantrum and threaten me until she got her way, so this time I didn't want to do that anymore since I'm 21 and I am capable of making my own decisions. 

I told my parents that I would try to exercise more and start eating clean and that if after a month or two my weight still increases, then I would consider their advice. They accepted it last night but today for some reason they are angry again. We got into an argument and my mom was asking how I could be so cold to my parents who raised me and I said I had to stop being naive and weak after the way they treated me in high school (never cared about what I did, never came to my concerts and said anything aside from grades was a waste of time. Also dismissed it when I told them twice that I was depressed and said it was my fault). The argument ended with my dad exploding and yelling that I treat my parents like shit and I am garbage and that he will no longer recognize me as his daughter. 

I don't really know what to do now...I am going back to school but did I really step out of line? I just didn't want to be forced into anything for once and I tried to reason with them but it didn't work.."

I had to go for an internship and before we left, we talked about how this would affect us. I love this girl so much and she told me she thought I was the one for her (I know, it's really soon) but recently things have changed a lot. I grew to hate where I was staying and soon hated the job i was working at. I never made any real friends and I soon made the mistake of relying to much on her to make me feel better. I have fallen into a deep depression and after some talks we had over this, she basically told me she wants to be there for me but doesn't think it's fair to put so much pressure on her. First off, I want to say she is right. I relied too much on her making me happy, but our communication has changed so much. It's as though she doesn't need to hear from me at all. I want to be there for her and make her happy, but it's just so hard when I can't even talk to her anymore. I'm too nervous to contact her because I don't want to bother her. I think I'm losing her over my depression and even though I finally get to see her in less than 2 weeks, I feel as though im farther apart from her than ever. I can't help but shake this feeling that she is scared to break my heart, but I don't want to bring it up cause I don't want to push her any farther away than she alwlready is. I have talked to her about getting through this but I can ear it in her voice that she is tired of it and wants it to end. She told.me she wants to be there for me and she still loves me, so why can't I get this feeling out that I have lost her?

If you were a stupid bastard like me and didn't do a STEM degree (Don't worry I know where my life went wrong) it just seems like the professional/semi-professional working world wants nothing to do with you.

So my question is this, those of you out there with non-STEM degrees that have been progressing with life in the last few years, how have you done it? have you gotten top up qualifications? internships? postgrads?

Any answer apart from 'do another degree' (too expensive, takes too much time) is greatly appreciated.  

edit: thanks all for the suggestions, you guys have given some great advice and I feel a lot better than I did when made this post out of frustration earlier."
4uea44,16,2016-07-24,Me [22M] with my girlfriend [22F] of 10 months. She wants to be in the armed forces after college and I don't want to live in that lifestyle.,throwaway1892526,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4uea44/me_22m_with_my_girlfriend_22f_of_10_months_she/,"I [22M] and my girlfriend [22F] are looking at vastly different lifestyles after college. We both have two semesters left and we’re trying to figure out our plans together after we graduate. Her whole family has been in the armed forces, including her father, her brother, both her grandfathers, and many of her aunts and uncles. I don’t know what her childhood was like, but I can imagine there was a lot of pressure for her to live up to her family’s expectations and also serve. She’s been involved in an officer program while in college which involves her signing a contract that would either be four and a half or over ten years after she graduates, during which time she would be active duty and would be obligated to go wherever she is stationed. I’m not at all interested in that lifestyle and from the outside looking in it almost always seems like people, especially families, are miserable in the armed forces. I’ve spent a lot of time with her family, many of which are veterans or currently active duty. All the veterans and their families seem emotionally distant or burned out and I don’t want that for her or me. On top of that, one of her sibling is also in the armed forces. Every time they video chat he seems exhausted and miserable. I have tried talking to my girlfriend about my concerns, but she seems blinded to anything bad about the military, or just insists that it’s part of the job and is worth it. 


A few weeks ago she brought up the shorter contract as an option for her (going in she was planning on signing the ten and a half year contract, but she brought up the four year contract because she started to understand how I didn’t want to live in that life). If she signs a ten year contract she’ll be a pilot, which is something she won’t be able to do with a shorter contract, however, I would be able to deal with a four year service much easier than a ten year service, especially since I would have to put off my dreams in order for her to follow hers. Before her summer program we had talked about our future together and she said that during her last year of college she would explore all the options available to her, including both her contracting options, or just leaving the armed forces and exploring a career in the private sector straight out of college. She has a very strong degree, near perfect grades, and a lot of relevant industry experience. She would have the option to go anywhere she wanted after school. We both go to one of the best universities in the world and will have a lot of options straight out of college. We both agreed that we would try to figure out our future together, however, after we talked last night she was completely set on signing a ten year contract and becoming a pilot. Any private sector option was off the table, and she was offended when I brought up the shorter, non-flight contract. This came as a shock to me and is something I would have a hard time dealing with, especially since I would have to put off my dream of starting a business for the length of her contract to be with her since there are no air bases in any city that’s good to start a business in, and I wouldn’t be able to invest my time and money in a business if we could get moved at a moment’s notice. We had an agreement to approach our future together and figure out what would work for us, but she’s completely backed out on that and put me in a “take it or leave it” situation with her career in the forces. She says she loves me and wants to be with me and make it work, but she isn’t showing any signs of compromise. My dream since I was young was to start a business and make a life for myself, but I don’t think I can gain the knowledge and experience to do that if I’m following my girlfriend around from base to base just taking whatever jobs I can get.


During this summer she’s been at a ten week military training that’s part of her program. It’s notoriously difficult and many potential officers drop out because it is just too hard. She has two weeks left and is almost guaranteed to finish at this point. While she’s been at her training I took an internship across the country that’s turned into a total bust. I’m completely miserable at this job, everything at the company I’m working for moves extremely slowly and in the eight weeks I’ve been here I’ve done virtually nothing, learned virtually nothing, and gained nothing except the knowledge that I don’t want to work for this company after I graduate. Emotionally I’m not in a very good place right now and it’s compounded by the fact that my girlfriend and I are unable to talk during the week, only for a few hours on the weekend when she is allowed the use of her phone. Last night I spoke to her after I had an especially hard week. I got a concussion on Monday night which just makes everything I do harder and has prevented me from working out which is my way to vent and make bad emotions constructive. On top of that my work week was completely awful, I literally sat in my cubicle with a headache all day and did nothing. When we finally got on the phone on Saturday night I was miserable and just asked her for some emotional support, just to tell me something that would cheer me up and make me feel okay after a long week. She couldn’t do it. I asked multiple times, and each time all she said was she didn’t know how to cheer me up and didn’t understand why I was feeling down. I explained how and why I was feeling down to her any why I had a bad week but she wouldn’t even try to help. During our whole relationship we both give a lot but take a lot too. Many of our friends would look at us and go “wow, he/she asked him to do that?” then the next week say “wow, he/she did that for him?” All I can think about since our talk last night is that I don’t have the emotional support that I need from her. I’ve always been a sensitive guy and I know that, but I need more than what she’s giving me right now. All I’ve done this whole summer is write her letters and support her in her program, even if I know it will make things harder for us. I wrote her two letters every week that were always positive and encouraging, even when I was feeling shitty. When the time came for her to support me, she completely failed to do so. I’m not sure I’ll ever be the first priority in her life like she is to me and I’m not okay with that. I want to get back what I’m giving and I don’t believe she can do that if the armed forces will always come first and leave her with nothing left to give to me.
   
**tl;dr**: I want more than what I’m getting now and what I’ll get in the future. I’m wondering if it’s worth it to postpone and potentially give up my career dreams for love and if I can be happy doing that. "
4uei39,3,2016-07-24,Looking for a decent European University for Bsc in Engineering ( In English ).,Hellblender,studyAbroad,https://www.reddit.com/r/studyAbroad/comments/4uei39/looking_for_a_decent_european_university_for_bsc/,"Hi guys,

This my very first post in reddit, go easy on me please.

I've done some research over the past few weeks on Universities in Europe that provide a BSc in Engineering ( Any kind, really, i don't have time to pick and choose here) and here's what i know so far.

I've look at German Universities and already sent an e-mail to Technische Uni of Ingolstadt, unfortunately i am not keeping my hopes up on that one because i am past the deadline now :( (According to daad.de it was 15 July).

Now i know it's gonna be hard for me to find an English Course offered by a European University ( at low/free tuition cost at that) for this coming ""winter"" (Sept/Oct) Sessions, and as far as Germany is considered all the Universities that are offering Engineering start and only accept applications for that period of time, so i'm kind of screwed in that regard, i'll have to wait till next October to enrol, if i have to, i'll find the most productive way to spend that time, but i am 23 and kind of desperate.

I'm starting to look at Belgium, Denmark and just came across DTU as well, let's see what happens there..

I would like to know from you guys if there are English courses in Engineering offered by Universities in Europe that i could still apply for, at least if not for this coming Sept/Oct then somewhere around January, so i do not have to wait more than a year to start.

A bit about me, i am from South East Asia and i've done 3 semesters at a Community College in California, it is a fairly affordable option compared to 4 year universities in North America BUT i was NOT ALLOWED TO WORK! That is a big issue for me, this is why i'm now looking to start a Bachelors program in Europe, where tuition is considerably lower and i WILL be allowed to work, take part in internships and support myself. I had a big problem with that in the U.S and it really affected my studies towards the end.

Regardless of whether i can transfer the credits i have earned (at Santa Barbara City College, just in case you're wondering), i want to start a Bachelors of Engineering ASAP at a University in Europe.

Any advice? 

I am even willing to embark in a completely new major, i do have a profound interest in Politics and Business, basically.. i want to start as soon as possible.

Now again, i know enrolling and applying for Sept/Oct sessions right now is difficult, but i've sent out a few e-mails to different universities (Ingolstadt in Germany, DTU in Denmark) to try my luck, but if you guys are aware of Universities that offer admissions in December/January that i could apply for - PLEASE let me know.

Also one more thing, i am willing to learn a new language or enroll in a 'pre-university' program too if i have to, so i can leave and at least begin the learning process in a new country, learn the language and acclimatize. I am willing to do anything-and everything- to start my new adventure.

I cannot rely on my Dad or Uncle to dish out tens of thousands to study in the U.S anymore, even though i have applied to Concordia in Montreal, decent tuition fees - but, i hope you can understand where i am coming from.

I have also researched the work holiday visa option, if anyone has done this prior to enrolling, please let me know. ( for example, if i enroll in a program that starts in 2017, will i be able to undergo a work holiday program prior to the Uni session beginning? Because it sounds like i would be applying for 2 VISAS concurrently, i guess i will know best when a University accepts me and i go down to the Embassy to find out, but if you know of someone who has done this before - please let me know)


All advice is appreciated. I know this is the best place for me to get a wealth of information, right this moment i have 10 tabs open, some universities in Vienna, Brussels etc. I am considering everything and anything. 

Warmest Regards and thank you in advance, i will do my best to repay fellow Reddit users now that i finally have an account on here :)


Good day to all :)."

Anyway I thought posting here might be cathartic. SO and I are coming up on 4 years together (1 week from Thursday!) and have known each other for the better part of a decade. Though she's not at bad as the majority of of your Crab People MILs she's still pretty damn unpleasant and I have plenty of stories that show even if she isn't a full fledged crab person she's at least sympathetic to the cause. 

Anyhow SO and I are getting engaged (well officially) very soon. He's bought the ring and if it comes in in time he will be proposing on during our anniversary vacation next week. For reference we are 23 and 24 and have been living together for a year now. We both are recentish college grads (me in Dec 2015 and him in Dec 2014), have great jobs (me as a PM and him as a programmer), and I have just been accepted into a masters program (as paid for by my job). We do pretty goddamn well for ourselves and are completely self reliant. 

My FMIL has always had a ""thing"" with me...Probably because I've been the motivator for my SO to grow the hell up. Seriously...Everything from his first job (at 21) to getting the internship that led to the job he has now...All at my urging. Moving out of his parents house (almost 24)? Me. FMIL has had something to say about evvvvverything...From ""don't get a job in undergrad just focus on your studies...You'll get a job when you graduate! ""(yeah with no job experience? No.) ""I just think you're getting too serious too fast"" (On our first anniversary, when we were still living in separate places)...Then again when we moved in together shortly before our 3rd anniversary...And again when we moved out of our old crappy duplex into a beautiful 3br/2bath starter home. In the year's time that we have been living together she's asked at least twice ""when is your lease up again? Did you sign a year or a six month?"" ""year' *insert cat butt face here*....And ""Your place is just so depressing. How about when you [SO] work from home you come here instead. I'll just make you a snack and leave you alone!"" (This was shut down by SO by saying that small or not he loved our place because it was ours and he would under no circumstances be going to her house to work). 

Oh yeah and there was that time...Just before we moved. When one of SO's friends got engaged and we all were talking about that...Because we can't just leave the house without having a 20 min conversation with her. She looks him square in the eye, as I'm standing there, and says to him over and over ""you are too young."" She repeated it at least four times. 

Now we're about to ""get engaged"" (It feels silly to say that since we pretty much live as a married couple) and I'm so excited. I grew up with an abusive (Narcissist, borderline, or possibly both) mother, enabler dad (technically step dad), and neglectful narcissist/religious zealot bio dad. Pretty much every memory from my childhood and young adulthood has been tainted in some way by my mom's outbursts. Because of my family dynamic compiled with other smaller reasons we will be eloping (to Africa. We're having a ceremony with elephants ya'll!). As awesome as our plans are I'm sad for the reasons we're eloping. It still feels like my parents are fucking shit up (I'm in therapy). Anyway I just REALLY want our engagement to be what it's supposed to...Happy. Just a celebration of the home we've built, the love we have, and the team we are. 

I told my parents way back that we were planning on getting engaged in the near future and that we were eloping. I didn't know what their response would be and frankly if there was going to be a blow up I wanted to know THEN so it would be handled well before the actual moment. It's only a couple of weeks out and SO (to my knowledge) as still not told his parents. He swears his mom will be happy (I don't think his dad will be anything but. He has his own issues but he's always been very kind to me and likewise his sisters will be happy too)...But I'm nervous. Not just about the 'we're engaged"" announcement but also the ""we're eloping"".

They LOVE parties. I'm an introvert with social anxiety and anxiety disorder...I also have PTSD that is triggered by loud voices (my mom used to scream at me for hours...Like to the point the pictures on the wall audibly rattled) . We've told his eldest sister many times that she should be a professional party planner (seriously she's really amazing...Think Leslie Knope levels of party planning but way classier) and her wedding was all out. As my SO says they won't ""understand"" why we're eloping and will ""feel left out"". He actually tried to ask if his parents and sisters could COME WITH US to Africa and just ""go their separate ways and have their own vacation"". No. Sorry but no. I've suggested 1. having them come to the courthouse to sign the papers with us, 2. Live streaming our ceremony, 3. having a 'reception' when we get back...Or all three or some combination. He doesn't know that any of that will be good enough to appease them. 

Anyhow I guess I'm just looking to talk to some people who have maybe been through this. I really REALLY just want at least my engagement (if not my wedding) to be just a happy memory without any hitches...But I really fear that's not going to happen if the Crab Sympathizer has anything to do with it. 

Edit; Also if anyone has any advice regarding the elopement announcement I'd greatly appreciate it...Particularly in regards to the 'But why-eeeeeeeeeee?"" I really don't feel like going into my fucked up family dynamics. If it were someone who'd been supportive and kind throughout the years then yes I would but she has not and I don't feel she really is entitled to a recap of my trauma. "
4uesk8,8,2016-07-24,Me [25M] having trouble making lasting relationships with people.,KBect1990,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4uesk8/me_25m_having_trouble_making_lasting/,"I'm a 25 years old college student and I seem to struggle to make lasting relationships/friendships with people. It's been bothering me quite a bit lately because it's summer break and if it weren't for my internship I'd be incredibly lonely at home. This dates back to before college even. I get along with everyone just fine, but when it comes to actually going beyond being an acquaintance I seem to fall short.   

I connect with people pretty quickly, but it seems to fizzle out and becomes nothing more.  I understand the old phrase ""To get a friend you have to be a friend"" and I interpret that as relationships are a two way street. You can't expect someone else to put forth all the effort and not give anything back in return.  I believe that's partially to blame for my predicament because I rarely reach out to people anymore.  A lot of that has to do with the fact that in the past every time I did set something up people were to hesitant to go or just flaked out completely. I really internalized this because it seemed like other people would set up the EXACT same thing and have no issues getting people to attend. I perceived that as them being more charismatic, friendly, and approachable and it must've meant I didn't possess those qualities. 

I'm just tired of not connecting with people and not making lasting friendships. I have about 1 year of college left and I'm concerned that once I leave I'll be incredibly lonely.  At no other point am I going to be surrounded by people around my age in this abundance.   

For those who seem to have a busy social life, how do you do it?  Was there an ah-ha moment where things clicked for you and you started just making friends?  I don't want to just being seeking friends out, but I'd like to be the type of person people actually want to be around. 

TL;DR; Struggle to make lasting relationships. How to charismatic social people develop lasting relationships/friendships?

4ufmzc,2,2016-07-24,"My MacBook Pro's trackpad becomes unresponsive when waking up from sleep, why does this happen?",W221S63AMG,mac,https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/4ufmzc/my_macbook_pros_trackpad_becomes_unresponsive/,"Whenever I leave my laptop on sleep for at least 10+ minutes, the trackpad becomes unresponsive and takes a while to load (NOTE: This problem mostly happens when I am carrying my laptop to another location in my bookbag). I have to keep tapping the trackpad 5-7 times (rapidly) in order for it to finally respond.

I have tried running a hardware diagnosis test from Apple and everything looks fine (so no trackpad issue). In addition, I have cleaned out my trackpad from free of dust but that doesn't seem to fix my issue.

Does anyone know what this issue is, how can I resolve this myself?

Additional details: Laptop operating on Mac OS X version 10.9.5, early 2011

**TL;DR: Trackpad becomes unresponsive after sleep, have to tap it 5-7 times in order for it to start functioning correctly. Why?**

**EDIT 1:** Strange thing is, it doesn't seem to happen when the laptop goes to sleep when kept on a flat surface, only when laptop is moved the trackpad becomes unresponsive. 

**EDIT 2:** CONFIRMED, problem only occurs when laptop is moved around. When laptop is left on table, its perfectly fine. 

**EDIT 3:** Now the problem is also happening with my Logitech M510 USB mouse.

**EDIT 4:** Laptop is using SSD, I though it was sudden motion sensor but that wasn't the issue. I'll have to wait until my internship is over, take it to apple store and have the trackpad checked out for any physical-related issues. 

**EDIT 5:** Ran the hardware test again and everything looks fine. 70% of the time I use Logitech M510, 30% is the track pad. Surprisingly, the build-in keyboard is having no issues. 

**EDIT 6:** Runs fine on El Capitan (10.11, booted from external hard drive) but the issue is on Mavericks (10.9). It may be software related than hardware! 

**EDIT 7:** The EDIT 6 above regarding software seems incorrect. Tried an SMC, PRAM reset and even that didn't work. I suspect this is a hardware issue and maybe the cables within trackpad needs to be replaced. 

**EDIT 8:** Discovered when I rest my left palm on my laptop, there seems to be some issue with trackpad when it wakes up from sleep. Left side is the SSD and right is battery. 

**EDIT 9:** Trackpad seems to work fine if you wait 8+ seconds after sleep. "
4ufq3o,1,2016-07-24,External Transfer (Info Sci) major wondering if it's possible to transfer to CS?,ccsthrowaway2017,Cornell,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/4ufq3o/external_transfer_info_sci_major_wondering_if_its/,"Hey, all.

I transferred in the spring from a community college as info sci (CALS). I managed to score an internship for this summer, but it's not exactly what I had expected. It's lead me to realize that a 'hardcore' (more dedicated?) software development role is more in tune with my career aspirations.

I feel like I could definitely get a 'CS' job out of school with IS degree, but I also feel that i'm missing a -ton- of core CS fundamentals after 2110.

Is it even possible for me to internal to CS as a previous external transfer student?

I'm a rising junior, and after looking at course equivalencies/what I have, it just seems like i -may- have to spend an additional semester if i'm even allowed to transfer, which is... fine.

I know IS in CALS (and CALS in general besides AEM) is significantly easier to external-transfer into, and I feel that will hurt my chances when I plead my case, and i'll be told something like: ""Oh, you just applied IS instead of CS in AS/eng because it's statistically easier to get into! Sorry, we don't allow sneaky backdoor transfers here"". I legitimately applied IS because it seemed to be exactly what I wanted to major in, but its allure is fading on me.

I do have a bit of relevant CS experience (two fully-fleshed websites, an iOS app/website (company), and a ton of random side-projects), too, though, so I wouldn't exactly be going in blind. 

Thoughts?

4ufsjj,5,2016-07-24,How do I network correctly?,buhhkup,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/4ufsjj/how_do_i_network_correctly/,"So, I get that the best way to actually land an internship is to call people around and network. The problem is, I don't really believe I am ready for an internship, if that makes sense. I'm looking to go into either risk analysis or wealth management. I'm an econ undergrad in a non-target school which makes things even harder. 

I have no previous work experience or internships. I know how to use Python, R, Excel; I know some machine learning methods, and I've taken advanced econometrics classes (that are offered only to honours students but I spoke my way into them).

So, with that skillset, where do I go from there? I read a post on here which suggested trying to get in touch with alumni from your program / university that work in the field you're trying to break in. Great, but what do I tell them? Like, do I just email them and attach my cv, then explain that I'm soon graduating and looking for an internship? Or do I play coy and ask about the job, about themselves and about the company in hopes that the conversation will end with them offering me something?

I've done a few personal projects, a lot of them which are small and this was irrelevant, but now in my internship and also with aspirations on building something bigger I want to be able to properly use tools like Travis/Jenkins (sorry if I'm not even referencing the right products). 

They seem daunting however, I have to write seemingly complicated configuration files and learn how to have them track certain files -- how do I go about learning how to use these tools?"

4ug5pf,8,2016-07-24,Concerns going into last year of Bachelors in CE from a not-so-known university,GetSheetDone,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ug5pf/concerns_going_into_last_year_of_bachelors_in_ce/,"Hey all

So, as the title says, I'm going into my senior year of Computer Engineering next month, and over the past year I have truly enjoyed every minute of both in and out-of-class coding I've done in my little projects teaching myself how to build android apps and it's really been a great experience to open up my Dev Console and see someone in a different continent use an app I made, even if the numbers are really low. But with less than a year of time to get my shit together and be a candidate for decent full time gigs, my worries are really starting to get the better of me.

1. Now, given that I have no internships to show and will be applying as an average state university *CE* student from the Midwest, what do you guys think of my chances to land a job as a Software Engineer? Java being my language of choice.

2. I did not want to factor this in as an excuse or bring it up in the post but for complete clarity..over the last year and a half, my gpa has dropped from a 3.2 to a 2.6, after the passing away of a close family member; realistically, with 32 hours to go, do you think I still have the time to reverse my gpa back? Microcontroller System Design, Intro to FPGA Design, Operating Systems and Computer Networks seemingly being the most important remaining courses.

3. From reading past posts on this subreddit, I have realized how big of a factor open source contributions are when it comes to the job hunt, and being a CE major, I would think that it applies even more so to myself. 
So, if I were confident at this point in my Java skills, how do I go about finding a project to contribute to? 

4. .....Is a winter internship even possible, if I cannot delay graduation? It would span mid December to late January.

Thanks for reading!"

When I started going I was on respiridone, hydroxyzine, and strattera. I met someone who wanted to be my friend in group, we will call him H. H and I started talking. He is a really aggressive type person and he seemed cool and we hit it off and started talking and talking and then over the summer we started to hang out. When my grandmother went on vacation for two and a half weeks, we hung out every day and I was always at his house and stuff. Well, things started to get somewhat emotional. I don't have feelings for him. He would push and push and want to get emotional and I was like, dude, can you stop and he never would really stop? And we were going back and forth. It started as a joke and then it got  bit much. Alright, so keep in mind he has a girl that he has been with for 5 months, 7 months ish and he blew her off while he was with me and now that we aren't allowed to hang out that much anymore he doesn't really care for me anymore. We can't really hang out anymore because my grandma when she came back was like no you can't hang out with him anymore blah blah blah, that is a whole story within itself, I don't want to get into. 

So, basically my friend, H, is being a major dick and I talk to his girl and she says that he is an asshole and that she just tolerates him. But this dude insults everything and everybody and he is not a good looking guy. He has deep insecurities. For fucking real. And he takes them out on other people. We were having a conversation and he blew the fuck up on me for not having a phone, I have a computer, I'm not allowed to have a phone. That is also another story in itself. He basically blows me off now, doesn't really talk to me, makes excuses to not talk, he won't answer me as to why he is being a dick. He lies to me consistently for example he told me that he was not paying for his college and (btw I am still in high school, he is a college boy). I always see him asking for money and hitting people up for stuff and he tries to be sweet and buy me stuff, but he came across that he can't afford it. His girl said that he actually has a savings account of more than 8k. and he is planning on moving out and getting his own place. He never told me anything like that and never shared nothing like that with me. I know it's not my business. I don't care if people have money... but why are you being lazy and not investing in your future?? And people from group tell me that he said that he does pay for his college. 

And another thing that pissed me off about him was he would slut shame me and i'm just like what the fuck dude. I keep talking to him because I feel like I have no one else really. He talks to me a lot but it's aggravating having to answer his FaceTime calls so much and he demands a lot of attention and his girl said I shouldn't have to deal with him. And that's another thing, is he basically bullies me into talking about my emotions, but he refuses to be honest about his feelings. and he leaves out MAJOR fucking details, like he will go somewhere and he will tell me about it, but fails to tell me how he almost got in a fight/ did get in a fight.

 I just don't know how to handle this. Because he has no friends, and I have friends, but they are too busy to talk to me, they are involved in internships and summer classes. how do I cut people off without feeling remorse?? And I don't know if this is because I'm off all my meds and just on buspirone now.Idk if I'm just getting impatient with my friend?? Usually I would just not care about the things that he does and just blow it off, but now I'm like fuck you, dude, I don't want to deal with this. Yeah. I don't know. If there are any questions about more details and stuff, just send them my way. Thanks for reading this long post. Please help me out. Idk how to stop talking to people bc I feel bad and I feel like I need them bc I don't really have people who I can talk to A LOT. "
4ug97m,17,2016-07-24,Wife of an emotionally absent gamer,aspiring_gnostic,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/4ug97m/wife_of_an_emotionally_absent_gamer/,"Update 2: Since 2 weeks ago, we've seen a massive improvement! My husband has really limited his phone and internet usage to just an hour a day during the weekdays, and, while I'm not sure whether or not we're down to 2 hours a day over the weekend, things are definitely improved on the family-time front. I find it's been very helpful to wake up together and have breakfast together, and my husband has enjoyed this too (I think otherwise he would have just gotten up and stared at his phone previously), and then, mostly because our son has night terrors if we don't - we stopped watching TV or letting our son watch anything (but this obviously means we can't have any artificial light producing thing around bedtime as well) - before 9 pm (when the kids fall asleep). Well, this has been a huge blessing in disguise for us and now we are able to sustain nearly 1 hour of reading to the kids together before bedtime, even though, I admit, we're a bit like trapped, internet-starved animals during this time (I admit I may be a little addicted to the internet too..though nowhere near the levels my husband managed). Anyway, together with this we've had a lot more conversations and more intimate times and I think our marriage is really growing stronger. I am really glad we managed to get rid of the HearthStone; the Pokeaman Go is nowhere near as bad. My husband has also been showering me with compliments and attention - not sure if he's making it up or just being tricky but - my baby son woke up while I was gone to the gym (the only time I ever leave the house without the kids in tow) and he was so heartbroken when I got back that, I happened to whine to my husband ""I wish I didn't have to go to the gym but, what can I do?"" and, he said something to the effect that, it really didn't make a difference to him if I went to the gym or not, and why even be concerned about not being able to get thinner as I'm already hot to him, the only problem being, as far as he perceives, my obsession with attaining a lower number (I'm supposedly at a healthy BMI but, one can always improve). Anyway, this was nice to hear although my mind immediately wondered if he were saying this to get me to watch the baby even during my 1 hour of ""liberty"" (which usually overlaps with the baby's nap but...sometimes he wakes up on the way home). Anyway, still uncertain about the motives there, but, at least he has been really sweet lately, and even posted some sappy sentimental gifs thanking me for loving him so much. So, despite never having received a full and proper apology over the toilet issue - I accept the conciliatory efforts. My husband was never really evil - just sometimes a little dense, and, I can work with that. So that's where we are.

*******************


Update: My husband has deleted the HearthStone and agreed to limit his technology usage to 1 hour a day, and then 2-3 hours a day on the weekend. This is a lot of progress, and, I am very hopeful things will improve!

*****

Hello. I wanted to post first a disclaimer in that, I don't judge others or their particular tendencies, or situations, and am only trying to find my own cathartic escape from a living situation that, while not unbearable, is extremely lonely, and progressively more empty. 

I married my husband now of -well, it's been 10 years since we were together. I knew from the beginning that comics and computer usage were a near obsession - from Magic the Gathering, to Wow, to numerous other games - ever changing, except for one thing: my husband has to play them, and/or spend vast quantities of time being distracted. I don't even mean an hour or two. This past weekend he spent 8+ hours each day. He now believes that HearthStone is somehow better in that he can do this on his phone, and periodically look up to give us, his wife, and two children, marginal half-hearted replies. I understood at first why he might have a gaming addiction - he lost his mother at the age of 13, and, I reasoned that the escape that had been reading, morphed into online comics, morphed into gaming -and that it was there to fill the void that otherwise would be filled with suffering. I made an enormous investment in him - something I don't think most people can fathom - and before you scoff and say there's no way you did this: there is, and I did; namely, I got him through engineering school. Yes, I am entirely taking credit for that. He has some kind of ADHD related to gaming and, was unable to remain focused enough to properly study and put in the time commitment necessary to succeed; it took us 4 years to finish 2 years of engineering school, and one computer thrown off a bridge (I had a temper at the time and could not bear to see him throw his life away over a game), but we finally got through, and I got him to an employable state, and even an internship with NASA (well, that was his professor, he was well liked because, overall, he is a very personable person). 

At any rate, I had had prior negative experiences with men; I've had a man dump me after 5 years on Christmas while also telling me the dimensions of his new girlfriend, after tricking me into sex with the flat out lie of marriage (ring included). I've had another wholesale parade his devotion to marriage and commitment only to completely stop talking to me after breaking into my dorm room and stalking me in the middle of the night all across campus. Just not another word, up and left, I guess, I got ""boring"". I've had another stop sex to drink a diet Pepsi, because hey, why not? I got very frustrated with all of these experiences, and my husband really promised to be something better, and, I figured putting all this effort in initially to ""build a man up from scratch"" would result in a gratitude that would eliminate problems that I perceived were otherwise stemming from ingratitude: abandonment, sexual infidelity, etc. I could not have fully anticipated what it would feel like to be wholesale replaced with some flickering text and gaudy coloring. 

One has to understand, my husband pursued me for years. Years. Stalked me, read all my blogs, gave up his entire family and moved to be by me - the level of devotion was breathtaking. But now, alas, I think we barely exchanged a few words today. I woke up and took care, as usual, of all the chores; I cannot even list them all here - but it included cleaning 20 feces covered cloth diapers, walking the dogs, vacuuming, all the dishes, all the laundry, driving the recycle to its location, scrubbing the floor, cooking breakfast, lunch, and dinner from scratch, making the beds, putting away MOUNDS of children's toys - anyway, I won't bore you further but I swear from the minute I woke up to now, exempting one hour of exercise and some food shopping, I have been constantly doing the chores. What has my husband done during this time? Well, because he was sleep deprived (I am too, but, for different reasons) - from gaming till past 12 AM last night, he slept in till 10:30 allowing me to catch up on more time with the kids while cleaning (yes, that is sarcastic, I stay at home during the week now - and yes, I know that in itself could be causal here, as he used to be extremely proud that I was an ""engineering"" wife and now, well crap, all I do is take care of his kids). Anyway, it's fine, he works, I don't, I get it. He has earned all the time he needs. But the gaming takes up ALL the time. He noticed that I was ""sad"" but, that's about it. We've been over this so many times, I am done nagging. I am a religious person and so would never cheat or walk out of the marriage, but, I don't understand why a person would abdicate real human relationships and force their partner into a state of emotional deprivation.

Lately, my sex drive has returned, and, perhaps more often than is normal I would solicit him for sex. He seems to put up with these requests of mine, and, it's true, about half our relations were amazing (he is good at sex). However, it's clear he is only ""performing"" for me, and it sucks that he hasn't initiated anything for...I think half a year. I've actually lost weight - 10 lbs at least since he first met me, and while I'm no waif, I try to keep in shape. Two days ago, he wholesale abandoned the opportunity to have sex to clear a toilet, which ""needed to be done"". I confronted him on this - (I had come onto him while he was playing HearthStone) and, he denied ""leaving sex"" because ""I wasn't hard at the time"". I wish I hadn't even talked with him about it; apparently he was so distracted by the HearthStone that he couldn't even get hard by my grinding up naked against him. That may sound funny to read, but it sucks in person. It majorly sucks. It just GAH. I feel trapped, unwanted, and unnoticed and it doesn't ""help"" for him to notice I am ""sad"" and give me attention for 1 hour a week, and then the next day be plastered against whatever screen will have him for literally, from the moment he comes home, outside of dinner, to the moment he goes to sleep. 

Lately, he even ignores the kids, 3 and 1 1/2, and while I initially wanted 2 more kids with him, I'm reconsidering. Not because I would ever pursue a divorce, or even as much as flirt with another male, but because I am bitter in my marriage over what it has become. I don't complain to him, I just keep it all inside, but, I thought venting here might help. I guess I should have known when his best friend lost the love of HIS life from gaming 18 hours a day. At least that one claims that if he ever had a wife and kids, he'd drop the games in a second. 

My husband doesn't value us, and if I could, I would literally strangle to death every single creator of every single ""recreational"" game that has ever polluted our family life. I guess I'm the idiot for marrying a gamer. 

The lonely hell of a cage that is my married life. "
4ugdjf,53,2016-07-24,Are you tired of these yet? Hopefully not. Yet another visual wardrobe.,cmw100,femalefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/4ugdjf/are_you_tired_of_these_yet_hopefully_not_yet/,"Over the past couple years I have been paring down my wardrobe (read: getting rid of so much crap) and trying to transition to a more ~professional~ wardrobe.

I'm 22 and a grad student in Elementary Education. I am currently in the middle of my year-long internship in a 5th grade classroom. My school has a pretty casual attitude about teacher dress code. Jeans and sandals always fine, for example. However, being young I try to dress a bit more professionally than is the norm.

I live in Florida so it's always hot and humid, and winter doesn't exist. No Ned, winter is never coming.

I'm 5'7"" and 135lbs.  I have somewhat funky hips. They're quite narrow and basically give me a perpetual muffin top. I may look like all of my pants are too tight, but that's just my body shape. That's why I stick to silhouettes that are fitted in the bust and waist, and flare from there. A-line is my friend. Dresses are my go to outfit, I love dresses. Also, shirts tucked into skirts. For all the pants/shorts/etc. I tucked in my shirt as to show all of the item. However, I would pretty much never wear my fitted shirts tucked into pants irl. Just not super flattering as you might see.

So my goals of this project is to get feedback from you folks. What pieces do you love? What pieces need to go? What areas of my wardrobe are lacking? Basically just anything you want to tell me is cool. Also, what is my body type? Banana? Wonky pear? Banana-Pear smoothie? None of the above? Why are these things so hard to determine?

[Here is the main attraction ladies and probably just ladies, given the nature of this subreddit. My visual wardrobe.](http://imgur.com/a/pTHw4)

After trying everything on and looking at the pictures I decided to get rid of shirts 7 and 35, and scarf 11. I hardly/never wear them and they no longer spark joy.

Not pictured in this album:
* undergarments and tights
* camis. I ave black, white, grey, and navy solid camis. I only use them for layering
* Athletic clothes and old t shirts. I only wear them to actually work out, and to babysit. So many bodily fluids that I want nowhere near my ""nice"" clothes.
* shoes

If you read all of that, thanks for your time and have a great day!"

I quit a very good paying job in order to move out to the boonies, live on the ranch we bought together, and go back to school for engineering. Over the last six months my relationship with my fiancee has fallen apart and she says she no longer has any sort of attraction for me. I know for a fact much of this stems from me not having a job or any friends in the area yet. I have become clingy without much effort, it just kinda happened. I have made many attempts to go out on various MeetUps in order to meet people and find friends, but as we all know that's easier said than done. Last week I finally started an engineering internship, which is good because now I finally have something positive going on, but I'm afraid it's too late. She no longer looks at me like she used to. It's like she looks right through me. I feel trapped and alone being so far from old friends and my family. Living with her and her mom has been civil, but I feel like I'm getting in the way. I have no idea what to do. I gave a good portion of my 401k to move in here with the expectations that they would cover the mortgage while I got my degree. Now it seems like I need to seriously consider moving out.. The main issue with that is I will be in serious debt, not to mention the stress of yet another move.
What should I do? She said she's willing to give the relationship 2 months, but I seriously think in her mind she's only saying that to be nice and to delay the inevitable. Of course I want to be with her, but I also don't want to be with someone who gets annoyed at my very presence. I don't know if I should consider trying to get my old job back, if I should duke it out here in my house, or if I should risk the stress and move again, hoping for the best financially.
Please help.

4ugli3,1,2016-07-24,"Me (19M) and my girl (18f) about to go to college, need advice on how to stay together?",JPargentine,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4ugli3/me_19m_and_my_girl_18f_about_to_go_to_college/,"I asked this girl out on the last day of high school and luckily she said yes.  She had been waiting for me to do so apparently and we've been hanging out and constantly texting and Snapchating for over a month now.  And oh my God is she awesome! We almost had sex recently but she was on her period,  so were pretty serious and exclusive,  but recently I've had some worries I need advice with. 

For the last 3 weeks I have always had to ask her out,  and while we still hang out,  she keeps canceling on me.  But she still seems to really like me and I'm assuming she's just busy or has been kind of lazy is all.  However we recently talked about our future and I don't know what to think. 

She's going to college next year in NC where we live,  but I got into Stanford in California,  however I'm taking a gap year first.  I also ended up finding a cool internship at the same college shes going to and I would really like to see her until I can't anymore.  She said she doesn't want a boyfriend going into college,  and I can respect that but it's hard because we are getting along so well that's its hard to just let it die.  We recently started sharing a lot and are getting closer everyday,  which is making the terminal nature of our relationship even more painful.  It's there anything I can do to convince her to continue seeing me only for as long as I'm in the same town as her? 

I don't want to force her to do anything she doesn't want to,  but we are both having so much fun together it seems a shame to kill it when it doesn't have to die! I think I may be coming off as too strong,  but I don't want to play hard to get because I feel like that's lying and I don't want her to just stop hanging out.  

What steps should I take to change her mind without forcing her into anything she doesn't want to do? Also,  how can I get her to want to see me like she used to? We used to hang out every day but now it's just weekends and I'm dying.  

I can take any kind of advice even if I won't like it,  and I'm sorry if my description is sloppy,  but it's hard to put my feelings info words eloquently,  I feel like I'm busting at the seems.  Thanks for anything you want to say!"
4ugpdp,13,2016-07-25,The therapist in therapy,therapistthrow,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/4ugpdp/the_therapist_in_therapy/,"Made a throwaway since I post somewhat regularly on this/similar subs.

I'm an advanced doctoral student (1 more year until internship) and I've been struggling.  I have a long history of depressive/dysthymic traits and anxiety, which I've been seeking therapy for, for quite some time.  However, I'm getting to the point that I feel completely stuck, that I'm not going to improve myself.  I feel that I'm lost on what to work on in my sessions, what to talk about, because I feel that anything meaningful, I would have/should have figured it out myself already.  That ""analysis paralysis"" at its best, I suppose.

Particularly, I struggle with anxiety and feelings of not being good enough/imposter syndrome type stuff.  I feel that, no matter what, I cannot shake it.  I have all of these therapeutic skills, and what I would like to see as fairly good self-awareness and insight, but cannot overcome these feelings.  I worry that I am just coasting at the moment, and that when it comes time for me to be practicing on my own, I will not be able to handle it.  I want to improve and be more confident, and I hear stories of therapy changing peoples' lives, but I don't know how to get to that point anymore.  I have no clear picture of how to help myself improve, and thus I don't fully expect to do so.  

So here's my dilemma.  I already know I struggle too much being my own therapist, that's no surprise to me.  I have no idea where to go from here, to continue improving.  My therapy seems to be at a standstill, and despite numerous conversations about this to my therapist, I don't know if I can be helped anymore.  I can't tell if this is my depressive traits keeping me down or if I really have maximized my benefits.  What's worse is my experience is shaking my beliefs in therapy as being helpful, that if I can't be helped, can I help anyone?  Is there only so much we as therapists can do?

It's frankly a scary place to be and I'm not sure what to do.  I guess I'm just writing this because I've been wanting to seek some advice, maybe hear of similar therapists with similar issues, or just vent.  I don't know.  This is my passion and I am not shaken, but I'm afraid I've reached my maximum, which to me is just not enough.   

So in sum, has anyone gotten stuck in their own personal therapy journey?  Do you ever feel as if you can't stop being your own therapist, even to your own detriment?  Am I overthinking these things, which I'm sure is likely?

Thanks in advance, this community has been amazing over the years, and I look forward to the responses."

Currently I'm completing an internship in the defense industry but I've always has a pull towards finance since watching CNBC in my Uncle's office where he was an investment advisor when I was young (not what I'm interested in). In terms of my financial background, it's mostly just through self-education and a desire to learn. I live in Chicago and occasionally look at job boards to see my options but it's hard to parse through what would be an appropriate path. So I guess these are my 3 questions:

1. Are there any career paths you can think of that would fulfill my desires? I'm not necessarily looking for a strictly engineering role...I took a mental math pretest for a trader at a prop firm in Chicago but unfortunately didn't make the cut. Equity analysis? Anything along those lines?

2. Do you think it would be more difficult for me considering I'm in my mid-20s and just getting a start in finance? 

3. Do you have any additional advice as to books to read/things to learn on my own? I'm pretty packed the next 3 semesters with curriculum courses so it would be extremely difficult to fit a legitimate finance course into my schedule but I'm pretty good at learning outside of the classroom environment.

Thanks!

4ugrz8,2,2016-07-25,Should I continue my internship during the school year?,sdf08,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/4ugrz8/should_i_continue_my_internship_during_the_school/,"My summer internship will be wrapping up in a few weeks, and I will probably be given the option of continuing this job part time during the school year. I am a CpE student going into my final year, and this was my first internship. I only need 12-13 credits each semester, so working during school would be doable. But I have some doubts:

The project I am working on is fun and related to my career goals (firmware/embedded), but I am working in isolation because there are no firmware/embedded engineers in my (very small) organization. One other engineer did a few super-simple MCU projects a while ago, but he insists that I know way more about embedded than he does. So I ask people high-level questions about what my application should do, and I show them some high-level results, but that's it. I do not have anyone to look to for mentorship or feedback on the quality of my work. 

To be honest, I don't think they need firmware engineers. There is plenty of serious engineering work happening, but it's pretty much all in other disciplines of engineering. Most places you might expect to find a custom MCU solution, they have purchased a 'black box' solution instead. They are more of a 'systems integrator' shop in this regard, and it has worked well for them so far. So I am not entirely sure how I fit in here or why they hired me. 

There are some things I like about this job. The people are great, I am working on fairly interesting stuff, and I am getting some money and experience out of it. But I would much rather work somewhere else after graduation, because I know I will grow way more as an engineer if I am working closely with others, especially with more experienced engineers who can provide feedback and mentorship. And I just don't see that happening here.
 
I think continuing my work during the school year, even though I don't really intend to work there after graduating, would be a bit awkward and kind of dishonest. What do you think?"
4uguro,2,2016-07-25,My gf [21] of 2.5 years moved to NYC for her internship and slept with someone from work. I [m/22] am living with her and trying to figure out what to do.,Throwaaay3822929,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4uguro/my_gf_21_of_25_years_moved_to_nyc_for_her/,"Background: my girlfriend and I met in college. Things were perfect first 9 months or so. She was fun and silly and felt like she was a missing piece to me. Rolls up to December 2014, and she tells me she has been bulimic for 2 years. Also, she spent almost all of her savings on her addiction and her parents won't support her full living expenses.

The next semester I generally support her. Some of it we consider what we would normally do, but other times we agree I'll be paid back. This put some stress on the relationship, but in general I would say we handled it well. Bulimia continued to be an issue - she was seeing a therapist, but she felt that it wasn't helping because she would just lie to the therapist to get through. She didn't want to put her trust in the therapist. We still do all the fun things we did, and I still view the relationship as a net positive.

That summer I turned 21 and moved to NYC for my internship. Throughout the summer she constantly would text me saying how awful our relationship is. If I went out she would call me crying until I left whatever I was doing to talk to hee. She would yell at me quite a lot. When she visited, she would ""cancel"" a day or two before because she says she doesn't want to see me and she's not excited. We would have tons of fun when she did show up, and she would apologize profusely, but this didn't stop it from happening again. She was still bulimic at this time, and a lot of this was driven by hating herself for not being able to fix it.

Next semester I wanted to start going out with friends. Didn't really happen the first two months because she asked me to really monitor every meal and help her get momentum in overcoming bulimia. I did it, eating (and paying for most) meals every day of the week. She improved significantly in this time, but was very reliant on me for making sure there were no issues. This meant if I was out with friends, I could get a call and I would need to get back to her. It made it very difficult to go out without being stressed. Still, she began to get better at handling it on her own, and by the end of the semester it was mainly better for me.

An interjection, this of course is only presenting the negative side of the story. There are plenty of fun moments, silly moments, us moments among this. This is just background on the relationships issues before I get to the current ones.

Next semester she moves in. Most is way better. Bulimia sometimes plays a role, but mainly is receded. She's still partially dependent on me for money. End of may this year she owes me around  $6k.

You'll notice she wasn't going out very much. She would sometimes for events, but she didn't have a fake and felt that she had issues making friends because of it.

She turned 21 this June and started her internship in NYC. My full time job didn't start until this week and we had arranged to live together until my lease starts August 1st. Throughout the time between school ending and last week, she would constantly ask for more time on the phone, where we were talking for 30+ minutes a day. I was fine with this, but it is important to note for whats to come. She talks about how she is starting to enjoy going out with people from work - there are a few guys that she mentions, but I've always trusted her more than anyone else. She tells me how excited she is to have me join her in the city and how fun it will be.

Fast forward to last Sunday, I move to NYC. The next day, she tells me she went home and slept in the bed of one of the full time employees (31 years old). She says nothing sexual happened. But that she needs to tell me. Also, she feels like she has changed a lot since coming to the city. She wants to be able to go out with her new friends, talk to guys, and make sure I'm the right one. She says she doesn't want to hook up with other people, just talk to them and basically reset our relationship so she's not so dependent on me. She feels like she was awful to me when I was here over the summer last year and is a leach. So we need to go back to being ""dating friends.""

This past week I didn't see or talk to her much. We still sleep in the same bed, and we got dinner twice this weekend, but overall communication and interaction is low. She doesn't tell me where she is or what her plans are in any level of detail. When I comment she says I'm not giving her her space. I've never ever been the jealous type, but it sort of tears me up because I could never cheat on her but I felt so fucking lonely this week. She never really drank before, but has come back tipsy or drunk multiple times. She is snippy if I am not ""going with the flow,"" which is something she never did ever in our relationship. Overall, she does seem like a more extroverted, bitchier version of the girl I fell in love with.

I did something I'm not proud of and tried to check her phone. The pass code that she's had our entire relationship has changed. 

So I don't know what to do at this point. I don't know if I'm in a relationship or not. Attempts at clarification get shot down. I can't move out because I cant afford a weekly rental until my lease starts. I don't want to end this, but I feel used, abused, and thrown to the side by a girl that for some reason I still think is my silly, loving girlfriend. I dont want to be in limbo. Help."

Minor Career Progression?,VoxClarus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ugw97/comp_sci_minor_career_progression/,"I have many academic interests, and have declared my major in a rather unprofitable one. I've opened a year of classes through AP Credit and would like to fill that with a second minor.

The CS minor looks appealing, and would open a separate and relatively high-demand career path. However, I have no idea what hiring prospects are like with just a minor. This seems a good area to ask a few questions.

 



Do Comp. Sci minors without significant internships have viable careers in the application and game development sectors? (Software development seems to be a field where project portfolios should matter more than formal education, but obviously I'm an outsider here.)


 

Besides basic Calc. and Stats, are there any courses that *must* be taken to be successful in CS coursework?
Further, would taking some of the Software Engineering major courses be valuable substitutions? It includes some AI and UI development, as well as basic formal language courses (UML, MATLAB).


 


If it helps, the official class setup I'm thinking is:
 
Object-Oriented -&gt; Data Communication -&gt; Software Construction  -&gt; Software Architecture -&gt; Game Programming/Game Design (Why not?)
 
Thanks!"

I've always loved hardware. I do like coding but I don't know if I can see myself doing it everyday. However it seems like the position ends at Senior Systems Administrator. Am I wrong here? 

But in all honestly I love this. I love building servers. I'm like gilfoyle on Silicon Valley. I love my shitty DL360 G6 and Athlon X2 freenas box. 

But at the same time I do like coding. I want to code games or go into machine learning. I'm at such a crossroads. I love every aspect of computer since and I have no idea what to do.

At least I'm only going into my 3rd year of school for a CS degree out of 5. (4 classroom, 1 of internships)  "

Advice appreciated.,LuluWoo,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4uhitm/intern_teacher_may_have_bitten_off_more_than_i/,"I am a brand new intern teacher that is not only working on her credential, but will be finishing her masters degree this fall. I decided to intern because I need the money. I live in an expensive area, and making ends meet while student teaching five days a week with no pay wasn't an option.

The school district I have been hired for is in an affluent area, but the district itself is nothing but title 1 schools. The school I will be at is one of the highest needs, and one of the lowest rated. I am fine with this because every school I have volunteered in, as well as the one I student taught at, was a title 1. I am aware of the trauma and the difficulties of working in a title 1, and I know I can handle this.

My concerns are that the position I was offered is a 4/5th grade combo class, and the district itself is full inclusion. I have no idea where to start with a combo class, nor do I completely have the knowledge of how to run a full inclusion classroom.

What advice would anyone who has taught a combo class, or has worked in full inclusion, or both, would you offer me? What can I expect in full inclusion? Is it possible to combine curriculums for 4/5th grade so that both grade levels are being taught to the standards? How do I find time to instruct on both grade level curriculum if I can't combine it?

Any advice would be so greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!"

I met my (I guess ex-boyfriend) in January of this year while we were in school; he and I do not attend the same school,  but we go to school near each other. For the sake of this post, I will refer to him as Max. Max and I have been dating ever since we met, and we have had a great, affectionate, and honest relationship.

Max and I became long-distance when summer started, as we live in different states about 20 hours away from each other and we moved back to our homes for our summer internships. The last time we met in person was a month ago, when he visited me in my hometown.

Yesterday night, Max called to inform me that he had made out with another girl. Naturally, I was a bit upset and disappointed, and it prompted us to have an honest conversation about what we wanted in a relationship and how we felt about doing long-distance relationships (especially as I planned to intern far away from our respective colleges for our upcoming fall semester). We were going to see each other in early August, about a week from now, so we decided to make our final decision about our relationship when we had a chance to discuss it in person, but we both expressed more interest in staying together over breaking up.

At this point, I mentioned that I was thinking about backing away from the internship because I thought I might kill myself if I went. You see, I was diagnosed as being bipolar (type I) last year, and have been prescribed a regimen of therapy and medications. Due to the location of the internship, I doubted I could continue my regimen, and I worried that my mental health would deteriorate to the point of suicidal ideation. 

(Just to be clear, Max knows about my diagnosis. He was there when I had a manic episode in front of him; he visited when I was hospitalized in a psychiatric ward for the illness.)

Max freaked out when I told him I ""probably would kill myself if I went to the internship"" (my exact words). After sputtering for a few seconds and mentioning that he was scared for me, he said that he needed a break from the relationship.

Reddit, we talk again tonight (we both mutually agreed to do so), and I do not know what to say. I still want to make a relationship work with him, but I obviously want to respect Max's wishes if he feels like I am too much to handle. I was trying to be honest about my mental health and what I feared I would go through, but I think that I placed a lot of worry and anxiety on him instead. To be clear, I am not currently suicidal- I have been off my medication and therapy for a couple of months due to a lack of insurance coverage (long story), so I do feel a bit not myself.

How do I approach the conversation? How do I express my regret for worrying him (unnecessarily?)? Is there even a chance that he would want to get back together?

4ui24r,1,2016-07-25,How comfortable should I be with python before I can reasonably apply for an internship?,BlckJesus,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/4ui24r/how_comfortable_should_i_be_with_python_before_i/,"I'm a college student and I've been teaching myself python for the past 2 years and this past year getting a lot more serious with it. I'm comfortable with the majority of Python's syntax (except for some of the more obscure packages in the standard library), I've built a dynamic mock-website for myself using Django &amp; HTML/CSS/jQuery (but I haven't deployed it), made a few basic web scraping tools, and built a few very basic games using Blender's Game Engine.

I'm currently between jobs and applying to the places I usually would (retail, service industry), but then I wondered if there are any places that would hire me based off of what I already know. 

I guess I'm just curious at what point should I consider myself competent enough to apply for internship and entry-level job postings I see on craigslist/indeed/linkedin and whether I'm even close to that point yet?

4uis0y,7,2016-07-25,It's that time again!!,Channel_20_News_Net,Askasurvivor,https://www.reddit.com/r/Askasurvivor/comments/4uis0y/its_that_time_again/,"Hello again folks, you know what time it is! I'm Buck Johnson and this is the Channel 20 Wildlands News Load.

Our top story tonight: As covered exclusively by Channel 20 News, Alliance member states met in Albany last week to discuss preparations in their campaign against the Lunar Technocracy. Many topics were discussed, the relative strengths and weaknesses of each member, the possible uses of the rogue Hampshire AI known as Pandora in the war effort, Davey's apparent betrayal of everything the Alliance stood for to the Borsons, and the issue of Davey wanting to contribute to the emerging horde under the command of Death Empress by leading Children of Kane Direct Outcomes on a preemptive suicide run against her. But most interesting was their discussion of a surprise guest at the war talks. Apparently an AMR clone with the exact same features as the notorious outlaw Princess flew into the conference room through the window with FR Admiral Duvalle in tow. Headmistress Pearl of the FCC, mistaking her for Princess, immediately attacked the poor woman and would have killed her if the other delegates had not intervened. While these sorts of hair-trigger reactions are nothing new for FCC Smith, we are told President Trockle actually had to bring in Pearl's boyfriend, one Mike Wilcox the hero of Manhattan, to calm her down some. Once that was out of the way, the Alliance members concluded that given the unethical nature of the AMR program that produced TSmk1 or ""Laura""(which this channel would like to remind our viewers was approved of by AMR Co-President Bill ""Make eye contact and relax your throat"" Jameson) it was necessary to immediately launch a raid on the AMR research compound. I repeat, there is a multinational raid coming to the research center that created what many believe to be an angel. 

Speaking of things failing, the ongoing hunt for the dangerous half-infected legionnaire known as Cerberus continues as Princess and a half-infected identifying himself only as ""Crow"" track him across the wildlands. Our sources say that the bounty hunting duo at one point caught up with Cerberus but somehow managed to let him slip away. When our roving reporter Jack Dastardly attempted to question Princess about a possible romance developing between her and the giant blood sucking monster, our interns report he was murdered in a way too terrifying and strangely beautiful for us to describe on air. Regardless, Princess and Crow were last seen outside of an AMR outpost in Canada and are believed to be armed and extremely dangerous to anyone who has a sword instead of a gun. 

Moving on, trouble brews for Junetics LLC as a series of terrorist attacks were carried out on various Junetics locations all throughout the week. A group of half-infected rights activists calling themselves ""Gaia's Chosen"" have taken credit for the attacks and claim that they are striking a blow for half infected kind, citing Junetics's development and sale of zombie control towers that can allegedly control even the half-infected themselves. We sent our roving reporter Jack Nicolson to Greenland for an exclusive interview with their leader, Jeremy Floquet of the Free Republic, but Jack was sadly infected with the zombie virus, turned into a half-infected, and is reportedly living quietly in Harvest to this day. For their part, Junetics has released a statement two days ago that they are more than capable of defending their locations from any further terrorist attacks and that they will still be open for business despite their being ""unfairly targeted"". Junetics also brought out numerous half-infected testimonials condemning the actions of Gaia's Chosen as those of extremists and radicals that do not represent them as a species. Alice MacNeil, reportedly the leader of the attack that ignited conflict between the two groups, was later seen by our team of highly trained and highly underpaid interns humming a rhythmless tune to herself underneath the hanging corpse of one of the testifiers. As someone who once used Junetics brand shaving cream in the shower and it burned half his face off, give 'em hell boys. 

Word has apparently reached us that the mysterious group of pre-outbreak high-tech doomsday peppers known only as ""The Foundation"" has come under cyber attack by another organization of the same type called The Deity Organization. Foundation representatives claim that in response to the attack they located and infiltrated a Deity missile silo in Great Britain only for said facility to soon go dark as some sort of biohazard was released inside the base. 05 Steven Kelly, as a fellow old world post-apocalyptic organization, we wish you and the Deity Organization a merry round of killing each other. 

On to economic news, Kanite Dictator for Life Davey MacNeil announced earlier that his company/cult planned on partnering with Hells Navy of all people in the near distant future in order to launch a trade mission down the Mississippi river. Our condolences to the villages located along there. Further south, the insular Republic of Texas has announced their intention to once again form a new Texan currency or TEX in an attempt to feel special right alongside its northern neighbors. Economists from other nations quickly criticized the wisdom of such a move, one Prof. Creathian of the Institute of Hard Knocks even going so far as to claim that Texas had created ""the post-apocalypse version of the peso"". While I respect Creathian's opinion, this anchorman must point out that when he's throwing money at two caged strippers kissing each other he's not throwing TEX. Therefore your argument is invalid. 

And finally our last story for the hour, the hunt is on for Roy Rodgers, a private investigator sub-contracted by Channel 20 to report on the even more private Alliance war talks. Mr. Rodgers was on his way to the agreed drop off point in Texas to hand the network his unedited, uncensored copy of the war talks transcript when our sources in FRIA say he was ambushed by agents of the Free Republic and the transcript was destroyed. Our sources go on to mention that Mr. Rodgers agreed to abandon his contract with Channel 20 in favor of traveling to Duluth for an undisclosed reason on behalf of the FR. Most probable travel routes for Mr. Rodgers to take on his way to Minnesota will be provided to any bandit groups who inquire. Roy, I think I can speak for all of us here at Channel 20 when I say: B#tch where's my story?

Well that about raps it up for todays news update. Remember to keep tuning in and to keep those upvotes coming to see more of Channel 20 News in the future. Otherwise I should warn you we will be forced to disband and go back to the empty shells that were our lives and spouses we've secretly come to resent. See you tonight at home honey!

* I am an intern and the lease on the apartment I am presently staying at ends before my internship does. This will be happening in about 3 weeks.
* I presently pay about $700 a month for rent. Anything more than $400 a week would be pretty rough, about $200 a week or less would be best.
* My apartment is furnished so I have no furniture to get rid of. Pretty much everything I have with me can fit into my midsize SUV.
* While I can fit everything in my car I would prefer not to keep it all in there. Firstly, it would be rather cramped. Secondly, it gets pretty hot and I would be concerned about keeping my TV, speaker equipment, desktop, and monitor in it 24/7. I can drive home to leave stuff there if need be though. Between my computer hardware and musical instrument I have a decent bit of valuable stuff with me that I cannot afford to have stolen.
* I have a pet leopard gecko. Stays in her tank, which is about 2'x1'x1.25'.

I have checked on airbnb and craigslist without much luck. I plan on calling hotels around the area and seeing if I could do extended stay, per night prices are around $60+ normally.

Any advice on where to look for housing? "
4uj0oh,4,2016-07-25,Discussing Pay for Potential Job,Jabo13,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4uj0oh/discussing_pay_for_potential_job/,"I have worked an internship for a medium size company, (around 250 employees), the last semester and a half of college. I received low pay at $9.00/hr. but it was only an internship, and I was mainly there to receive to college credit to graduate anyways. I worked pretty much in one dimension as a Database Technician. Basically, I filed Database Reports for my supervisors, so they could view different aspects of the business.
  
The internship is coming to an end this week, and I graduated from my university last Friday. My boss told me that they could offer me a temporary job, (temporary, because I plan on pursuing my Masters starting January), from now until January. The job duties would be much more diverse than my current internship. I would be on the company's IT Support Staff and would mainly work in diagnostics and maintenance for the company's IT system. Also as a side note, my supervisor expressed heavy interest in me staying, going as far to say, ""In case you didn't catch it, we REALLY want you to stay.""

  
There are multiple reasons for me to not accept the job, most of which involve the fact that I had not planned on staying to work in my college town. The main reason for me to stay would be pay. Since I have now graduated and possess a Bachelor's Degree, and my new job would have many more duties than my current job, I would expect much higher pay than the current $9.00/hr. that I currently receive.  
  
I am meeting with my supervisor to discuss the details of the job tomorrow, and I was hoping to receive around $17-$18/hour which would be on par with the average entry-level IT job. I acknowledge that I may not receive that much due to the temporary nature of my presence at the company. However, the minimal rate that I have set in my head is $15/hr. Anything lower would not interest me to stay as there would be better opportunities back home for me to pursue.
      
How do I discuss this with my boss? I have never discussed pay before and generally accepted whatever rate I was given in a job because I have never worked at a ""skilled"" position before.  
  
TL/DR;  
I worked an internship for the past few months prior to graduating college. I have now graduated college and the company I interned at has offered me a temporary job. Temporary because I plan on pursuing my Master's degree 6 months from now. I expect a pay increase, but don't know how to discuss it. How should I go about discussing this?"

I'd appreciate your prayers, as it feels like I have a big decision to make. (I'm sorry this is so long, by the way)

I'm 20 years old and attend a non-denominational Charismatic church (I'd describe us as Pentecostal, but that's not quite right. Just think Arminian and continuationist). My pastor has been mentoring me to enter the ministry for the past four years. Under his guidance I've preached several times and have been invited to other churches to preach now and then.

For a little while now I've been growing increasingly discontent with my church. My pastor does more eisegesis than exegesis, and I disagree with plenty of the theology being taught. On top of that, I feel as if I've been cast to the wayside a bit.

I have a good friend named Nick who interns at a church located an hour from me in the city I live in while the college semester is in (the church I currently attend has ~100 members, while Nick's has ~800-900). This church is also non-denominational, but they're much more reformed in their beliefs. He's invited me to come up to his church and become a youth leader there, and if I do there is potential that, after I show myself as faithful, the pastors there will continue my mentorship and put me on staff as an intern as they have done with Nick, eventually leading to a pastoral position and better seminary payment options.

I seriously want to consider this. I need to talk with the pastors at this other church first, and continue discourse with my pastor. I love my pastor and the church I attend, and it's honestly heartbreaking to think about leaving. However, I feel like I'd be better utilized if I took Nick up on his offer, and the options it opens up in the future are much more numerous.

I'm seeking God's will in serious prayer about this. I would love it if you guys would pray with me.

Advice would also be greatly appreciated. I can expand more on anything you want. I value the opinions of everyone here.

Thanks a lot!"

1. College student , renting a house with three roomies in a small  town/city - India. 

2. Neighbor adopted two puppies when they were 25 days old. This was last August.

3. They used to wander over to our play and we played with them when they did. Would occasionally given them treats.

4. Left for my hometown for our internship break that December, when I returned - one of the puppies had died.

5. The other one whom we call Ditka (he doesn't respond to the name) , though staying at out neighbor's place, spends a ton of time at ours instead. 

6. Gets kicked out of their house in around Feb - March. We allow him to spend time and nights on our front porch... I play with him and give him Biscuits every night.

7. I leave in May for my semester break - return in July.

8. He's there , waiting for me on the day I arrive...the routine resumes.

9. Over the last two weeks, follows me around everywhere... Has me immensely worried, as the main road is very busy...and he's almost been run over a few times now while running to cross the street and follow me . Chases our bike when I'm off to college.

10. Follows only me, not the others.

11. After discussing it over in the thread linked to at the top of this post (please read if you have fhe time), I decide to adopt him till December...when I can hand him over to a shelter in my hometown which is a big city.

12. The town I live in is very small, there's a vet who ill be visiting the day after...but no dog trainers. So I'm alone

13. No experience with pets, except a few kittens that I used to babysit for an hour or so as a kid.

14. So I desperately need help . I've tried tricking him into entering our compound before locking the gate...but he slips through the bars.

15.  Our neighbors obviously never trained him, so he's a one year old dog...who stalks me ....albeit adorably and suicidally.

16. I desperately need tips on where to start. He needs a bath, I don't think he's ever had one. I also need to train him not to follow me around unless I say so. These are really important I think. Also name training, but I'm more concerned about behaviour.

17. I'm planning to tie iron wires between the gaps that he uses to squeeze through. But I'm afraid that he'll hurt himself trying to escape and follow me. 

18. I don't want to chain him up. I've always found it cruel, and such dogs are unusually aggressive.

19. Also, I'm at college between 9 and 5. I'm up at 5 though. In between, if I can train him to stay at home ...I'll also need to train not to be aggressive to strangers..as the landlord or his relatives sometimes come unannounced to check out the property.  Not to mention delivery men, and the electricity board guy who checks the meter. Usually when we're in college.

20. He usually wanders around outside, when I return He's there...when I go back inside he sometimes stays on the front porch or leaves and goes who knows where....but within hearing range as my footsteps generally bring him scurrying him to my side, tail wagging at the speed of light ...ready to stalk.

21. I bought him a rope bone which he ignores. But I've got a ball and another toy on the way.

22. Oh , my roommates won't allow him inside the house. He has to stay on the porch...I'm thinking  of a kennel for now but yeah.... that'll take a while

23. So please help!!! Any resources on where I can find training material etc

He even gives up food to follow me. I used to place a few Biscuits In front of him and walk away as he ate them. But now , he follows me and leaves the Biscuits...when I stop nearby he whines and turns towards the Biscuits but doesn't go there even though it's obvious that he wants to! For some reason, he's desperate to be with me 😦

My primary goal is to keep him from following me and to increase his chances of being adopted (as he will have basic training if I succeed)

Okay, it's not brief I'm sorry. I'm bad at summarizing.

TL;Dr - going to temporarily adopt a Stray that was abandoned by my neighbor. He has no training, about a year old... I have no experience with pets. He follows me around everywhere, which is a behaviour that I desperately need to correct as he's sure to get himself run over while crossing the road following me.

I also need help with resources regarding basic pet care and training. There are no professional trainers where I live. I hope to take him to the city in December and hand him over to a shelter. My goal with the training, is to keep him from killing himself and to increase his chances of being adopted as a previously trained dog!"
4ujjc6,2,2016-07-25,My (31f) boyfriend (35m) has been acting incredibly immature lately. He doesn't think he's doing anything wrong. I need help talking to him. Together ~3 years,randomthrowthisaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ujjc6/my_31f_boyfriend_35m_has_been_acting_incredibly/,"I'm not sure where to begin, so I guess I'll start by writing about the more recent weird/immature things he's done that have thrown me for a loop. 

* He's a smoker (I'm not), at the very least he knows I don't like being around it and won't smoke near me. When we go out together he'll smoke outside away from me. Recently he's decided to smoke at gas stations which has made me very uncomfortable. The first time this happened I kinda freaked out and was shocked he'd smoke while the gas was pumping. He calmly explained that any type of fire or explosion would be extremely rare and not likely to happen. This happened one more time when I was in the car with him, I told him that I don't want him to light up a cigarette at a gas station when I'm with him anymore. He continued to provide reasons to why anything bad happening is rare. I understand that's it rare and unlikely to happen, but I'd rather not be in a situation where a gas fire could happen. I tried to explain to him that accidents happen, people spill gas, tanks leak, someone could drop one of those plastic gas containers, etc. He didn't seem to care about those possibilities. FWIW, he no longer smokes at the gas station when I'm with him, but I'm quite sure he does this when he's by himself. 

* He stuck a metal knife in a wall socket while we were at a restaurant with two friends. Again, I was a little shocked he did this, I had a wtf the moment and asked him what the hell he was thinking. He then explained about how all outlets are made these days, and it was nearly impossible for anyone to electrocute themselves. I tried to explain to him that accidents still happen, we were in an old 70s/80s diner, an outlet had the possibility of being faulty or not installed properly. And that it was just weird in general for a 35 year old man to stick a knife in an outlet while we were eating with friends. Our friends didn't say anything, they just kinda awkwardly laughed at the situation and looked uncomfortable, and seemed weirded out that he was sticking a knife in a socket that was by our table.  

* I am currently saving up for a new car.  I decided to get a part time job that doesn't interfere with my regular 9-5 M-F office job. So, I'm working on weekends and some evenings at a nearby electronics store in the video game section. This isn't something I plan on continuing for much longer, I just wanted to speed up my ability to save up for a down payment for the car I wanted. My boyfriend is well aware of what I'm doing and I've told him that I won't be spending a lot of money until I get X amount of dollars saved up for my down payment. For his birthday I usually take him out to a nice restaurant (we both enjoy fine dining, so he usually takes me to a nice restaurant as well on my bday), this year I told him that because I'm trying to save money I won't be able to take him to an expensive restaurant, but I asked if I could cook him a nice home cooked meal instead (I'm a pretty good cook, I frequently get asked by friends and family to make a certain dish for their events). He threw a tantrum once I informed of this. First he was angry, then he was really sad... like tears were welling up in his eyes sad. I felt bad but continued to explain my situation of saving money, he eventually calmed down and agreed that me cooking for him would be okay for his bday. 

* He wants to plan an insanely expensive vacation for us to take next summer. His idea is to stay in a ~$600/night resort in Hawaii, we live on the east coast - plane tickets alone would be around $1k each to even travel that far. For travel and lodging that would easily cost around $6k, that's not including food, drink, entertainment, etc once we're actually over there. I haven't agreed to this trip because I think it's way too much, and not something I want to spend money on right now. But, he keeps talking like this trip is just going to magically happen and that we're actually going to go. He knows I'm not onboard with this, and he knows it. He'll just joke that he'll convince me eventually. 

* As I mentioned above, I'm trying to save up for a car. In a non joking way he'll try to tell me that I need to buy something like a $100k Tesla, or some other luxury car that I can't afford. He knows my finances and and tells me that I can afford a $700/mo payment, that it's not really too much money. Technically, yeah, I could spend $700/mo for a car payment...but that would leave very little left for savings, emergencies or anything else. He doesn't seem to get that. 

When I've brought up these weird instances to him, he just re-explains what he told me in the past. Doesn't think he's being unreasonable or unsafe. The conversation never changes when he explains his actions. 

The only thing that I can think of that may be causing him to act out more is my recent success in my main (full time) job. Excluding the part time job I took on, I know earn more money than him and I have a very promising future at my current company. Honestly, I could probably quick my part time job and I'd be fine financing a new car, but I want to reach my down payment goal quickly and I'm also having fun at my part time job. I've always been career oriented and I tend to stress about money and I worry that I may not have enough to be safe or secure. He has always been more of a risk taker, he doesn't have a formal degree but has always managed to have steady work doing a little bit of everything. He taught himself how to code, so he'll make good money building websites by freelancing. He's a great writer and makes a decent amount off of his blog. He'll also do almost any kind of work that comes his way - he's extremely popular in our small town and will sometimes be asked to host events or speak. He's extremely charismatic, intelligent, funny, handsome and always well dressed. He's always been able to find random work that pays well. He's always been adamant about how office jobs or regular 40 hour a week jobs were never for him, that he could never do something like that and the most successful people make their own schedules, etc etc. I've always stayed down a safe path - I did well in school, I graduated on time, I went to grad school, I participated in internships, started an entry level position, worked my way up in my company, set goals and achieved them for myself, took online classes to supplement in areas where I may not have had much experience, etc. He's a wildcard and just follows the wind, and it's worked well for him. 
   
**tl;dr**: My boyfriend has been doing immature things like smoking at gas stations, sticking a knife in an outlet, thinks we can afford a $7-10k trip to Hawaii, wants me to buy a $100k Tesla and thinks his reasoning for all of things is totally normal. "
4ujkd3,26,2016-07-25,"[iOS] 2nd Month in an Unpaid Internship. I've learned how to make a pretty reliable standalone app, and now my manager and I don't know what to do to make the most of my time.",Awric,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/4ujkd3/ios_2nd_month_in_an_unpaid_internship_ive_learned/,"Sorry that I couldn't come up with a better title, the situation is hard to make concise. 

So I am very lucky to get this unpaid internship at a startup for an iOS app. I went from not knowing how to program or even identify what a method is in a function to being able to create a productivity app on the iPhone programatically. Off the top of my head, the app required me to make use of: Tableviews, design patterns, single responsibility principle (making my project readable by other programmers and making each method efficient), parsing JSON, networking with JSON, using third party tools from open source github repos (like FBShimering, AFNetworking, etc), and more. 

This took me about two months to really understand what's going on, and I can say that I've learned a lot at a pretty fast pace. My work hours are from 8am - 4pm M-F. 

Anyway, I have approximately a month left at this internship, and at this point we're not exactly sure what I should be doing in order to really make the most of my time. The argument is, sure, I can continue to *practice* creating apps and making them better, or even move on from productivity apps with only tableviews to creating productivity apps with collection views. But the thing is I already know those things exist, and I can do that without guidance because I know what questions to ask and I have an idea of what to do when I'm stuck.

I feel the purpose of an internship is to really make use of the mentor / manager by encountering things that I will have trouble finding an answer to and having him teach me how to answer it. He gave me a project to work on that he personally wanted to create himself, and we encountered a few questions that we *both* can't answer, and after 2 days of no progress, we feel that it's better that I move on to something more productive.

Right now, his suggestion is for me to study advanced data structures with the online free MIT Courses. The reason why I'm a little hesitant about this is I don't want to use my time in this internship with an online course that already has answers. 

Anyway, my question to you guys is : Should I be studying advanced data structures? If there are any of you who were ever in my situation before, what is the best thing I should be doing?

I want to be a reliable iOS dev in the future, and when I put on my resume that I've had an internship for 2-3 months, I want to be able to exceed the expectations of someone who has my amount of experience. Ultimately, I really want to be a greater developer to get a paying job. Am I in the right direction? What would you do better?

Thanks, sorry for the wall-o-text!"

Now I'm wanting to move into cyber security, though I'm not completely willing to fork out the money and time for college since I learn better and faster on my own anyways. I was wondering how well employers regard the CEH in comparison to an associates or bachelors. Is it even helpful or do most employers flat out require college in the security field since it is a more sensitive one than other I.T. branches?"
4ujwr9,0,2016-07-25,[Idea] Prince/Dark Prince COMPLETE OVERHAUL,QuaternionsRock,ClashRoyale,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashRoyale/comments/4ujwr9/idea_princedark_prince_complete_overhaul/,"Hey guys, it's Q again! It's been awhile, but I'm back! The title says it all; I've been drafting some ideas I have to make the Prince and Dark Prince more interesting to use cards, without making them more powerful. Without further adieu, here it is!

# Prince

*(Note: numbers parentheses describe a level 1 Prince)

* Increase damage by 4% (from 240 to 250)
* Decrease hitpoints by 27% (from 1100 to 800)
* Increase shield hitpoints by ∞% (from 0 to 200)

# Dark Prince

* Increase elixir cost to 5 (from 4)
* Increase area damage by 11% (from 135 to 150)
* Increase hitpoints by 14% (from 700 to 800)
* Increase [attack radius](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashRoyale/comments/4shumt/the_attack_radii_of_every_area_damage_troop_in/) by 50% (from 1 to 1.5)

# Reasoning

I really think that adding a shield to the Prince will be a blessing for those in lower arenas. It never made sense to me why one Prince had a shield and one didn't, and even less so that the first ever shield in the game comes at Arena 7.

As for the Dark Prince, it's about fricken time he was taken seriously. He always had the capacity to be a killer 5 Elixir card, but some intern at Supercell had a bit too much whisky one night and decided to make him cost 4. I'm honestly even considering making his damage 175 instead of 150, to make him even more valuable.

What do you guys think? Should the 5 Elixir Dark Prince have 175 damage or 150? Don't forget to leave your comments below! As always, this is Q, and **see you in the Arena**.

4uk188,6,2016-07-25,F4A - A cliché with a twist,1995jess1995,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4uk188/f4a_a_cliché_with_a_twist/,"Here's the cliché: You caught me looking at adult material at work. You're going to call me into your office, threaten to fire me, and make me do things to keep my job that I so badly need. Your office is large, with one wall entirely made of glass and overlooking the street. Your secretary is loyal, hard working, she turns a blind eye when you groom the young intern into your personal obedient sex-employee.

Here's the twist: the website you caught me looking at was DPP. You've been biding your time, following my posts, learning my kinks, seeing what makes me tick. The last girl you manipulated, she just stole from the supply cupboard - you made her suck you off. But me? You're going to make me play out every single one of my DPP posts for real if I want to keep my job.

...

This is a cliché that I particularly enjoy, the idea of being blackmailed and used and being helpless. The twist adds another layer of humiliation - being made to play out my secret fantasies in real life will be hugely embarrassing, and I won't be able to avoid being turned on by my torture, and it'll all be my own doing. The beauty of this idea is that any fantasy that either of us have, any role play idea, we can work into this as part of my '**fictional** DPP post history'

4uk2b9,11,2016-07-25,"My sister, Nimbus and the Middle East Cold War (xpost from RBN)",JonSnowledge,JUSTNOFAMILY,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/4uk2b9/my_sister_nimbus_and_the_middle_east_cold_war/,"My 2nd oldest sister and I have had a tumultuous relationship since I can remember. We can be cordial and even close, which was an improvement from when we were kids. She used to bully and intimidate me endlessly. Especially since she grew 6"" tall at a young age. She's hit me before several times, she has a louder voice and is just generally more intimidating than I. I'm usually averse to confrontation and I just shut down when I feel an argument coming.

I'm calling her Nimbus because she can cast a shadow over anything and anyone she doesn't like or agree with. More often than not, things are black or white to her and she can argue with you if you believe otherwise over and over again till one of you is hoarse. 

She can be appallingly rude to people she's just met, including my SO (I'll make that post another day). One time our cousin introduced us to her friend. Cousin's friend was named Bosco. Without missing a beat, Nimbus says loudly ""Bosco? That's a dog's name!"" Awkward...

**Main Story**


Like I said, Nimbus and I haven't always been best of friends and things came to a head a week and a half ago when we were discussing women's rights in Saudi Arabia. I was saying that legally they are forbidden to drive and she was contradicting this (or maybe I misunderstood her I don't know). She stomped off to the bedroom as I was googling to prove I was right. Again, maybe I misunderstood her and we were talking at cross purposes the whole time. She came back out to yell at me about how she was right but I had already mentally shut down. As well as height, she's also heavier than me and she was spreading her arms wide so it just felt overly confrontational. My mum and brother piped in to tell her to simmer down.


She went back to the bedroom and ranted to my cousin then posted some passive aggressive texts on our extended family Whatsapp group. Basically that she wants to move out and she's tired of pretending to be nice blah blah whine whine... One cousin responded with a suggestion for a place to stay but basically no one addressed the rest of her rants.
Next morning I woke up when she had just left for work. She texted me this after she left:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; *Nimbus*: I don't know if you have noticed, but are really condescending and know-it-all it is super annoying. When it comes to matters religion or just general facts... Well, now that you are taking your depression pills it is a lot easier to ignore.


I was diagnosed with severe depression early this year and I've been taking meds and therapy. It took a lot to come out that I was suffering but I have since been more open about the condition so all my immediate family know. 

Also I'm an atheist and my family knows this. Some are religious and I don't say anything to them of it unless they bring it up. My sister doesn't go to church and isn't particularly religious. We usually had what I thought were debates on religion but usually started with her baiting me or saying something about atheism to get under my skin.


&gt; *Nimbus*: Take last night for example... We were both right. But you insist on going out of your way to other people wrong you did not even bother to get what I was saying.
&gt; 
&gt;  I know that Dubai is in the UAE and I never said that it wasn't. But I did say that women in Abu Dhabi and Dubai are allowed to drive. Yes, I missed the term 'foreign'.
&gt; 
&gt;  Why would I think that Dubai is in Saudi Arabia?
&gt; 
&gt;  You said that women Arab countries are allowed to drive except for Saudi Arabia... You also missed the word foreign. Dude, it's the same damn thing.
&gt; 
&gt;  My point is your condescending attitude is a bit out of control. And arguing with you can also get of control that is why I chose to text it instead.
&gt; 

I at first answered ""K"" and let it sit till the next day when I picked up the conversation.

&gt;  *Me*: If hurting my feelings by going for the one thing I'm most insecure about was the goal, you've succeeded. I hope you feel better.
&gt; I'm sorry for anything rude I may have ever said or done to you. It's wrong because I wasn't considering how my actions or words made you feel. From now on I will never argue with you.
&gt; Let me know if there's anything else I can do.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; *Nimbus*: Don't play victim with me...
&gt; 
&gt;  I am fine with that decision. 
&gt; 
&gt; You are so quick to consider your own feelings hurt and your own insecurities without regard to what my feelings and insecurities are... You are not the only one with those.
&gt; 
&gt; You hurt my feelings and my insecurities each time you condescend me and I ignore them each time. I know I lash out, but each time you just laugh and make look and feel me stupid... I have brought that to your attention and now you know how that feels when somebody does that.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; *Me*: I'm sorry.
&gt; 
&gt;  You resent my presence in your life. There's not much I can do about that. We'll just stay out of each other's way as much as possible.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; *Nimbus*: Girl, I only have one problem with you and I have let you know which one. 
&gt; 
&gt; You can take it however you want. 
&gt; 
&gt;  I am done.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; *Me*: Have you considered that maybe you haven't been nice either
&gt; 
&gt;  Maybe you've become mean and selfish to not just me but practically everyone in the house.
&gt; 
&gt;  I get into it with just you. You get into it with everyone in the whole house. Think about it. Maybe you've been mean and condescending to everyone including me. 
&gt; 
&gt;  The heavy sighs and the eye rolls and the attitude when someone asks what to you seems like a stupid question. Everyone has noticed.
&gt; 
&gt;  Think about it. You are literally the only person who confronts me about religion. Why does it bother you so much? The churchgoing members of the family don't even seem to care as much. 
&gt; 
&gt;  Maybe it's your attitude, your issues, your stress and resentment. I've apologized for my part. 
&gt; 
&gt;  I'm done too.
&gt; 
&gt;  You're fond of saying how I have issues. At least I'm getting help instead of lashing out on everyone... Mock me for taking pills for a medical condition. Maybe I should do it your way and yell at my favorite punching bag, right? Your way of sulking at everyone and banging about in the kitchen is better? Instead of therapy with a doctor I should snap at my mother or threaten with physical intimidation? You're perfect right?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; *Nimbus*: Like I said, I am done.
&gt; 
&gt;  All this because I called you condescending. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  Keep taking those pills... You need them
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; *Me*: Implying that my mental health is inferior to yours is literally the definition of that word.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; *Nimbus*: YOU CAN INSULT ME BUT WHEN I DO YOU ARE VICTIM NOW!! 
&gt; 
&gt; GET OUT OF HERE WITH THAT
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; *Me*: How have I insulted you
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; *Nimbus*: I have told that I have one issue with you, that is your condescending attitude... I could have chosen to have a yelling match with you... But I have not. 
&gt; 
&gt; Now you have resorted to attacking me and using everyone else as your back bone... 
&gt; 
&gt;  I had one issue with you and I have let you know... You can decide to change it or not
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  *Me*: I'm the one who went ranting to the family group?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; *Nimbus*: I am done with this conversation....
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; *Me*: I'm the one who rolls eyes at everyone and sighs like a martyr at the slightest question. Seriously if anyone here is condescending its you 
&gt; 
&gt;  You're the one who opened this conversation but I'm the bad guy 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; You bait me into debates and I'm the one who's attacking you? 
&gt; 
&gt;  You imply that I'm insane and yet I'm the one insulting you? 
&gt; 
&gt; You use all caps at me and I'm the one fighting? 
&gt; 
&gt; Good for me for being spared your yelling, right? You're the nice one for sparing me a tongue lashing. I should be grateful. Thank you so much 
&gt; 
&gt;  You know what, I refuse to be bullied by you anymore and if that makes me condescending I'll tattoo it on my forehead proudly.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; *Nimbus*: I opened the conversation and from your reply yesterday, we were done.
&gt; But you chose to continue.
&gt; I chose not to yell, not for you, but for me. I did not want to get into it with you because it always gets out of control. Like it has now.
&gt; Trust me, nothing I have done has been for you.
&gt; I used all caps because I was frustrated by your self victimisation.
&gt; I had an issue with you and I chose to confront you. You can decide to do something with that or not.
&gt; If that is bullying you. Then fine.
&gt; I get that you are mad that I brought up your meds. That is fine. Be mad.
&gt; You want to win. Fine. I would really like to be done with this conversation. You are right. I am wrong.
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt;  *Me*: You literally started this whole thing by baiting me as you usually do then taking it round in circles.
&gt; What you see as me continuing is me refusing to back down and obey her majesty
&gt; It gets out of control because when you feel your argument is not holding up you start making personal attack, yelling, standing over me because you know you're taller and louder. You've used violence before too. Stop pretending you're doing me a favour by withdrawing some of your abusive methods. I've seen you look at me like you literally want me gone.
&gt; You're a bully and there is nothing fine about that 
&gt;

At this I stopped talking and haven't said anything else. I know how much she loves to have the last word so let her have it. We live with our parents, I'm still a full time law student. She has a job as a developer at a bank and is planning to move out soon.
I was even starting to doubt myself and think that I'm somehow crazy. I don't know how to cope until she moves away. We share a bedroom but I sleep on the top bunk with my cousin whose on an internship. Nimbus and I are on a cold war right now. This is the longest one yet.

What is a good setup for producing on the road? I already have an awesome computer to take with me, but I could really use some suggestions as far as headphones that will be ok for someone who is really used to monitors.

here's the kicker though: I don't have a lot of money for these. Trying to keep it under 150.

What I've considered thus far:

V-Moda M300's (they're super tough headphones and I hear people use them for production as well as DJing)
Sennheiser HD280's

Let me know some other suggestions, or other gear I may want to bring with me. Already planning on bringing a 25 key midi keyboard as well (an Axiom 25)"

4uk9zd,3,2016-07-25,How do you prepare so you avoid burnout?,09cjones1,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/4uk9zd/how_do_you_prepare_so_you_avoid_burnout/,"Hi guys, I'm hoping that you can maybe give me some advice!  Everyone seems friendly and willing to share their experiences!

I've been lurking on here for quite some time.  I lost 20 pounds with CICO a few months back but have since returned to my unhealthy emotional eating habits.  I lost about 50 pounds a few years ago in college but did not do it through developing lifelong healthy eating patterns.

I tend to get burned out and start feeling like monitoring my eating and ""restricting"" it (i.e. not eating cake every time I'm upset) is too difficult.  For reference, I'm working a full-time job and a part-time job, have a graduate school internship, and am in charge of most of the cleaning and all of the errands and financials in my apartment (it is just me and my husband).  And honestly, my husband is my biggest stressor, although that's something for r/relationships, and we will be starting counseling this week.  All of my calorie counting, meal planning and prepping, trying to avoid going out to eat needs to be done by me and me alone.

So, what do you guys do to avoid burnout?  I just get overwhelmed with everything going on around me; I can stick to things really well for a few days and then I just don't have the emotional energy to keep logging and thinking about what I eat.  I want to though because it makes me so much happier and confident.

I want to start CICO again tomorrow (I'm at work all day and am eating work food, didn't bring healthy alternatives).  So far I've made a bunch of healthy, lower calorie freezer dinners for my chest freezer that I'm really excited about (thanks, u/saltandprepper).  I'm thinking about getting some bath bombs to use as a stress relief and reward in lieu of cake.  I've read the FAQs, particularly about binge eating, but that isn't really a problem for me.  Any more ideas?


TL;DR: I get burned out while working on my eating habits easily and want some tips on how to prepare so that it doesn't happen again."
4ukfkj,7,2016-07-25,What should I do from here? I'm stuck beyond belief.,Gottagetajob91,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/4ukfkj/what_should_i_do_from_here_im_stuck_beyond_belief/,"I graduated in May 2015 as an Actuarial Science major with a 3.44 GPA. Since then (or technically since the fall until deciding to put focus on my cross country road trip since I wasn't getting any responses, and then starting again after my return), I have applied to both actuarial (which I also email actuaries from that company for when doing so) and non-actuarial positions, did several interviews (even a phone screening for an actuarial position as recently as a 1.5 weeks ago), but no luck. 

The good news is that I know exactly where I want to go (Property and Casualty Insurance, and yes I've applied to Life/Health/Pension companies too), so it's not like I completely lack direction in my career aspirations, the problem for me has been getting the first job that will directly/indirectly open every opportunity imaginable. Considering I did make it to the interview that would have next led to a job offer three times (one of the positions being actuarial six months ago), I imagine my interview skills (in terms of knowing how to answer the questions the right way) are a large part of why I'm still on the search, but I just don't fully know anymore.

I have my resume attached (perhaps a cover letter will follow), and I would most certainly welcome any advice you guys may have for a still-aspiring actuary who's a year or more into his job search. It is also worth mentioning that I am willing to relocate, and money is not an issue for me (without giving too much information, I'm in a fortunate position that getting even tangentially related experience has been my main concern). 

ADDENDUM: At the risk of sounding haughty, I'd like to ask one more thing, if you're here JUST to type ""Man you fucked up"" or ""Oooh, this is bad, you're screwed"" without offering any input to point me in the right direction, please don't. I could probably write a novel on the millions of things I could have done differently to not be in this predicament (including but not limited to learning about this field earlier, asking professors for help in my hardest of classes which also got in the way of me trying to find an internship when I was able to apply for them, and much more), I'm well aware of it all and I'm clearly still feeling the repercussions from them, so I don't need to be reminded again. It's been very **VERY** hard for me to keep it together, and the last thing I want to do is use up all my energy that could go into directly making me more employable on past mistakes. 

Sorry for sounding a bit moody there, one thing I want to add is an answer at least one of you may ask, ""What have you been doing all this time?"". When appropriate (particularly in a cover letter, which I may post later here or on a new thread), I would say something like: 

*""This is a skill (multitasking, as an example from one of my cover letters) that is still being applied today in my ongoing journey to learn and become better-rounded going into this field. Each day would be spent tackling and prioritizing numerous tasks such as continuing my studies for the CAS/SOA exams, continuing my research on insurance topics (especially related to the ***industry that company specializes in***), conducting private tutor sessions, and networking.""*  

If there's anyway I can explain myself better when asked this (and there probably is), again, I could use all the help I can get.

Sorry for the very long read, but thanks!

As the title says, I graduated from a Master's Degree in Software Engineering. I decided to take a gap year to go to the US and improve my english. 

It's been almost 6 months, my english isn't perfect, but it is better, I can have a decent conversation with anyone. 

Now, all I need to do is to find a job. The thing is, I don't really have a lot of experience except the internships I did for my Bachelor's and Master's. Even though I have some side projects, I don't think they will be of great use. 

I have been thinking of the current possibilities for me, I can either go back to France and find a company to get some experience OR I can try to find a job here in the US.

From what I know, to work in the US, I will have to find a sponsor. I don't have a lot of information for the procedures, nor do I know if it is easy to get one.

Now, I need some advice, and I figured out that posting this here might help.

I will mostly be using it to play games but I also will be using it to do all of my work in coding as well as the occasional video edit.

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

I worked hard this summer for an internship and earned a nice pile of money so I am rewarding myself. I would like to keep it under $1,000 but have been known to throw budgets to the wind.

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

within a month.

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)** 

I have a 25es hp monitor and a gaming mouse. I will be buying a corsair k70 rgb most likely and a second 25es eventually. don't feel obligated to include those in the price unless you have extra money to hit a grand.

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

I live in Indiana (indianapolis or west lafayette) but my internship is in michigan 15 minutes from a microcenter however i leave the 28th of july.


&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

reusing monitor and mouse. Thought about buying a case and guts off craigslist and upgrading everything necessary... any thoughts on that?

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

no, not at this stage in my computing knowledge

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

I would like a ssd and then a large second drive but I don't really know why aside from quicker bootups. let me know if thats unnecessary 

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

I would like a cool case but its not a dealbreaker. id splurge for leds and color coordinating, etc if you think itd make me get the ladies and isnt a ton more.

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

I go to university so i can get super cheap copies of windows.
&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**
I would love a future(ish) proof setup ill soon be running duel monitors and maybe my 4k tv to push movies and shit who knows. let me know but have fun spending my money!"

4ulxsb,1,2016-07-25,Parsing variable spacings from a generated file,TNSEG,excel,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/4ulxsb/parsing_variable_spacings_from_a_generated_file/,"Greetings /r/excel, I apologize if this is long winded, but I'm trying to explain my need and rational the best I can.

So, I've been toying with this for a few days and have drawn a blank with this last piece of the puzzle.

A little background, I'm working this summer as an intern for a contracting company. One task I've acquired as part of my responsibilities is inputting the time cards for the crews for the week. The way this is done is, I receive the paper timecards, of the previous day. I take these and input them into a commercial construction software (CCS), that is accessed through a remote desktop connection. Once all the timecards for the week are put in, we have to make sure everything is correct, then generate a report, and send that off to payroll. 

The problem I've had is with the report. I haven't had a week yet, nor has my supervisor prior to me joining the team when he did these, where payroll hasn't found something we've missed. One issue is that our foreman are relatively new, so they're learning the system, and make mistakes on the paper timecards (and I don't get to really go over the cards directly with them). The other, is there are a lot of little easy to miss things. 

The main things we're looking for in the report are to make sure that each employee and piece of equipment is being charged to a cost code with labor or equipment hours respectively, each piece of equipment is tracked for exactly 40 hours, and each employee has 40 regular hours, and how ever many overtime hours they've worked. 

So I discovered in the CCS that there is a way to print a text file report (vs actual printing or pdf which we were doing to review it prior). Using this, I'm created this VBA program to check all of these criteria for me, and help me more quickly, and more accurately catch any mistakes. 

Now what I need help with is better parsing the file. The file uses spaces to align the items, and maintain columns for each day of the week. I'm using RegEx to break each space separated section into a comma separated section, and then from there I can run my checks.    
***        
The issue I have is in cases where we get a new piece of equipment in midway through the week, or in CCS I forget to input a ""0"" if someone misses a day of work. In these cases, the columns are just spaces, so what ends up happening is if piece of equipment A came in on Wednesday, when my program runs, it looks like it was there on Monday, and we just forgot to track it for Thursday and Friday. 

Here is the VBA Source: http://pastebin.com/duVLbMAP

Here is the excel sheet, and a sample of the file. 
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-Y5B2pA-UFTSk1sc3E1VlQwYUk

You can see, ""Dirt Mover A1234"" came in on a Wednesday, but if you run the program (""Sanity Check"" button on the ""Output"" sheet) it looks like it was there on Monday. 


Hopefully this makes sense, if not please dont hesitate to ask questions. Thank you for any help!"

I wanted to call upon some industry advice about my career and internship opportunities while in school.

This Fall I start my senior year. I currently have a 3.9 GPA and have been working towards a degree that focuses on PR, Social, and Community Management. Last Spring I interned at a small theatre company assisting them in establishing their newly launched social channels. 

This Summer, I worked on the Social Team at a large organization and it was great! However, due to a last minute change of plans my Fall Internship fell through. Finding a new one has proven difficult, as most are either past deadline or do not fit my full-time course schedule. 

My goal is to work Community Management/Social Media in the games industry. Though I am fearful it will look bad that I was only working my on-compus job/attending class in the fall.

I plan to continue podcasting/working with photoshop as side projects, and hope to start moderating larger subreddit's/FB groups in my free time. Additionally, I've taken on the role of controlling all social accounts for my school's newspaper and have become the lead content producer on an on-campus TV show. 

Do you think missing out on an internship is going to reflect negatively on my resume? 

Thanks all! "

The issue is the job is full time and will conflict with my school schedule so it's between continuing school and working a crappy job for 15 hours a week or quitting and actually working full time and making decent money.

So I'm torn...

* One friend says it'd be a mistake to quit persuing my degree because I will hit a hard cap to how far I'll advance in my career without a degree.

* My mom says she thinks I should finish my degree but also understands that you can make it without a degree in programming.

* The internet says you can definitely get by without a degree.

I am going to be a freshman engineering student looking to major in electrical engineering with a minor in computer science, that is if I get accepted (or a 3.50 GPA).

I've looked into the study abroad program at Texas A&amp;M Qatar and am very interested in participating for the fall semester of my sophomore year. I think it would be a great experience going overseas, learning their culture, and hopefully getting to apply to internships in the Middle East, which is where I want to live and work when I am older.

Does anyone, whether having gone through the program or not, have any suggestions as to make my application stronger? These are what I am hoping can get me in:

* I speak a little bit of Arabic. Not sure how applicable this is.

* I plan on joining IEEE, a service organization, and possibly the Arabic club.

* I am going to work my hardest to get as close to a 4.00 GPA as possible, but then again, so is everyone else!

* I am planning on engaging in undergraduate research while in College Station, and if accepted to the program, in Doha. 

Thanks for any guidance! I will happily answer any questions if needed. Gig 'em."

I've recently come to realize that I have a very specific pattern in my dating life and have learned that it's referred to as ""Serial Monogamy"". So I'm here in part to admit once and for all that I've been a serial monogamist my entire dating life, but also to give a little background and hopefully get a little bit of advice from any generous souls who read this and have helpful suggestions.


I had my first serious relationship was when I was 15 years old. We dated for I don't remember how long but soon after we split up I met the girl I'd eventually lose my virginity to and date for almost 3 years. Following my second break-up, I had a few lustful pursuits, but nothing reciprocated until I met my third girlfriend, no more than some months later. We stayed together through college (which is a clear sign to me of my attachment issues--this was not a great relationship and I stayed in it way too long until SHE dumped me, which comes at no surprises to me now in hindsight.) Following the end of that 3yr relationship, that same summer I met my next 3yr girlfriend, with whom I would eventually get an apartment, and move states for. She was a really good partner, but I screwed it up with how I used to be (although I was an emotionally very warm and affectionate partner, I was not open, had a lot of jealousy, and was a very poor communicator.) We eventually split--with her breaking up with me (again, no surprise there). I enjoyed a late-summer, fall, winter and early-spring of Bachelor living, and was soon consumed with Graduate school (but was certainly still someone who yearned for connection and partnership) and eventually began hooking-up with a classmate/friend. 


[Side note: throughout these periods of non-relationship, there were other people who could have just as easily filled the position of 'partner' for me, but it was for purely practical reasons (they were transferring after the semester, or they were doing an internship somewhere else) that it didn't work out with them. I see now I have in the past 'settled' for the people I would come to partner with. I wasn't taking just anything or anyone who crossed my path, but I can tell I was attracted to people who were interested in me, rather than really finding what I truly wanted in a relationship and going for that.]


Okay, so , back to my most recent ex: I told her in the beginning that I didn't want a serious relationship, but I know my strong affection probably showed otherwise. After a few months of 'just having fun' (or so I wanted) she asked if she could call me her boyfriend, and I think out of fear for losing her I said yes. We had a pretty good relationship, moved in together eventually, and dated for a little over four years. No surprise, the relationship doesn't work out, but this time I was the one who broke it off. I realized I was unhappy, and that she was unhappy. She wanted more from me, and I don't blame her, but ""it"" just wasn't there. I didn't have more to give. I was trying--but forcing an effort, and who wants that. I stopped kidding myself and pulled the plug. It was hard. I made a lot of sacrifices for her, and tried to give her what she needed--but i realized I wasn't being honest with myself and wasn't getting what I needed--and wasn't even sure if I knew what it was that I wanted!

So flash to today--guess who's in a new relationship? Yep. Quick backstory and then I'll wrap this up. So I got on online dating a few weeks after I moved out. I was feeling like i'd been locked up all these years and was eager to see what was out there. All these apps didn't exist really when I was dating before, so I got really excited about it. I could tell most of the people I went on dates with could have easily been someone I'd enjoy spending time with, but there were a few I didn't call back--and so I know I'm not that hopelessly co-dependent. And I was also dating multiple people, which I think was good for me because it allowed me to end things with some of them in preference for what I felt was a better fit--but all this time I was obviously still seeking partnership. So about a month after my four year relationship I met someone outside of the online scene--IRL, in person, out somewhere. I was pretty excited about her, but asked to keep it casual, which she was apparently cool with a few months ago, about six months in to us seeing each other at least once every week (so, again, no surprise here--but it seems my understanding of my relationships only works backwards, with my hindsight goggles on). She got upset about not being able to call me her boyfriend. I like this girl. I'm not sure she's totally right for me--but I like figuring it out. We're officially boyfriend and girlfriend now, but not without a bit of compromising on my part. I didn't want to stop seeing her, so I thought ""I'll agree to this, as long as I promise myself i'll be honest with how this relationship is progressing. I will do my best to determine my needs in this relationship and express them to her; will not become a chameleon like before; I'll pursue my own interests and share them with her in hopes that she'll welcome my personality."" Aaaand so on.


Okay, so in closing, I took a test recently that said I have a Fearful-Avoidant attachment style, which I sort of agree with, but my upbringing doesn't really match the description. My mother was an extremely affectionate parent, and loved unconditionally, always there for us. Buuut, I do remember having separation anxiety as a child. I would throw a fit when I was dropped off at pre-school, and often worried that she would never come back. If she was ever late coming home from work, even until my adolescence, I would worry.


But anyways, here I find myself in doubt in this new relationship--now primed with all this past experience and new cursory psychology-101 knowledge. I'm riddled with thoughts of ""what if this is just another dot in my pattern?"" which I feel is hurting the relationship and clouding me with hesitation. I feel more self-aware now, but I think in a way that's making things worse. I have a guard up. I'm reluctant. We started off with me expressing my need for independence and now here I am compromising on that and not trusting that it is what I wanted to do.


I do really well with reading as part of my self-improvement. I'm hoping there's something that would be good to read for people in my situation.


Thanks for reading and sharing your thoughts.


Warmest wishes,
The Monogaman

TL;DR;  30 yr old male serial monogamist with fearful-avoidant attachment style is doubting his current relationship because of previous dating patterns and wants to make sure he does things right this time--and clears away the reluctance and hesitation that are getting in the way of the new relationship.

4umiww,128,2016-07-25,My [25/M] SO's [22/F] mom is pretty nutty. I don't really know how to handle it. She's the biggest source of stress in our relationship.,mysosmomiscrazy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4umiww/my_25m_sos_22f_mom_is_pretty_nutty_i_dont_really/,"Hey y'all, 

SO [Jen] and I have been together for about 6 months and it's been going great. We just have a great natural rhythm and communication. We picked up on the other's quirks and how to make ourselves 'heard'. Part of this is definitely due to her mom being a therapist and holding her daughter to an absurd expectation for communication. It's pretty much just been them her whole life so they have a really weird dynamic. They moved like once a year, so Jen never was really in one place long enough to form strong lasting relationships with anyone but her mom. 

From my outside perspective, their relationship is just weird and kind of messed up. Her mom can turn on her in a second and go from 'we're the perfect team' to 'you're not on my team' (her mom uses language like this all the time. I could just not be accustomed to it, but it seems very black and white). 

Jen is constantly worried she's going to upset her and is pretty much always walking on egg shells. Her mom says things like ""well, I tell clients you were the most difficult child I know"", which is just laughable. I mean, seriously, all through college she talked to her mom every day, kept her updated in the happenings of her personal life, and went out of her way to help her on a consistent basis. Jen has barely drank, never done drugs, graduated with a 3.8 GPA and handled the financial side of her mom's practice for the better part of three years. Ffs, my mom would be over the moon if my brother and I were even 1/4 as close with her during college. 


Her mom has also decided she hates me. It started as a pretty impersonal 'having a boyfriend now will hold you back and you'll waste your youth like me' (her mom got pregnant at 22). I shrugged this off. They have a close relationship and obviously she's going to be protective. I'm a couple years older so she was skeptical. Whatever. I figured she'd get to know me and we'd be all hunky dory (when she met me before we started dating she was quite fond of me). I've never had a girlfriend whose parents didn't like me and my friends parents have always liked me. I wasn't really worried. 


Well, that didn't work out so well. Her mom has pretty much decided I'm a disrespectful (one time I waited 5 minutes to greet her when she stopped by Jen's apartment because I was wrapping up something time-sensitive), drug using (she's an anti-vaxxor and found out I'm on anti-depressants) menace that is destroying her relationship with her daughter  


I won't deny that I've encouraged Jen to stand up to her mom when helping her will would have negative repercussions in her life. e.g:


Jen, very apologetically, told her mom she could not spend the entire day driving out to the middle of nowhere to pick up a desk because she absolutely did not have time. She was leaving for a two month internship in two days and was behind on preparing. This, apparently, was 'a deeply personal offense' and 'a betrayal'; Jen obviously 'did not understand how important this desk was to her new office' (I wish that wasn't almost verbatim). Even better, the one reason she was behind on preparing was that she had spent a few days painting said new office instead of packing/shopping/etc. In that moment, her mom still somehow felt that their relationship had been one sided and Jen wasn't holding up her end. 

Another fun one was when her mom made a fuss over feeling neglected while Jen was wrapping up finals week of her last semester. Which, alone, would have been absurd, but Jen was taking 21 credits and seriously behind because she got pneumonia halfway through the semester. She was in serious panic mode and her mom was throwing a fit over her not being responsive enough. 

Her mom obviously frustrates me, but after overstepping a bit and criticizing her mom, mostly out of shock, in the beginning of our relationship, I'm trying to be more to be supportive of Jen than anything else. Crazy or not, she and her mom our incredibly close and have had to rely on each other heavily. I can see how, from her mom's perspective, I could be a neagtive; before we started dating, Jen probably would have helped her move that desk and dropped her schoolwork to connect with her mom. It may not be reasonable, but I kind of get it.

I'm not really sure what I'm asking... I'm just not sure how to handle the situation. At the moment, I've been working on removing any combative or 'us vs them' language when we talk about her mom. About two months after we started dating I said something like 'I feel like your mom is setting this up so she's going to push you into a 'it's me or him' type of situation.'  Well, a couple weeks ago she said something along the lines of 'if you marry him or he gets you pregnant I'll be out of your life' (which I get even less since we've been together 6 months and obviously are not considering either at the moment).  She said she 'shouldn't have said that' the next day, but that was the closest she got to an apology. 

Jen completely misses this divisive language a lot. She has a worrisome habit of always giving her mom extreme benefit of a doubt. I swear sometimes she defines words based on how she wants her mom to be using them. Apparently, her mom had an epiphany while she's been away at her internship and is planning on turning over a new leaf when Jen gets back. 

The more Jen has, optimistically, told me about how her mom is going to approach things with a fresh perspective the more this weird competitive language has been creeping in. Just weird ways of phrasing things that make it sound like her mom and I are going to be competing to win her affection when she gets back. Which, in other situations, could be interpreted differently, but given her mom's tendency to seemingly place me as an adversary is worrisome 

A few other random things like that: she referred to her mom being a loving and supportive mom during her parents divorce as a 'strategy'. Her mom, unlike her dad, did not openly criticize her father, but framed herself as a victim and told stories that could only lead to the conclusion that her dad was obviously a terrible person. She realizes her mom expertly, and from the way she talks about it intentionally, turned her against her father and basically conditioned her into hating him. She didn't realize until recently that, while he isn't the greatest guy and is a mediocre father, he also isn't the absolutely detestable human being her mom led her to think he is. None of that seems weird to her and she's more impressed than anything else.


So what are your guys thoughts on my rant here? Am I wrong to think there's something off with their relationship? Should I be worried about the future of mine and Jen's relationship? Is the best course to keep trying to be as non-confrontational as possible and not play into any 'her vs me' dynamics? Jen gets back in a couple days and I want to handle any drama with her mom well. 


There's a lot of potential in our relationship and I really want to see if we can work through this.  


tl;dr: SO's relationship with her mom makes me uncomfortable. Her mom also hates me and seems to have a tendency to try and shift things into 'us vs them' type of situations. I'm not fully sure how to handle this and am just trying to not be confrontational. 



Fun bonus stories 

A few months ago, Jen and her mom met someplace to eat and catch up. While at the restaurant, Jen put her phone on silent. They then left the restaurant and separately drove 30 minutes back to the same place. Jen forgot her phone was on silent. Apparently, her mom tried to call her numerous times in this half hour journey and felt that this failure of communication 'was indicative of the state of their relationship' and resulted in a huge emotional event. 

Her mom also told Jen's cousin that I was a 'creepy, older, drug user that was taking advantage of Jen.' We learned this after said cousin talked to Jen and realized she had been horribly misled. 


Edit: Just an addendum. I'm not asking for advice on their relationship. I'm asking if it also seems weird to an outside perspective, how to navigate the situation, and if this should worry me about pursuing a more serious relationship. As long as I'm around I'll encourage Jen to say no to her mom when the situation is obviously completely unrealistic and unreasonable. Beyond that, it's her relationship. "

""For you? You wish. Not going to happen,"" I said, sipping at my coffee and adjusting my terrycloth robe while I looked at the ticket. I typed back a form response, stating that we don't give out local admin access to users without management's written approval for security reasons, and clicked Send &amp; Close in ConnectWise.

My bosses, in their benevolence, had decided that it was easier for me to work remotely in the mornings (I had a home office setup similar to my office setup - i5-3570K, 16GB RAM, 2x GeForce 760s, 256GB SSD, 2x2TB 7200RPM drives in RAID1, a Yealink T46G IP phone, and multiple monitors - but my home setup only had two monitors as opposed to the four at the office) than to fight Austin traffic and come in homicidally angry. It also didn't hurt that I have multiple floofs (cats, in this case) to curl up on my lap while I worked, and I could literally roll out of bed, get my coffee from Mr. Coffee in the kitchen, feed the cats, and trudge back to my workstation in about 5 minutes, all the while waking myself up to be a productive senior systems administrator.

A few minutes later, my inbox dinged with a reply to the ticket.

&gt;I don't care. Either give me local admin rights or I will involve senior management.

I raised an eyebrow and started typing my response.

&gt;Unfortunately, due to SOP and security requirements, you will not be granted local administrator privileges. Your system and software are specifically configured for your position, and granting local administrative rights can allow the software and OS to deviate from the mandatory configurations. Again, we cannot - and will not - grant local administrative privileges without management signing off on it in writing.

Another Send &amp; Close later, and I started working on a few group policies to automatically map drives based on group membership. I didn't hear from the user for the rest of the day, so I figured the matter was closed.

**THURSDAY MORNING, 14 JULY 2016...**

- - - - -

I rolled over, fell out of bed, and trudged into my office after grabbing a mug full of Jet Fuel, brewed strong. Outlook was already open, and I looked at the tickets that had come in overnight, then the Nagios alerts, and finally, the GFI and CompuTrace notifications.

""What the...""

I looked at the CompuTrace alerts - a user OTHER than that user's domain account had logged into his PC that night, and sure enough, it was Administrator (the local one, mind you, not the Domain Admin account). I pulled up a remote background command prompt through GFI (fun fact: GFI's dashboard can let you do that - remote background command prompts, service control, and even process control via a handy-dandy web interface). 

&gt;net localgroup ""Administrators""

&gt;

&gt;LocalAdmin Administrator $DOMAIN\NAUGHTY_USER 

&gt;$DOMAIN\Domain Admins $Domain\Enterprise Admins

""Oh, now that's just not cricket,"" I muttered, and typed in some commands (changing the local admin passwords, disabling the local admin accounts, and removing $NAUGHTY_USER from the local admins group - then force-rebooting in 30 seconds).

Thirty seconds later, the computer dropped offline, and the user's admin rights were removed. I dashed off a quick message to the client's HR department, notifying them of what happened, and told them that I'd be checking up on his machine daily for the next few weeks. I also flipped on reporting on their web proxy for his account, just for paranoia's sake. 

Outlook dinged again, and sure enough...

&gt;I need to have local admin access. Management has approved my request and will be sending in a ticket to grant this. I need this IMMEDIATELY, as I cannot work without this.

""Well, then.""

&gt;When we receive a ticket from the appropriate managers that states you have been granted administrative privileges, we will enable them for you. Per SOP, however, until that approval is in writing in our hands, we cannot and will not grant you those privileges.

One more mouse-click, and it went off into the ether. Another message came in a few minutes later.

&gt;I expect to have administrative privileges within the hour. If this does not happen, management will be speaking with your supervisors in regards to your continued employment at $FIRM_NAME.

I snorted. 

&gt;Again, you are asking us to break explicitly stated standard operating policy, which we have written instructions not to deviate from under any circumstances, to grant you administrative rights. Unfortunately, unless and until we hear from the appropriate management personnel stating that you are allowed such privileges, we will not, under any circumstances, grant them to you. Further requests from you for administrative rights will be rejected unless they are directly sent from the appropriate management personnel. This ticket is now closed.

""You can go now,"" I snarked, thinking back to the tale of Jack, the worst intern, and BCCing his HR department on the e-mail chain.

**FRIDAY MORNING, 15 JULY 2016...**

- - - - -

Two cups of Jet Fuel woke me up, and a small tuxedo cat nibbling on the back of my head from my swivel chair's headrest kept me giggling as I logged into my office box remotely and took a look at the day's alerts.

Sure enough, there was a CompuTrace alert about the same user's machine logging in as Administrator again. The same commands were executed, his admin rights were removed, and I wrote up a GPO explicitly defining which accounts could be local admins, then applied it to his machine and a bunch of others.

I then immediately restarted his machine with shutdown -r -t 0 -f, because he lost the right to save his morning's work when he decided that he was going to be that much of a pain. Another e-mail went to his HR department, and another cup of Jet Fuel went down my gullet.

&gt;YOUR UPPITY NETWORK ADMIN RESTARTED MY COMPUTER WHILE I WAS WORKING! THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR AND IT WILL BE STOPPED _NOW!_

My eye twitched, and the crappy Dell multimedia keyboard I had started bending dangerously under the angry typing I pounded out.

&gt;We have restarted your machine to address security concerns - namely, a disallowed local privilege escalation. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.

His HR rep was again BCC'd, and five minutes later, I was on the phone with her.

""Look, this is the second time he's done it. He KNOWS he can't have local admin rights.""

Her sigh was audible. ""I know he can't have them. Look... he's kind of the office bell-end. We all want him fired, we're building a case as is, but we need more ammo. Is there any chance you can let him dig his own grave? If he's done it twice already, you and I both know he'll do it again.""

I grinned a grin not unlike Al Pacino's in ""The Devil's Advocate"" and chuckled. Sure enough, her gulp could be heard over the VOIP link. ""Oh, dear, however did you know what I was planning? If he's even remotely smart, he'll back off now. Of course, given his role over there, I'm betting that he doesn't.""

- - - - -

**LAST MONDAY MORNING...**

- - - - -

More coffee, more tickets, and more alerts.

CompuTrace again signaled that he'd logged in as a local account over the weekend, except this one was different - he'd made a local admin account with his username. I shrugged, then did a double-take - how could he do that, when a GPO explicitly prevented every account but ours from being local admin?

The answer was easy - he'd used Hiren's or another boot environment to remove the local admin password, the same as he'd done the other days - then booted the system up, logged in, and UNJOINED THE PC FROM THE DOMAIN! That, of course, nulled all group policy objects and let him do whatever he wanted.

""Oh, he's for the high jump now,"" I said to the HR rep, and she confirmed it - Legal was listening in on the call, and stated that they were going to meet with him the next day, and to leave his machine as it was, so they could catch him red-handed.

""I think I can also do you one better,"" I continued, exporting his web logs to HTML and sending them over. ""Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, and GMail, all of which are prohibited by name in the employee agreement. Think we can have some fun with this one?""

""Normally, I'd say no, as we need to treat this as a hostile termination - but since it's going to take us a bit of time to get the paperwork done today, we can't fire him until tomorrow.""

""Tell you what... any chance I can be there when this happens?"" My mind was racing, and I had a BRILLIANT idea. ""Make it known that I'll be there tomorrow in the Colorado River conference room around 10 AM. I have a hunch he'll show up - really, I plan on making it happen, so be close by but out of sight, okay?""

With their approval, I spent an hour or so ironing out my cunning plan and getting everything together.

- - - - -

**LAST TUESDAY MORNING...**

- - - - -

I couldn't resist - I pulled a slim-cut grey suit out of my closet that made me look like Sterling Archer, and after feeding the floofs and driving to the client's office, I made myself comfortable in the conference room. The HR rep and her friend (from the look of him, one of the heavy-duty droids they keep for the real tough cases) from Legal were slumming it a few cubicles down, and the trap was ready to be sprung.

Standard policy for me is that I keep certain MSI files slipstreamed into my install images - one of which is my company's generic LogMeIn installer, WITHOUT the characteristic system tray icon. Sure, $NAUGHTY_USER had uninstalled the copy I had on there as is, but he'd missed the GFI management agent (which, rather conveniently, I'd hidden from the list in Programs &amp; Features - it's a simple registry hack, nothing special). I fired up GFI's agent (fun fact: it runs as SYSTEM, and you can actually remote-BSOD machines with it), silently installed LogMeIn via msiexec /i /qn /norestart, and made a quick call to the HR rep. 

She, in turn, made a call to his manager, asking the manager to pull $NAUGHTY_USER into a meeting and not let him go back until he got a text instructing him to, and as soon as $NAUGHTY_USER left his office - with the machine locked, I noted (didn't care) - I reset one of the local admin passwords via the remote background prompt, logged in via LogMeIn, and unleashed a rather destructive toy that I'd gotten my hands on - [the MEMZ trojan] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-jdSgjtUPk) (seriously, I'm not kidding, that's what it's called - and if you open that link, be warned, there's NSFW language in the video). I logged off as the local admin account, then uninstalled LogMeIn, and logged into the domain controller and Exchange cluster to lock his accounts and - if instructed - remote-wipe his personal phone (this is why BYOD is a ridiculously bad idea).

Sure enough, the machine bluescreened, just like MEMZ is supposed to do (if I'd left it logged in, it would have had all kinds of fun effects, but in all honesty, I wanted the best effect of them all and that one only). 

On my signal, the HR rep texted the manager, who let $NAUGHTY_USER return to his office... to a machine with a BSOD on it. He rebooted, and the final payload showed up on his laptop's screen - a [bootloader that was replaced with Nyancat](https://youtu.be/I-jdSgjtUPk?t=467) (kid you not, that's the last payload of MEMZ). A few seconds after Nyancat's music started playing, I heard furious stomping coming down the hallway towards the conference room (along with the Nyancat music).

""FIX THIS, NOW!"" he yelled, thrusting the laptop towards me, Nyancat's disgustingly beetus-inducing PopTart body bouncing on the screen. ""I know you did this. You've been stopping me from getting my work done for the past week! Now either you fix this, or you're not going to be working for your company after today!""

""Actually,"" the HR rep said, entering the room with her friend from Legal, ""that's my line. We need to have a discussion about your continued employment here - namely, its continuance. Jack, would you mind?""

I stood up, closed my laptop, slipped it back into the case, and pulled out a sheaf of papers. ""And here's his web logs. I didn't man-in-the-middle the SSL, though I should have, I suppose. Oh, well, that's moot.""

Turning to leave, I looked at $NAUGHTY_USER, and through his rage, I saw just a hint of fear. I'd worked for about ten minutes on a little speech, and it would have been a shame to waste it, so after a quick glance at the HR rep, and a nod from her, I said my piece (admittedly with a halfway decent imitation of a certain actor's voice).

""You know, for you, one of the worst days of your life will probably be the day that an 'uppity network admin,' as you so charmingly put it, got you fired, in utter disgrace, from your cushy six-figure job where you played games and sat on Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter all day.""

I leaned against the wall, hand on chin, and delivered the last part with a smirk

""But for me? It was Tuesday.""

I waved goodbye to the HR admin and the Legal droid, and validated my parking on the way out (icing on the cake - after all, who wants to pay for parking in downtown Austin?).

- - - - -

**TL;DR: It was Tuesday.**

Please read: Just a typical guy here with no idea at all on tattoos, looking for advise from people with tattoos and general public on how having one would affect future prospects, e.g. securing a job, local university placing etc.
I plan to work in an bank/IT industry in the future.

I've no discrimination against people with tattoos or whatsoever, do not misunderstand if I do unknowingly do so, forgive me. Tattoo is an art to me and I'm just looking for more information before deciding whether I really want to have one.

I'm looking to having one on my forearm and one on my chest. I'm looking for putting something like [this](http://www.inkfolder.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Black-Geometric-Forearm-Tattoo.jpg) or [this](http://create-tattoos.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/arrow-tattoo-on-forearm.jpg) on my forearm, something like an arrow or other geometrical ones. For my chest it would basically be roman numerals, something like [this](http://tattooblend.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/roman-numeral-tattoo.jpg).

At the same time, do you guys have any tattoo parlor/artists to introduce? Would love to have some where people have been to and have tried out their services before.

Lastly, I've a few question regarding tattoos, some of them are pretty stupid do bear with me. I'm totally clueless on this.

1) Will a tattoo stretch? I'm rather skinny, like bamboo pole so my worry is that if I become fatter in the future the tattoo would stretch. (pretty dumb question I know, but I really am clueless.)

2) I know tattoo's are permanent but will they like be affected for example if I have one on my forearm and I accidentally cut myself on the area the tattoo is on, it would heal but it would leave a scar right? I have a tendency to pluck the healing skin when it's in the progress of healing, will that affect the tattoo in any way?

3)What's the price of getting a tattoo? I know it defers base on length but is there a general guideline?

4)How pain is it?

5)Will it affect future employments and university enrolling chances? I've been through my internship where I do see people with tattoos around an office environment, nothing wrong with that as they are still able to important positions, at the same time I've heard there are companies that still wouldn't like it. I heard that for some you would've to declare it, but if it's not visible during working hours since I'll be wearing shirts, is there a need to still declare?

Thanks in advance.

I can do very basic OSX troubleshooting and do not really use Linux much at my work. There is light server administration when interfacing with copiers. We will usually set up a new user for the copier in the AD tree and sometimes reset passwords and such as well as troubleshoot installs. My current supervisor has told me there is really nowhere for me to grow unless someone leaves. This currently has me looking for new positions. 

I also used to troubleshoot cell phones for six years. I want to work this into my resume again because I believe it would show my technical aptitude.

However, I'm a current comp sci student and our entire course is in Java. 

Java the *language* I am totally comfortable with. However, development in Java is a totally confusing field to me. Unlike Python's community (which is generally more web-based and vibrant), the Java community seems very enterprise-y, and that reflects in the documentation/resources I find online.

I've got my Python workflow down pat - virtualenvs, `pip install` for requirements, PEP8 linters in my text editor, I've used various testing frameworks etc. But when I'm working with Java, I don't really know how to work besides opening my IDE and typing the code. How do I run tests? Hell, how do I *write* tests (JUnit something something...)?

I've heard terms like Ant, Gradle, Maven etc. being thrown around and even after looking them up I have no idea what they do. I struggled even to find out how to resolve dependency issues in one of my projects (with Python it's just `pip install dependency`, with Java there's something to do with a CLASSPATH?).

**So basically**, I'm asking for a complete description of a good Java development workflow, as you would explain it to someone coming from a Python background."

Part of it is finding the job.  Supposedly, I was offered a job as an IT help desk.  They made me study for the A+ certification, which I passed and they paid for admittedly.  Then they lowered it to an internship, only $10/hr.  Then it became a part-time internship for the first month.  Now, they sent me:

&gt;After evaluating further, we decided it would be most beneficial at this time to have you do a job tryout (usually will be 2-3 weeks) on the service desk to make sure it would be a good fit for you. This will allow us to determine the best placement, which we are unsure of right now. We want to make sure we are able to provide the best support needed for your success. At this point, we will not be moving forward with a full hire, but would like to move forward with coordinating a try out. 

If they are being serious, how long will it take them to set up the ""try-out""?  My parents were cynical about this job like they were cynical about me having autism, and I don't want to tell them that it changed yet again.

I always come up with excuses for myself for not reaching out, and usually end up believing that I am good enough on my own.

This summer, I have been an intern at a large company. There are about 100 interns in our city and most of us live in the same place. However, I was one of the last to arrive, a few weeks after the first, and I felt that most people had already made friends, the ""icebreaker"" events had already happened, so I didn't really make any friends. 

I know a few people, but have never done anything outside of work with any of them. See excuses above.

However, there is an intern event for the end of the year coming up and I really don't want to go. It is at a family fun place with mini golf, etc, things like that. But I don't want to go and not have a group, and I don't want to force myself into a group because I hate to feel like I am imposing. 

I am honestly just planning to miss it. I know that I shouldn't, that things would probably work out and it would be fine, and I would feel great if I did meet a few more people. But with the summer coming to a close in a few weeks, I just keep saying ""there isn't really a point."" 

I know I have problems with social situations, being outgoing, self-confidence. And it's been hard, but I've been pretty good on my own. It's lonely, but safe, comfortable.

Sorry for the long message if you are still reading this, but this is as much asking for advice as it is just letting some stuff out a little bit.

I got good marks in practically everything, but here's my problem:

I really, really don't enjoy the course. We had programming (C), computing systems, algorithms, maths, physics, electrical engineering and web development classes and the only one I actually liked was maths. 

I've also been working in a software department for the summer on an internship thanks to some connections I have and I really don't like that either. I've been left with a project that I should be able to do, but I'm nowhere near creative enough to come up with ideas for it. Honestly I can't see myself working in software development at all if this is what it entails.

So my predicament is this: I don't particularly like anything other than the maths element of the course, which there isn't as much as I thought there would be. So do I drop out, keep going and try and find some kind of analytical job? Unfortunately because the course is so specific and how Irish Universities work, I cannot transfer to another course, although I wish I could.

4upp2m,5,2016-07-26,Life after the college program.,Skaczoro,Disneycollegeprogram,https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneycollegeprogram/comments/4upp2m/life_after_the_college_program/,"Hi Folks, 

There are ultimately two paths I have seen for those after their college program. I will get to these two paths in a moment but first my story. 

I did two CPs with the hopes of getting a professional internship. My first CP was after my junior year of college and I totally fooled around and did not take much seriously other than my job. My second CP was after I graduated, I took Disney courses they provide and networked like crazy. I even met with two recruiters for a one on one who gave me pointer but alas no PI. 

I don't have any bad feelings against this, sure I was disappointed but I had truly a great time in both programs. 

I took one of the two paths after my programs. That path is going back to school and getting a job outside of Disney. I got a great job in the field I wanted to go into right after my second program. 

Unfortunately for many CP cast members, they take the other path, and they stay at Disney as a part/full time cast member.

The whole point of the CP is to get some amazing experience, build your resume and land a great job after you graduate. Believe me when saying a full time front line role at Disney is not a great job!

Its insane that Disney allows CPs to essentially quit college for minimum wage. Please if you do the CP go back to school and get your degree! I see old CP co-workers that are still in the same role 1/2/3 years after our program. No disrespect to them, but Disney did them wrong. Disney is making a killing off of CP workers that become full time cast members. Don't fall into the trap and get your education.

TL;DR Go back to school after your CP. Don't be a fool and make minimum wage the rest of your life at Disney. Seriously just go back to school."

 So, as a bit of context I am a recently graduated college student in Georgia and have been working an internship for a large company in the western part of the state. A large part of my job is interacting with a variety of people coming and going from our campus, leaving campus myself, and spending some time outside of a traditional office environment, leading me to decide to concealed carry at all times. Unfortunately, the company maintains a 'soft' no-firearms policy that was communicated via a single line about possession of 'dangerous weapons' being prohibited on campus so I knew that choosing to carry was far from condoned; however, another document through our HR department said that possession of weapons was prohibited unless you were okay under state law so I believed that it was a 'don't ask, don't tell' type off situation. Compound all of this with the fact that I was assaulted last summer while on lunch break for the same company, but was disarmed because of a desire to strictly follow policy, and I believe my choice to carry becomes more clear. Finally, I carry a Springfield XDs with the 4"" barrel in a tuckable WhiteHat holster at 3:30 with a polo shirt tucked into khakis. The pistol is extremely well concealed save for the two small black clips which no-one has even mentioned in 5 months of carrying. 

Well, this morning I learned a valuable lesson about what level of concealment needs to be maintained in a questionable work environment. After using a urinal in the main restroom I was approached out of the blue by one of the production line supervisors (for context, our supervisors are only a level above a basic machine operator while I work in engineering, this guy was in no way my boss or superior)  and questioned as to ""what that thing on my belt was"". I was absolutely floored to be questioned in the bathroom and assumed that he had no idea what he was looking at so I said it was private and promptly returned to my office, assuming that some sort of medical device was implied and thinking that being vague would de-escalate the situation. A few minutes later the supervisor enters my office and starts to demand that what I was doing was illegal and that he would 'walk me to the guard house' so I could disarm myself. Being that my office is inbetween our two HR reps I attempted to quietly explain to him that I was licensed and in no way breaking the law, prompting him to continue to demand that I walk with him to the guard shack. I offered to show him my license but he insisted that he had one and knew 'what those little black clips were' and promptly walked directly to our HR rep. 

After being approached by our HR rep some 2 minutes later I printed out the policy concerning the state-law exemption but was told to sit tight until further notice. 10 minutes after that our head of HR entered my office with our 2 heads of security and I knew that the game was up. They immediately corned me and demanded that they would be disarming me for everyone's safety, something I told them would not be happening because I had no desire to be shot in the ass by someone attempting to manipulate a firearm they were unfamiliar with. In a particularly interesting turn one of the security heads attempted to strong arm me by demanding that he was a retired cop who was more than qualified to handle my pistol, which again prompted me to tell them that I was more than happy to leave campus but my weapon would stay secure and no one would be touching me. I informed them that I was a licensed carrier who had been called out by an employee so I was in no way a threat to anyone and not mad at all, eventually causing them to agree to simply escort me out of the building. On the way out I mentioned that I was certainly not the only owner of 'little black clips' in the building to which he replied that he was always happy to know there were law abiding folks around him, I was just the poor bastard who got popped. Two hours later I received the call that I had been terminated but thanks for playing. The kicker? The HR ladies thanked me for being such a great employee and always being happy to help them carry office supplies, move furniture, or fix computers. They thanked me for being polite throughout the whole process which really just put the shit icing on the shit cake.

Lessons to learn from my own inadequacies:

1) Concealed means concealed but the rules are the rules, break them and pay the piper. I suppose that I knew this was a possible reality but had always hoped that being close with the HR department and having a loophole on my side would save my skin. Know this now and forever: corporate does not need you and does not love you, if you're not the top boss then you're replaceable.

2)The idea of belt clips being minimalist enough to succeed only survives so long as the people who know what they are play along. I have noticed multiple people that carry, especially in our engineering and IT departments, but would never say anything because I am not a gaping asshole. The mouth breather that outed me knew what they were but decided to dick me hard, hindsight being what it is pocket carry or a belly band would probably be my choice if I had to return.

3)Never let anyone handle your firearm unless compelled by an officer of the law or at a range. The guys from security wanted to remove a loaded firearm from its secure holster in a 8'x10' office room during a high stress encounter, even being fired on the spot isn't worth letting someone shoot you in the leg or ND into a fellow employee. Some cops also apparently retain the idea that they are god even once they remove a badge, but that's neither here nor there.

4)Have a good response ready for when you get called out, if I had been more clear and said that it was a medical device or something then maybe some of this could have been avoided. However, the supervisor seemed to have thoroughly 'made' me so I'm not sure what good it would have done. I am not sure why this guy decided to throw a fit about me but it probably has something to do with my department being responsible for inspecting and maintaining environmental policies for his line. I have had to report his department several times for routine haz waste violations so I'm sure a chance to screw the young guy telling him what to do was downright cathartic for him.

It costs $32,000 yearly to attend.
With grants and basic financial aid, it's still about $20,000.


And before you say anything, yes, I know now I should've gone to a cheaper state school. It's a bit late for that.


My GPA has never been amazing. I've always gotten Cs and C-s with the occasional B or A. This is mostly caused by the mid-semester slump where I'm behind on every assignment all at once. In general, time management and punctuality are my greatest weaknesses, but I digress.

Fall Semester of 2015, I was attempting to juggle an internship (12 hrs/week + 4hrs/week of driving) and 15 credit hours. It went very poorly and I failed two of my classes. I should've dropped them, but I was stupid and thought I could salvage my grades enough to scrape by.

This Spring, I made my best effort to boost my GPA so those two F's wouldn't hold me down too much. This, however, was futile. As I said, my GPA has always teetered around the 2.0 minimum, so those two F's dropped it down to a 1.9.
The Spring semester raised it to a 1.955, but that's not great.

Now I'm no longer approved for federal or institutional aid and have to take out private loans if I want to continue.

I also have two more years (after three years already). 

I have absolutely no idea what to do. Taking out the full $16,000 in private loans for at least one semester sounds like financial suicide when I've already accrued about $60,000 in federal loans, and my GPA is hurting so badly that I'm wondering if I can even salvage it at all."

Now I am at the point where I do not care anymore, only because i feel incompetent, nervous about presenting anything because I am lost, and when youre lost, you pretty much look like you dont know what the hell you are talking about, which has happened a couple of times. The internship ends sometime in August, and honestly, I think its been nothing but disappointment on my end and the hiring teams end, and at times they let it show by making jokes regarding our coding ability. SIDE NOTE - Which, in the interview, there was no mention that we would be focusing on developing/scripting, rather, the Help Desk/Ticket work was what was mentioned, but we haven't touched that once during this internship, besides getting access to it and analyzing data. I dont know what to do, whether to stick it out and embarrass myself, during random questioning and presentations, or whether to end it prematurely, maybe 2/3 weeks earlier than they anticipated. It started in May, If i do end it early, should I end it once August roles around? I feel like speaking to one of the hiring managers and letting him know, how I feel, but i DEFINITELY know it will circulate since this is a small team, and they have openly spoken about previous employees. Overall, all i know is that i dont look forward to the commutes in the mornings, and i stress/freak out while here, because I have no idea what im really doing, even after explanations. Faking it till i make it at this point in stage, I know i will get bashed for this but i need opinions before i make a rash decision Another Side Note, no where in the interview did I mention I was good with coding, all i have are HTML and CSS, basic web dev stuff, and some basic Python knowledge. Which was on my resume. Sorry if it seems all over the place and scattered, thats how my head feels honestly...along with headaches.

4uqazh,10,2016-07-26,Bitlocker issue Windows Update KB3172985,trobknight,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/4uqazh/bitlocker_issue_windows_update_kb3172985/,"Hello,

I'm not sure if this the correct place for this, but I'm an IT Intern at a company and we're experiencing an issue with Sophos Encryption on Windows 10 machines.

The issue is the login screen for Bitlocker (which overrides the Sophos Safeguard software) is either showing a blank blue screen or an orange screen with white vertical lines running down it.

This is a problem for our users, one because the product surely isn't doing what it was intended to do, which is display a Bitlocker screen prompting the user to enter their Bitlocker PIN so they can regain access to their hard drive.

I've research a few articles about this issue and seems that it isn't as common as I would like.

http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-security/bitlocker-pin-pre-boot-screen-empty/f985c4f6-dd71-4586-bd46-50f513432bb3

or 

https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/2d7bd961-5ded-42b9-996e-945bd63e0a15/bitlocker-screen-is-orange-with-white-lines?referrer=http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/2d7bd961-5ded-42b9-996e-945bd63e0a15/bitlocker-screen-is-orange-with-white-lines?referrer=http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/2d7bd961-5ded-42b9-996e-945bd63e0a15/bitlocker-screen-is-orange-with-white-lines?forum=win10itprogeneral

I've contacted Sophos Tech Support for this issue and their response to me was that they hadn't heard of this issue before.

Yet, I've found it on multiple different forums as well as Microsoft's own website.

I feel like Microsoft would have notified Sophos if there was an issue considering the two companies appear to be working in unison with Bitlocker overriding the Sophos Encryption.

Anyways, my supervisor asked me to contact Sophos multiple times to find a tech that might be able to help me. Eventually, I was able to find a tech that informed me that we had an outdated version of the Sophos Encryption software. We were using Version 7.00.1.35. According, to this tech, Windows 10 requires users to use at least Version 7.00.2.

So, there's a plus. However, on these forum posts I don't see anyone posting what version of Sophos Safeguard they're installing on their machines, so I can't be sure if this resolves the issue entirely, hence why I have three laptops that I'm testing with 3 different versions.

UPDATE: While I type this post out, we received an email from the Sophos vendor we work with and they contacted a Senior Software Engineer and his response was that it isn't a Sophos issue whatsoever. It is entirely a Windows issue.

The reason why they believe it is solely a Windows issue is that there a reports from users that only use Bitlocker that are not using Sophos.

Also, most of my users that are experiencing this issue are remote and in a very different timezone than PST so it makes it difficult to test.

However, I have one user that is leaving today at 4PM PST that is allowing me to run a test to uninstall the KB while Bitlocker is suspended or by trying out the command.

I'll post my results after I leave work today.

Any other useful comments that you all might have would be so greatly appreciated. My supervisor keeps asking me for updates every hour which is rather difficult since the encryption for Bitlocker takes anywhere from 1hour to 6 hours depending on the speed of the machine.

Thanks /r/sysadmin :)

4uqbxo,36,2016-07-26,How Islam and other things fucked up my life ..,not1but2secrets,exmuslim,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/4uqbxo/how_islam_and_other_things_fucked_up_my_life/,"It all started since 24 years ago , aka when I was born , ok I might be exagerating but honestly my mother has been a jerk to me for as long as I can remember , from beating me up ( and I'm talking about beating me up resulting in blood and those blue bruises , the kind of beating that makes me breathless begging her to stop and sometimes she wouldn' t until sb interferes and tell her she's gonna kill me if she doesn't ) it was over silly things like leaving a dirty spoon on the table or nagging about how much houseshores I had to do when I was only 9 yo , to all the verbal abuse ,calling me names : stupid , whore (i was only 12 then ), no one is ever gonna love u ,  ugly face etc.. u can imagine the damage such childhood would do to someone ..

 Tt all got worse when one day she decided she's gonna be religious , and as sb says :' Of all bad men ,religious bad men are the worst ', her madness reached its peak . All of sudden she started hitting me and my siblings with cables once she found out we weren't praying , I remember I faked praying many 

weeks until she was convainced we were following her orders , I was 13 yo that time , yet I did feel guilty about it because I really believed in god . Being in desperate need for some tenderness and sb to listen to me , I had to turn to sb or sthg , for me that was god ..

During highschool , things got better ( i got beaten like once a month instead of 3 times a week at least )  . At the age of 16 ,  I was reading quoran during Ramadhan ( again forced by her  along with the long exhausting taraweeh ) and I started crying ,  I felt that "" lil sacred bond that sends u to another world ""and I thaught it was a sign from  god .
 All of a sudden I started reading Quoran more carefully , actually paid attention to what Imam says , and decided to wear the doomed hijab (not as if i wasn't already pressured to wear it by my mother ) and that's when my life started to really get fucked up .
I decided if god asked me to listen to my mothers orders I should , and I started seeking her satisfaction more than anything else . 

I passed highschool exam with excellent grades after she had been promising me all year long she would let me major languages and go study in another city , and I trusted her , how can one not trust his own mother especially when she promises over and over again that she would never interfere with my personal choices . But I was such a fool ! As soon as results came out she told me with a quiet smile : 'congragulations! so u gonna be doctor , aren't you ? ' , and thats how what was supposed to be 
one of the biggest joys of my life ended in minuts .
 I had the worst summer full of fights and crying and more promises but this time she promised if I don't like medical school after studying one year there she would let me quit it and join languages school and thus everyone will be happy .
 I thaught that what's most important for a true muslim is to follow god orders and if god won't be satisfied until my mother is , i should do it , not for my mother because she wasn't worthy such a sacrifice , but for god , for allah .


6 months afterwards , after spending the worst days of my life there , I told her it's time she kept her promise and let me change major because obviously staying there is a nightmare and I just , I just don't wanna be a doctor . it's a life time committment and I know so many ppl would die to do it but it's just not me . She attacked me , hit me again , spit on me , slapped me and said it's either medical school or being a maid cleaning and cooking in the house , she acted like faiting , said I was gonna cause her to die and that she will cick everyone if I keep being stubborn . No one was there for me , they all told me how i should listen to her , that she's my mother after all and she knows what's best for me and they 
scared me .
 I was afraid if I keep being stubborn or run away or change my major secretly  god will be ' mad at me ' and sthg bad will happen to me . How naive and stupid I was ! 
 I gave in .. and thaught , whats more important is heaven , maybe I didn't lose all , maybe if I do this , I'll be granted heaven.

It has been  5 years now ..I have been convainced Islam is a bunch of bullshit three months ago , and now .. the only thing that has been keeping me a bit sane about being somewhere I don't belong  is gone .. the only thing that kept me patient towards my mother is no longer there and I feel furious .
WTF have i done to my life ?? now that there is no heaven and that im convainced I let a total psycho 

blown my life , I dunno what to do . 
I'm still living with her under the same roof for fake god's sake !!since she also forced me to apply to the one school that's in my city .. 
Here I am living sb else's dream , still in my nightmare house with her , who btw has never  been really satisfied and hasn't changed her awful manners with me , she actually says she 's not the one to blame when I complain about how awful medical school is ..
my grades are awful but i still manage to pass , and I just hate my life more every passing day .
I live in a such a shitty country where u can't get a diploma until u finish 8 years , so if i drop out of it now ,it  will be like I have never even entered it , no evidence of studyin there for 4 years , no chance for a scholarship outside the country and even if there was I don't wanna study medecine , not here , not anywhere , I loath it .
Sometimes I think of running away at night and go somewhere else and start fresh , and have the life I always wanted , but for so many reasons it doesnt feel like the right thing to do at the moment . After next year I will be an intern  for three years and get paid like 400 usd a month , Im thinking to bear just one more year in this house then get my financial independancy and rent somewhere else and take off the stupid hijab and be myself  .. but then I think it's just gonna be 4 more wasted years of life .
Im tired , Im tired of thinking , im tired of hating , and im tried trying to fit somewhere I don't belong ..Im totally lost .. and my heart aches everytime I see ppl studying what they want or following their dreams , I never had the chance to do so ..

4uqg7p,19,2016-07-26,Having to choose between Clinton and Trump is making me physically ill.,BSandersThrowaway,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4uqg7p/having_to_choose_between_clinton_and_trump_is/,"The entire Democratic National Primary is making me nauseous right now. I have been a huge Bernie Sanders supporter since the day he first announced his/our candidacy on April 30, 2015. Here was a candidate concerned with the issues facing ordinary everyday American people like me, a candidate concerned with exposing corruption and getting money out of politics -- and in a time in my life when I was dealing with severe depression and feeling hopeless, his campaign screamed of real hope and change. For the first time in a long time, I felt hopeful and energized... but seeing all of the corruption that kept us from having a fighting chance has just put me in a slump again. I have spent the past 24 hours or so just being sick to my stomach, just desperately hoping that someone, somewhere, does something to stop all of this, praying for a miracle, while common sense tells me that there's nothing that can be done.

I used to be an intern for my (red) state's Democratic Party, but I quit a few months ago, when I found out that they were working to pretty obviously to have only Clinton win our state's primary (which she did, by a HUGE margin). An article published a few months back called them out for giving ""super-shady-and-unethical-but-technically-legal"" donations and contributions to the Hillary Clinton campaign prior to and after her victory. From what I personally witnessed, they had the interns make phone calls to people with an average age of 65.3 (which I calculated on my own time based on the phone calls I made through the phone banking system -- as the elderly were more likely to support Hillary than they were to support Bernie, so what incentive would my state's Dem Party have to get us to engage younger people in the voting process?), while after the primary, they had us calling and engaging voters with an average age of 32.1. Prior to Super Tuesday, they gave us phonebanking scripts that only included her name, and they sent us to volunteer at Hillary events while they kept dead silent about Sanders events and rallies in the area. The email leak just showed that exponentially worse things were going on NATIONALLY, not just in my state, but in almost every other state that she won and in the Democratic Party as a whole. All of the hours of phonebanking, canvassing, and advertising that I did for our campaign, just for it to be in a sham of a primary... And to think that I used to trust this party, that when I was younger, I dreamt of being a politician for the Democratic Party so that I could help them grow because I believed in them so much. I am absolutely crushed. I feel so betrayed and hurt.

I have so many Muslim and Latino friends, and they are BEGGING for me to vote for Hillary because of Trump's rhetoric about them. As I'm black, they also insist to me personally that Trump hates black people (which I have seen no proof of). Social media is just on fire right now with my friends, most of whom are Hillary voters, trying to win Bernie supporters over, saying that Bernie supporters who stay home or ""waste their votes on a third party"" will be ""entirely at fault"" for a Trump presidency, that we're being ""petulant children"" and that ""he lost, get over it and keep Trump out of the White House."" After all, they all say that choosing the ""lesser of two evils"" would at least protect Muslims and Latino people. I feel so invalidated by these people, and it hurts to see brilliant people that I love dearly absorbing this narrative and screaming for us to fall in line. Like Sanders supporters aren't allowed to be frustrated and disillusioned by the DNC's collusion with the media and the Clinton campaign. Like we aren't allowed to say that we are having serious trouble accepting a victory and a nomination that many of us see as fraudulent. Like we're supposed to just turn around and vote for a cause we don't believe in. And in light of the first series of email leaks, I honestly don't think Clinton is a ""lesser"" evil anymore. I dislike Clinton and Trump equally, for different reasons. I do not agree with the majority of the GOP platform or Trump's vision for America, and I cannot bring myself to reward the Democratic Party's corruption and neglect of democracy with my vote just because I'm afraid of a Trump presidency. I honestly cannot vote for Hillary Clinton, given the information being released lately about her and the DNC's corruption. I'm so sorry to my Muslim and Latino friends. I won't be able to tell you guys to your faces, and I'm honestly scared to tell anyone else because it's not a popular opinion, and things are heated right now. But it feels so damn good to say it now: I will not vote for Hillary Clinton.

I tell myself that I'll vote for Jill Stein, and I'm actually volunteering for her campaign right now, but I'm probably just going to be too sick on November 4 to leave my dorm. I'm probably just going to hole up that day because this is crushing me right now, and it'll hurt even more on Election Day. I feel like I can't voice my honest sentiments anywhere else. I feel hopeless again. But I'm glad that I got all of this off my chest."
4uqrlf,1,2016-07-26,Should I open a new credit card? Recent College Graduate,rationalities,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4uqrlf/should_i_open_a_new_credit_card_recent_college/,"Hey y'all,

Long story short, I am a recent college graduate, and I have a ""secured"" credit card through my bank. Essentially, it has a credit limit of $500 and is backed up by $500 in a savings account. This card is a way for those with no credit or bad credit to build some. I have had it for about 3 and 1/2 years. 

**My current credit score is 694.** From what I understand, that's not bad and anything over 700 is considered ""good."" It would be higher if I had not ran up the balance on the credit card a bit more than I would have liked to when I had an unpaid internship. However, now that I have a steady stream of income, I am slowly paying it down.

Once the card is paid off and my credit score is over 700, I plan on closing out the card to free up the $500. My bank wants me to open up a new credit card because they claim that if I close that card and do not have any other lines of credit, my credit score will go down. From what I understand, this all seems true. However, I am also aware of the dangers of credit cards and do not want to make a hasty decision. I am definitely closing out the card because it is relatively expensive (high interest rates AND a $24 annual fee), I just want some advice on what to do after that.

So what should I do? Close out the card and open a new one through my bank? Close out the card and not do anything? Or close out the card and open a new one through someone else?

Thanks for any feedback!"
4ur0e8,3,2016-07-26,[Advice] I'm a complete mess,Bigblueduck,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/4ur0e8/advice_im_a_complete_mess/,"Hi Getdisciplined, this might be a long one so bear with me.

Here’s the situation:

I just graduated from one of the top business schools in the country with a marketing degree and now I’m living back home with my parents while I look for a job. Due to depression? Anxiety? Something else? I’m not sure what it was, I barely did anything in college to better myself. I didn’t get one internship, I didn’t join any clubs, I didn’t make any friends, I didn’t DO anything. All I did was sit at home and smoke weed, occasionally hang out with my one friend that I’ve known since high school, or play League of Legends for 10+ hours a day. I was a complete fucking mess. I had no desire to live my life, I felt absolutely worthless. I think part of that stemmed from the fact 1. I wasn’t ready to go to college and 2. I didn’t want to get a business degree. Halfway through I realized I fucking hated all my classes and my last three years (graduated in five years) were complete misery. Everybody else was at least having some fun, getting interships, joining clubs, and then there was me sitting at home high as fuck playing League. I think the only silver lining is that I have a very small amount of student loan debt.

I basically spent three years of my life in a high/video game haze. The longest I went without was probably two days up until my fourth year when I realized I was incredibly addicted and something needed to change. I needed to get an internship (never happened, couldn’t get myself to care) and quit league and pot (did happen, two months sober). Throughout the last year I tried over and over to motivate myself to quit both of these awful addictions, I tried therapy from the college and that helped a bit. I finally quit for like a month then something upset me and I was back at it. Right before I graduated I realized if I wanted a job I was going to have to quit smoking and playing League, because I just couldn’t moderate at all. I packed it in, threw away all my shit and deleted my accounts. I gained about 40 pounds my last semester from stress eating from looking for a job. I say looking, but really I was mostly redditing and half assing my applications. 

Now, I’m back at my parents house and it’s fucking awful. My dad is a huge alcoholic and a narcissist, my mom is a homeopathic nut even though I love her dearly she is crazy as hell and way too negative which is impacting my moods. I was honestly feeling a lot better this summer until I came home. They’re pressuring me hard to find a job and I really don’t even want one if it means I have to work in marketing/sales. I can’t drive because I’m legally not able, so I'm stuck inside because there is nothing within walking distance of the house worth doing. I’m so demotivated to find a job because I fucking hate marketing. I think it’s the most boring shit on the planet. I can’t even tell if I really hate it, or if I’m scared of finding a job, or if I’m just depressed and it’s clouding my judgment. I’m pretty sure I’m not depressed, but I might have dysthymia which is a longer, milder version of depression from what I’ve read. Honestly at this point, I wish I could just fly to Germany or something and become an au pair or do something abroad but I can’t because I refuse to leave my cats behind with my parents. I know they wouldn’t take care of them properly and because I won’t consider having kids I think of my cats as my children (I know it’s a little weird, but I love them to death). The only thing keeping me going is them, and leaving them behind for 3, 6, or 12 months just doesn’t sit right in my stomach.

I’m seriously at a loss of what to do. Do I just get a job that I hate and try to get some therapy? I want to get the fucking hell out of my state and experience another place for once in my life and getting a job in a different state could help with that. I think I’ve never truly experienced independence despite paying for all my own shit with scholarships while I lived downtown for college. I never received anything from my parents except help moving, but they were always there if I needed them. I’ve almost considered trying to go back for a second bachelors so I could get some internship experience and switch my job path, but then I’d be 26-27 and in the same position I’m in now. I’m utterly confused and broken and I just don’t know what the fuck to do. I thought I was doing better since quitting my addictions but I almost feel like I had more control when I was gaming 10 hours a day and getting stoned constantly. 

**TL;DR: Stuck at my parents after graduating, little experience, hate my major, can't drive, feel like dick, want out.**

I majored in Computer Science with a minor in Web Design &amp; Development.

I'm trying to figure out what i'm doing wrong, because I've only had 1 interview (on the phone) so far. I honestly feel like the interview went perfect for a job in Colorado, I had all of the skills they wanted and felt very confident throughout the interview. I answered their questions with easy with no hesitation. When it came down to it, they said they couldn't hire me because I was not already in Colorado and they needed someone asap.

I have a website which just links my resume/githib (sort of my portfolio)/linkedin, you can see it here and maybe offer me some feedback on my resume/github/linkedin. http://rohanharrison.com/

I've been told by a lot of different people that my resume looks really good from friends to family to people on r/resumes.

I'm from a small town in KY and I have applied to a few jobs in-state, but I'm really trying to get a job out of state because living at home is just toxic for me.

I'm mainly applying in San Francisco, San Jose, Denver, Seattle, Austin, Dallas, and NYC. I could probably apply in Connecticut (where I went to school and did my internship), but I would rather not. 

I've been told my resume was good. The only interview I did went as smooth as I could possibly imagine, and I've probably applied to a billion places. I've used Glassdoor, Indeed, Ziprecruiter, and a couple other sites to find jobs. I tried searching on linkedin, but couldn't figure out how to find what I wanted. The idea of searching linkedin was to message recruiters directly, but I couldn't figure out who/what to message and how to go about it. 


I realize I didn't go to an awesome university, but my school is decently respected in CT (or everyone at least knows of it). I didn't have an awesome GPA, but I also didn't have a bad GPA. But most jobs i've applied to have not even asked about it.

I've applied to a lot of entry level/associate level jobs as a software engineer, developer, mobile (Android) developer, web designer/developer and more. I am pretty experienced in what i did at my internship (mainly .NET/SQL) stuff. I design websites as a hobby (full stack LAMP) and more. 

It's been eating at me but I have only gotten ONE interview out of so many job applications and hours spend applying. I really want to work for my money, and I am absolutely willing to learn whatever skill or language I don't know. Saying I am enthusiastic is an understatement. My parents have graciously allowed me to stay at home for as long as I need, but I can tell they're a little antsy. I have applied to jobs locally, but like I said I would much prefer to move out of state. Thankfully I do not have loans or this would be even more stressful.

I'm obviously willing to relocate with maybe 2-3 weeks notice (so I can get a place to stay out of state), and I'm not even asking for relocation compensation. I am willing to eat that cost myself. My requirements for pay aren't exceptionally high either. I would be willing to take $50k a year starting, where most of the states I've applied average more around $60-90k.

I graduated in May by the way, and I started applying maybe two weeks after graduation."

Will try my best to give a tl;dr at the end**  

&amp;nbsp;

*Bio:*  (Sorry for the stuck up tone here, I've reread this damn part like four times and I can't make it not sound stuck up, but I think the information is valuable) I'm 19 years old, and going into my sophomore year of studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at a rather well-regarded university. My current academic situation means that I'm nearly guaranteed to get a steady job offer of $90,000+ once I graduate. In order to avoid bragging/humble bragging (I already feel like I'm bragging too much hahah) lets just leave it at that and I'm happy to give more information about my school situation if needed.

To continue on the vein of euphemistic avoidance of bragging, let us say that the only real expense I myself need to pay for is food throughout college. (Again, happy to expand on this if its needed)


OK now I really feel like a complete asshat, so I'm just going to apologize again for probably sounding like a stuck up trust fund kid (which I am sincerely not I promise!)


**tl;dr Getting a degree in a growing industry, likely will get well paying job when I graduate, and no student debt and little expenses at school**


&amp;nbsp;

*Budget:*
*Income: $7000 by 08/12 (currently ~$4000) Plus whatever I may get in tax returns come April.  
*Projected Expenses: ~$1000 (for food/maybe a few fun nights out :P)  
*Projected Income: I currently have a paid research position on campus for $15/hr and I work    an average of 7-10 hours a week. Additionally, I have a return offer from my summer internship so another ~$7000 guaranteed next summer.  
*Proposed Emergency Fund: $3000
*Slush fund (which this question is focused on): ~$3000


&amp;nbsp;

*Reason:* This section is purely to counteract my assholery from the above bio section and to prove that no life is perfect, feel free to skip this. I'm coming out of my first breakup from a real relationship, where I failed spectacularly and lost a girl that I genuinely wonder if I can ever find someone as perfect (YAY teenage angst and worries). But, I am also escaping from a month to two month long bullying effort against me that ended up involving the police (death threats and clear stalking of me) and it ended up with no charges being able to stick, but a lot of betrayal from people I thought I were my friends (and now I have nearly no meaningful relationships left in my life). Anyway enough of that, the short version is that I need something to focus on so that I can keep myself distracted and not want to die of loneliness/heartbreak/teenage angst/severe loneliness.


&amp;nbsp;

*Questions:*
 Essentially what should I do with the slush fund? Invest in stocks, hide it in a savings?
 I was thinking of getting into the stock market and using it as a learning experiment. I had to do a semester long stock simulation in high school, which I did decently well at (ROI of about 60%, but ~40% of that was fueled on an incredibly lucrative day trade on HAZMAT suits during the ebola crisis) so I would like to see if I can get deeper into that and try to increase my abilities and truly understand how that works. 

&amp;nbsp;

**tl;dr:** About $3000 of disposable income, debt free, 19 years of age. Should I experiment with it or just hide it in a savings account?

4uranr,8,2016-07-26,Money problems and BPD,morbidhawk,BPDlovedones,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/4uranr/money_problems_and_bpd/,"Has anyone else had financial stress since being in a relationship with a borderline? My therapist recently read me the official borderline diagnosis and I remember **impulsivity** was brought up as a symptom and I think he might have mentioned something about money too. I'm wondering if others have experienced severe money issues in their relationship?

In my own relationship I find that my wife expects to live at a certain comfort level in her life and that she expects things to be handed to her. She complains about never going on vacation, having to repair the car, etc. We spent over $1300 in mechanic repairs earlier this year and it has still been leaking in other places I decided to save money and learn to do the repairs myself. Instead of being able to initially buy the proper leak testing tools (because she refused to let me) to find out the cause of the leaks I ended up just taking my best guesses and after spending a ton in coolant I finally just started replacing a bunch of parts and now it's still leaking. Now that I blew a ton of time and money on it she finally agreed to buying the testing tools. But it would have saved me a ton of time and money to be able to just do it the way I wanted to in the first place. It's like her logic was ""I'm not going to spend $70 and still not have it fixed"". Currently I'm checking to see if it retains coolant if I don't run the A/C and now she's pissed off at me for even thinking that she should have to use a car that doesn't have A/C. So I'm pretty upset right now and feel like venting all this out.

The crazy part of all this is that since last fall I've been a salary software engineer and I make a good deal more than I did as an intern and additionally she is now working for the first time in our 8-year marriage so we make more than enough to get by but she's depressed that we don't go on cruises and such while we're trying to get out of the financial hole we've dug for ourselves.

She'll also buy new things for herself semi-frequently and then feel bad about it and then will want me to validate that it's ok to spend money on herself. I fully support her buying things for herself but I'm never allowed to buy something expensive for myself because that would be taking money away from the family. Even though I'm a software engineer I still don't own my own laptop, smart phone, or game console. The cool tech stuff that used to be so interesting to me is now just not worth the fights yet we spend at least the cost of a gaming console every day or so eating out all the time. I'll be in my 30s soon and I've been looking back at my 20s and resent my life and my career. I feel like I've never been able to succeed on my terms ever and that it is always a battle to try and be myself. It's just like nothing is good enough for her, she wants me to make more money and to magically make problems go away. I've been trying to encourage her to solve problems and she wants control of the budget which makes it hard when we have to impulsively fix problems last second and have to pay more for it because she feels like oil changes and tires every few years is the only expense she should have to account for.

**tldr; it's exhausting trying to get out of financial problems with my wife, I think her BPD has something to do with it**"
4urcta,1,2016-07-26,I [20F] am scared to break up with my boyfriend [24M] of ~1 year due to his infidelity. Please let me know if I'm doing the right thing.,coldcoldfeet,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4urcta/i_20f_am_scared_to_break_up_with_my_boyfriend_24m/,"Hello,

This may be long and I apologize for typos as this is on mobile.


I have been with my boyfriend for over a year now. Basically what happened was that he cheated. We were friends with benefits for 8 months before he asked me to be exclusive before he graduated college. That summer he left for a month in his hometown and a month in Europe. 


Last October I discovered a girl from his hometown was heavily flirting with him and although he did not flirt back, he did not shut it down either. I found out she didn't know he was taken but he told her they could only ever be platonic (he apologized and said he didn't want to hurt her feelings because he knew she was into him). It made me uncomfortable but I didn't want to be controlling and so I let it slide and they talk still but she was being kinda needy. He barely replied to her texts and seemed annoyed when she did text.


About three months ago I discovered he had actually flirted back while he was visiting in his hometown with her and spend nearly every day with her. When confronted he said they only kissed twice (just pecks on the lips) and said he did so because he was lonely and has little friends. Last summer I was incredibly lonely as well but kept my fidelity so this felt terrible. He cut off contact with her and promised he would do anything to make it up to me. I have never felt such pain or betrayal in my life, it hurts to breathe and the pain vibrates. Not long after that I found he had actually flirted with her since before we were even exclusive and now my entire relationship feels like a lie. I was never the only one. He gave me his FB password and looking through his messages I saw his coworker send him a tattoo on her breast just a week prior. I broke down. 


It's been three months and I'm feeling terrible. He says he'll do anything to make it better but he just wants to move on. He gets upset when I ask him questions about what happened and I'll ask him the same questions sometimes. I can't help it really, because he tickle truthed me I have no trust in him and am always imaging things were/are worse than what he said. And sometimes it's right and others it's not. We've gotten in nasty arguments for the first time and I've said some really fucked up/cruel things (I wish I never met you, you're a piece of shit, what the fuck is wrong with you). I don't want to hate or resent him. I've always been a nurturing empathetic person and this scares me.


It came to a head a few days ago in an argument where he said 3 months is too long to feel like this. He's constantly asking me how long this will last and he's been unhappy. Looking at forums many places say it takes a year or so at least so I'm worried at the three months. I can't just move on and I can't forgive all the lies and disrespect. I can't pretend everything is okay and I cry everyday. I know he cares about me and he's trying as best he knows how. But I don't think he understands what I'm going through and the pain. I can't just forgive him. I just can't. Not now anyways. And now I feel scared telling him I feel sad/angry/upset or have a question because it ruins whatever mood we had or if we had a good day. He says I'm trying to punish him, maybe there's some truth to that but I mainly ask because I feel I need to know. The pain is unbearable and I feel so alone. 


So I've been thinking of breaking up. Currently were long distance. I'm 1000 miles away for a summer internship so I can only call. I won't be back for another month so I can't do it in person. I love him and I care for him but were miserable. I'm scared of the thought of him moving on from me and flirting with other women or holding up though and I feel I'm a bit codependent, he's been my main support for the past two years (my family is in shambles and I recently quit a toxic job and lost a lot of friends, I need a fresh start). But I've noticed my eyes have started to wander and I don't want to end up like him. I guess I'm also scared of being completely alone in a state where I know no one and he is a huge comfort to all that. He's my best friend and I'm so scared of living without him.


I guess what I'm looking for is some reassurance that I'm doing the right thing and that I'll be okay. I'm scared I'll regret losing him and I'll miss him so much and that I'll be making a mistake. But I feel trapped in this relationship. I don't want to lose him forever and potentially fuck up our mutual friend circle. I just really wish he didn't do this. I just wish it never happened, we could have been so happy.


**tl;dr**: Discovered my LDR boyfriend of one year cheated on me last summer and lied about it for months. Tried working it out and getting through it but I don't feel like he understands how I'm feeling and gets upset when I ask questions because he tickle truthed what happened. Contemplating breaking up with him for my sanity but am scared of having doubts because I'm scared I'll lose the only person who really cares about me."

I am a rising senior in CS, and i am currently doing an QA/Automation Internship. I am kind of disappointed in my internship, as i applied to so many development internships (~20 or so) and did not get even a single offer. When i received the offer for my current internship, it was rather bittersweet since i knew i would not enjoy QA too much, but i still took it, because its still better than no internship (and i was desperate). i would say 80% of my responsibilities revolve around writing selenium scripts to test web applications. At first, it was moderately interesting, because i was learning a new framework and felt like i was getting decent coding experience, however, after a while it got extremely, mind-numbingly boring. It has gotten to the point where i hate going to work, because, i know it is just going to be another 8 hours of writing boring Selenium scripts, and gaining no relevant development experience. It is also so frustrating when i am talking to friends, and they tell me about their awesome internships where they are creating mobile applications, websites, and working as a part of an actual Agile development team. I started this internship on June 1st and it is supposed to last six months. I have been through barely 2 months now, and i honestly don't know if i can keep this up for another 4 months.

This internship, however, has given me so much appreciation for QA people. I don't take QA for granted, and know it is an extremely crucial part of the development process (finding bugs, automating testing, etc), however, i just don't think it is for me, as i always have had a fascination for development.

My main question is, for all the QA/Automation Engineers out there, what keeps you really interested in your job, and why do you enjoy doing it? Would you say you have a ""passion"" for what you do?

Thanks for any responses :)"

4urrwr,3,2016-07-26,Anyone have any experience getting back together with someone after a break up/break and not repeating the same mistakes and bad behaviors?,loveidiot87,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4urrwr/anyone_have_any_experience_getting_back_together/,"[29m] So I have just recently broken up with my off and on girlfriend [27f] of 2 years. We originally met 3 years ago while she was on an internship in my city. We became fast friends and spent a lot of time together in spite of the fact that she had a boyfriend of 6 years back home. By the end of her internship, some feelings had developed between us and she ended her relationship with her boyfriend and we began a casual two week hook up before she moved home. She inevitably got back with the boyfriend and I moved on.

Then 2 years ago she came back to work on a project for a couple months. We repeated the same cycle from the previous summer and began hanging out all the time again, platonically. I had a girlfriend at this point so it was easier. But by the end of her project, history repeated itself and we started hooking up again. This time was way more serious as it was actually an affair and we told each other we loved each other before we began having sex again.

The initial part of the relationship was rocky as she was still with her boyfriend on paper and we had to hide our relationship from everyone. This lasted for months because, even after they broke up, she also didnt want to hurt him by having him find out that she was immediately in a relationship with another guy. She also decided to move to my city and never went back home once her project was over. 

The first 6 months were rocky as she had to figure out her emotions for two men and was also drinking away a lot of her problems. I bartend and was also drinking too heavily at the beginning also. So all of the hiding, the drinking, the arguing, and the emotions definitely put a damper on the early days of our relationship. But we went sober, and things became great. For months we were by far the best relationship I had ever been in. Then one of our friends was murdered and our world got turned upside down.

I began drinking a lot, lost my job, and basically went broke. It was a dark time. Our relationship was the only solid thing in the midst of that. Then one day I was attacked at a bar and her reaction was to make fun of me. I lost it after that. I know I was being sensitive and lashed out, but it was the wrong thing to do to me in the state I was in. I cursed her out and told her to go home. Then she dumped me because she told me that she does not allow anyone to talk to her like that.

We got back together a week or so after that but things were different from that point on. We were meaner to each other after that. Things got toxic and there was a level of anxiety in the relationship now. She had a quick temper and began storming out any time we had an argument. The inevitable texting that happened after that just ensured that the fights would last longer and be more intense than usual. Things were like this for the past few months, but at a manageable level. Then one day she blew up on me out of no where. Told me she resents me and the way we fight. Also, that she will not be talked to the way I do and that she was done. A crazy sudden break up.

So for the past month, we have been apart. At first we didnt talk. Then we talked but she continued her bashing of me and hate talk. Then she realized the part she played and she softened up and we began seeing each other again. I realized the love is still there, we just got to a weird place in our lives after the murder and that started a cascade into every other aspect of our lives. We came to the mutual agreement to take a month or two away from each other (she is traveling for 6 weeks) in order to work on ourselves and get our minds right so that we can be together in a stronger way. Because we are genuinely great together.

The kicker to this story is that we bought tickets to a concert before the break up. This concert happened to fall on the night before her trip. Even though we had been hooking up and casually hanging again by this point, we made the decision to go with our friends and meet up at the end of the concert to spend the last night together. She ended up getting drunk and selling me out to get drunk after the concert with some guy that was part of her group and his friends. I got pissed and she drunkenly told me she didnt need my shit and proceeded to rip me a new asshole through texts. I dont know if she went home with the guy from that night, she says she didnt, but thats beside the point. That final fight before she left showed me that there is no way that we could ever work unless we really changed how we deal with each other. And a lot of it comes from this general resentment that we developed towards each other that we need to break away from. I dont have any expectations for getting back with this girl any time soon, but I would like to work on myself and possibly reconcile for the long term. I would also like to find a way to get her to realize her faults and the origins of her anger also. Because I do love her and want to be with her, but we became so toxic that I know we need a ton of work.

Any and all advice I greatly appreciated.

tl;dr Broke up with my girlfriend because we became toxic. There is a possibility for a reconciliation one day because we werent that bad to each other, nor did we cheat or do anything very bad. But I need advice on how to become better if we ever do reconcile and I dont want to make the same mistakes."

Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

--------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up (would love her to look like Madison Ivy)

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S also looking to role play Marvel/DC, Game Of Thrones, The Witcher and Mass Effect

4us3ew,1134,2016-07-26,How TF2 helped me achieve my dream of getting a job in Silicon Valley,LoopsCode,tf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/4us3ew/how_tf2_helped_me_achieve_my_dream_of_getting_a/,"This is a story on how TF2 got me a job in Silicon Valley, the place of my dreams to begin my career as a fresh new computer engineering grad. 

_________

This story started two years ago, when I was invited to sub as a Soldier in a UGC Silver Highlander team from a friend, his name Borat, I met in TF2Center. We played a few games while we chatted in Mumble, and in the first few games, we clicked pretty well. A few days later, this friend asked if I was interested in joining their team full-time as their main soldier for the upcoming season. I first hesitated, but eventually agreed because I thought the dudes were all very swell. 

Fast forward a few months, we were deep into the weekly games. Our team didn't have the best DM, or the best players, or even the best strats, but gosh darn, we had team work and good vibes. The group of guys were just great people that encouraged each other when things went south, and in general, made the sometimes-toxic UGC environment tolerable, and even fun!

Speaking of toxicity, this is how the story *really* started. 

As you all know, some teams would bring in unregistered ringers (often times higher skill divisions than what the current team is), imposters with the same name and display picture (played by a higher level player), or sometimes, the team leader just doesn't know it's against the rules. Prior to a match, there isn't much time to actually check one-by-one whether the player on the team is really who they say they are, or whether they're in the official roster. My team leader, let's call him Messiah, knew that I was a software developer. He is also one. He expressed to me his frustration, and it clicked to me that maybe I should try to take a stab at solving this problem.

A few weeks later, the UGC Roster Verification tool (now offline) was born. Initially, only the players in the team used it. After awhile, I started sharing it on /r/tf2, /r/truetf2, the UGC forums, TF2Center forums, and more, and it kinda blew up. I recall over 1000 unique players used it, and for a kid like me, that was pretty insane. Hearing people's thoughts on the tool prompted me to learn to gather user feedback, test for bugs, and ultimately implement new features to it. This was a great feeling, and it really trained me to become a better software and product developer.

Fast forward a few more months, the team sort of disbanded because we all had real life responsibilities to attend to (although no worries, we all shoot the shit on our Slack channel on a daily basis). I was talking to Messiah how I was graduating soon in June 2016, and whether he has any tips for me for job search.

Little did I know, Messiah, who I absolutely admire because he is *also* the main dev of a Steam based website, works in a company in Silicon Valley. I was absolutely flabbergasted. Recall, I've known him for around a year and a half by now, and this is the first time I knew about this. He keeps it very low key, a hint to his character. He asked me if I was interested in his company, which is conveniently located in the center of Silicon Valley. 

Am I interested? *Am I??* My life long dream has been to work in Silicon Valley. I think interested was an understatement. I was more like - ***fuck yes I am***! 

I honestly tried to apply for internships in this area all five years of my college career, with no luck each time. Being able to begin my career in the Valley would actually fulfill a long-time dream of mine.

Messiah put in a good word for me to the CEO of the company knowing what I did with the UGC Roster Verifier tool (and our fun technical discussions on coding and tech in Slack/Mumble), and I scheduled my first call with them. 

One call led to another technical call. Then a third culture call. Then finally, I was invited to their office in the Valley for a full day of on-site interviews. I flew over from the East coast; everything was paid for. Was I nervous? Goddamn I was. At this point, I was rejected by a few companies already, and morale was at a new low. 

I arrived at their office a few weeks later in beautiful California. I went through the rounds of interviews starting at 9 AM. After the seven and a half hours of interviews, of testing me everything from algorithms, data structures, building simple apps, asking me questions about design/UX/UI, career motivations, culture fit questions, and more, it was over. I was emotionally/physically/mentally exhausted, but I felt good. I even got to meet Messiah in person for the first time in two years, and he gave me a TF2 shirt. Even after meeting him in person, I still can't put a face to his voice from Mumble. It's just too unreal.

After I flew home, I went through one more phone technical interview with them, just to get more data. Considering they are a data analytics company, that made a lot of sense. 

So after around 11+ combined hours of interviews, one day, my now-boss called me to extend me an offer. It was my first offer, from a company of my dreams, and after all those rejections! I don't think happiness described it. After literally nine months of rejections after rejections, of reviewing those excruciating data structures and algorithms questions (which takes time away from me from developing great applications), of waking up knowing I *still* don't have a job while friends around me were getting offers - it was finally over. It actually took me three days to fully process the mental load that it's over. 

I achieved my dream, but I didn't do it alone. Playing TF2 actually helped me achieve my dream. Thank you Messiah, Borat, and the rest of the team for being such good people. I honestly can say I couldn't have done it without them! 

____________

So this is my story of how TF2 helped me achieved my dream of getting a job in Silicon Valley. 

The lesson I learned is - just be a good person. Be a good person even under the veil of anonymity. You don't know when it will bite you in the butt, or when it will literally help you achieve your dreams. Just do it!

(x-post),3yeargradthrowaway,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4us83f/graduate_early_or_stay_another_year_xpost/,"This upcoming fall I will be going into my third year of college. Due to overloading a couple semesters, combined with a few summer terms, I will complete all of the required courses this spring (assuming I don't fail anything). I have two industry (electrical engineering) related work experiences and have completed research with one professor for about a year and a half. My resume is decent but it doesn't really stand out. I have been thinking about maybe going to graduate school if I decide to graduate, or: stay at my school, complete another internship, gather more research experience, and get a double major. Right now I have a 3.8 GPA, but a safe range for the end of the year will be 3.7-3.9. 

Finances are not really a constraint. It would obviously be nice to save an extra ~15k by graduating early, but I am definitely not in a strain. I feel that this decision will be worth more than 15k as a long term move.

4usax8,4,2016-07-26,"Me [19F] with my boyfriend [20M] of six months, he is ashamed of our living situation",perlkat,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4usax8/me_19f_with_my_boyfriend_20m_of_six_months_he_is/,"Sorry this post is so long for such a simple problem!

My boyfriend and I have been together about six and a half months now. He is truly a wonderful person--charismatic, funny, and I know he worries about me a lot. Sometimes he can have difficulties being sensitive to my problems, but I think it's because he grew up in a household of girls and learned to bottle up his own emotions. So far we've had the best relationship of my life by far. We communicate often and clearly, and we actually recently worked through a very major issue, which is why this issue is perplexing me. I need some insight. But first, background.

I am a computer science student and I have one year left of college, which I start in the fall (graduating in three years). This is a lot, and I chose to take a class last summer instead of taking an internship. I went home to my parents and community college. This summer, however, is my last opportunity for an internship. I worked very hard to secure an amazing and well paying internship with Software Company X. Company X is located an hour and a half away from my college, in the closest city. My boyfriend, on the other hand, can't take internships because he's military. He decided to do unpaid research at our college this summer so that he could take a break in the middle for military training.

We were both super, super excited for each other this summer. We're both doing what we're passionate about. The only problem was he had no place to live (because he has no income) and I had no roommate to keep me company. He suggested that we live together this summer, as it would only be two months, and I'd be getting an apartment anyway. I happily agreed, knowing full well that he would not be able to help with rent, utilities, and I would probably have to help him pay for gas. To me, money is a nonissue so long as I can keep saving and have enough to survive. I've been generous with my previous boyfriends, and I have never regretted it (even if I've regretted those relationships). He knew that this was the situation, as well, but we were just happy to get out of the dorms and be ""real"" adults.

I started looking for an apartment near Company X. Boyfriend told me that then his total commute would be 3 hours a day, though, and it would be a better compromise to move half an hour toward our college because then rent would be cheaper and his commute would be shorter. I agreed, but I was still disappointed because it meant that I wouldn't be able to bike to work like I was hoping. I had a lot of trouble finding an apartment because I started looking so late. I ended up getting a one bedroom apartment instead of a studio, too, because the apartment was in a better location for him, which is an extra couple hundred dollars a month. But I mean, I'm just happy I finally found an apartment! I call the place and set up an appointment, sign a form, arrange my dad to cosign, etc. We split the application fee because I didn't have the full $50 in my wallet.

The apartment complex emails me, telling me that they need our SSNs. Boyfriend dragged his feet majorly because ""he doesn't like giving private info to strangers"". I mean, I understand that SSNs are supposed to be private. But it's so that they CAN be used for things like this. We had a small fight because I felt like he was punishing me, not the apartment complex, because I was the one in charge of all communication with them and making our living arrangements work and it was REALLY stressing me out. He gives in and I send them a scan of our cards.

Fast forward two months. He's completed field training and come back home, and we've been living together a month now. Because I found out my identity was stolen and he was gifted a couple thousand dollars by his parents, he agreed to help pay utilities. We had to put them in his name because I fail credit checks. So far I've dumped at least $2000 into this apartment, through bills and rent. I didn't get to keep anything out of my first two paychecks, because it literally all went to bills. Suddenly I'm worried that I'm going to LOSE money on this internship, but because boyfriend is back he was able to cover our electricity bill ($70) and our gas bill ($10) for a month. He offered to pay next month's rent, too, which is about 3/4 of normal rent and due next weekend. This is WAY more than I thought he'd end up being able to pay, and I'm super happy about it.

The reason why he's able to pay this is because his parents gifted him $2000 against his will. It turns out that his parents had tried to give him the money earlier so he could help me with rent, and he'd refused it because he doesn't want their money. He's working ~40 hour weeks right now (9-5 job), plus two hours of driving a day, which brings the total up to 50 hours. I am taking one online class from our college and working full time at my internship. I'm putting in 65-75 hour weeks, including driving. But at our apartment the only chore he does is cooking, and not every day. He loves cooking and making me feel like a princess and making awesome meals for us, which I really appreciate. But all of these elaborate meals make dishes, and our dishwasher is broken. So I spend around an hour a day washing dishes, because he absolutely hates doing dishes. To be fair, I think it's wrong to have to cook and do dishes. But I also have to remind him to do ANY of the other chores around the apartment. I feel like his mother. I've told him so, and our conversation went something like ""They're on my radar, and I know when I need to get them done. I just like to wait until the last minute."" But while he's waiting, our apartment gets messier and messier. I am kind of a neat freak. I don't like having dishes all around the apartment, or having dirty clothes on the floor. I like it when we put our shoes in a row, and when there aren't dirty dishes overflowing in the sink. I actually get extra stressed out when they're not done. But he doesn't care about these things, so they don't even enter his radar.

So he doesn't really do chores on his own, and he hasn't really paid that much of the bills. Which I am FINE with. This was part of the arrangement. But I happened to mention offhandedly today in conversation that I really feel like he moved in with me, rather than us moving in together. After all, I would've gotten an apartment anyway, and I did all the legal side of things (finding apartment, booking appointment, paying bills, and set up one of the two utilities and walked him through how to set up the other). I feel that he's really done no work to make this apartment his except unpacking some of his boxes and helping set up appliances that his mother bought for him. But he's very offended because I've made him out to be a tag along, rather than an equal partner in all of this. I told him everything I've written here, but he's still upset. He says that when people ask him how long his drive to work is and he says an hour because he lives with his girlfriend, they think he's crazy for living so far away. But he says what I said makes him question whether he should really be living with me after all. It's not what the people at work say, it's what I say. I mean, he is really, genuinely upset about this. I told him that I don't feel that way at all, but he's still convinced that I'm being rude for saying this kind of stuff to him. I don't want him to feel bad, but I don't understand how he feels at all. If I were in his shoes, I wouldn't feel bad at all! I know he wants to be independent, but he literally signed on for this. How do I make him feel better about this situation? Is my thinking wrong?


**TL;DR**: My boyfriend moved in with me for this summer, does very little chores and doesn't pay many bills. Is upset that I implied he's just a tag along instead of an equal stakeholder in our home, and is ashamed that he's not independent. This is what he signed on for, though! How do I make him feel better, or is my way of thinking wrong?"
4usfi9,0,2016-07-26,Me [23 F] moving to a new apartment and my dad [early 50s] keeps buying furniture that i don't like because i am financially dependent on him,Newman5317,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4usfi9/me_23_f_moving_to_a_new_apartment_and_my_dad/,"I graduated college in January and since then, I moved back home with my parents and have been working a minimum wage retail job until last month. I start grad school this fall in a new city. The tuition for the 2 year program will be entirely covered by TAing for the school, which was a financial package I got offered when I got accepted. On top of the tuition waive, the school is giving me a living stipend and health insurance. But with that said, I don't have a source of income right now and I plan to get a part-time job or internship to cover my rent partially. The stipend will cover most of my daily living expenses, but definitely not my rent. My dad has offered to cover it for the duration of my program because he knows how much my major matters to me and he believes that I can get employed upon graduation. This was decided prior to me applying for schools more than a year ago.  


Last week, I finally signed a lease to a studio apartment nearby the school. The rent is more than I had budgeted but I checked with my dad and he said he would gladly help me out and that he'd rather have me live in a safe neighborhood than find a cheap but crappy place. Any way, I've been really excited to furnish it and I have big ambitions to finally get my many movie posters framed, buy matching furniture, color coordinate, etc. because I have never lived in an apartment before (just dorms) so I never really had a chance to decorate anything permanently besides my high school bedroom. Earlier today, my dad told me that he found great deals on a mattress and sheets and bought them for my new place....I had previously mentioned to him that I think I wanted a queen-sized bed but I was merely considering it. But now I guess I am stuck with it....He also bought these grey bedsheets, which again, I have mentioned before that I think I want my studio's colors to be grey and black, but it wasn't final and I certainly did not ask him to buy them for me. I'm ok with the sheets but I would've preferred a different shade. On top of this, he already bought me an Internet router (this I don't care too much about). When I showed agitation about him purchasing things for my apartment without consulting with me, he got irritated back and said I shouldn't be upset because he's paying for the apartment and I'm still financially dependent on him. I said that he should still ask before buying something that is pretty personal and that I would of course check with him first before any big purchases. He left the conversation disgruntled that I should be grateful of his financial support at all times. I am...but I just want him to stop buying my furniture that's all. 


Do I have a right to be irritated by his actions or am I being picky and unappreciative? Should I ask him to stop all future purchases that have to do with apartment decoration and don't furnish the place until I save up enough to buy them myself? I'm not talking $3k Pottery Barn couches here - I've been mostly looking at Ikea and Campus Free &amp; For Sale Facebook pages.  


TL;DR; My dad bought a few items for my new apartment without consulting with me. I showed annoyance and now he's saying that I'm being ungrateful of his financial support. "
4usfpm,3,2016-07-26,"I was let go from my internship halfway through. Should I include this position in my re.sume even though I was only there for a month and a half (i.e., June-July)?",Throwaway_cuzwhynot,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4usfpm/i_was_let_go_from_my_internship_halfway_through/,"Hi everyone. I previously posted this in the resume advice thread, but I think I'll get more responses if I post my question here.

So, I recently graduated with my bachelor's degree in computer science, and I was fortunate enough to get hired as an intern at a software company. Though I did well during the training process and completed earlier tasks quickly and with little to no errors, I was unable to finish a larger project by my manager’s deadline. I also believe that I was working at a slower pace compared to the other interns, and as a result, I felt that I gave my manager the impression that I was slacking off on the job (even though I was just struggling to understand their development environment). Unfortunately, because I didn’t have projects in production by the end of the month and because the managers didn’t see improvement in my performance, I was let go from my internship halfway through.

Anyway, what I am most worried about is that this is the only internship opportunity I’ve had in development. Since a lot of what I did at the internship dealt with web development, I feel that I can apply those experiences towards other positions. Therefore, I was wondering if I should keep this experience on my resume even though I was only at the company for a month and a half (i.e., June-July).

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

Im not about to blame steroids for any type of instability or anger issues I might have, I know I dealt with them growing up in a number of ways, I do notice that while I'm on cycle It can feel a little like I'm walking a even thinner line than normal. 

What do you guys do to help yourselves when you feel yourself spinning.... 

-Nature walks (haven't had energy/time from factory work)
-More cardio(slacking lately)
-Check Estrodial/Stable blood levels of all drugs(mine are fine right now)
-Spend time with friends(friends grew apart as i got angrier slash more reclusive, id rather be with that girl and it shows on my face unfortunately)
-Hobby thats not lifting(video games? isolates me more)
-Therapist( I'm willing to try anything but I really don't think this will help, had a bad experience with one as a child, started to tell her about my parents getting physical(totally deserved it) and she called child services and my mom reamed me and her out)

Im going to be uncharacteristically candid here... maybe someone can pm me if you have some experience....

I Hate to admit it but I know I'm on a slippery slope at the moment, and I really don't know what to do to help myself, i grew up with a roof over my head two parents and food on the table. I am very fortunate but i also have to admit I've been suicidal ever since i can remember. It started from when this camp counselor made me and my friend and this girl all rub each others shit and lick our assholes when i was about five, my friend initiated a blowjob on me a few weeks later and i let him, I was still in kindergarten at the time so I don't even think I was hard but i thought i was gay growing up after that and fucking hated myself for it despite not being the least bit attracted to males and fantasized about killing myself since then to run away from it... i blocked it out until i told my ex in college, who, i had a nuts relationship with, she's a go go dancer/massage therapist,i might have pushed her a few times trying to confront her in a drunken rage, got sucker punched by this dude she was trying to hook up with, tried to kill myself for the first time after that by jumping into a cab in nyc but my reflexes caught over and i jumped a little as it hit my legs and i bounced off the window and onto the roof of it and slowly ran away after i caught my breath. I feel sorry for the cab driver, that was the last time until yesterday... apparently garages are harder to fill with carbon monoxide then i thought, its embarrassing as fuck to admit and even write, but maybe some one is going through it i dunno, I'm happy i loaned my brother my .45, I've had that in my mouth before. Anyways story after cliche story over years, we are like oil and fire, relevant because i was in a healthy spot for awhile then my dad died and she came back into the picture almost a decade later and I've been spiraling since, she makes me feel sane and special then disappears and makes it seem perfectly normal, texting and talking all day or very often then no contact, admittedly not entirely her fault, she lives across the country now. Ive isolated myself the past four or five years, training, marijuana and a failed relationship were my only ways to unwind, I used to drink in moderation but found I would tend to get into trouble doing that type of stuff, Ive had four or five or trips to the hospital and or jail from being found unconscious after boozing... and example would be one night stole a drunk bus full of people outside the campus police station with a friend and drove it a few hundred yards before coming to my senses and running away, or having my lifting buddy perform surgery on my index finger tendon while hammered, completely yanked it out, with kitchen tweezers, looks like a big long white jiggly booger. its pathetic i can't control it all the time I'm aware. So if i do drink ill have a beer to fit in now adays. But i haven't drank in about 2.5 years because I've been chasing some aesthetic goals and because honestly I really can't seem to find pleasure in anything i used to and I'm starting to notice my depressions handicapping my ability and stunting my life. It was the reason me and my last girl (not the first one) broke up I never left the house and bulked to 297.9 lbs at 5'8' i met her at 165... needless to say after 4 years she moved on pretty fast, although i don't have any animosity really, just miss her.

I have two degrees from Northeastern and had a academic scholarship, i worked blue collar jobs throughout college and high school in addition to sports and have a year and half experience in a marketing/sales jobs through internships. I passed my last final three days after my dad was killed in a car accident. (just canceled his life insurance policy the month before in order to pay the mortgage) I know i Have grit i just can't help seem the point, I can't land a job, forget one I want, A JOB, i was working in a factory making close to minimum wage since graduation in order to pay bills. I have to work so much fucking harder than my peers for the basics. I always came home after school and did extra homework, i really just feel like I'm burnt out on both ends before i even started the race. I really feel like the military is my only option at not going completely postal on the way to work one day but Im worried its just because my backs agains the wall.

anyways sorry for the rant, what would you guys do... in my mind i could get a personal training job that would allow me to pay rent and move somewhere for a year while i try to decide what to do with my future? Ive been living at home since he died to help my mother with our land, its in the middle of fucking nowhere, so its not exactly easy to put myself out there with girls, but i really don't enjoy sleeping around anymore, id kill to meet the right girl but i know the chances of that happening are next to none in a normal city, forget living in bumble fuck nowhere. i turned down one or two job opportunities rightt after i graduated that have understandably vanished and now about 14 months later, Im in a hole and need some      good actionable advice      besides stop feeling sorry for yourself and go fuck something, you'll forget about her. I have been, for literally years."

I'm two years into an education at an Ivy. Fortunately I have amazing parents who both can afford and do care enough to pay my tuition, which is a ridiculous 60ishK per year. 

I recently got an internship at a tech company and I have come to realize that my degree doesn't seem to count for shit beyond getting in the door. And I don't know how valuable that is either considering the high demand for developers anyways. There are interns from other less prestigious, but way way more affordable schools who are making the same I am at the company and seem to have access to the same opportunities I do. 

I'm in too deep to transfer out and skip on getting that stamp on my diploma. But how can I make the most of it? Is there something I'm missing that I should be doing, because otherwise I can't help but feel that it would have been a hell of a lot smarter to get a degree at an in-state school than cost my parents a quarter of a million dollars and end up at the same place in my career anyways.

I know it's only 30 days but holy crap. To make it worth it to anyone reading this I will give a detail of benefits received, some general tips and a positive attitude haha.

Started this journey because my last girlfriend left me because I didn't treat her right as I was so blinded by porn and you know, trauma forces people to change, so I did. I made the decision to then and I have succeeded only now, more than a year in, so for our warriors here keep trying! 

Benefits I received? I will try and say things that are not obvious like more time and better confidence. I picked up android programming. My deadlift went up by 20 lbs in a month and I now hold a state record and I finally landed myself an internship where I'm leading a team haha. It's all cool cause I was just put on probation in college but I'll be in the Dean's list this semester to makeup for it. I can't even put into words how much this has changed me to be honest. Everything is better, not happier(you have to deal with your emotions) but simply more accessible,  girls, money, motivation, good looks, it all comes to you and if it doesn't you have the will to change it. 

Tips to help. (by week) 

1)Face the first week: Be a f###ing man about it. Don't come here and be like I need help. You do! but help yourself. Take it on like a challenge. Something i would whisper to myself when my will was fading. ""If you fail here, life will fail you"". Harsh, but you must be your worst critic.

2)Flatline will come: I know for some people this is just a loss of libido but man, I had crippling depression. Music made me cry and I started to eat less. But so what, i had a goal in my mind and I'm not giving up. During this week I came on Nofap and would stupidly try and find excuses to quit noFap. ""Do i really need it"", ""I don't have PIED"", ""Who is noFap really for?"" . I realised this was putting a dent in my ego to change. So i quit that too. I wrote posts which helped me and the community instead. 

3)This is absolutely a waste of my time: No benefits, confidence goes away. Life is like coming down from drugs. I was mad, sleepy and tired all at the same time. I did notice I could sleep better (normally fell asleep at 4am, now 11:30 pm on the dot) and I was losing fat, but I was working out harder too.
Nofap was making days longer in a not comfortable way. I noticed I wanted to fap when i was Stressed out and not being able to face my problems. This  was shocking to me. I wasn't mildly horny and I would crave a release, a release from my duty so I could be a porn junkie and achieve less than I now I can. 

4)Haha I'm back: This is great. It's stayed like this, I'm generally a happy person and porn would return that baseline for a few hours after, now however, It's just constant. I would also like to say something possibly ignorant. In my denial to face my porn addiction, I tested myself for ADD professionally and was given medication. I took it for a semester and It wasn't helping so I stopped. Picked up nofap and have been much better since. I know this is not a medical opinion but It means the world to me.

TL;DR Best feeling in the world seeing that star. Read it if you want :p"

1. I am going to talk to my boss/mentor soon about a possible full time opportunity. I have half a semester of college left so I would be looking to come back starting January. How should I approach him about this? I have a few ideas how to and am pretty confident of them, but want to get other peoples views (especially people that have been talked to by an intern, or an intern who has spoken to his boss about this)

2. is that fact that i have been given the opportunity to intern here not only once, but twice give me a better shot at landing a possible full time role?

3. When applying to startup jobs, do most companies like the fact that someone has a few years of startup experience? or does it really not matter?

4utlxs,263,2016-07-27,"You ask for a rainforest, we'll give you a rainforest.",MexicanSpaceProgram,MaliciousCompliance,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/4utlxs/you_ask_for_a_rainforest_well_give_you_a/,"This one probably fits the tone of this sub more than my other submissions.

Anyway, we need some background on this one.  There's these things called ""Class Rules"" that are issued by organisations like the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) and Det Norske Veritas (DNV).  They tell you *everything* about how to build a ship - what steel to use, what welding to use, how the toilets work.  Correspondingly, they're fucking *huge* phonebooks with a limited number of uses, but you have to keep them around ~~in case you need a booster seat for a toddler~~ ~~to beat a suspect half to death with~~ because you're required to by law.

Now, every so often these Class Rules are updated.  This is a major pain in the arse.  DNV are good - they release the new rules and a little PDF telling you what the changes are e.g. ""toilet height increased by 3mm in section 3.2.1.5"".  ABS, nah - they rerelease the old ones with the changes marked up in red like some fucking elementary school teacher grading a paper - ""toilet height has changed - see me after class"".

A client bought a piece of shit semisubmersible rig from some bumfuck good 'ol boy outfit in Incest, Alabama or Toothless, Arkansas that went out of business.  They dragged the shitheap down to the KFELS shipyard in Singapore from the GoM and want to put new topsides on it (i.e. keep the hull, replace the drilling, accommodation and support modules).  Personally, I think the thing is better suited to being an artificial reef or some kind of futuristic sci-fi prison barge where the inmates have to fight to the death to stay alive, but I'm not in charge of such minutiae.

Since they're adding new stuff to old crap, the regulator here in Australia (which is where they want to bring this monstrosity) asks them to send them a copy of changes between the '88 Rules which the hull is built to, and the newer ones that the topsides are built to.  ""Sure, no worries!"" says them, and then they call me.  The conversation goes thusly:

""...yeah, no worries.  '88 and which rules?""

""2003""

""You realise we're going to have to do the intervening years because ABS doesn't do change logs?""

""Yeah.""

""...and you *actually* agreed to do it?!""

""Pretty much"".

""Do you have any idea how boring that is, let alone how much it's going to cost at hourly rates?""

""All good, it's factored into the refit capex"".

FUCK.  Damn christ son-of-a-bitch-whore dog cunt.  There's at least 15,000 pages to go through, half of which we only have in hardcopy.  My Jew of a boss is delighted because he's seeing hours on hours of billable work in his eyes with no real cut-off date.  I get the Client on the phone to figure out what they promised them.

""Standard submission"" says the Super.

""Fuck me - are you fucking serious?""

""Yep.""

Standard submission to the Regulator here is 2 x hardcopies, 2 x electronic.  Normally, that's fine if you're talking about a safety case or an emergency response plan.  These guys have promised a small rainforest worth of paper.  Oh well, fuck the rainforest - what's it ever done for me but make Greenpeace charity muggers ask me for money?  Fuck 'em.

So, I set up a ""work group"", which consists of me, and half a dozen Work Experience Drones.  These are otherwise known as ""interns"" to our knuckle-dragging American friends - college kids who want ""real world experience"".  Basically they do whatever I want for fuck-all and if they complain, I can fuck them off and replace them with new drones.  They're not bad kids, just annoyingly idealistic.

I try to be nice to them but a.) they're idiots; and b.) what kind of idiot agrees to work 8 hours in exchange for lunch and bus fare?  Also, they keep talking about how ""stressful"" college is.  Idiots.

""So, that's the project - I'll give you each a copy of the Class Rules for the year you've been given.  Any time you see a page with RED markup on it, enter it into the excel spreadsheet and make two photocopies of that page"".

""Is this *billable*?"" asks one of the Drones excitedly.  He thinks if it's billable we'll pay him or something.  Cute.

""Absolutely!"" says I.  It isn't really (for them), but I set up a dummy account in the timewriting system so ~~I could account for the hours and teach kids project management~~ the Drones would feel important.

""Is there a kick-off meeting?"".  Ah.  They want lunch.

""Sure - let's go to [pub next door]!"".  Lunch costs me nothing because I can expense anything related to ""mentoring"" Work Experience Drones.

Anyway, I corral my Drones into our old conference room and set them up.  I put a big whiteboard and a Gantt chart on the wall so they feel important.  I put a laminated Project Group sign on the door so they felt more important.  I also assigned them roles.  The bloke doing data entry was the ""Project Information Coordinator"" etc.

I also assigned one as ""Project Manager"" because she was a serious cutie (think young Katie Holmes) that wore pencil skirts to work.  She was 19 - complete jailbait to me - but easy on the eyes.  I vaguely recall I said something about ""setting a positive example of women in management roles"", but I can't remember.  Sue me, she had nice legs.

*Side note:  before anyone gets uppity about me being mean to Drones, these kids all got good letters of reference, and unlike other people, I actually assigned them work, not ""get a jug of water and some glasses, put them on the table, and fuck off because we have a meeting"".  Also, they weren't graduates, just college kids I got foisted with.*

Three weeks later, it's all done.  Deliverables consist of two burnt CDs full of scanned PDFs, and four photocopier boxes full of bullshit.  I get the ""Project Manager"" to write up the transmittal and sign it, and we sit around ~~trying not to ogle her like a paedophile at a Wiggles concert~~ and wait for DHL to pick it up.  Guy comes in and takes three or four trips to haul the shit down to his van because he thought it was just documents (which it was, but a fuckload of them).

Maybe two hours later we get a call from the client.  A very pissed off one.  I've got him on speakerphone while ""Project Manager"" sits in on the call.

""What is all this shit?"" asks their Ops Manager.

""Deliverables"", says I.

""I know what deliverables are - what's this FOUR BOXES FULL OF SHIT doing in my doorway?""

""Before we go any further, do you mind if this conversation is used for training and coaching purposes?"".

""What the FUCK are you smoking?  What am I supposed to do with this crap?""

""Put a cover note on it and drop it off with the regulator.  It's all there in the transmittal.""

""WHAT?""

""The transmittal form.  Has everything on there.  Don't use ours though, you're the ones who are supposed to be submitting this.""

*Pregnant pause*

""WHO THE FUCK IS ""PROJECT MANAGER""?!""

""She managed the project"".

""NO!  WHAT?  Who the fuck is SHE?"".  He's getting *really* pissed now, but, fuck him, he's an asshole.

""She ran the project and supervised the consultants involved"".

""Fine...okay...anything else?""

""You need to get it to the regulator by COB tomorrow.  I'd organise it today for first thing in the morning if I were you"".

""Fine.  We'll do that."" he says, quite grudgingly. ""Tell ""Project Manager"" we really appreciate her and the team coming up with it on short notice and all that"".

""Tell her yourself"" says I.  ""She's right here"".

They have a short chit-chat, until the Client asks how long she's worked for the company, because it's a small place and he's never heard of her.  She couldn't have said it better.

""Actually"" she says. ""I don't work for [company].  I'm on work experience from [college]"".

""WHAT?!""

""Yeah, I'm on work experience after I finished my first year.""

""FUCKING WHAT THE?...FUCKING!...MexicanSpaceProgram!""

""Yeah?"" I ask, fairly nonchalantly.

""We need to submit this to the regulator...it goes out tomorrow...we could get shut down if we don't...and you're telling me some fucking first year shithead COLLEGE KIDS put it together?""

""Yep.""

He hangs up and calls my boss.  ""Project Manager"" is terrified of being shitcanned (why, I'm not sure - it's not exactly a well paid position).  Some time goes by.

Boss storms into the conference room.  He's pissed - he saw dollar signs all over this thing.  He dials back to the Client's Ops Manager.
Boss decides to try his ""mediation"" voice.

""MexicanSpaceProgram, how many hours did you budget for this?""

""20 to do it, 20 as contingency.  A week, plus a kick-off meeting"".

""Huh?"" says the Ops Manager.

""Huh?"" says my Boss.

""Yeah, if we used billable people to do the work, it would have taken three weeks at dayrate.""

Client is now very happy.  Client is a pennypinching Scotsman.  Client is now quite pleased.  Boss is unhappy because he's a Jew and making less dosh.  Situation resolved.  Upshot:  Regulator looked at 4x photocopy boxes of shit and says ""um, yeah...looks like you did your homework...um...yeah we're happy"".

Have a drink with ""Project Manager"" after work.  Get various dirty looks from women because they think I'm robbing the cradle.  Explain that it's after-work drinks and she's my Project Manager and (in the short term) my boss.  Watch disgust turn to confusion.  Laugh heartily.  ""Project Manager"" leaves after a few because she has to get home.  Pity.  Sucks when she leaves but I really don't mind it when she walks away.

Boss very angry the next day.  Client is happy and has awarded us more *actual* work.  Boss doesn't care.  His Goldenstein senses are tingling and he wants a good reason why his palms aren't laced with silver.

""Look at this way"" says I.  ""You realise we get tax credits for every hour we mentor those kids, right?  Basically counts as a charitable donation"".

Boss's eyes light up.  The only thing Abraham likes better than making money is not giving away money, especially to the tax man.

""Project Manager"" ended up ditching college a few years later to work as a ""Qualified Personal Trainer"".  I've no idea what that is.  I put ""Qualified Personal Trainer"" in the same league as ""Certified Aromatherapist"" and ""Board-Accredited Faith Healer"".

**TL;DR** Sent four boxes of shit to the Client to forward to the regular and I had some college kids do the work, which was good for the client and made by boss happy because it let him dodge taxes.

4utrx2,1,2016-07-27,"I didn't get into college, now what ?",ggrumpypie,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4utrx2/i_didnt_get_into_college_now_what/,"I screwed up, I'm currently the 33th on the waiting list so chances are close to zero. I wanted to study advertising and I didn't choose any other safety options.

I am kinda devastated because I see how everyone around me succeeded and I did not. It's not like I was the last one in my class, I finished 2nd in my last year and I passed the baccalaureate with 8 (that was the criteria for the admission). 

So, now that I dried my eyes, I'm trying to think about my options. 

I can still find some colleges in autumn but only with tax places, but I don't want to go to a random college just for the sake of it.

I could take a gap year, maybe travel a bit, learn new things, read a lot, and this way maybe I can discover what I really like and what I want to do in life. And after that, if I still want to follow an advertising programme in college, I would also have plenty of time to sign up for a college that has an history exam as criteria and study for that, or any other college that has an exam for admission. Plus, I could even have a chance to get a tax-free place.

But the idea with this gap year would make my parents quite sad, not only they're disappointed right now but mom would pretty much go insane if I mention it to her, she thinks I want to give up college at all.

However, I see it like the perfect plan, maybe I could work abroad a few months and this way I could afford a new camera and lenses to progress with my hobby. Or even if I don't work to get paid, maybe I can volunteer or get an internship somewhere in a advertising agency to actually see how it would be to work in that area.

I would pretty much try to do anything not to actually ""stay home"", because I live in a small and boring town and I'm sick of it.
I could start learning by myself HTML, or Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop etc., any skills that would prove useful in the future.

So, any words of wisdom ?"

2. I just moved to New York City since my girlfriend can't leave her job for another 2 years (so I won't move out of NYC, please understand this). However, I have been having a very hard time landing interviews in NYC or NJ since April(mostly internships, paid or unpaid you name it). Even if I did well in the few interviews I got, no response from them ever since. 

3. One of my relatives works in Intel and he is a senior engineer. He recommended me through their internal network thing for 4 internship positions but Intel told me that they wouldn't give me an interview and would move on to someone else. So I've tried that. 

4. I'm very anxious now and I know I shouldn't be but I really can't control it. Now I believe one Reddit post I read talking about how ""employment is the worst thing for your psychological health"". Everyday when my girlfriend gets off work and comes home, I feel like a loser staying at home(she's an accountant, not the big 4 but good enough, and she's totally fine with this since she has been through the same but I don't feel well facing her).

5. I never stopped learning and preparing for interviews but with the anxiety going on right now I can't say I'm learning as efficiently as I used to be. Then I heard from a good friend who is now attending a bootcamp told me that thing would make me learn more efficiently and it could guarantee job placement. So I'm considering it. 

6. I'm very comfortable with intense learning environment and very confident I can graduate the bootcamp above average. And I got some savings since I got scholarships for my undergrad. 

So do you guys think I should do it? Any suggestion would be appreciated! Thanks!"

I did C++ programming classes at my CC and I learned a bunch of things like algorithm and data structures, and thought I'd try to get my hands on an internship.

However, when I checked on internships.com, most positions asks for things that I never even used like jquery, R, Drupal(never even heard of this), and such. Some even asked for previous working experience. How do I apply if every employer asks for previous working experience?

As soon as I found out the required skills to apply I feel dumb as a rock and highly incompetent, and I thought I was doing well in my classes.

Maybe computer science isn't the right path for me?

4uudmy,1,2016-07-27,How TF2 helped me achieve my dream of getting a job in Silicon Valley,RIPmod,RIPtf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/RIPtf2/comments/4uudmy/how_tf2_helped_me_achieve_my_dream_of_getting_a/,"This is a story on how TF2 got me a job in Silicon Valley, the place of my dreams to begin my career as a fresh new computer engineering grad. 

_________

This story started two years ago, when I was invited to sub as a Soldier in a UGC Silver Highlander team from a friend, his name Borat, I met in TF2Center. We played a few games while we chatted in Mumble, and in the first few games, we clicked pretty well. A few days later, this friend asked if I was interested in joining their team full-time as their main soldier for the upcoming season. I first hesitated, but eventually agreed because I thought the dudes were all very swell. 

Fast forward a few months, we were deep into the weekly games. Our team didn't have the best DM, or the best players, or even the best strats, but gosh darn, we had team work and good vibes. The group of guys were just great people that encouraged each other when things went south, and in general, made the sometimes-toxic UGC environment tolerable, and even fun!

Speaking of toxicity, this is how the story *really* started. 

As you all know, some teams would bring in unregistered ringers (often times higher skill divisions than what the current team is), imposters with the same name and display picture (played by a higher level player), or sometimes, the team leader just doesn't know it's against the rules. Prior to a match, there isn't much time to actually check one-by-one whether the player on the team is really who they say they are, or whether they're in the official roster. My team leader, let's call him Messiah, knew that I was a software developer. He is also one. He expressed to me his frustration, and it clicked to me that maybe I should try to take a stab at solving this problem.

A few weeks later, the UGC Roster Verification tool (now offline) was born. Initially, only the players in the team used it. After awhile, I started sharing it on /r/tf2, /r/truetf2, the UGC forums, TF2Center forums, and more, and it kinda blew up. I recall over 1000 unique players used it, and for a kid like me, that was pretty insane. Hearing people's thoughts on the tool prompted me to learn to gather user feedback, test for bugs, and ultimately implement new features to it. This was a great feeling, and it really trained me to become a better software and product developer.

Fast forward a few more months, the team sort of disbanded because we all had real life responsibilities to attend to (although no worries, we all shoot the shit on our Slack channel on a daily basis). I was talking to Messiah how I was graduating soon in June 2016, and whether he has any tips for me for job search.

Little did I know, Messiah, who I absolutely admire because he is *also* the main dev of a very-large-and-popular-unnamed-TF2-trading-site, works in a company in Silicon Valley. I was absolutely flabbergasted. Recall, I've known him for around a year and a half by now, and this is the first time I knew about this. He keeps it very low key, a hint to his character. He asked me if I was interested in his company, which is conveniently located in the center of Silicon Valley. 

Am I interested? *Am I??* My life long dream has been to work in Silicon Valley. I think interested was an understatement. I was more like - ***fuck yes I am***! 

I honestly tried to apply for internships in this area all five years of my college career, with no luck each time. Being able to begin my career in the Valley would actually fulfill a long-time dream of mine.

Messiah put in a good word for me to the CEO of the company knowing what I did with the UGC Roster Verifier tool (and our fun technical discussions on coding and tech in Slack/Mumble), and I scheduled my first call with them. 

One call led to another technical call. Then a third culture call. Then finally, I was invited to their office in the Valley for a full day of on-site interviews. I flew over from the East coast; everything was paid for. Was I nervous? Goddamn I was. At this point, I was rejected by a few companies already, and morale was at a new low. 

I arrived at their office a few weeks later in beautiful California. I went through the rounds of interviews starting at 9 AM. After the seven and a half hours of interviews, of testing me everything from algorithms, data structures, building simple apps, asking me questions about design/UX/UI, career motivations, culture fit questions, and more, it was over. I was emotionally/physically/mentally exhausted, but I felt good. I even got to meet Messiah in person for the first time in two years, and he gave me a TF2 shirt. Even after meeting him in person, I still can't put a face to his voice from Mumble. It's just too unreal.

After I flew home, I went through one more phone technical interview with them, just to get more data. Considering they are a data analytics company, that made a lot of sense. 

So after around 11+ combined hours of interviews, one day, my now-boss called me to extend me an offer. It was my first offer, from a company of my dreams, and after all those rejections! I don't think happiness described it. After literally nine months of rejections after rejections, of reviewing those excruciating data structures and algorithms questions (which takes time away from me from developing great applications), of waking up knowing I *still* don't have a job while friends around me were getting offers - it was finally over. It actually took me three days to fully process the mental load that it's over. 

I achieved my dream, but I didn't do it alone. Playing TF2 actually helped me achieve my dream. Thank you Messiah, Borat, and the rest of the team for being such good people. I honestly can say I couldn't have done it without them! 

____________

So this is my story of how TF2 helped me achieved my dream of getting a job in Silicon Valley. 

The lesson I learned is - just be a good person. Be a good person even under the veil of anonymity. You don't know when it will bite you in the butt, or when it will literally help you achieve your dreams. Just do it!

You can find our answers [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4uueqa/we_are_kaspersky_labs_global_research_analysis/d5syshi) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4uueqa/we_are_kaspersky_labs_global_research_analysis/d5t3cz7). Also, never stop asking questions. Don’t be afraid to learn new things, be open minded (try to go the extra mile when you learn something) and don’t hesitate to ask questions! Apply for internship positions, even if there are no openings displayed on the website. Sign up for your local security group in your city. Start doing CTFs (Capture the Flag). A good starting point for future CTFs is https://ctftime.org/ . Find some friends from your uni / community and start solving the challenges! You never know how things will turn out in the end :)

We also noticed a lot of people asking us about how difficult is to enter this industry. You can find our answer [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4uueqa/we_are_kaspersky_labs_global_research_analysis/d5svp0y)

4uumxq,5,2016-07-27,A little stuck in transitioning to a dev career,AdvDubs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4uumxq/a_little_stuck_in_transitioning_to_a_dev_career/,"I currently work in IT security and I'm positively desperate to get out.  I love the idea of it, but in practice the profession is glorified sysadmin but worse because I'm also the guy that has to get in the way of business all the time while having to check audit checkboxes constantly.  I just started in a new position thinking that maybe a change in scenery was what I needed, but I still dread coming in to work every day. Don't get me wrong, I know that the IT security practice is vital, but it's not for me.  For awhile now I've been struggling to figure out what else I could do for a career that I think I would be good at and I keep coming back to development.  I've come to the conclusion that I want to use my tech skills to build things, rather than obstruct people from building their stuff. 

I graduated 2 years ago with a B.S. in Information Science, which at my university was basically a sizable chunk of a CS degree with some Business, psychology and economics thrown in.  I've taken the basic CS classes (Programming Fundamentals, Discrete mathematics, OO programming, data structures) and some of the more advanced ones (Assembly, OS/Network Level programming, database design, Basic Software Security).  As part of my education I used a whole bunch of languages for various projects including Python, C, Java, Javascript, even Lisp and Racket.  Projects ranged from basics like writing a recursive Fibonacci counter in Racket to a functioning implementation of TCP that was tested against various network conditions for accuracy and throughput.  I'm also acknowledged in the errata of a published book (by one of my professors) for helping to build and test initial ideas for teaching programming concepts through basic games.  In my IT security roles since graduating I've used a smattering of python and bash to script stupid little things that I don't want to do anymore, but nothing that resembles real software development.   

I'm simply at a loss on how I can transition into a dev career because I feel kindof stuck in a weird position.  I feel like I have a pretty solid understanding of a lot of programming theory via my university degree and projects, but when I look at even junior level development positions out there, they seem to look for internships and professional experience in development which I don't have so I'm afraid that I won't cut it in the interview process.  I really loved programming in college and I was initially on a CS track, but somehow convinced myself back then that the business portion of the Information Science degree was going to be better for me. Any suggestions on potential paths to transition into a development focused career? Is my experience good enough to apply to dev jobs?

**TLDR**: Stuck in IT, desperate to get out.  I have a good amount of experience programming in college via my university degree (which consists of a good chunk of a CS degree) I obtained 2 years ago, but I have a lack of professional experience and am unsure if my knowledge of programming is good enough to be hired, so I'm looking for suggestions on things I can do to transition.

I am kinda devastated because I see how everyone around me succeeded and I did not. It's not like I was the last one in my class, I finished 2nd in my last year and I passed the baccalaureate with 8 (that was the criteria for the admission).

So, now that I dried my eyes, I'm trying to think about my options.

I can still find some colleges in autumn but only with tax places, but I don't want to go to a random college just for the sake of it.

I could take a gap year, maybe travel a bit, learn new things, read a lot, and this way maybe I can discover what I really like and what I want to do in life. And after that, if I still want to follow an advertising programme in college, I would also have plenty of time to sign up for a college that has an history exam as criteria and study for that, or any other college that has an exam for admission. Plus, I could even have a chance to get a tax-free place.

But the idea with this gap year would make my parents quite sad, not only they're disappointed right now but mom would pretty much go insane if I mention it to her, she thinks I want to give up college at all.

However, I see it like the perfect plan, maybe I could work abroad a few months and this way I could afford a new camera and lenses to progress with my hobby. Or even if I don't work to get paid, maybe I can volunteer or get an internship somewhere in a advertising agency to actually see how it would be to work in that area.

I would pretty much try to do anything not to actually ""stay home"", because I live in a small and boring town and I'm sick of it. I could start learning by myself HTML, or Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop etc., any skills that would prove useful in the future.

So, any words of wisdom ?

4uuxpp,2,2016-07-27,Feeling guilty about not being able to focus much near tail end of solo intern project,t8329f,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4uuxpp/feeling_guilty_about_not_being_able_to_focus_much/,"Hi everyone, I'm winding down a summer internship at a Big 10-ish tech company with just over three weeks left. I've made very strong progress on my summer intern project, and in a lot of ways the functionality and features are ""done"". In my last couple of weeks, I think I'm going to be tasked with coordinating with a few different teams to try to get my project into some pipeline to be released in the future.

However, I feel like I've lost MAJOR daily stamina. I can concentrate on coding a new feature or debugging something for two good hours each morning, but after that I feel like my attention span is shot for the day, and I justify the work I do in a given day and push future work to the next day. 

What's frustrating is that my company/team doesn't have a lot of breaks in the day. Most of my days are wide open with no meetings scheduled. And being alone on the project, it's hard to get a feel of overall team pace on building the project, so as to feel more or less pressure to get a certain amount done each day.

Does anyone have any words of wisdom that can help me relax and/or focus a bit more? I feel considerable guilt for not getting more done each day, but I don't receive strong signals from the team about my progress/pace.


Thanks."

4uuyxs,37,2016-07-27,Just finished an internship with a (sort of) job offer – sharing my experiences,ryuhphino,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4uuyxs/just_finished_an_internship_with_a_sort_of_job/,"Hey all! I’ve relied a good bit on this subreddit and some of the other ones (like learnprogramming) and I wanted to take the opportunity to try and give back by sharing my experiences at my internship and a couple of the ways I handled things in order to be offered a job.

Some backstory real quick: I just finished my time at an internship which spanned over this summer for 10ish weeks. I went in as a weak programmer with a degree (C++ and Python mainly) and made it out with a job offer for when I graduate (I’m finishing my Masters). I didn’t blow people away with my programming, but rather it was how I handled myself people liked. I wanted to share some of my philosophes which helped me learn and grow so much from this internship.

1)	Be Proactive – In this I mean take the initiative for things, even if you don’t know what you’re doing. I found out near my last week that my boss actually really had a good feeling about me before I even made it to the office because when they told me what language I would be working I asked for specific details on things like APIs and such, in order to study up before I got there. It showed initiative to learn and get the job done. I did the same when new jobs came up for testing, trying new things I’ve never done before, which showed them I was willing to work and learn to get a job done. Or even if you know what you’re doing, that is even more the reason to be proactive and offer to take care of it.

2)	Get Out of Your Comfort Zone – This was another big one for me. I knew I was an intern. There was a lot I didn’t know, but it means a lot to a company to constantly show your desire to learn, even if it means working on things you don’t quite understand. Put yourself out there, and try anyways. Showing you’re willing to get out of your comfort zone shows them how you’re willing to learn to help the project out. This kind of goes along with number 1, but it means more to work on things you’ve never done before in order to learn.

3)	 Be Professional – I showed up at 7a.m. in Khakis and a Button up every day and would work out after my 8 hours. People grew a natural respect for me because I would stay to get the job done, and consistently stayed after to work out. I worked well with everyone else on the project and kept everything very professional between fellow employees. There can be drama when working with some people every day but you always have to stay professional about it and keep the job in mind. My boss at the end of it all believed me to be a ‘Team Player’ which contributed a lot to getting an offer.

4)	Programming Wasn’t the Most Important Thing – This is going to sound crazy considering programming is your JOB, but you also have to keep in mind if you work on a project with all different people, all of which are new to you at an internship so, honestly, programming becomes one of the least important things at times. Your ability to work with others, communicate properly, and ability to learn on the spot are all going to end up playing a higher role. It won’t help you be the best programmer around if you can’t properly communicate with your fellow employees.

I know this advice won’t work for everyone, but it worked very well for me, and I think can for others.  A lot of this seems pretty straight forward but when dealing with the stress of a new job sometimes it can be forgotten. I know I had plenty of off days. You just have to remember to keep the job in mind and be willing to put yourself out there. They know you aren’t a junior engineer or anything, so the goal is to learn. The test, in my opinion, is how quickly, and willing, you are to learn new skills and to learn the agile development process.

I hope this helps some, as I actually still am not a strong programmer. I was able to learn from what they had and use that to work my way up, and I definitely am better today than I was when I started, but I have a long way to go. If I can do it, I believe that everyone else can too if you have the right attitude!

Tl;dr: Some skills which helped me get a job offer after an internship were My Work Ethic, Professionalism, and my focus on the job itself, not my focus on the programming.

4uv26r,183,2016-07-27,How TF2 helped me achieve my dream of getting a job in Silicon Valley (xpost /r/tf2),LoopsCode,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/4uv26r/how_tf2_helped_me_achieve_my_dream_of_getting_a/,"This is a story on how TF2 got me a job in Silicon Valley, the place of my dreams to begin my career as a fresh new computer engineering grad. 

_________

This story started two years ago, when I was invited to sub as a Soldier in a UGC Silver Highlander team from a friend, his name Borat, I met in TF2Center. We played a few games while we chatted in Mumble, and in the first few games, we clicked pretty well. A few days later, this friend asked if I was interested in joining their team full-time as their main soldier for the upcoming season. I first hesitated, but eventually agreed because I thought the dudes were all very swell. 

Fast forward a few months, we were deep into the weekly games. Our team didn't have the best DM, or the best players, or even the best strats, but gosh darn, we had team work and good vibes. The group of guys were just great people that encouraged each other when things went south, and in general, made the sometimes-toxic UGC environment tolerable, and even fun!

Speaking of toxicity, this is how the story *really* started. 

As you all know, some teams would bring in unregistered ringers (often times higher skill divisions than what the current team is), imposters with the same name and display picture (played by a higher level player), or sometimes, the team leader just doesn't know it's against the rules. Prior to a match, there isn't much time to actually check one-by-one whether the player on the team is really who they say they are, or whether they're in the official roster. My team leader, let's call him Messiah, knew that I was a software developer. He is also one. He expressed to me his frustration, and it clicked to me that maybe I should try to take a stab at solving this problem.

A few weeks later, the UGC Roster Verification tool (now offline) was born. Initially, only the players in the team used it. After awhile, I started sharing it on /r/tf2, /r/truetf2, the UGC forums, TF2Center forums, and more, and it kinda blew up. I recall over 1000 unique players used it, and for a kid like me, that was pretty insane. Hearing people's thoughts on the tool prompted me to learn to gather user feedback, test for bugs, and ultimately implement new features to it. This was a great feeling, and it really trained me to become a better software and product developer.

Fast forward a few more months, the team sort of disbanded because we all had real life responsibilities to attend to (although no worries, we all shoot the shit on our Slack channel on a daily basis). I was talking to Messiah how I was graduating soon in June 2016, and whether he has any tips for me for job search.

Little did I know, Messiah, who I absolutely admire because he is *also* the main dev of a Steam based website, works in a company in Silicon Valley. I was absolutely flabbergasted. Recall, I've known him for around a year and a half by now, and this is the first time I knew about this. He keeps it very low key, a hint to his character. He asked me if I was interested in his company, which is conveniently located in the center of Silicon Valley. 

Am I interested? *Am I??* My life long dream has been to work in Silicon Valley. I think interested was an understatement. I was more like - ***fuck yes I am***! 

I honestly tried to apply for internships in this area all five years of my college career, with no luck each time. Being able to begin my career in the Valley would actually fulfill a long-time dream of mine.

Messiah put in a good word for me to the CEO of the company knowing what I did with the UGC Roster Verifier tool (and our fun technical discussions on coding and tech in Slack/Mumble), and I scheduled my first call with them. 

One call led to another technical call. Then a third culture call. Then finally, I was invited to their office in the Valley for a full day of on-site interviews. I flew over from the East coast; everything was paid for. Was I nervous? Goddamn I was. At this point, I was rejected by a few companies already, and morale was at a new low. 

I arrived at their office a few weeks later in beautiful California. I went through the rounds of interviews starting at 9 AM. After the seven and a half hours of interviews, of testing me everything from algorithms, data structures, building simple apps, asking me questions about design/UX/UI, career motivations, culture fit questions, and more, it was over. I was emotionally/physically/mentally exhausted, but I felt good. I even got to meet Messiah in person for the first time in two years, and he gave me a TF2 shirt. Even after meeting him in person, I still can't put a face to his voice from Mumble. It's just too unreal.

After I flew home, I went through one more phone technical interview with them, just to get more data. Considering they are a data analytics company, that made a lot of sense. 

So after around 11+ combined hours of interviews, one day, my now-boss called me to extend me an offer. It was my first offer, from a company of my dreams, and after all those rejections! I don't think happiness described it. After literally nine months of rejections after rejections, of reviewing those excruciating data structures and algorithms questions (which takes time away from me from developing great applications), of waking up knowing I *still* don't have a job while friends around me were getting offers - it was finally over. It actually took me three days to fully process the mental load that it's over. 

I achieved my dream, but I didn't do it alone. Playing TF2 actually helped me achieve my dream. Thank you Messiah, Borat, and the rest of the team for being such good people. I honestly can say I couldn't have done it without them! 

____________

So this is my story of how TF2 helped me achieved my dream of getting a job in Silicon Valley. 

The lesson I learned is - just be a good person. Be a good person even under the veil of anonymity. You don't know when it will bite you in the butt, or when it will literally help you achieve your dreams. Just do it!

I've managed to create a system that works but it has the unwanted side-effect, depending on how I do it, of either 

a) Creating a limited range of cells so that the formula needs to be changed whenever sectors are added
b) Leaving blank spaces that need to be scrolled up through to reach the top due to the infinite blank spaces below

I was wondering whether it was possible to create a dynamic range which includes illegal characters in the dependent list, this is what I've currently got for the Data validation box but it doesn't work :(

I am a recent graduate, I received my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering from a well known University in Canada. The university offers a co-op/internship program and despite my major, most of my co-ops were software related and less on the electrical engineering side of things. 

I realized that I want to be in a software development position a bit late (in 4th year) and am not sure if my degree or my experience or skill are holding me back. I have been applying for the last 2.5 months, I know I should've started sooner while I was in my last semester and that is a mistake I will just have to live with unfortunately. I have applied to over 200 positions, been contacted for interviews by 2 big companies and around 6-7 others. I messed up on the technical interviews, but I have been studying (CTCI, Leetcode, DSA, etc.) and I know I am getting better with every interview.

Most of my internships were lacklustre and I have maybe 2 out of 5 internships where I really learned so I removed the others from my resume.

Now I am wondering why I do not get interviews from most of the places that I apply to, maybe it is a resume issue so I am attaching links to 2 of the resumes that I have made:

This is the one I have been using so far, my main resume: 

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/88911532/csq1.pdf

This is the new one I just made which shows all my work experience:

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/88911532/csq2.pdf

Company 1 and company 4 were horrible waste experiences that I have nothing to say about if they ever come up in an interview so I removed those from my main resume. 

I am wondering should I keep all my experience on my resume? Is that better? 

Also, I have made 2 games in Unity (nothing major I know) but game development is my end goal. I want to end up in that industry, possibly as a gameplay programmer or tools.

Sorry if this post sounds like I am rambling, I am just wondering what I need to do to get there. A lot of the jobs I see say ""Degree in Computer Science or related field"" and am wondering if having a degree in EE is seen as a negative?

A position as a junior software developer or associate (regardless if its gamedev or anything else) is what I feel would be ideal, I really want to break into this industry but maybe I am going at it wrong and that is why I am posting here.

Thank you very much!

(Also if anyone recognizes my resume or realizes who I am, please do not expose)

Edit: Also I should add that I have no issues with location, as long as the position offers enough to get by where it is located. I have been applying all over Canada and the States, I haven't limited myself much with regards to location I feel"

The schools here are okay, nothing special compared to the schools in NC, California, TX, etc. but not particularly awful either. 

I recently visited USC and found the John E. Swearingen building to feel really depressing on the inside, however I am aware that an IBM-funded Innovation Center is being built where many CS, EE, and CompE classes will be moved to. As far as Clemson is concerned, all I know is that they have a strong overall engineering program, however I'm not sure how well this translates into the quality of CS program. Similarly, I don't know very much about CofC either except knowing that they have a data science major and there being a startup culture in Charleston, which seems interesting.

Anyway, this is all I know about CS in my state. I do plan on applying OOS to top colleges, however staying in-state is still an option due to the scholarship programs here. Between USC, Clemson, and CofC, which school is best in terms of internships, job outlook at top companies/CS firms, and overall CS education?

M and I have been dating for close to 7 months now. We love each other and I can honestly say I'm never happier than when I'm spending time with her. She's expressed the same thing to me. After I finish college this upcoming year and start working full time the summer after, we have hopeful plans to get an apartment and move in together.

Along the course of our relationship, I've seen hints of her wanting a long term commitment. Some examples being a joke on TV about couples getting married and having her look at me and smile right after, saying things like ""that's so pretty I'd love to have that at my wedding"", having her ask questions like ""when we get older, can we do this?"" and just the idea of us getting a place together in general made me think that she has no problem getting closer to the next level with us. And to he clear I'm not disagreeing with these plans, I can see myself going the distance with M and it seemed like she wanted the same with me.

Last night we hung out with a couple of her girlfriends when the topic of marriage started a conversation. Everyone had different viewpoints on the subject, and then M put in her two cents. She says that she likes weddings, but couldn't really see herself having one. M also mentioned that she couldn't imagine being committed to one person for the rest of her life. Right in front of me. Her friends even looked at me when she said that seeing how I would react. I didn't make a scene out of it, and I wasn't confrontational about it afterwards because she had a big interview the morning after for an internship and I didn't want to mess with her head. But should I be confrontational? It seems like I'm hearing two opinions from her of what she wants out of his relationship and I just want to know her end goal with us. Or should I just slow down and chill out because I'm only at month 7 of this relationship? Any advice would be appreciated.

4uvgsc,2,2016-07-27,Engineer Major Getting Contacted About Financial And Insurance Positions???,UnemployedAtype,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4uvgsc/engineer_major_getting_contacted_about_financial/,"Hey r/jobs, 

I am a B.S. and M.S. engineering graduate. I had very good GPA, significant research and engineering experience (internships, consulting, various other projects), academic achievements and awards, and even a patent.

&amp;nbsp;

Since my job search hasn't been going so well, I've been building profiles on various job and career sites.

&amp;nbsp;

However, I have been receiving many solicitations for Insurance or Financial positions. 

&amp;nbsp;

I've looked up these positions and they look like bottom-of-the-barrel deals. However, I'm perplexed by the fact that they are contacting a candidate clearly geared towards engineering-science positions.

&amp;nbsp;

Other than the fact that I was (and am) a high performer across the board, does anyone know why this might be?"

But if I ever wanted to intern or work in a lab, I'd need some sort of useful skill set I can say that I have (as of now I have no previous work experience).  


So what languages do any of y'all suggest I should learn/be fluent in?"
4uvrma,1,2016-07-27,Is there any way I can finish college without being murdered by debt?,pooramericanboy,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4uvrma/is_there_any_way_i_can_finish_college_without/,"So I'm currently going into my junior year at the University of Minnesota, however,  I'm already worried about the potentially crippling debt that I will have to face in a few years.  I'm going into industrial and systems engineering which helps,  but I'd really appreciate if you guys could give me some advice on where I should go from here.  

Here are my loans so far:

Subsidized fed: $6,000

Unsubsidized fed: $3,000

Private loan (Wells Fargo): $18,000 

My parents helped pay for my first year,  but that was it.  So far I've accumulated ~$27,000 in debt in these two years.  I expect the next two to add another $40-50,000 in debt.  I currently have a year round technical internship which pulls in about 11k before taxes.  As far as costs of attendance go,  the biggest factors are tuition and rent.  Tuition costs about 12k/year and apartment rent in the area will cost be ~8.5k/year. I receive very little financial Aid (about $800/year from the school) since my parents are married,  I'm their only child in school atm,  and they make enough money to not be in a lower class, etc.  Do you guys have any advice on how I can lessen the impact that this will have on my future? Im not sure if I gave enough information,  so let me know if there are any other numbers or factors you need to know.  Thank you!"
4uvulj,3,2016-07-27,"Help, I have an awful roommate",raineverceases,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4uvulj/help_i_have_an_awful_roommate/,"Hi guys, I'm in need of some advice and maybe some assurance that I wasn't the one completely at fault in this situation. It's been a terrible time and has been weighing heavily on my mind for awhile now. Please bear with me because it's an incredibly long story.

Last year I moved in with another girl that we knew through church friends for my studies as a graduate student. Things seemed normal at first, it was a nice apartment, and she was kind enough to tell me that I didn't need to buy any cooking ware and I could share hers. 

What was odd was on the first night of my arrival, she decided to leave to be with her boyfriend and leave me completely alone. She had dodged my requests to be added to her facebook, so I simply assumed that she wasn't expecting a friendship. I think some of you have a similar issue where if someone seems to refuse the first few gestures of friendship, you just shut that relationship down. I did the same, I just stopped trying to see if we could be friends.

It was originally a one bedroom apartment, but we had hired contractors to build a two year temporary wall to separate the front room into my room. My nMom insisted that I ask for her to pay for half of it. She said it wasn't possible. Then, when I moved my things in, I left immediately to go to Canada, also something my nMom wanted to do, but she also wanted me to ask her if I didn't have to pay for that time we spent in Canada, since we had moved my stuff halfway through the month and was gone for the rest of it. I felt uncomfortable with this request and thought it not possible, but nMom insisted and of course, my roommate responded that that was also not possible.   

She was barely ever at home, maybe one day on the weekend, one day on the weekday. I had mentioned in my initial email to her that I had a boyfriend, and he likes to come over frequently, so she should tell me if she isn't comfortable with that. I also asked her essentially every time he came over for the first months if it was okay for him to be there. She always responded with a smile and told me it was totally cool. 

After coming back from winter break though, I was given a long email from her, purportedly requests from her mother. She started it by trying to reassure me that I have been a good roommate so I don't have to worry, these were just reminders. Some of it included throwing out expired food, which I felt embarrassed about because I had been gone for a month and didn't think to throw things out that would have expired before hand. It also irritated me because she had plenty of expired drinks, yogurt, and other things sitting in the fridge. When we had arrived, my own nMom was disgusted by the bowl of moldy rice that had been just sitting there for days. 

After that initial message, she became more and more critical of what I did, complaining about everything I did in the kitchen, which included leaving dirty dishes from the previous night to wash in the morning. I felt terrible, but I was also going to an internship in the mornings and working until I went to classes that ended late at night. I wasn't always on top of it, but after she complained I made sure things were clean. 

At the beginning of June of this year, after being gone for nearly three weeks on a vacation she didn't tell me about (no matter, she was always gone), she told me she was planning on moving with her boyfriend and I had until August. I instantly felt panic. I went through hundreds of listings online, dozens of showings, all in a span of a few days. I didn't sleep, I couldn't sleep because of how worried I was. But I managed to snag an apartment within a few days of looking. It just so happened an apartment very close to campus had opened up, and I took the opportunity quickly. 

I informed her of the good news and she told me I should probably let the apartment supervisor know I was moving things. That's when I discovered there was a 500 dollar move out fee. I was shocked, and my parents told me I had to find a way around it. More work and stress for me. I had become friends with the doorman of the building and he told me it was unfair for me as the tenant to pay, and I should ask my landlord (my roommate's uncle) to pay. No way in hell that was possible, so the doorman planned to help me sneak out. 

Over the course of a few days the doorman started revealing information about her to me. He kept insisting how unfair it was for me to leave since I was the one that actually lived there. He also thought that I would be the first to stay, because there had actually been a long list of other girls that had lived at her apartment for the same amount of time before they inexplicably left too. I wasn't all too shocked. I felt something was off already, but that was just confirmation that this was something she routinely did. 

I told him that maybe this time it was different, because she said she was moving out and her uncle was selling the place. No such thing, the doorman said. A top realtor was already struggling to sell an apartment in the building and she had never heard of my apartment being on the market. 

Fast forward, I've moved to my new place and felt finally at peace. The doorman contacts me and tells me that he met a girl that had come in to meet my roommate, she was LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO STAY. He asked her if she was planning on long term, AND YES, SHE WAS. Confirmation she had been lying to me. He told me not to feel bad and listed off the names of all the other girls listed on the apartment that had already left, he guessed that this was just what she did. 

So I didn't take it to heart, left it at that, didn't even tell my parents the news. And then yesterday my dad calls me frantically telling me my roommate's mother had sent him a long email, complaining about how terrible of a roommate was. 

I had an anxiety attack. I couldn't believe that my roommate would do something this low. I didn't understand it. My dad said that her mother wrote about how I burned my roommate's pans and her oven mitt, how my boyfriend was constantly over, how unsafe she felt with him, how she had stopped cooking for months because of how unhygienic I was. I couldn't believe it because she was never in the apartment, from the very start, it wasn't uncommon for her to be gone for days on end, yet her mother insists that her daughter ""suffered in silence."" 

She also mentioned the fees ""I"" tried to waive (on behalf of nMom), trying to make it seem like I was trying to cheat them out of money and pocket my parent's money (my parents are paying for my rent right until the end of my schooling). She snidely said that that amount of money was probably nothing in comparison to the person I hired to find my place, because it was impossible for me to find a place within three days on my own.

I was completely unaware and felt terrible about the damaged cooking ware. I told my dad I was willing to repay my roommate and buy her all new almost exact or close to cooking ware that I had damaged (a slightly burnt oven mitt, blackened by her mother's words, a pan that was burnt on the back, a scratched pot, and an ""improperly"" cleaned baking tray). I begged him not to tell nMom because I didn't know how she would react to everything. 

My dad agreed and said that he didn't think it was a good idea to bring her into this. I responded to my roommate's email, expressing over and over how sorry I was and that I was willing to buy her all new kitchen items. Her mother hasn't responded. What I'm scared of is that I have no idea how she got a hold of my dad's email. I'm living in constant terror that my email would be insufficient and she will try to find a way to contact my nMom. 

Guys I don't know what to do. I'm sorry this has been so long. It's been a year in the making. I feel terrible and I can't sleep. Thanks for listening to me."

Wednesdays are half days for me. I don’t have to go in until one in the afternoon, and I get to leave normal time, six at night - a.k.a. prime drinking hour to my friends. So, since some were still in the area, and we were all still close friends, we had planned a drinking night. I could get as drunk as I wanted and not have to worry about the hangover tomorrow (Thursday’s are one of my two days off). Drinking and drinking excessively with friends was exactly what I needed after ten days of utter bullshit. 

My alarm woke me up promptly at five-thirty. I pressed off but then Scotty jumped on me with his leash. Coerced into exercise by adorableness, I was thankful the town park was a short walk away so that I didn’t have to drive anywhere when rush hour was just about to start. An hour later, when we got back, Niex was in the kitchen, the smell of coffee permeating the air and making me perk up. Scotty bounded past me to his water bowl once I released him and I meandered over to the other side of kitchen. Instead of the usual jeans and button down that Niex would wear, he was in what looked like to be a fully tailored suit. I felt under dressed in my pink running shorts and college sweatshirt. 

“Where were you this morning?” He asked, watching as the coffee maker finished up. He poured himself a cup and tried it black.  

“Scotty wanted to go for a walk, so I took him,” I said, pulling out the sugar and a mug for myself. Niex immediately dumped about five spoonfuls into his coffee. “Where’d you get the suit?”

“I know a guy,” he answered. 

My eyes involuntarily rolled. *Cryptics. Joy.*

“You’ve spent ten days on earth, only five of which you spent actually outside of this house. How could you have possibly found a tailor already?” 

“You think I spend the past seven years in prison doing nothing?”

*Yes*. “I dunno.”

Niex looked insulted. “I’m a businessman. While I may have been unable to attend meetings, I was still able to delegate my representative. How do you think I got that phone so fast?”

“I just figured you stole it.” 

“No. And even if I hadn’t been working while in prison, I’d been doing business on Earth for years before my imprisonment.”

“Why Earth? I thought you hated humans.”

“I find that your kind is too easily influenced by the range of emotions you have. It makes you weak.”

*Says the guy who bought a dog on whim.* “Mm. I see.”

“But that also makes you a good market. Plus, if that ship hadn’t broken down, they’d never suspect me of being on Earth.”

I glared at the cream in my coffee. “So why the suit?”

“I have a meeting with some business associates. Breakfast.”

“Ah.”

“Which brings up the question - why are you not at work? Normally you’d be rushing out the door at 6.”

“I don’t have to go in until noon today,” I answered, turning on the television and sitting down with my coffee. Scotty rested on the floor next to me. 

Niex glanced briefly at the morning news show before he grabbed his car keys and left without so much as a goodbye. 

Once his car was down the street, I was bored of the news. I changed the input on the television to my x-box and opened up Netflix. *The Walking Dead* had been neglected by me for too long. 

When Niex returned two hours later, I was sobbing to the credits and had to stop the next episode from playing. 

“What’s wrong with your face?” Niex asked, blocking my view of the screen.

“I’m an emotional trainwreck,” I answered. *And a sympathetic crier and a sucker for family values.*

“So your eyes leak?”

“I’m crying, asshole.”

“Well stop it.”

“Easier said than done.” I wiped my face and stood. Niex glanced at the screen, the titles of available shows and movies up now that I had exited the show. “You can watch something if you’d like.”

Scotty growled protectively over the couch. I flicked him on the nose to get him to stop.

Niex glared, “I’m busy.” He stormed off up the stairs.

Kristoph Caper had invaded my workspace, a woman dangling off his arm as they strolled right past the cowed intern. 

“And this is where we keep all the artifacts and information not currently being displayed anywhere,” he said, turning to show off the massive filing cabinet that was the basement. I looked at the woman. She wore a butt length dress that lacked a distinguishable neckline, a designer purse, three inch heels, gold hoop earrings that were pulling her lobes down, and an excessive amount of rings . I tried not to judge, I swear. 

“Get out, Kristoph,” I snapped, slamming the drawer of the cabinet I was at shut. “I’m still cleaning up from the last one you brought down here.”

Kristoph smiled, “Charming as ever, Calla.”

I glared, clipboard in hand. “I’m serious. You’ve got to stop showing this room to…” I debated on outright insulting the woman or not, “Your totems.”

She looked hurt. I instantly felt guilty.

“Fine, fine,” Kristoph waved it off. I knew nothing would change. “More interesting things upstairs anyway.”

The pair exited the room and I made a face - some mix of disgust and relief. The intern gave me a look. 

“Is it a human custom to always have a new partner every week or is that only for Mister Caper?”

“Kristoph Caper is the absolute worst womanizer alive. He has a new partner any time he wants one, which is usually every other day,” I answered. Then gave them a pleading look. “For the love of all that is good in this world, do not base your expectations of humans off of that man and anyone who he keeps in his company.”

The intern nodded, and scratched some notes down. I looked at my clipboard and moved onto the Maori section of the room.

I’d been duped. This wasn’t a get together and go bar crawling with the girls night. This was a last minute attempt at a mixer to try and pair up all the single friends. I glared at the couple who had tricked us all into coming, stormed over to the bar and ordered a piña colada. Some of my more sociable friends immediately jumped on the opportunity and drinks were being bought for pairs. 

I may have been too harsh, but meeting new people was never my strong point, and flirting has always gone right over my head. In other words - I don’t really *do* parties. I tend to stand in a corner and admire the wall paper once my only friend has abandoned me to the hoards. 

“You get tricked too?” A friendly voice asked. To my right was a guy that looked about my age, average looking, with rimless glasses covering his hazel eyes. 

“Yeah,” I answered, wiping the condensation off of my glass. “I was really looking forward to a girls night out.”

He huffed out a laugh. “I feel that.”

“You’re not going to try and talk to me all night, are you? ‘Cause I kind of came here to drink.”

“So was I. Just figured there’d be no harm in sitting next to you while I drink.”

“It’s a free country.”

“So it is.”

*…*

“My name’s Calla, by the way.”

“George.” We shook hands. I looked anywhere but at him. 

A Blue Moon was placed in front of him. “What happened to not talking?”

I grinned and sipped my drink. “I’m not really good with silence.”

George laughed. 

Another piña colada and a Strongbow and a half later, I was laughing my ass off at almost every joke being tossed my way and unable to sit without leaning on the counter. I think at least an hour had passed at that point, but the clock was fuzzy because of the distance so I gave up, not wanting to even look at my phone. The bar’s noise level had been steadily increasing, as people talked and music was turned up, and the mood lighting had been set. 

“You seem to be drinking a lot,” George noted. He’d only just started on his second Blue Moon. 

“I’m stressed,” I said, blowing hair out of my face and smiling sloppily. I’m a lightweight and not ashamed. 

“About?”

“Eeeeeeverything.” My head shook a little with the answer and I got a little dizzy. “My boss is a womanizing dick and my new housemate is a fucking ass.”

“Where do you work?”

“The MHH.”

“Oh, nice museum. I’ve heard Caper’s a bit difficult to work with.”

I rolled my eyes and stuck out my tongue. “That’s an understatement.” My hand waved for the bartender, “Rum and coke please.”

My future most definitely included a bright white porcelain. 

“What makes you say that?”

“I want ‘nother drink?” 

He laughed over his drink. “No, as to why working with Caper is a pain.”

“Ooh. Because he’s annoying, always brings unauthorized people down into the archives, has absolutely no self control, and loves money and himself.”

“Pay must be good though.”

“It’s fucking amazing. Best library job. Ever.” I stared at him, the cool of the counter nice against my face. “What ‘bout you? What’d’you do?”

“I work with the embassy.”

“Which?”

“The planetary one.”

“Fun. Must meet lots of interesting characters.” I went to drink again but was met with only ice-cubes. “‘Nother one please.”
“It’s okay, I don’t really do much though.”

“Trust me, anything sounds fun when you organize shit for a living.”

He laughed again. My other drink arrived. Everyone else in the group of our friends had started challenging each other to karaoke dules and all around having a good time. 

“So, what exactly d’you do?” I pressed, trying to not down my drink whole again. 

“I’m part of the research division. We basically collect data and information for the ambassador and keep records of all visiting aliens and travelling humans. It’s mostly so that we can keep track of everyone in case someone, God forbid, gets in trouble. It’s not perfect, since people can still move around once they’re outside of our jurisdiction, but it at least gives us the reason they came and where they headed to first.”

“So, you guys must be exploding with this escaped convict escapade huh?”

“We’re mostly just glad we’re not getting shit for it, since it wasn’t our prison or jurisdiction . But the other part of my job is to research any aliens for the ambassador if one of their own ambassadors is visiting, or if we never heard of them before.”

“Like the Aestians? Where do you even find this information?”

“The federation has a database of all known species. Aestians were a pain in the ass to find though. They’re as old as the Sorainias, so not much is really known.”

I must’ve given a look of confusion, ‘cause George explained. “Sorainians are one of the oldest species in the federation - they actually started it. Anyway, because the Aestians are basically an entire race of Mystiques, what records we do have of them is completely useless. All we really know for certain is that because they can shapeshift, they’ve basically become the intergalactic monopoly race for espionage and sabotage. It’s an unproven fact that they’re have played a hand in all immediate causes for all interplanetary slash interspecies wars. Some of the scholars say that they do it because they enjoy creating chaos, the money is just an added bonus.”

*Sounds like Niex.* I thought. I looked down at my rum and coke and noticed it was gone. “So then how do they know this guy’s forms?”

“Some law that was basically forced on them to release their records for the registered forms of each Aestian that traveled off planet. So I’m guessing that when they caught him, they got this and had him shift into each one for the different mug shots.” George shrugged and sipped his beer. “They’re a pain in the ass to work with, to be honest.”

“Are they not helping?” I asked. *If they’re all like Niex than I can see the entire planet collective making things difficult just to cause a little distress.*

“Just barely. I think they want to catch him as much as everyone else, but it seems to be for different reasons. They never share anything, and they act like they’re either neurotic about the whole situation or perfectly fine with him having escaped.”

I choked back a laugh and stood up to go to the bathroom. Everything was unclear and I was dizzy as all hell, but I tried to maintain my balance and not make a fool of myself. When I got back, there was another rum and coke waiting for me. George watched as I sat down, his third beer finally opened, and made sure I didn’t fall over. 

“So, your housemate?” George asked, sipping his beer. 

“Ugh. Don’t even get me started. He’s a fucking complete soulless bastard.”

“Hellspawn?”

“The absolute worst kind. He’s always mocking me, ‘s bull headed, incompetent, impulsive, obnoxious, full of ‘imself, in you face, childish,” I was listing off with my fingers, pushing away from the bar. “He’s the kind of guy who just barges into your life with no warning and expects you to bed light and your life around him to suit his needs. It’s just so fucking annoying!”

The liquor on the shelf went past as I fell back. I expected to hit my head on cold floor, scrape my knees against the bar even. Did not expect to be stopped by a wall of finely made cloth. 

I blinked up, intending to apologize to whoever I had just accidentally disturbed. Grey eyes smirked down. “What about me?”

I scrambled away and pressed my back into the bar. Niex looked about to laugh so I glared. “What’re you doin’ ‘ere?”

“Is this the guy?” George asked me in a whisper. I only nodded. 

A man came from the back room before Niex could answer me. His face was flushed from drinking and even I hadn’t run into a table. I don’t think. “Mister Vicariot! It’s such an honor to finally be able to - hiccup.”

Niex glared at the man but the intoxicated idiot didn’t notice. He only approached further, extending his hand. I saw Niex’s hand twitch, but instead of punching the man (like I expected), he firmly grasped it.

“The pleasure is mine, Mister Pinsotti. Please, call me Jonathan.” Niex smiled as the man insisted on being called Louis then. I shivered at the sight. “I’ll join you in a moment. Simply finishing up a conversation with this lovely young lady.”

The man looked at me, smiled, and clasped Niex on the shoulder. “Ah yes, of course, of course. I understand completely. Come to the back when you’ve sorted things out, yes?”

I gagged at the implications, reached for my drink and downed it to burn out the vomit taste in my mouth. Niex  continued to smile. George had turned around to try and avoid getting involved, nursing his beer and making himself smaller. Once the man had disappeared back into the back room, Niex forced himself between George and I, flagging down the bartender. 

“Yes?”

“Anything this one,” he pointed at me, “has had and will have you can put on a tab for me. I’ll get the receipt when I come to collect her.”

“Hey!” I snapped indignantly. “I can pay for myself. I’m not as broke as you seem to think I am! And what makes you think that I’d be -”

“You’re too drunk to even walk to the subway properly,” he interrupted. “I don’t believe you’ll stop drinking anytime soon, it’s half past eight and no amount of time on the train is going to make it safe for you to drive back from the train station. I drove down here, I’ll take you.”

“She could always stay at my place,” George offered up as an out. “I don’t live too far away.”

Niex paused in his thought process, turned around and looked at George. He glanced down and then back up, sizing up my companion. “What unfortunate circumstances caused you to exist?”

Even the bartender flinched. 

“God! Why are you so mean!” I shouted. Some other patrons looked away. “It’s like you never got punished for anything so you think you can do anything! What god gave you the all powerful right to be an asshole?!”

Paper was shoved in my mouth. I spat it out and promised myself to smother the bastard in his sleep. 

“Shut up, would you Calla?” Niex had another drink brought to me. He turned towards George. “If I come back out of that room and find the two of you have run away, I’ll hunt you down and gut you. I’ve heard that long pig sells wonderfully on the galactic meat market.”

George’s pale face reflected my own as Niex left us. “See what I mean.”

“No wonder  you needed a fucking drink. Does he act like that all the time?”

“The threats are always present, but the bossy attitude is on point.”

George raised his eyebrows in agreement. I downed the new drink and then glared at it. If he was going to pay for me then I might as well make his bill as high as I could. Bastard deserves it. Smiling broadly, I asked for the most expensive liquor the bar had. The bartender asked if I was sure,and then placed a shot of a deep blue drink in front of me. The air around it was sort of fruity, which made me think that it couldn’t be that bad. 

“Take this, you bastard,” I toasted. 

George gave me a worried look. “Do you know what that is?”

“No, but it smells good.”

“It’s called Demon’s blood. It’s basically Belphanegm moonshine.”

“Aaand?”

“Belphagora isn’t exactly known for its serenity and diplomacy with other planets.”

“So? They wouldn’t be serving it if it was dangerous.” There was definitely a flaw to my logic, but George saw me as a lost cause. 

George sighed. “It’s a free country.”

I grinned and downed the shot. 

*Holy shit fruit.* It was like pouring berry honey down my throat. There was barely a burn and it tasted amazing. I had another one immediately. George watched uneasily as I downed it quickly. I waited a bit to ask for another, savoring the other two. When I did go to ask for another, I stopped halfway. Everything started mixing together and I couldn’t tell one face from another. The lights, even though they were at half power, got brighter and the noise became muted.

“Calla you okay?” George asked. His face looked more like something out of a cartoon.

“Even the alien patrons tend to shy away from that one.” The bartender, I think. It was really hard to distinguish anything from everything else. A bird flew past my face and I turned to follow it. Out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw my mom and tried to hide my face. Looking down at the floor, it was more like grass and I wondered, briefly how the hell they managed that. I giggled and rested my head against the bar again, and closed my eyes to savor the coolness. 

“Calla-”

“Mm. Shh.”

“Calla, you need to wake up.” A hand shook me. 

“No. I dun wanna.” 

*His* voice was the next to try. “If you don’t wake up in ten seconds I’ll leave your body exposed in a ditch. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six.”

I groaned and managed to pull myself up. 

“Oh good, you’re awake,” Niex snapped, looking at his wristwatch.

“I didn’t-” I looked around. I was still in the bar. Still drunk as all hell with George still watching over me.

“Devil’s blood affects everyone differently. You seemed to have a milder reaction to it than some of the others I’ve seen,” Niex explained, picking up my untouched shot glass and downing it in one go. He paid the bartender with cash.  

“How’d you know-?” George began to ask, but Niex had already started a habit of cutting him off. 

“I’ve spent the past ten years doing business in space. With the joining of Earth to the Intergalactic Federation, a whole new market opened up to me. I had the pleasure of spending a year on Belphagora while trying to establish a branch out there. They drink this stuff like it’s nectar from the gods.”

*Lies. So good at lying.* I thought.

“Well, now that I’ve-” I wobbled when I stood, my body not prepared to take it’s own weight. To my utter annoyance, Niex caught me, throwing one of my arms over his shoulder.

“Yes, yes. Let’s get you out of here.” He supported me out into the side of the road and shoved me into the passenger side of the camaro. The engine roared and then we were navigating the New York City roads, trying to make our way onto the Major Deegan Expressway. I avoided talking, watching the lights and buildings meld together as we drove by. The expressway was mostly empty, being about ten when we finally got to it. Nothing other than the usual construction delays really got in the way of us making our way back north. The silence was nice.

“Do humans always drink excessively?” Niex ruined it. 

“What, you never drink because you don’t want to deal with your problems?” I asked, turning in my seat. 

“I drink. Not with the vigor that you had tonight though.”

I scoffed, a smirk showing through. “I find that hard to believe.”

“Why’s that?”

“Pirate.”

Niex glared. “Piracy is more than just what you humans have concocted as the iconic drunken rapscallion.”

“Oh really? I wouldn’t know since I’m not a pirate!”

He sighed. “You’re too intoxicated for anything to pass through -”

“And while we’re on the subject, just how the hell do you have business connections after only ten days on Earth?”

“I explained-”

“I mean really! That’s just impossible! Even if you are some suave crime lord who could probably overthrow the devil and start eating souls, you just shouldn’t have connections that are fawning over you already! No matter if you were working while in prison, most people want to meet the person they’re working with, it’s just a good policy. You can’t trust someone who you’ve never met before! And furthermore-”

“Would you shut up! For the love of Signan, woman, you’re too chatty when you drink!”

I slumped in my seat and Niex slowed down. I hadn’t noticed that he had sped up in his agitation. The exit for the Taconic was coming up on our right. 

“I already told you that I’d been doing business on Earth prior to being incarcerated. Jonathan Vicariot is my human alias, and my second in command has been setting up the background and framework for him. He’s had open accounts and solid  business on Earth for a good fifteen years. As far as records go, he’s clean because all my… Other business is done through alternate means. All the business people I’ve been meeting with on Earth haven’t seen him, first because of health reasons and then again because we had him travelling space to do business. Your friend at the bar can even look for a Visa for him and it’ll be there.”

“Then why would such a successful businessman be renting out an attic in a suburban home?”

“Does a wealthy person really need to explain why they do anything? I could simply wrire it off as needing fresh air for my health.”

My stomach gurgled. “You’re going to need some fresh air if you don’t pull over right now.”

“What?”

“I’m gonna puke.”

“You better fucking not. Not in this car. These seats are fucking leather.” He pulled over hastily. 

*Just like him to be more worried about his car than my health.*  I thought, pushing the door open and emptying out the contents of my stomach. After a minute, I spat out the rest to try and remove the taste. 

“Are you done yet?” He asked. I nodded, closed the door, and rested as he drove back home. 

---

After a shower, I fell onto my bed and pulled out my phone. It had died during the night, so I plugged it in and watched as it exploded with messages. There was at least twenty from my best friend, and a missed phone call from her. And then another from a number I didn’t recognize. 

*Hey, it’s George. You probably don’t remember giving me your number. Just wanted to make sure you got home alright.*

I flipped onto my back and typed out a quick reply. *Yeah. Thanks for making sure I didn’t get kidnapped.*

*Haha. No problem.*

I paused and went to the other twenty something messages.

*Calla, who is that?*

*Calla, Calla.*

*Seriously, answer the phone*

*Is your phone dead?*

*Who is that man?*

*You just left the bar with him?!*

*How could you not introduce me to your potential kidnapper/rapist?*

*If I wake up to news of your dead body in the Hudson, I’m going to tell your grave I told you so every day*

*Calla. At least you had an attractive killer.*

*You could say, he kill you with his look ;D*

I groaned. *Jesus fuck, Ash, he’s my fucking housemate. You know, the annoying one who should promptly die in the fires of hell.*

*Nice to know you’re alive*

*Go to sleep*

*Still drinking my sorrows away*

I sighed and put my phone on the night stand. The door to my room opened and Scotty ran in. I looked up and saw Niex standing there. 

“What?” I asked. 

“Nothing.” He turned around and pulled down the stairs to the attic. I had to get up to close my door. 

“Good night to you too,” I muttered, pushing my door closed. Scotty nestled into the blankets as I lay back down and passed out.

M and I have been dating for close to 7 months now. We love each other and I can honestly say I'm never happier than when I'm spending time with her. She's expressed the same thing to me. After I finish college this upcoming year and start working full time the summer after, we have hopeful plans to get an apartment and move in together.

Along the course of our relationship, I've seen hints of her wanting a long term commitment. Some examples being a joke on TV about couples getting married and having her look at me and smile right after, saying things like ""that's so pretty I'd love to have that at my wedding"", having her ask questions like ""when we get older, can we do this?"" and just the idea of us getting a place together in general made me think that she has no problem getting closer to the next level with us. And to he clear I'm not disagreeing with these plans, I can see myself going the distance with M and it seemed like she wanted the same with me.

Last night we hung out with a couple of her girlfriends when the topic of marriage started a conversation. Everyone had different viewpoints on the subject, and then M put in her two cents. She says that she likes weddings, but couldn't really see herself having one. M also mentioned that she couldn't imagine being committed to one person for the rest of her life. Right in front of me. Her friends even looked at me when she said that seeing how I would react. I didn't make a scene out of it, and I wasn't confrontational about it afterwards because she had a big interview the morning after for an internship and I didn't want to mess with her head. Part of me is thinking I'm over reacting because we're 7 months in but from all the signs I've gotten to make me believe that she did want a long term commitment, should I be confrontational? It seems like I'm hearing two opinions from her of what she wants out of his relationship and I just want to know her end goal with us. Or should I just slow down and chill out because I'm only at month 7 of this relationship? Any advice would be appreciated.

Tl;Dr: girlfriend had made it seem like she wanted a long term commitment with me, but sometimes says otherwise which is making me confused

* Interested in the field of politics long term

* Don't want to go to law school. Paid my way through undergrad and that was painful enough

* Am willing to do volunteer work as long as it's not an unpaid internship. I have a 10-6 M-F gig at the moment that I need to pay my mortgage

* Am willing to spend several years volunteering before making a full time switch. Need to save up a chunk of change before accepting a lower paying career path.

* Would like if my volunteer work was tech oriented(IT, web programming, application programming, security, etc) but certainly not a must

I'm a recent grad non-traditional student (age 27). I did well in my CS program but never interned. I didn't really realize until late in the game how important this was (I wish I had found this sub earlier). 

I'm getting some hits in my job search, but I'm almost scared at the prospect of getting a job. I feel like experience as an intern where I learn a lot without the fear of high expectations would have been valuable.

As a junior dev, am I going to lose out on that experience? I'm afraid of being thrown to the wolves and just failing right away. And once I fail at one place, how hard is it going to be to land another gig?"
4uwhlg,3,2016-07-27,Me [24 M] with my wife[22 F] wants to divorce possibly after a break?,AMANAMISTAKE,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4uwhlg/me_24_m_with_my_wife22_f_wants_to_divorce/,"Hello /r/relationships I am seeking some further advice from the masses. A little bit about myself and my wife. I am 24 she is 22. I am in the military going on 5 years. She is a student who recently graduated with her Bachelors and is applying to Med School. We have been together 4 years. Married since the end of 2013 (through the court) we kept it quiet before I left on my first deployment with the pretense that I would still propose and we would have a wedding. Any who our families found out anyways and that was a shit storm for awhile. Now onto the issue at hand.

I am not a perfect man. I have a fault that I am getting help from and I hope its not too late. I realize that and I have messed up. I have never struck her but I have put my hands on her aggressively (grabbing, pushing, pinning to ground). I am seeking help for this. Anywho a few weeks ago (independence day weekend) we went out for the weekend with some friends. We drank and partied had a good time. The next day we got in an argument. We were tired and she was really stressed with studying for her MCAT that she had to take the following weekend. In this argument she provoked me and I pushed her. She came back to my face and I pushed her again. She took off her wedding ring and threw it at me (I had just given her the ring and proposed in early June). When she did that I lost my cool and chased her into the bedroom and pinned her down on the bed. I grabbed her by the hair and said lots of mean stuff to her then left. I slept on the couch that night and we didn't speak. 

The following day I had to go into work. I had hid the ring from her as I was still hurt she took it off and threw it. We had already talked about how disrespectful that is and that we shouldnt do it. When I got home she starts yelling at me to give the ring back to her. I refuse. She then says she is going to escalate the situation and grabs my phone. She holds onto it. I try to get it back from her and I grabbed her. I saw she wasn't letting go and it was going to get worse. Fast judgement led me to grab her phone and emergency dial the police. They arrived in a few minutes and I ended up getting arrested because she had red marks on her from where I grabbed her. My wife went ahead and had a temporary restraining order filed against me because she didnt want me coming home that day and she told them about what happened the day before and that there was other incidents. Fast forward to a few days ago and all the charges have been dismissed. The restraining order was dropped and the Domestic Violence charge dismissed. My wife never wanted me to get arrested and it was a situation that got out of control. 

Now here comes the curveball. During the restraining order I couldnt come home or contact her obviously. She had her father come up and pack up the apartment and she moved back down with him over a thousand miles away. She left after she took the MCAT. Her reasoning is that she needs time to think about staying with me and needs to get away. I respect that even though I couldnt believe she left me and took half the stuff in the apartment (bedset, a desk, all her belongings) and she also took half of our money saved up ~$12,000. Mind you ive been the only one working while shes been going to school. She had an internship but she paid off her student loans and she graduated last month debt free. 

It took her a couple weeks to give me an answer on if shes coming back or not. She called me a few days ago and said she loves me and misses me, but she wants a divorce. She said she needs to find herself. She said her morals tell her to not be with a man that abuses her. She says I will make someone else very happy and that she loves me but she doesnt believe I will change. I know I will change. After all this I see it clear as day what my mistakes are. I can only blame myself and what I saw growing up but that is wrong. I ended up crying and she did too on the hour long phone call. She ended up saying lets have a 30 day break. No contact or anything at all unless absolutely necessary (about to commit suicide or something) then she will call me and tell me if she still wants the divorce or will give us another chance. She also said she doesnt want to see me because she feels it will make her give me a second chance. It's been a few days and its been very hard for me not to contact her but I have a strong support group of people to talk to and I keep a notebook and write down things I want to tell her. I also changed her name in my phone and deleted old messages to help me. 

Basically reddit, I am here for advice, good bad or indifferent. I have some family members saying that she had this planned and used me now that she graduated debt free. It does sort of look like that and she took the 12k but I dont believe so because her father spoils her and she never had to leave her family in the first place to be with me. I also want to clearly state that I know what I did was wrong and I have had enough people telling me about it. I WILL fix it. Will she come back? Really all I can do is show her I can keep my word and not contact her right? Ive been advised not to even contact her family. This is all so hard for me because ive been on the reactive end of everything. Shes the one that left. I was the one that got arrested. I had a surgery coming up that she knew about and she still left me. She hasnt even called my mom or dad to talk to them. Im just left here wondering if she will come back but I feel like she wont because once she has her mind set on something she rarely changes it. I dont know if I should go out and buy my own bedset or just keep sleeping on the couch. I dont know if she will give us another chance but I do know that if we try together we can conquer this and become stronger from it. In a way her leaving me was a real eye opener but I'm afraid she wont be coming back. We took wedding vows and I believe in them even though it was only her and I in the court. I don't think she really honors those vows. I need advice. I hope this post gets some attention and I'll probably ask specific questions  or for guidance. Thank you for your time.

   
**tl;dr**: I was physically abusive, wife left me during restraining order over a thousand miles away and took half our stuff and $12k in savings. We are on a 30 day no contact break. It's hard to keep it together and not fly down to see her. It's best if you read it all to get a better picture of the situation.

Feel free to ask questions/advice. On a throwaway obviously.

EDIT 1: To clarify, there is no longer a restraining order and charges by the court have been dismissed.

EDIT 2: also I am looking for advice. I want to hear thoughts and answer further questions about what happened. I am asking questions to people to see how they see the situation from the outside.

Can I please have some advice? Will she come back? Suggestions? Do I buy a bedset or wait the 30 days? Really all I can do is show her I can keep my word and not contact her right?"
4uwhzi,2,2016-07-27,Choosing an Internship Offer - Big 4,job_throw_away_1,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4uwhzi/choosing_an_internship_offer_big_4/,"I am going to be a Junior in college and I just received an offer from two of the Big 4 accounting firms for an internship next summer, the summer of 2017.

I would be going into the advisory practice at each firm and I need advice on which one to choose as they are very similar yet different. I will be going through the pros and cons of each one. 


**Firm 1** - offer: $39 / hr (~81k salary) 

Commute to Office: ~2-2.5 hours (have to travel into a large city every day with public transportation that is 1 hour away by car without traffic)

*Pros*

* Second largest advisory proctice within the Big 4
* Arguably the most well known and prestigious of the Big 4
* Lots of room to move up within the company
* High pay grade
* Would be traveling by plane each week (The practice I would be working under is a national practice so clients would be all over the US)
* Tuition buy-back program (they give you $1200 a year towards your student loans for 6 years)

 
*Cons*

* I do not know much about the type of work associated with my practice and horizontal 
* I know none of the people I would be working with
* Very rigorous work load associated with Firm 1
* Bad work - life balance due to the travel

**Firm 2** - offer: ~$30 / hr (64k salary)

Commute to Office: ~1-1.5 hours. Only car.

*Pros*

* I have met and know personally everyone I would be working with / for (including the partner, managers, and directors)
* I know the type of work I would be doing since they have been so transparent
* Amazing work life balance
* Not as much travel since the practice is regional


*Cons*

* Smallest advisory practice of the Big 4
* The practice I would be working under is considered ""Audit support"" so it does not seem as exciting or challenging as the Firm 1 offer
* Lower pay grade


A little bit of additional information: I have been pigeon holed by Firm 2 in a sense because when I first started going to their events, they looked at my major and immediately assigned me to the practice I would be working within. This allowed me to meet many people within my practice and gain a feel for the type of work I would be doing. 

As you can see, I am stuck on this decision. I have until mid August to decide. Which would you choose? What aspects of each offer / company should I be weighing the most?"
4uwoqa,14,2016-07-27,[Story] my motivation to be better,ernied3rd,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/4uwoqa/story_my_motivation_to_be_better/,"Alright so I'm kinda new here to reddit (I hang around a lot though in imgur) and I've never really posted anything like this before and if I'm posting in the wrong place i guess just let me know, but i just have to put this out there for my own sake and the hope that someone may benefit from it.
	
So I'm 21 and in college but have honestly not gotten far since I graduated in 2013... I was aiming to be a nurse but at this point I'm just gonna be a medical assistant. Anyways my three years in college I pretty much broke down more and more and felt more alone even though I got along well with my two younger sisters and parents. And so at some point I started to think more about my life being worthless and how my family might be better off without me if I just left, that way they wouldn't have to struggle financially thinking I was going somewhere in life. They thought I was fine and doing good in school because that is what I wanted them to believe even though inside I felt alone, worthless, and without any real purpose to change and move forward with myself. 
	
Now the thing to understand is that anyone who knew me would think I was going to be successful and be the nurse/doctor that I wanted to be. I always did well in school and never hung with a bad crow, and in fact graduated top 10% in my class (for reference there was a total of some 800 students in my class). So pretty much I had everything set up for me cause I also managed to have a $2000 scholarship which helped out a lot when I headed off to community college. 
	
So I pretty much felt good and ready once I started college. My first couple weeks in college showed me just how alone I was though. I had friends in high school that I always hung out and played soccer with in the weekends but when we graduated we pretty much went our separate ways and just lost contact with each other cause we had jobs and school stuff. So this compounded by the fact that I didn't have good people skills or at least was just really shy, made me even more reserved and alone. Another thing is that since i'm an illegal immigrant (yeah i'm mexican -_-) I felt I had no choice but to do well in college and just hope(I mean that in every sense of the word) I could make something off of that (without documents you can't work or even do internships that realized I would need to do once I was in a nurse program). I always new that it would be hard for me as an illegal immigrant to get a job or go far without any documentation but luckily DACA came into play just as I was gonna graduate and so I was able to save some money to put towards college expenses...without it I probably would've been stuck with a sub-minimum paying job with such long hours that it might've been hard for me to go to school AND work. Even with DACA though I felt pessimistic about my future and so this also added to my depression later on...
	
side note: I know my story might be all over the place but i've never written this before so just bare with me... 
	
So the first year of college went okay but not what I was expecting and so long story short I fell into depression more and more as the months went by and after flunking a couple classes I just stopped caring and started thinking suicidal thoughts (I never did anything to myself but at times I felt I was close to doing something) even though I still went to campus just to show my parents I was okay. Eventually around October last year when I dropped out of the medical assistant program I told my parents what I was going through. I went into their room one night and broke down in front of them telling them what I've done and how i've failed and that I thought it might've helped if I just left or killed myself...but they supported and helped my though much more than I thought and so that was my turning point for me. I didn't go to a psychologist or anything, but I noticed my parents behavior changed and how they were just more supportive and caring asking how I was (it might not seem like much but it helped me). I started to go to the gym and had a vision for myself of what I wanted to be and do (I went from 140 to 154) in about three months (some of that is fat too -_-)... I also started to just think more about how I wanted to go out and date girls (i've never had a gf or been on a date) and eventually did (i've been out with three, all through tinder ;), and so far i'm in a good relationship with my gf right now).
	
The thing that helped me the most with this and helped motivate myself to wake up at 6 a.m. In the morning to go and workout was getting some chicks ;)... yeah I was a pretty horny guy (still kinda am lol). But I just figured it'd be easier to talk to girls if I was more muscular and in better shape and it did. I felt more confident and sure of myself whenever I talked to a girl or just about anyone for that matter and that gave me even more motivation to change in other ways. I started to really apply some of the stuff I learned from reading self help articles and videos (I like watchin TED videos) and just realized it's okay to be “the nice guy” (I would feel I was too nice sometimes and so I would crawl into myself so people didn't make fun of me or something). What I always try to keep in mind is that I need to stay humble and kind and respect other's decisions and if I don't it's okay they've got their reason's i've got mine so just move on. Doing this pretty much helped me in so many ways than I thought because now i'm more outgoing, open minded, talkative and able to hold a conversation...and get them phone numbers! Sorry just felt like putting that out there lol. So for anyone reading this just be open to new things don't be afraid to talk and say what's on your mind just realize when its okay to joke and be serious and if your not sure well just do what I did...purposely do something stupid (this does not mean jumping off the roof your two story house and into a trampoline -_-) or get yourself in an uncomfortable situation so that way you get a little more used to being out of your comfort zone and develop a sense of how to read somebody (body language) because it helps a lot. 

**i didn't know how to put this in here but another good thing that helped me was the fact that i work at a phone store right now (i've been here since around early september) which really helped with my communication skills cause of all the stuff i gotta tell people to buy a phone haha

	
Well I guess that does it for me, I know alot of you might just say TLDR and so to you I say good day sir/mam and to those who read it thank you...i just wanted to put this out there so that way I didn't just keep telling it to myself like a wierdo haha.

I was a peer tutor this past year in Math and Science, and I'm only part of one club that does Engineering-based projects to help the community. But I don't think I really have any relevant experience for any Electrical Engineering or Software Engineering jobs.  

Does anyone have any advice on how I can improve my resume so that I can get hired for a summer internship next year. I have a month of 100% free time just to work on whatever it takes, and I'm willing to work extremely hard on developing real work experience this next school year even it means a slight drop in grades.  

If it's relevant, I go to Texas A&amp;M University.

So I was taken into an early stage company as an intern for general SEO improvement (and to learn an unbelievable amount).

I've done the typical dynamic meta/title work, image alts, as well as revamped their social in/outbound linkage. 

I think as a low level young intern this is as good as I can get it, right?

The issue now is they are claiming that it was a great start but it seems they are now waiting for phase 2 of modifications. 

I've read dozens of articles and reached out to multiple full-time engineers and nobody seems to have any ideas of what more I can do in terms of SEO.

Does anybody have advice for a nervous intern like me? Should I simply say ""there's nothing else to do?"" or something like ""what do you expect?""

I can't tell if I'm severely inadequate for my role or if this manager has unrealistic expectations. 

Is there a whole world of SEO I'm missing?"

For the last year and a half I have been working at a QA automation company, but recently left because I was more interested in the automation side of things versus the QA side and the job was paying terribly. 

I would love to get into DevOps, as I had the opportunity to help with deploys and creating tools to use. The bad thing is that there is no way to get into a role like that without having experience doing it. 

I am also open to returning to a developer role, but again, it seems I don't have enough experience for most places. I have a decent portfolio of some of my side projects including websites I've created, desktop applications, and some bots I've made for personal uses like sneaker bots and IFTTT node scripts for a ton of tasks. 

Lastly, I live in north Louisiana, which seems to be one of the worst markets for software development. I would love to work with cutting edge technology and contribute in any way possible while learning as much as possible... That's not happening in north Louisiana, and can't/don't want to move. 

I have applied for over 35-40 jobs via Stack Overflow, company websites, angelslist, and any other listing that looks like a great fit. Most of them say they are looking for more experience since I've only been out of college one year. 

ANY help is greatly appreciated, guys. Feedback on this post is even appreciated. How can I do better in getting myself established? "

She is about to finish grad school in social work but she is a people-pleaser and has a hard time saying ""no"" to things and seems to have a hard time setting boundaries. Ie she will hang out with a ""lonely"" friend of a friend, but when they yell at her for random reasons she just takes it. If she gets an invitation to go to an event but doesn't want to go, she says yes anyway. She seems to live completely by the Christian thought of always putting others before yourself. She also has a hard time being alone and has to be busy at all times. I've known her for a very long time and she is certainly avoiding some deep issues that she has. From past conversations when I have touched on this topic, she seemed at least aware that she has some problems, but is afraid or doesn't want to delve into it. She has been to counseling in the past, but she was insistent about it only being a tool to help her get through a specific difficult situation she was going through at that time, not something to work through deeper issues. 

I'm not the type of person to push someone who doesn't want to talk about something, or argue when I disagree, but I'm really worried that she will get badly hurt and eventually crash and burn the further she gets into social work. She is starting a grief counseling internship soon and I believe that she absolutely must learn to set boundaries and take care of herself. 

Does anyone have any thoughts about what I can say or do to help her? "

I just finished my first year at University but have been required to forgo any internship opportunities by my parents for 1 year to live at home. I'm trying to self-teach myself a few technologies, and have learned HTML/CSS. I currently know Java and C from university.

I'm interested in learning web development (JS, PHP), MySQL (with LAMP or Java), and Android Development but I seem to be unable to pick. I want to make myself desirable to recruiters but I feel the best way to do some would be to specialize a bit. I'm working on getting some projects up (basic webpages and data structures in Java and C) but I feel like nothing I do is really impressive.

4uxxu1,0,2016-07-27,I [24 M] with my wife [22 F] wants to divorce possibly after break,AMANAMISTAKE,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4uxxu1/i_24_m_with_my_wife_22_f_wants_to_divorce/,"Hello /r/relationship_advice I am seeking some further advice from the masses. A little bit about myself and my wife. I am 24 she is 22. I am in the military going on 5 years. She is a student who recently graduated with her Bachelors and is applying to Med School. We have been together 4 years. Married since the end of 2013 (through the court) we kept it quiet before I left on my first deployment with the pretense that I would still propose and we would have a wedding. Any who our families found out anyways and that was a shit storm for awhile. Now onto the issue at hand.

I am not a perfect man. I have a fault that I am getting help from and I hope its not too late. I realize that and I have messed up. I have never struck her but I have put my hands on her aggressively (grabbing, pushing, pinning to ground). I am seeking help for this. Anywho a few weeks ago (independence day weekend) we went out for the weekend with some friends. We drank and partied had a good time. The next day we got in an argument. We were tired and she was really stressed with studying for her MCAT that she had to take the following weekend. In this argument she provoked me and I pushed her. She came back to my face and I pushed her again. She took off her wedding ring and threw it at me (I had just given her the ring and proposed in early June). When she did that I lost my cool and chased her into the bedroom and pinned her down on the bed. I grabbed her by the hair and said lots of mean stuff to her then left. I slept on the couch that night and we didn't speak. 

The following day I had to go into work. I had hid the ring from her as I was still hurt she took it off and threw it. We had already talked about how disrespectful that is and that we shouldnt do it. When I got home she starts yelling at me to give the ring back to her. I refuse. She then says she is going to escalate the situation and grabs my phone. She holds onto it. I try to get it back from her and I grabbed her. I saw she wasn't letting go and it was going to get worse. Fast judgement led me to grab her phone and emergency dial the police. They arrived in a few minutes and I ended up getting arrested because she had red marks on her from where I grabbed her. My wife went ahead and had a temporary restraining order filed against me because she didnt want me coming home that day and she told them about what happened the day before and that there was other incidents. Fast forward to a few days ago and all the charges have been dismissed. The restraining order was dropped and the Domestic Violence charge dismissed. My wife never wanted me to get arrested and it was a situation that got out of control. 

Now here comes the curveball. During the restraining order I couldnt come home or contact her obviously. She had her father come up and pack up the apartment and she moved back down with him over a thousand miles away. She left after she took the MCAT. Her reasoning is that she needs time to think about staying with me and needs to get away. I respect that even though I couldnt believe she left me and took half the stuff in the apartment (bedset, a desk, all her belongings) and she also took half of our money saved up ~$12,000. Mind you ive been the only one working while shes been going to school. She had an internship but she paid off her student loans and she graduated last month debt free. 

It took her a couple weeks to give me an answer on if shes coming back or not. She called me a few days ago and said she loves me and misses me, but she wants a divorce. She said she needs to find herself. She said her morals tell her to not be with a man that abuses her. She says I will make someone else very happy and that she loves me but she doesnt believe I will change. I know I will change. After all this I see it clear as day what my mistakes are. I can only blame myself and what I saw growing up but that is wrong. I ended up crying and she did too on the hour long phone call. She ended up saying lets have a 30 day break. No contact or anything at all unless absolutely necessary (about to commit suicide or something) then she will call me and tell me if she still wants the divorce or will give us another chance. She also said she doesnt want to see me because she feels it will make her give me a second chance. It's been a few days and its been very hard for me not to contact her but I have a strong support group of people to talk to and I keep a notebook and write down things I want to tell her. I also changed her name in my phone and deleted old messages to help me. 

Basically reddit, I am here for advice, good bad or indifferent. I have some family members saying that she had this planned and used me now that she graduated debt free. It does sort of look like that and she took the 12k but I dont believe so because her father spoils her and she never had to leave her family in the first place to be with me. I also want to clearly state that I know what I did was wrong and I have had enough people telling me about it. I WILL fix it. Will she come back? Really all I can do is show her I can keep my word and not contact her right? Ive been advised not to even contact her family. This is all so hard for me because ive been on the reactive end of everything. Shes the one that left. I was the one that got arrested. I had a surgery coming up that she knew about and she still left me. She hasnt even called my mom or dad to talk to them. Im just left here wondering if she will come back but I feel like she wont because once she has her mind set on something she rarely changes it. I dont know if I should go out and buy my own bedset or just keep sleeping on the couch. I dont know if she will give us another chance but I do know that if we try together we can conquer this and become stronger from it. In a way her leaving me was a real eye opener but I'm afraid she wont be coming back. We took wedding vows and I believe in them even though it was only her and I in the court. I don't think she really honors those vows. I need advice. I hope this post gets some attention and I'll probably ask specific questions  or for guidance. Thank you for your time.

   
**tl;dr**: I was physically abusive, wife left me during temporary restraining order over a thousand miles away and took half our stuff and $12k in savings. We are on a 30 day no contact break (agreed upon by us). It's hard to keep it together and not fly down to see her. It's best if you read it all to get a better picture of the situation.

Feel free to ask questions/advice. On a throwaway obviously.

* To clarify, there is no longer a restraining order and charges by the court have been dismissed.

* also I am looking for advice. I want to hear thoughts and answer further questions about what happened. I am asking questions to people to see how they see the situation from the outside.

* Can I please have some advice? Will she come back? Suggestions? Do I buy a bedset or wait the 30 days? Really all I can do is show her I can keep my word and not contact her right?

* I know my faults I just want to fix this...venting and seeking advice has helped me deal with this major fuck up"

Things got off to a good start with his [high energy](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4uxdbn/im_donald_j_trump_and_im_your_next_president_of/d5ton5k?context=3) response to a well thought out 5 part question from potential Trump voters who wanted to know a little more about him. What they learned was that he can't even finish making vague promises. Trump then switched his style up with a comprehensive explanation of how he would [keep money out of politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4uxdbn/im_donald_j_trump_and_im_your_next_president_of/d5tpfo4?context=3). Trump then displayed fantastic intelligence to name 4 whole presidents instead of saying [who he admired the most](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4uxdbn/im_donald_j_trump_and_im_your_next_president_of/d5tr2z3?context=3). His reading comprehension may not be the best, but he sure can list those presidents off! Trump's interns continued to make vague promises for a few more questions which honestly aren't even worth mentioning (you can take a look, they're supremely underwhelming), before somebody got the memo that Trump's rally was starting and it wouldn't look too good to answer more questions while he was up on stage. 




Well I think I can say without bias that that was a pretty terrible AMA all around. From being 20 minutes late, to not giving any concrete answers, to not even finishing his first answer to on the fence voters. Can't imagine even the more diehard the_donald posters are feeling great about how that went to be honest, I'd be pretty disappointed to hype him up for months and then Trump himself shows up and it's just some interns casually saying democrats are bad and Trump will fix everything "

I met my best friend, let's call him D, in fifth grade and we've always been super close. We had all of our highschool classes together and even have the same job. When we graduated from our very small highschool we both got accepted to the same college, which is the flagship university of the state. I moved into an apartment my second year, and he moved in a couple months after. 

Now I know what people say about having friends as roommates but and we had zero problems for the first year, and loved living together. However, he flunked out of the state school and had to enroll in the local community college. Then the next semester he flunked out of there and went to working full time. 

The entire time this was going on, I was doing pretty well in college.  I really don't mean to sound pretentious but I had always been a sort of introvert my entire life, but finally came out of my shell in college. I went from having a small circle of friends from highschool to joining a huge club in the business college, which meant I went to every single football game (which are huge at my school), and parties every weekend. I tried to get him involved with my friends and at least keep him in the loop, but he refused every invite, opting to stay at our apartment with his girlfriend.

Like I said before, he slowly started getting colder towards me. Before, we play video games together all the time, usually in the same room, but now when I ask him, he declines and goes straight to his room without a word and shuts the door. We used to split doing the chores (dishes, vacuuming, trash, etc) with no problem,  but he had stopped doing it completely, letting everything pile up until I caved in and cleaned all of it myself, everytime. Whereas before we would have all of our shifts together at work and carpool every shift, he secretly requested to be scheduled opposite shifts as me. It has now gotten to the point where he is openly aggressive, refusing to do any chores, having little to no contact, and leaving messes out on purpose for me to clean (I am a very clean person and hate having a dirty apartment.) Just the other day I put up a decoration in the main room, only to find it torn down and thrown in my room when I came home from work.

I just don't understand where all of this hostility is coming from. I tried to include him with my new group of friends, and he refused. I never thought less of him for flunking out, and even helped him with his studies at the Community College, and he still wants nothing to do with me. I'll admit, we are both very closed people, we do not talk openly about our feelings. But the passive aggressiveness his starting to come to a head.

I'm now on the brink of cancelling my lease and moving somewhere else while I finish up my last year of undergrad and go for my Masters, but I have no one else to live with. All of my other friends are either already living somewhere, or can't afford to move out.

So this bring me to what's been my situation this entire summer: I've been working 65 hours a week between my summer internship and regular job, and every day I come home to him playing video games in silence in a filthy apartment, where I have to try and find time to clean myself since he won't do it. He completely ignores me every time I talk to him, and avoids me when our shifts at work overlap. The only theory I have for his attitude is the fact that I'm doing well in college and he flunked out. I have a big group of friends and an active social life and he still hangs out with our highschool friends, all 4 of them. Again, I don't act like i'm better than him in any way, and try to get him involved every chance I get. I just think it's unfair that I moved on while he didn't and he's now taking it out on me. 

Can someone please empathize with me, or at least tell me i'm a huge jerk, since I obviously can't see it

I want to go down the front-end developer route, but my school doesn't offer much in that realm. I figure that a lot of it will be gained through self-teaching and (hopefully) an internship. Can you guys give me real-world evidence of why you think the Master's is a good or a bad idea?

Also, how do I go about finding internships geared towards front-end? Back-end ones are super easy to find, but I'm having a more difficult time trying to find front-end.

4uyauz,209,2016-07-27,185 Days NoFap - A Brief Report,blueeyedbandito,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/4uyauz/185_days_nofap_a_brief_report/,"Hello fellow fapstronauts!

Today marks 185 days no PMO.
There is so much I can report on, but I'd like to be as concise as possible (however I have a habit of rambling).
The main reason why I would like to write a report is to give my perspective on NoFap which may in turn motivate others, and document how I feel in case I ever want to relapse.

A quick background:
I'm 22, and recent college grad.
I found NoFap in April 2013. Growing up, I would say I had pretty average PMO habits for the modern male teenager. Sometimes I would fap 3+ times a day, sometimes I would fap once every few days. It never quite got out of hand for me, and I never really saw it as a major issue. In 2013 I had a few short streaks, followed by a long 150 day streak. Since then, I've had probably three or four 90+ day streaks. Generally speaking, I believe in NoFap and I rarely PMOed for long periods of time once I found it.

What's worked for me:
I strongly believe that NoFap is not a magic bullet. It will not cure all your problems, erase your depression, or magically get you a girlfriend. However, I feel like it DOES give you a pretty big edge. I don't know why, and I'm not going to spat bro-psychology or reference any studies on testosterone or semen retention. This post is anecdotal. 
That being said, NoFap has been effective for me in combination with 
1. A steady weight lifting habit, 3-5 days per week
2. Minimum 7 hours sleep per night
3. Minimum 20 minutes mindfulness meditation per day
4. Limiting your media consumption (video games, netflix whatever)
5. Limiting how much you drink or do drugs
6. Cold showers

Basically, just fucking take care of yourself. Have respect for yourself, love yourself. And if you don't, fake it. If you hate who you are or the things you do, fake it. Power through that. Address the issues in your life and take action. Look in the mirror and smile at yourself. 

Here are some benefits I've had in this specific streak:

-Less depressed in general, mood is stable. Yes, I have off days- everyone does. However, I am generally a happy person and not everyone can say that.
-Social anxiety. I feel like I act more congruent with who I am. I don't really care what people think as much about me. If I make a shitty joke or I mispronounce a word or ask a stupid question- it doesn't quite embarrass me like it used to.
-Relationships with women. I started dating a girl I had a huge crush on about 60ish days into my streak. I had a HUGE crush on her. But, I asked her out and we dated for a while. I had to end things with her a few weeks back because I'm moving across the country for a job and things weren't really going anywhere between. Great girl, but not for me in a long term sense. My female coworkers and I have a great relationship. Flirting happens yes, but I don't over think it. 
-Got an internship for the summer and now a full time job when I move back up north. Can't say this is directly because of NoFap but it probably gave me a bit more pep in interviews and such.
-Got in the best shape I've ever been in. I started lifting weights pretty seriously about 3 years ago. I bulked for waaay too long and got a little soft. I really committed to cutting down and for the first time in a while have been hovering slightly above or below 10% B.F.
-Motivated- for the first time I'm pursuing a hobby outside of the gym and meditation and actually seeing REAL progress. Every night after work I draw from the moment I put my bag down until I go to bed. I grew up drawing, went to art school, but never committed to really learning shading/value/realism. Each drawing I see progress.
-And then all the generic NoFap stuff, eye contact, deeper voice, more assertive etc.

One thing I really want to stress is that NoFap is hard. Anyone out there who is struggling to make a week or two weeks or one month- pat yourself on the back for just simply trying. The fact that you're here, reading this post and on NoFap forums means you want change. And you'll probably get it. Just commit. Write down a list of 3 things you want in your life one year from now and the second your feet hit the floor every morning make it your fucking mission to manifest those 3 things. 
On my desk I have a post it note I wrote in May with 3 things.

1. Paint a realistic portrait of myself (getting there!)
2. Run a half marathon (dropping the ball on this one, only doing cardio once a week but still lifting weights)
3. Have a job I love. (haven't started at the new place yet but fingers crossed I'll love it.)

Anyway, I'm going to wrap up here.

If you can take anything from this, here's my 2 cents on all this NoFap stuff. 

NoFap is definitely a great tool to give you an edge, you can have everything you want in life if you go out and get it. 90% of what I read on this forum, although well-intentioned, is broscience. 

There's no doubt that a pornography habit is harmful for the psyche, it causes divorce, depression, unrealistic views on women. That's common sense.

What do you personally think companies would value more? The current internship that I have at the camp, or a simple app that I made myself for android phones?


Just discovered this subreddit and thought I would ask. You guys seem to give great advice so any help is appreciated."
4uygc4,0,2016-07-27,A post about Salt/Sportsmanship by SUGOI | Z [from Vegas Smash 4 community leader],BearUNLV,smashbros,https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/4uygc4/a_post_about_saltsportsmanship_by_sugoi_z_from/,"One of my buddies Z from Vegas Smash 4 posted this and I thought it was beautifully written &amp; worth the share [I asked his permission to share it] also please follow &amp; support Z if you like this https://twitter.com/Vegassmash_Z:

Hey everyone, something I've been meaning to share for a long time now. It's something that honestly, to this day I struggle with, but I feel like one of the best ways I can learn is to try and teach. So here it goes!

Salt and sportsmanship. Something that I've dealt with, along with many others, for a long time when being apart of the smash community. Salt is something that has a lot of negative stigma to it and rightfully so. Sportsmanship is something that absolutely needs to be applied to all of our tournaments even though we're not a ""sport"". I wanted to shed light on some of my thoughts on it as well as some coping methods if you feel that it's something that is too much for you. 

First and foremost, I actually encourage people to get a little salty. Some of you may be thinking that it's quite strange that I would encourage it. But truthfully, salt stems from competition and reflects how much one actually cares about their results or progress. Now, i'm not saying throw chairs, smash controllers, or get in someone's face about it, but venting some frustration is a good thing. Everyone is trying to win and when you come up a little short from achieving your goal, it's disappointing, just know that it's okay to feel a little tense. I remember I was talking to HugS back in 2011 before he took a small break from competitive smash. He told me that he no longer felt disappointed after losing a tournament, he said he simply nodded his head, laughed and immediately thought about what bar he wanted to visit while he was out of Socal. It was at that moment he knew his fire was gone and it was time to move on to something else in his life that he felt passionate about. He told me that he didn't like that failure didn't bother him and that he needed to find something he truly wanted to succeed in. Granted, he's back now and sponsored by Dream Team. 

Here's where I want to make things clear though. As a competitor in a tournament, realize that there are ""X"" amount of people with probably the same ultimate goal as you. Let's say on average, 20 people enter a local Vegas tournament. That means 19 other people are aiming to win. Understand that, just like applying for a job or internship or anything you want to be apart of, you have to fight through that field, and usually, the most prepared/experienced will succeed. Can you honestly say that you are that? Can you say you have put in as much time as the veterans or have as much time as the younger kids without responsibilities or etc. etc.? Keep everything in perspective, have the drive to win, but if you lose, you need to realize that instead of coming up with an excuse, you should recall your game play and remember what you did wrong. Watch your replays or stream archives, I know you'll find at least one thing you did wrong. You just have to be ready to analyze yourself as you would anyone else. If you don't have matches recorded or streamed, then it's up to you to pay attention in game. I'm speaking from experience here, back in brawl (circa 08-10) we barely had any type of stream or replays because of the 3 minute limit. We had to understand IN game that we were making mistakes. It's absolutely possible to learn your own bad habits and your own mistakes while playing, you just have to open up your mind a little. 

Another thing I figure I'd talk about is sportsmanship. Smash is rapidly evolving into an E-sport and it's time to put aside childish antics. I'll give you an example, I lost to snoop at a power up tournament and went off spouting nonsense and discrediting the win. I realized that I was out of line and apologized. The next time I lost, I felt the same frustration but I remembered I needed to own up to it. I reached out to shake his hand, granted I was visibly frustrated but you have to give credit where credit is due. And he responded with really kind words, which speaks volumes about his character. Again, it's okay to be frustrated, it's okay to pop off after a win, it's okay to be emotional. We don't need to be robots, we're playing a game after all. Just like when LeBron James cried after winning a championship or when Hbox won his EVO ""Chamionship"", we're allowed to express how much it means to us when we win/lose. 

Keep in mind, you're not going to be judged by just your talent, your personality before, during, and after the game will all come under scrutiny. It's best to set a standard for yourself and represent yourself the best way possible. I know a lot of you are wondering if you can become a sponsored player or go pro. The answer is yes, you can. It all depends on the amount of work you put in and how you carry yourself. If you can't smile immediately after a loss, it's okay, just don't turn into a villain because that sort of label can stick around for a long time and can even differ others from speaking to you. When the round boots up, reach your hand out for a fist bump or hand shake and give them a ""Best of Luck"" or ""May the best man win"" and as soon as the set is over, reach out and make sure you let them know you acknowledge their victory with a ""GGs"" or ""Good stuff"". Being humble will help you grow, not just in your smash career, but as a person. Giving respect is something a lot of people do not learn and I feel like if everyone in the smash community can learn to give and receive respect then only good will come from it. 

All of this stuff is what I've seen and it all comes from my personal experiences. I have my own goals I'd like to achieve but building the community as strong as I can will always be something I'm going to do. If you guys have questions or anything, feel free to comment or share if you think someone could use this, whatever helps! Oh, and I linked a video from Omni about how to handle a loss. It's a good watch that's funny and covers some stuff I may not have gone in detail with. I hope this read was informative!

I'm still in the ""can't quite believe it"" phase, to the point that I'm not sure what else to say lol.

For those that are curious, I started at OSU last fall on the 1 year track, and will be graduating in 16 days (but who's counting?). I got contacted by a Google recruiter in late March, after attending two hackathons which they were sponsors of. I did the online coding assessment in April, a phone technical interview in May, an onsite interview with 4 sessions in June, then got called back for 2 more technical interviews over Hangouts two weeks ago. The whole process is an exhausting gauntlet but evidently it's paid off! I initially interviewed for a full software engineer position, but given my lack of industry experience, they felt the residency program -- essentially a year long internship with the option to convert to a full engineer position at the end -- was a better fit for me. I'm so relieved this process is over and that it all worked out haha! Plus I've wanted to live and work in New York since a college visit there way back in high school!

edit: Thanks everyone! 

edit2: Just signed my offer letter! Holy shit, this is real! 😄"

Nothing will change, and both parties will learn that this is OK and that they can get away with it.

But that's not good enough for me. The first thing I'm going to do is commit to never vote for a Democrat again until they have taken responsibility for this mess and taken action to correct it. And I AM going to show up to vote. The democrats were handed this election from day one without having to resort to collusion and manipulation. It's their election to lose. Vote. Vote Republican. Vote Libertarian. Vote Green. Just make sure you vote, and vote for someone on the ballot or your ballot will not get counted and your vote voice won't be heard.

But wait, there's more! We need to summarize the most egregious examples of corruption and collusion from the DNC leaks and use that as the basis for a congressional letter writing campaign. We need to write letters to our representatives at all levels of government, to party chairs, and those who oversee our election process. We need to make it clear that the content of the leaks will not be forgotten, and we will not settle for accusations of a foreign scapegoat that could lead to unnecessary hostilities and further lies, scandals, cover-ups and corruption. We need to write to both Democrats AND Republicans about this, and hold them accountable to make a change. We need to threaten their very careers if they don't take effective and immediate action. We need to call on politicians to leave the party, or lose their next election if they don't lead the call for action. Our representatives are our voice, no matter who paid for their election.

But don't send a letter without calling your representative as well! An intern will answer the phone and tally your interest in correcting the corruption within the parties. Many believe this carries more weight than a letter or an email. If your representative is a Democrat, tell them you're leaving the party as well (even if you're not actually a Democrat).

Next, we need to keep #DemExit trending and don't let this get swept under the rug. Social media is the one of the only powers the people have left if we can't trust our election system, and even that's getting manipulated away from us. But hashtags and profile pic overlays don't do anything more than raise awareness.

We need to organize well-written petitions requesting reasonable actions from those that can carry them out and sign them. Keep in mind that a petition by itself will never make a change, but it is one tool we have to make sure our voices are heard, and to keep the pressure on.

We need to hold the media accountable for failure to report on the most important story in the history of our democracy. We need to contact the sponsors of media outlets that try to downplay the importance of this, or deflect blame to the Russians, and let them know that we won't buy their products as long as they support these news networks.

We need to tell all of our friends and family that they are being manipulated through collusion with the media, the political parties and our elected representatives, and that they need to help become part of the solution.

If we don't all take action and make sure this doesn't stand, we've already lost. Don't just sit here and watch things unfold. Inaction is the death of democracy."

I'm going to be a junior this fall and I don't know if I should work my ass off in high school, I have a 3.33 overall gpa. Or, should I go to a community college and work my ass off there and possibly get into a good UC I don't know how this shit works. I have people telling me it''s easier to get into a good college after 2 years of undergrad and others telling me to work my ass of the last two years of high school. I'm just not sure if that would make a difference because I don't know what colleges want. Especially UC's. 

Also how do you get a job that makes a least 6 figures. I've heard of people having a job that's not even close to their major and they are making a lot of money. I want to become some type of engineer, mechanical, electronic, computer doesn't really matter. Though, if there is a job that would pay better I would probably take it. 

Lastly, should I start working in that kind of field, maybe an internship or something over the summer. Another Job i'm thinking about is being a chief, for that job should I work at a restaurant, climb up the ladder or what. Do I go to culinary school and get a job as a chief, or do I still have to pay my dues. 

This is so confusing, I want a job that pays well, but I have no Idea how to get it. Specially, with the shitty economy we have right now. I'm only expecting it to get worse, and make it worst for the next generation to get a descent job.

4v009s,3,2016-07-28,Feel like crap and wondering if I need to do a serious career change,saycheese1010,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4v009s/feel_like_crap_and_wondering_if_i_need_to_do_a/,"I've been a developer for about 10 years and I did an interview just today with the interviewer being someone I've known for a few years and it went horribly, horribly bad.  My other peers did this same interview and they performed well.  Feeling pretty bad right now.  In fact, this feeling has just permeated my entire career so now I'm seriously considering a career switch.  I decided to put my whole story since maybe it'll give you some idea of what would be a good fit.  So please sit down, relax, have a cup of joe... or just scroll down to the bottom for a synopsis. :)

Throughout my career (and college) I've felt pretty insecure about my abilities.  It became pretty obvious to me when I was in school that I wasn't all that 'mathy' and I just didn't learn as quickly as the rest of my peers.  I went to one of the best schools in my country for CS (my marks were shit though), I've had positive feedback about my work in my internships and full-time work, and a single instance of negative feedback that just killed me (""the only good female developer is X"", where X was not me).  I constantly toy with the idea of being a UX designer, a UX researcher, a tester, a project manager, a product manager, a developer advocate, tech support or just someone who is involved in the tech scene and can code, but is in more of a supportive role to the developers.  I like to code (less so now) but never to the same extent as my coworkers, especially the ones who've been programming since childhood, and unlike them, I don't code at all when I get home.  I would classify myself as a developer who can quickly prototype stuff, make the UI look elegant (this is the only thing I'm actually very confident in) and I'm pretty versatile in terms of the frameworks and languages I've used (though most people are anyway).  There is a willingness I've noticed in me to try to always go above and beyond at work and I'm not one to ever turn away work because it's 'below me' or anything like that.  I am a workhorse and tend to take on too many things and burn myself out in the process.  However, when it comes to the theory and proving myself in an interview, I just suck a lot.  I'm fine when it comes to performance reviews, but I have never been considered for a management role.  I work well without much supervision (it's preferred actually) and I rarely ask for help, but there's just something about my general demeanour or lack of self-confidence that has never put me in a leadership role.  There was one guy at work who wanted to have more female stakeholders and even went to our lab head to set me up for a leadership role since he had heard wonderful things about me, but it just never panned out and I felt too weird about following up.  I feel inadequate almost daily though.  Still, I can't think of a better career for myself since I've always had an interest in computers.

As a kid, I used to watch this computer show, and would read almost every kid's computer book at the library.  I started developing later than my peers, but I felt like I always had an affinity to 'computers' throughout my childhood.


I went to an all-girls high school that had a slight emphasis on math and sciences, but I didn't really have any other friends who got into a STEM field.  (As an aside, it's not all that necessary for me to mention it was all-girls, but maybe it is important to my story?  Lately I've been asked to be part of a few initiatives at work to help promote women in tech.  I really dislike that whole dialogue and get a little embarrassed by it honestly, since I am mediocre at best but anyways, that's just my low self-esteem talking)...  Anyway,  high school is when my interest waned a fair bit, but even so, I would still work on webpages throughout high school, was pretty ok with my math abilities and was part of the computer science club.  I didn't really want to be part of the computer science club since my friends would roast me about it (not seriously or anything), and I mostly did it because my math teacher, also the supervisor for the club, really liked me and wanted me to be a part of it.  I happened to do very well in her math classes so she thought highly of me.  However, she did ask me one logic question (I suck at logic... weird that I became a programmer, right?) and after that, she advised me to get into law instead of math/cs.  I felt weird after that, but I still ended up getting into CS.  I have regrets about not doing more CS-ey stuff in high school, but I was really boy crazy and had stupid priorities. lol

Cut to university and I just felt like a total idiot.  So many other people would outperform me to the point where I just stopped caring and the only reason why I didn't drop out and switch careers was because I enjoyed my internships so much.  Most of the coding I ever did in school was during my internships.  If I had a group project, I was almost always on documentation (it was a huge chunk of the grade anyway haha).  I am eternally grateful for my internships as they helped me pay off my tuition and gave me the financial stability I needed since childhood.

I've been working full-time for close to 10 years now and I'm thinking maybe there is some weird hybrid role I can do so that I can feel wonderfully confident in my role.  I either need to start affirming that I am a great developer and resign myself to doing 100 interviews as practice or just freaking switch out of development altogether.  So I know I'm in the right field, but I just don't know what my role would be.  If you have any suggestions, I'm definitely open to it.  I'm not the young, impressionistic kid anymore but I'm also not terribly old either.  Feeling a little bummed right now.  I'll probably read through this again after I posted and be like, geez!  I am one depressed mofo.  But yeah, this is probably the lowest I've felt about my career and any sage advice or words of encouragement are definitely welcome!

I feel that the only thing that sets me apart from the next developer is that I really, seriously care about the aesthetics of the product.  I have no portfolio, I can't draw for shit but I am sensitive to placement of stuff and how things look and my 'eye' is usually aligned with the ux designer's eye if that makes any sense.  I just feel like others may notice these things but it just bugs them less or something.  Unfortunately, there is no hybrid role for that, at least not one I've seen.  I either need to just be the UI developer or the UI designer.  I bet a startup would be fantastic with that as I'd have to wear many hats anyway.  Thoughts?

Thanks for listening.

TLDR; I'm a developer but despite having all the qualifications, I don't feel I'm any good and have considered switching careers.  To what?  Not sure, but would prefer to have something with an artistic bend to it.  Suggestions are welcome. :)  Thank you."

  I just turned 23, and I work as an exotic dancer in a major city within the U.S. on the West Coast. I've been in the industry for nearly a year and a half, and tonight for the first time, someone I know, walked into the club, to my greatest horror and hilarity of it (why are the most awkward horrible moments also super funny??).

&amp;nbsp;

  The person in question, is the long term boyfriend/Significant Other of a female mentor of mine, who was an active part of my life 5 years ago. She helped me a lot when I was 18-years-old. I came from a turbulent, traumatic childhood and teenage hood. She gave me the grounding internally and mentally that I desperately needed. We became extremely close to me back then, and she confided in me, that she had at times, had problems with this particular partner of hers, with regards to him crossing boundaries and etc. She would share these things with me, to emphasize and teach me how important it is to establish boundaries and to make sure those around you, ESPECIALLY romantic partners and family members, respect them!

&amp;nbsp;

  She taught me to stand up for myself, and to not question myself when someone does something wrong to me. Thanks to her, I dropped a very unhealthy victim mentality that I picked up from my mother. I love her dearly, and I respect her tremendously. She is my hero, without going into too many identifying details, she is a successful businesswoman who had started multiple businesses.

&amp;nbsp;

  Her relationship with this guy, always had ups and downs, usually due to some action of his crossing a boundary of hers, and her standing up for herself and threatening to break up. She's loved him for many years. They are both successful people with their own separate businesses, although  they live together. I met her before she got back with him, in fact, I helped her move a portion of her belongings. She voiced to me some of her concerns of getting back together with this man, such as having a back up plan financially in case he breaks her heart and bails. In my eyes, they were the ultimate power couple, and what I longed to obtain in my future.

&amp;nbsp;

  I know her quite well, and I know she is the more conservative type. She's shared a lot of her intimate preferences with me, like I said, we became close. I honestly cannot imagine her giving him permission to go to a gentlemen's club, and his reaction only further confirmed this to me.

&amp;nbsp;

  When I first spotted him, he spotted me too, and glanced at my face, in such a way that I knew he must have recognized me to some degree. I decided to sit and chat with him to find out if this was really him, or if it was just a doppelgänger and a bizarre coincidence.

&amp;nbsp;

  I sat down with him, I asked him what his name was and sure enough, it was the same name. As soon as I sat in front of him, and started talking, I knew it was him for sure. I asked him where he was from, (she told me he was from the east coast) and sure enough he tells me the state he is from, which is east coast. I ask him where he lives now, and he again confirms what I already knew. Some more small talk follows. 

&amp;nbsp;

  Then I asked him why he chose that particular club over other ones, he makes some offhand comment about coming here many years ago, and then says he had a serious relationship end on him recently. I asked him if it was still affecting him, he said yes but that they are still friends. I acted as if to sympathize with him, switched the conversation to my friend on stage, and made my exit by saying I needed a drink (water not alcohol haha), and wished him a pleasant night.

&amp;nbsp;

  I went to the locker room, logged into my old social media account, and sure enough, it says he is in a relationship with my mentor still, and there are recent photos of them together. My heart plummeted even further, and for the remainder of the night I felt nauseous and emotionally incapable of working.

&amp;nbsp;

  Reddit, I need your help. This is way way beyond something I can deal with. I joined the industry to pay for things I couldn't pay for alone on a high school diploma (like an immigration lawyer!). I love my female mentor tremendously, because of her, I grew in ways that enabled me to start my own business, seek out internships, and be brave in the face of adversity. 

&amp;nbsp;

  I come across men who are married or have girlfriends all the time in my line of work. I hate it, but I have come to accept it begrudgingly. I wish people would get the consent of their partner before entering a ""sexualized"" environment, or at least go together as a couple. I don't have control over the actions of others, but I know deep down inside, she would not be okay with this, and I don't know what to do. 

&amp;nbsp;

  The last time I saw her was 2 years ago for a special occasion oriented around one of my accomplishments. She was my primary mentor in a group of mentors that I had. I love her so much, she even considered adopting me legally to make my legality problems go away, but couldn't due to my being 18 already (5 years ago). I want to tell her, because I feel like she should know that he is doing something, that I have strong inclinations to believe, she would not be okay with. She doesn't know what I do for work, and I don't think she would judge me for it, although I am certain she would be concerned with my emotional/psychological well-being. Will she turn on me and hate me? 

&amp;nbsp;

  I witnessed him getting multiple lapdances and talking to girls until the club closed. Am in the wrong here? I can't look at him the same, I don't think there is anything wrong with going into a gentlemen's club, but I do believe it's wrong to do something behind your partner's back that makes them uncomfortable ! I know he comes from a traumatic childhood, but that doesn't justify him betraying her trust. She let go of her dream of having kids, because he didn't want kids, solely because she loved him and believed he turned over a new leaf.

&amp;nbsp;

  If I didn't know so much about her and him, I wouldn't care, but I LOVE HER, the truth is, I love her as if she were my mother, because in a very real way, she was like a mom to me when my mother abandoned me at 18.

&amp;nbsp;
  Should I tell her what I saw? Why or why not? 

&amp;nbsp;

  How do I move on from this experience? 

&amp;nbsp;

  They were the ultimate example of an ideal healthy adult relationship, and now I feel crushed. 

&amp;nbsp;

  I typed this all on mobile, first time ever posting, I skimmed through for typos and editing, please excuse any errors!

&amp;nbsp;
  How do I add spacing? I keep editing to add space between the paragraphs and I am unsuccessful!

&amp;nbsp; 
Edit: I finally figured out how to add spaces! Whew!

&amp;nbsp;

Edit#2: Thank you to everyone who has responded thus far. This is a difficult dilemma, and everyone's responses have helped me to look at this situation from multiple angles, and also give me insight into myself, and for that I am thankful. With that being said, I am 90% leaning towards telling, and 10% trying to decide when exactly to tell her. I don't want to lose my job, and I don't want to lose my friend/mentor either. I have also decided to work harder so to leave this industry I am currently in sooner. This whole event just adds even more disgust to a work environment I already hate. Thank you to everyone for helping me! If you have any additional suggestions, please don't hesitate. I will absolutely respond to everyone!

**tl;dr**: I work as an exotic dancer. The boyfriend of my female mentor/mother figure came into my work place, a gentlemen's club, bought lapdances, and chatted with women all night until closing. I confirmed it was him by chatting with him, without revealing who I was. I suspect he recognized me, but neither of us outed the other. My female mentor is conservative, and confided in me, 5 years ago, some issues related to trust and boundaries about this guy. I have known her for 5 years.  She does not know I currently work as exotic dancer. Do I tell her what I saw? Why or why not? How do I move on from seeing my favorite example of a healthy relationship, crushed? "

Fast forward a year after starting my computer science degree my optician told me that I have to start wearing glasses.

I'm now two months into an internship as a software engineer and everyday after I get home my eyes are completely dead. They're very red, irritated, constantly itching. 
I take a short 2/3 min break every hour to look outside a window next to my desk. For the last year I haven't spent any time AT ALL on a computer or watching TV when at home. But nothing I do is enough.

My eyes are continuing to get worse and worse.

The last two months alone have me considering changing my career because I don't want to be blind by the time I'm 40.

Anyone else have a similar experience?"

Tomorrow is my last day of work and I can finally move away and start my real life.",buffbuf,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4v0sta/progress_after_spending_the_last_2_grueling_years/,"Almost three years ago (holy shit), when I was 20 and in college, I moved into a house with all of my best friends at a point in my life where I was craving structure and discipline. I wanted to compartmentalize my life a little bit more. Around this time, my parents were also fighting a lot. Infinitely many factors converged, including depression and mental instability, and that led me to, for better or for worse, leave that house I was in, transfer colleges, change my major, and move back in with my parents. Things didn't get easier; it was a hard decision that I've thought about almost every day this whole time, but I ultimately think it was for the best, because I pushed myself in ways I've never performed before. Over the course of college, I transferred twice and switched majors four times, settled on neuroscience, took all pre-med electives despite knowing I probably didn't want to go into medicine, finished them all in like 1.5 years, got the best grades I possibly could have and graduated with honors, jobs, internships etc. all while helping my mom with her divorce, and graduated in 4.5 years total. I have an Ndad and a Emom who was scared of leaving him, not because of any ""danger"" but because she thought that I would resent her for not having a father, when, in fact, though I understand that it is difficult to leave an abusive relationship, I would have preferred to cut that toxicity out of my life sooner rather than later. She told me that if I wasn't there to help her emotionally, she wouldn't have gotten that divorce. I felt parentified for pretty much that whole time going to college.

I'm saying all of this not to gloat, but because I dedicate a lot of time dissecting and reassembling all of the reasons that led me to leave the college where I had friends and acquaintances, and everything was easy. Sometimes, it even feels like I just skipped almost three years of my life, and here I am, back at 20. I could have spent the last two years of college socializing and settling into the city I went to school. I could have just dropped out, or taken a job, or something, and have it easy. I've come to develop an appreciation for things that are challenging, though. I love exceeding my own expectations in life. I have a firm commitment to taking the route of uncertainty and risk vs. comfort and security when presented with a fork in the road, and I think that's what I did. Plus, I just wasn't ready for the prospect of dropping out of school and/or performing way below my own expectations and capabilities, and the party lifestyle was becoming like any other boring routine that ultimately feels unfulfilling. I felt like I was going along with somebody else's agenda, instead of being the leader and captain of my own ship. I was at a point in my life where I was focused on the future, whereas my core group of friends were not. Mismatch of priorities; something else I learned about living with other people. Almost all of them are at the same phase in life as they were before, whereas I feel like the past few years of isolation, loneliness, and being the universal scapegoat has fundamentally transformed me. I also learned so, so much about everything. 

I once read in a David Sedaris book which, in a conversation with a wealthy Australian businesswomen, he was told to imagine life as a stove with four stove tops, representing a) family b) friends c) work d) health. In order to be successful, you turn off one, and to be *really* successful, you turn off two. Well, I think ACoNs only have three stove tops, and I feel like I turned off two. I sacrificed my mental health and (possibly related) my social life/support system, but I did something *I never thought I could do before.* I went into the last two years of college thinking that I would drop out, I wouldn't be able to handle driving 30 minutes every day and taking labs and hard sciences, and it was comforting in a way, but also scary, which led me to do the opposite of drop out: channel resentment into doing something constructive.

Anyway, I just wanted to write this out to people who might care. Those 2.5 years were hellish, and though, on principle, I don't regret a thing (on principle!!!), I also don't think I would have done it if I had known the road that laid ahead. I want to remain positive about this, and I want to look back on this experience in the future as my most formative years, the years that made me into a man. I reject any sort of negative thought spirals that lead to regret.

I guess my point is: if there's this big, hairy challenge in your life that you think you're not capable of, put yourself in a sink-or-swim type situation and will success into reality. Just reach into the ether with both hands, grab the version of yourself that you want to make real by the throat, and strangle it into existence.

Now, at almost 23 (my birthday is August 11), all I want is to travel, move to a city, make a bunch of new friends, and start a band. I want to spend the next few years of my life (while I still have hair) just taking it easy and blossoming before I decide on my next step in life (be it academic or otherwise -- I'm hoping a high GPA matters for grad school, if not for the workforce).

Anyway, thank you guys so much. This chapter in my life is coming to a close and I'm so happy to finally have freedom. I can go anywhere, do anything. My mom and I knew my dad had a personality disorder, but it was something that we were vaguely uncomfortable with and didn't fully acknowledge until I found this subreddit years ago. Changed our lives. 

Thanks."

Sorry, I'm on mobile. 

I've been on the ""watching from afar"" end of VR for the year or so. I always thought it looked like a ton of fun, like ""this is what VR is supposed to be.""  I'm an intern and a college student, I make enough money as a student to care for myself but I still worry about finances and whatnot.

Through a series of crazy luck, I got my hands on a GTX 1080 a month ago, and suddenly VR seems like a real option for me. SteamVR gave my PC an 11 ranking. I watched LGR's review of the Vive, where he loved it! Watching him play Project: Cars with the steering wheel looked like a fantasy come true for me.

Well, here in Manhattan, I found a Vive being sold from my local GameStop. I thought about if for a week, then went inside and dropped the cash and bought it. I have my time to think about returning it, but if I open it, I can't return it unless something is broken they said. 

Then I saw his LGR's video afterwards, where he spent a lot of time pointing out just how lacking the Vive library is. My brother, who works in the consumer/tech industry rather high up, started taking about how ""we don't know which one will be here to stay.""  I saw that there's the Oculus, the Vive, the Hydra, Microsoft's, and a million others. No real games have been developed for it yet. All of my old teamspeak buddies say they'd rather wait until the next generation or for a ""real game"" to come out.

At the same time, I am excited. I see Dolphin VR and I want to try all these old games in a new way! I want to try Job Simulator and fuck around for hours. I want to mod GTA and Fallout and see if I can get them running. I want to get motion sickness from VR for the first time. I want to show my friends back in Ohio just what VR can do. I want to play Dirt: Rally and Truck Sims, even though I don't have a wheel—which I probably won't be able to get for a while since I'm buying this :P

But it's expensive. It's not a certain future. It might be a paperweight in a year if another headset beats it.

I just worry so much about wasting my money.

You guys have made the jump—are you optimistic about the real future with this first-edition Vive?"

4v15lr,0,2016-07-28,Question about getting a Masters degree.,MelosMojo,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/4v15lr/question_about_getting_a_masters_degree/,"Hi guys,

So I am on track to graduate in Spring 2017 with a Bachelors in Industrial and Systems Engineering from a top 15 public school in the US. I am unsure if it would be worthwhile for me to go for the Masters program here or not. The undergrad program has given me a solid foundation in math, statistics, programming, and operations research. Ideally, I would get a job in data science right after graduation but I don't know if I have enough experience. What I DO have on my resume, however, is an assistant research position at my school's Center for Applied Optimization (the CAO is an office within the ISE dept.) and I am currently spending my summer as a Business Development intern at a major materials supplier. A little bit of background on these two things:

The research: Our project (I work with a PhD student) involves studying the network of Facebook ""Likes"". Basically we have a large, two-column datatable of FB users paired with something that a user liked on FB (this can be websites/links/companies etc - but everything has been converted to integers). I have been calculating the degrees in/out at each node, average path length, clustering coefficients, centrality, etc. of this network all using C#. We want to compare this network to the network of FB friends as well as other social networks. I used SQL pretty extensively in the initial stages when we were figuring out what datatable we wanted to use. I will be receiving a stipend for my work this coming year and we plan on writing a paper and submitting it for publication at our school.

The internship - I am currently writing a C# program (WinForms application in Visual studio) that essentially takes in messy .csv and Excel files, cleans them up, extracts necessary information and outputs that information as a new table into a new/existing Excel file or an Access database file. SQL commands are used but its mainly the basic select and insert statements. There are hundreds of these messy files that I have to process and a lot of them take a different form than the rest, and so developing the cleaning mechanism has been hands down the biggest challenge, but I am making significant progress.

As a side note, I don't know much about python yet, but I plan on learning it and becoming fluent before graduation.

Now that you know what my experience entails, do you guys think it would be worth it to pursue the Masters in Industrial and Systems Engineering at my school? If not, do you think I could get a job in data science fresh after graduation, or would I be better off starting in data analysis/development work and then eventually trying to transition into data science. It's also worth mentioning that I will have $150,000+ in loans and would only consider the Masters program if it would really be worth my time and money. 

tl;dr Getting Bachelors in Industrial and Systems engineering soon with some decent experience but major student loans and I'm wondering if Masters program is worth it for me.

Any help/guidance would be greatly appreciated!"

4v1dgw,3,2016-07-28,My journey starts today.,Burning_Bagels,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4v1dgw/my_journey_starts_today/,"I wasn’t always much of a drinker… 

When I joined the military at 18, things changed. For the first few years I would just drink when I went to house parties on the weekend. Then I deployed to the Middle East and turned 21 amidst my visit. Upon returning to the states I started drinking much more and received a *complementary* DUI a few months later… I was then left with two options, separate at the end of my enlistment, or re-enlist and lose rank.

I chose to separate and use the GI bill to pursue an education. This decision was the best and worst choice of my life, I met my current girlfriend (going on 5 years now), but also fell further into the trap known as alcoholism.

When I separated from the military I moved in with some close friends in Orlando near the UCF area. I you know much about UCF, its party central. I ended up getting a job waiting tables at a nice new restaurant and made a bunch of new friends. These friends also loved to go to bars and host parties that I frequently attended. Since I had the GI bill, I received an additional monthly income and could afford a surplus of alcohol for the house and out at bars. Like an idiot, I occasionally drove home after imbibing, and was lucky to not get caught. After meeting my girlfriend, and living in Orlando for a year, we decided to move away from the city to be closer to family.

After relocating, I quickly found a new job as a bartender. This wasn’t the best decision for me since I was already showing clear signs of alcoholism. Nonetheless, I bartended for a year (while still in school) before I was burned out and quit. I found a new job at a gym, and I was finally living a bit of a healthier life.

Then I got a notice in the mail saying my license was revoked because I did not take the required alcohol counseling. I found a counseling class, but due to the high cost, I chose to start the classes four months later. Unfortunately I had to ride my bike everywhere for those few months, and was taking a full course load at the time. So I ended up biking about 20 miles per day, 4 days per week and was getting in decent shape. However, I also had the brilliant idea of getting some drinks on the way to school so I could get a buzz during class. From that point on, I ended up getting drinks on the way to class until I finished counseling (I also lied to the counselor saying that I quit drinking months before so I could finish sooner).

When I finally had my license reinstated, I started getting my life together by finding an internship and finishing my degree. But I was still drinking moderately after work and more on the weekends. About 6 months into my internship I went home for lunch and had a few beers, and somehow thought it made me more proficient at work. When the beers were no longer enough, I started buying pints of vodka and pouring it into whatever bottle I could conceal it with (Sprite, Gatorade), to bring to work and finish the workday with. This continued up until today, for I am now willing to accept that I have a problem that has been obvious for so long. I always just told myself “I’ll quit drinking once I finish the beers in the fridge”, though I never finished the beers because I kept restocking them when I ran out.

Well, yesterday I had my usual vodka at work and picked up a bit more liquor in the evening since my girlfriend would be home late. When she got home I was a bit toasty and we had an emotional discussion where I admitted that my life is a mess and she was the only thing I even have to live for anymore. That statement was partially true, but mainly influenced by the alcohol. Although she was devastated to hear it, I tried comforting her but my memory of the rest of the night is a bit hazy.

We woke up this morning for the gym as we usually do before work, but I was too hungover and she had to go without me. I couldn’t go back to sleep since my mind occupied, thinking about how disappointed I am in the person I’ve become. After reading numerous relatable experiences this morning, they have influenced me to make a change.

My girlfriend came home from the gym clearly unsettled from last night’s fiasco, and I told her that I am fine and things will get better. I told her that I intend to quit drinking, and that’s a promise that I aim to keep… I now realize that I’m not only hurting myself, I’m also hurting her."

After about 3 months, I was offered a job as a full time therapist working with individuals with special needs and jumped on the opportunity. 

I've been working here for about 2 weeks now and I feel like I've been struggling. I took over a few people who have left caseload. I've met with my clients and I've really struggled to get them to share any of their concerns. When they do they usually tell me they're resolved and they were able to deal with them. I know it takes some time for people to open up to a therapist, so I usually spend the rest of the session learning about them. I know that a lot of the stuff im going to be doing is concrete, such as teaching coping and social skills, but I just feel concerned because it's a decent amount of my clients who all demonstrate this. 

I did some longer timed therapy in my last year internship at a hospital and I felt like that went pretty well. The sessions were longer there, but they always seemed perfectly timed. Here the sessions are shorter and seem like I have too much time. This is a population I have limited time working with and any help or support would be appreciated. I'd like to know that I'm at least on the right track. "

I am 27 male straight middle class white and I have had 4 partners since I been sexually active. All but the most recent one was a long term relationship. This last one we are still talking but she got an internship out of state, and I am moving across country myself, so untill she finishes it will be hard to see each other. Most of the time I have used condoms but the longer relationships there have been lapse in that protection but always mutual. I have never had any symptoms of any STDs that I am aware of or never had a partner tell me. My relationship have been mainly white middle class girls and one Latina not drug users and not promiscuous. 

Last encounter was 7 months ago no condom during oral and no condom during 4 play(interesting the tip maybe 2-3 mins max) then sex was with a condom. No anal and nothing rough just normal stuff. Girl upper middle class Mexican no iv drugs and insisted on condoms. 

Before it gets to long winded when I move I am going to lose my health insurance so I wanted to get a check up. Went to the doc and he asked me the normal questions and he ordered a blood test. He asked if I was sexually active and told him the same story above. He then said I should get a std test while I was already getting my blood taken. I agreed and got the test done. I asked the phlebotomist what my dr ordered she said normal blood test,  a hep panel, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis test but no HPV, no Hiv or herpes test. 

I called the drs office and asked why he didn't include those and he said that hpv isn't tested on guys(just warts show up and they make the diagnosis from there), herpes isn't usually tested and asked if I experienced anything like herpes. My answer was no.. Then I ask about HIV and he said from what I was explaining to him about my past and being in a heterosexual relationship and never done drugs or the girls never have them my chances are very slim.

Do you agree with the Dr? Reading this sub I have kind of come to the conclusion that he is correct from some of the answers but just checking."
4v1l1j,2,2016-07-28,Possibly bad internship experience - How will this affect my career?,nothingto1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4v1l1j/possibly_bad_internship_experience_how_will_this/,"I am a junior still studying in college.

Currently, I am interning at a pretty large industrial company (one of the largest), and I applied for their leadership program in IT. Being a leadership program, I was expecting something with coordination or helping someone higher up than me manage their project, but instead was put into an IT Project Manager role for a pretty large project from the get-go (Possibly understaffed at the moment? Interns usually don't get this role... especially on projects that are expected to make 1m+). I've been getting very minimal help and have had to deal with the usual corporate bullshit, forms, security and etc for this project with little to no help and generally everything else a project manager has to do, at the age of 20. I think it's unfair, especially being put into this role coming from a CS background without any help or prior experience, but I went through and have actually in my own opinion surprisingly done well so far. I progressed the project which was already a month behind, and in the process of getting development started, but I have doubts as to whether many things can even be done in time. I leave in 3 weeks but the project has about a month and a half left before release so I have to hand off to someone else. I asked my manager and he said I was doing really well, but considering there are many huge roadblocks that will come up soon that might delay which are out of my control (our business manager for this project is on vacation for a month...., this application has absolute shit documentation, architecture control, etc) so there are no information and many things undefined that needs to be done with security reviews that are simply out of my control, and I do not have info to, but I don't think my manager really would understand. I am just an intern, but I don't think she understands the level of stress and difficulty I am going through, and while she thought i was doing well 2 weeks ago (I have 3 weeks left now), i'm not sure how she will review me at the end... Although this is not confirmed and based on suspicion. I feel like I am honestly doing the best I can for coming in not knowing anything and with murky requirements, but I'm not sure if the future roadblocks and delays will give me a bad review even though everything before that i've done well. 

So to conclude, I am intending on definitely putting this on my resume as this is role I took was critical to my career in the future (I do intend to go from Software engineering to project manager or something similar down the line), but not sure if a possibly bad review will matter much. If applying to software engineering roles and mentioning this internship, I can definitely pull out thousands of things I've learned and accomplished, but ultimately, project is not in a good spot and its out of my control, so I'm not sure if that affects anything (do companies do background checks on this?). Also considering i'm looking for software engineering internships/jobs in the future, this wouldn't matter much either right? 

I just wish I wasn't treated like an experienced project manager while an intern. If this is not the right sub-reddit, i apologize, im a CS major and future software-engineer prospect so I thought I would ask here. 

Thank you!"
4v1slr,4,2016-07-28,I failed to get an Internship and need advice.,cscareertoss,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4v1slr/i_failed_to_get_an_internship_and_need_advice/,"Throwaway account.

I switched in to computer science my junior year. I was formerly in the Army ROTC program (on national scholarship) with a different major. I gave back the scholarship and dropped ROTC once I took CS I to purse a programming career. I will be graduating a semester late due to this (December), so I will be on the market for a full time job soon. I figure that because I was unable to get an internship, I am doing something wrong and that you guys might be able to help me. 

I go to a medium sized state university. I have a 3.9 overall GPA and received an A in every CS course I have taken. I work tutoring students in computer science through the university and also work a weekend help lab for CS I and II through the CS department. My resume has been looked at and edited through my university career services.

At the start of my senior year, I started looking for internships (wanted to get a head start, right?). I was targeting the Raleigh/Durham area, but did not limit myself and have tried out of state options. I went to a huge career fair at a prominent university and talked to/submitted my resume to at least 20 companies. No response. I spend the rest of the school year submitting my resume to companies, probably 25-30 overall. I only received one interview, but it was through the school and everyone got one. I did not make it past the first round. I went to another career fair in the Spring, which I also submitted about 15-20 resumes to and did not get any responses from.

I honestly did not expect it to be this hard and thought that I would be a top prospect. However, when the mid Spring semester rolled around I started to get extremely discouraged. It really hurt my self esteem and has me worried about my prospects as a programmer. 

Nobody that I have asked can tell me anything that I am doing wrong, other than the ""follow up more"" advice. I am admittedly not great at getting past the nerves to follow up, but I have pushed myself to do it on many occasions and still gotten no response (phone calls and emails). Projects are the other main thing I can think of here: I have very little outside of class programming work, because I have been swamped trying to catch up with this major. I am currently working on open source work to try and patch up this gap.

Only one more thing stands out to me, but it seems like an excuse in my head. I share the same exact name as my father, who is a registered sex offender. He shows up first on google when you search my name. I don't know if this matters, but I figured someone on this subreddit might know.

Anyway, thanks for reading. I am sorry if I sound like a complainer or ""woe is me,"" I am just expressing what I feel because I have had no other answers or input and the real deal is coming up for me. I am excited to hear what constructive advice you guys might have for me."

I love it all and has somewhat got me curious of obtaining my RD licensure to go with my master's in a few years so that way I can hopefully run my own business where I can fill both shoes of training and being an RD. I know sports nutrition jobs are very difficult, but i feel like my expertise in resistance training etc. may make that a possibility b/c I am in love with sports nutrition.

I'm just curious on what steps I'd have to go through to get the verification statement so I can apply for an internship. I'll definitely talk to my professors at school, but curious if anybody became an RD when they went a separate route in undergrad.

The parts are re-stocked every 3 days, so I need to know how much of the part to stock for 3 days. I have some ideas on how to do this but I was wondering if any of the people on this reddit are familiar with minitab and how to make slider graphs.
Example; assume that I have a part that is needed 2 times over a 3 day period. let's say the mean usage is 10 and the standard deviation is 2. assuming that the population of quantity used is normally (or approximately normally) distributed, then the number 14 (mean + 2*std) would be sufficient for 97.5% of the repairs. so let's say I want to stock 28 to be somewhat guaranteed that I have enough. the question is, is this sufficient for 90% of the time for those 2 repairs to be satisfied? Is it too much, and can we stock less? I know that we can look at probabilites based on an example number, but I don't know how to calculate the overall probability of 28 being sufficient. would it just be (.975)2? if that's the case, how can I calculate the amount needed so that the probability would be 90% for both repairs to be satisfied?
If the problem needs more clarification I can do my best but it's a hard problem to state in writing, to be honest. 

Edit: I want to make probability distribution plots in minitab essentially but to where I can slide the x value and it will change the graph. is this possible using wolfram? 
Edit2: kind of like this; http://mathlets.org/javascript/build/probDistrib.html but where I can choose different means and standard deviations as I like, since this is kind of limited"

4v2cav,17,2016-07-28,[Story] How playing video games helped me achieve my dream of getting a job in silicon valley,LoopsCode,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/4v2cav/story_how_playing_video_games_helped_me_achieve/,"This is a story on how TF2 got me a job in Silicon Valley, the place of my dreams to begin my career as a fresh new computer engineering grad. 

_________

This story started two years ago, when I was invited to sub as a Soldier in a UGC Silver Highlander team from a friend, his name Borat, I met in TF2Center. We played a few games while we chatted in Mumble, and in the first few games, we clicked pretty well. A few days later, this friend asked if I was interested in joining their team full-time as their main soldier for the upcoming season. I first hesitated, but eventually agreed because I thought the dudes were all very swell. 

Fast forward a few months, we were deep into the weekly games. Our team didn't have the best DM, or the best players, or even the best strats, but gosh darn, we had team work and good vibes. The group of guys were just great people that encouraged each other when things went south, and in general, made the sometimes-toxic UGC environment tolerable, and even fun!

Speaking of toxicity, this is how the story *really* started. 

As you all know, some teams would bring in unregistered ringers (often times higher skill divisions than what the current team is), imposters with the same name and display picture (played by a higher level player), or sometimes, the team leader just doesn't know it's against the rules. Prior to a match, there isn't much time to actually check one-by-one whether the player on the team is really who they say they are, or whether they're in the official roster. My team leader, let's call him Messiah, knew that I was a software developer. He is also one. He expressed to me his frustration, and it clicked to me that maybe I should try to take a stab at solving this problem.

A few weeks later, the UGC Roster Verification tool (now offline) was born. Initially, only the players in the team used it. After awhile, I started sharing it on /r/tf2, /r/truetf2, the UGC forums, TF2Center forums, and more, and it kinda blew up. I recall over 1000 unique players used it, and for a kid like me, that was pretty insane. Hearing people's thoughts on the tool prompted me to learn to gather user feedback, test for bugs, and ultimately implement new features to it. This was a great feeling, and it really trained me to become a better software and product developer.

Fast forward a few more months, the team sort of disbanded because we all had real life responsibilities to attend to (although no worries, we all shoot the shit on our Slack channel on a daily basis). I was talking to Messiah how I was graduating soon in June 2016, and whether he has any tips for me for job search.

Little did I know, Messiah, who I absolutely admire because he is *also* the main dev of a Steam based website, works in a company in Silicon Valley. I was absolutely flabbergasted. Recall, I've known him for around a year and a half by now, and this is the first time I knew about this. He keeps it very low key, a hint to his character. He asked me if I was interested in his company, which is conveniently located in the center of Silicon Valley. 

Am I interested? *Am I??* My life long dream has been to work in Silicon Valley. I think interested was an understatement. I was more like - ***fuck yes I am***! 

I honestly tried to apply for internships in this area all five years of my college career, with no luck each time. Being able to begin my career in the Valley would actually fulfill a long-time dream of mine.

Messiah put in a good word for me to the CEO of the company knowing what I did with the UGC Roster Verifier tool (and our fun technical discussions on coding and tech in Slack/Mumble), and I scheduled my first call with them. 

One call led to another technical call. Then a third culture call. Then finally, I was invited to their office in the Valley for a full day of on-site interviews. I flew over from the East coast; everything was paid for. Was I nervous? Goddamn I was. At this point, I was rejected by a few companies already, and morale was at a new low. 

I arrived at their office a few weeks later in beautiful California. I went through the rounds of interviews starting at 9 AM. After the seven and a half hours of interviews, of testing me everything from algorithms, data structures, building simple apps, asking me questions about design/UX/UI, career motivations, culture fit questions, and more, it was over. I was emotionally/physically/mentally exhausted, but I felt good. I even got to meet Messiah in person for the first time in two years, and he gave me a TF2 shirt. Even after meeting him in person, I still can't put a face to his voice from Mumble. It's just too unreal.

After I flew home, I went through one more phone technical interview with them, just to get more data. Considering they are a data analytics company, that made a lot of sense. 

So after around 11+ combined hours of interviews, one day, my now-boss called me to extend me an offer. It was my first offer, from a company of my dreams, and after all those rejections! I don't think happiness described it. After literally nine months of rejections after rejections, of reviewing those excruciating data structures and algorithms questions (which takes time away from me from developing great applications), of waking up knowing I *still* don't have a job while friends around me were getting offers - it was finally over. It actually took me three days to fully process the mental load that it's over. 

I achieved my dream, but I didn't do it alone. Playing TF2 actually helped me achieve my dream. Thank you Messiah, Borat, and the rest of the team for being such good people. I honestly can say I couldn't have done it without them! 

____________

So this is my story of how TF2 helped me achieved my dream of getting a job in Silicon Valley. 

The lesson I learned is - just be a good person. Be a good person even under the veil of anonymity. You don't know when it will bite you in the butt, or when it will literally help you achieve your dreams. Just do it!

My relationship has had is bumpy patches, but we've manged to make it four years.
Long story short, my family doesn't like him, and they have been open about that. They think he is lazy, which he has been. While I've been finishing up undergrad and starting grad school. He dropped out of undergrad bc of grades bc he quit going to class and for the past three years has been living off the support of his mother and myself. 

But, besides all of this. I believed he would get his shit together, and I'm proud to say that he has. In May, he finally got a good job doing some computer programming--what he was going to school for--and he is making good money. Naturally the years in between have been rough for us. I think I built up a lot of resentment towards him, and he has always complained of me being distant. But, with his job I was ready to start thinking of a serious future with him and so was he. 

However, I am spending my summer out of state for an internship while he is back home working. Communication has been a little rough. I've been lonely and wanting to talk more while he's been busy working. He also reconnected with an old friend who is a bartender and made friends with all the other bartenders. He goes there every night and they give him free drinks on their spill tab. 
I have been really happy he has made friends, because those three years of him doing nothing were mainly because he was suffering from depression and anxiety. He needed good friends, so every time he would tell me about them I was super supportive. 

I'll be home in two weeks, and so I've been looking forward to coming home to a boyfriend who is supporting himself and has a great social life too. But, earlier this week I got a text from our neighbor, whom I'm good friends with, saying that she saw him walking to the bar with a girl that looked similar to me. But, he had already notified me of her (I'll call her Jen) and that he was letting her park at our house and walking with Jen to the bar. My boyfriend has never had a problem with honesty. Actually, I'm the one in our relationship with a track record for omitting things..but neither of us has ever cheated.

I told my neighbor I already knew, and she said she was relieved. 

Next day: I get another text from my neighbor saying Jen has slept over, and my boyfriend didn't mention it a all.  I immediately freak out. 1. Because he has always been so honest with me  &amp; 2. Because he had been extremely distant with me, and we had actually had a conversation where he said he wasn't sure if he was happier without me or because he had a job.

I send him a few very immature texts. 
""I hope Jen was comfortable at your house.""
""Do you like her big brown eyes and dark hair?"" 
""I knew you were unhappy with me but Jesus Christ, break up with me if you want to fuck her.""

I know I overreacted. I'm super ashamed of myself. I'm not normally so reactionary. It just all made sense to me immediately..

Anyway, We get into this huge fight. He admitted to her sleeping over, but he said that his male friend slept there two and they both slept on the couch after a long night of drinking and binge watching Stranger Things. He also eventually apologized for not texting me, but he had ""fell asleep.""  And he was really angry with me for immediately accusing him of cheating. 
We both said some really hateful things to each other during this argument, but we both stepped away for a bit and were able to apologize to each other, and I chose to believe it was innocent.  

Next Day:
We text throughout the day causally. That night, he tells me Jen parked at his house again and he walked with her to the bar, but there were no plans on her returning for the night. As the night proceeds, however, it was really stormy so she and her friend do sleep on his couches again. But he tells me. 

The next day around 1pm my neighbor sends me a snapchat and text of Jen leaving.
So I text him if Jen was still there. He said he didn't know because he hadn't left his room all morning because he is hungover, but he doubts it. So then I say yeah, ___ said she just left. 
He gets furious. 
He says he feels like he is being spied on, which I understand. 
But, he eventually calms down and apologizes for snapping at me when I was just asking. 

A few hours later. I opened the snap from my neighbor. The caption said that she had an overnight bag. Sure enough the the girl has two backpacks on her shoulders. 

So I send another text. Now, I'm currently a mess. I felt absolutely crazy. ""Why did Jen have an overnight bag?""
He is livid, and claims she uses two backpacks as a purse.

I text my neighbor that I'm taking myself out of the situation and not to update me anymore. 
and then I text him something similar. I don't want to know anything about their friendship until I get back home. I want just two weeks of peace. I don't want to hear her name, what their doing. Anything. And I don't care if it sounds crazy because I feel like I'm going crazy. 

He is still angry. Saying things like ""Now I am just finding petty things to be angry over."" ""He didn't do anything wrong, but he is being treating like a criminal."" And he finally says that he is just going to freeze her out. 
I tell him not to do that. That if he does, he would resent me for it. He can still be her friend. If anything just stop letting her sleepover. He responds that he is almost 27 years old and that if he has a drunk friend, he will let them crash on his couch instead of driving because that's the responsible, adult thing.

But, we eventually cool off and he agrees to give me my ""peace.""

Today: I am still losing my mind. My gut tells me he is lying. I don't know why. Not to mention my neighbor also said she never saw any other person there. Not his male friend or Jen's friend.

So I'm stalking her twitter... even though I know I need to keep my mind off it, I can't... when I see she tweeted ""Me and (my boyfriend's name) binge watched Stranger Things.. I'm so fucked up right now.""  

Interesting.

Why didn't she mention her co-worker and my boyfriend's friend who he swore was there?

I texted him asking again. And of course he is fucking angry. 

But I'm losing my mind. What is going on?! Is he really lying to me about this? Or am I just going insane. Okay. I know I'm going insane, but I don't know. Someone please. Give me your input. 

---   
TL;DR!  My boyfriend has allowed a girl I don't know to sleep over at his house twice while I'm out of state, saying she slept on the couch, but I feel like I'm finding holes in his story, and he keeps getting angry every time I bring it up. Help!"

Additionally, how would one format such an e-mail? I'm guessing it's not quite a cover letter, but should generate some interest in you. This is what I have so far:

&gt;Dear Sir or Madam,
&gt;
&gt;My name is [FIRST NAME] [LAST NAME] and I am a recent graduate of [COLLEGE], where I majored in Computer Information Systems. Though my academic career focused on technology, I am very interested in exploring the possibility of an internship or entry-level position at [COMPANY] in order to start my career in finance.
&gt;
&gt;As previously mentioned, my focus has been on technology, but I recognized early on that by itself technology was not of much use and it was only at its best when applied to a specific discipline. Thus, leading me on the path to learning about and building tools that were of relevance to finance. This choice has proven to be an exciting one, with each project being more challenging than the last.  I believe that an internship at [COMPANY] would not only provide a challenge that is worthwhile, but one that can aid me in better understanding the financial environment.       
&gt;   
&gt;To provide you with further information about my academic and professional experience I have attached a copy of my resume. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss my qualification with you and learn more about [COMPANY] at your earliest convenience. I can be reached at [PHONE] or via e-mail at [email]. I understand that you may be reviewing numerous other applications and would to take the time to thank you for any consideration
 

Any suggestions?"
4v2rm2,2,2016-07-28,Situation at my job. Drama and getting tired of dealing with customer service.,former_anachronism,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4v2rm2/situation_at_my_job_drama_and_getting_tired_of/,"Hi all,

If this is not the right place to post this, let me know, I'll delete and move somewhere else.

I've been at my job for about 6 months. In that time I've had to deal with really difficult management. I feel as though my immediate manager (who started when I  did) is disorganized, overstressed, and does not act like a manager. There was a lot of drama about one of my co workers who was verbally abusive to another co worker and came to work high a lot. When i told the facility manager (my managers manager) she said to me ""it would have been as much your fault if she did something as hers because you didn't tell us"". After I had just told them... They also have a habit of (in my opinion) overworking their staff. A part time employee has been consistently working 38-40 hours while the manager handle ever hits 40. My department (customer service) seems to get blamed for everything in the facility and I regularly get yelled/snapped at by the facility manager who changes the way things are ""supposed"" to be done regularly.


My position is customer service in a pet boarding place. I like the job because I get to be around animals but I've found that working with the public is becoming more and more difficult. Especially here where is something goes wrong in the back (a dog didn't get a certain playtime or if a morning person put something into our software incorrectly) I get cursed out by the customer. I'm tired of people being annoyed with me or being rude about something that's out of my control. I know that's part of the job but I've worked with the public in all my other jobs and it's just felt different. Maybe I'm burnt out. I already have depression and anxiety issues, but I'm such an empathetic person that I'm really good at customer service. It's just an odd/shitty situation. 

This is just a temporary thing. I'm trying to get into a master's program, but that may not be for another year. I just graduated college in December. I'm currently doing an internship as well in my field of study (anthropology). 

I guess what I'm asking advice for is if I should stay in this job or not. If I do, what can I do to deal with the public and not be so sensitive to their rudeness? How can I deal with the difficult management? If I should leave this job what would be something I could do that doesn't deal so much with angry customers? 

Thanks y'all."

I only saw maybe two or three listings out of several hundreds which I thought I might have a chance at.


For one, I never really did any personal project(I like programming, but I have many interests besides this and after spending 40-50hrs on coursework a week I'd rather spend time on other things than programming..), which a lot of the listings aimed at entry-level jobs seem so to freaking love mentioning. Secondly, I don't have any experience besides being a 
teaching assistant for one semester and never did any internships. (However internships are fairly rare in my country unless you are a master degree student, I only know 2 in my class who has an internship now..). 


Now this semester is gonna be really busy, and on top of getting full credits I also need to re-take operating systems which I failed...I feel a bit overwhelmed.  I have to pass my classes, apply for jobs, study for interviews so i dont fail them, and do my part time job.


What I really wanna know, what can I do this last semester to make myself a bit more employable ? Learn new technologies, languages etc? Focus more on preparing for job interviews? One semester away from graduation and all I feel I  can offer is having good grades. I don't feel like anywhere near a competent programmer at least, so all my subjects in last semester are programming subjects.. I just wanna make sure I spend these last few months making sure I don't end up jobless after I graduate."

I'm an ISyE freshman coming in with a few extra credits, and with careful planning, I can finish with two minors in computing and people and scientific and engineering computing (I'm genuinely interested in pursuing these subjects), and still have 7 class spots. I've already had two internships this summer, and plan to obtain more, as well as do research, and go for an international internship or experience during my final summer. 

What I'm wondering, is in these class spots, is it worth it go for some certificates? I was looking at pursuing some of my interests in the IAC, such as foreign language, HTS, or LMC, or business certificates, such as analytics or IT management. I know that pursuing research and work experience are better options, but since I can do both along with the extra classes, what would be recommended? Thanks!"

4v3a7n,2,2016-07-28,Is a degree in accounting minor important?,gabiande,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/4v3a7n/is_a_degree_in_accounting_minor_important/,"Hi! 
I am currently a rising senior majoring in Economics. 

I couldn't get into accounting minor because of my poor grades in two calculus classes. However, I recently found out that I can take another two calculus courses to replace my grades, and if I do well in them I will be able to get admitted into accounting minor. 

However, taking two more classes means I will have to take one more quarter, and I won't graduate until Fall 2017. But at the same time, having one extra summer also gives me a chance to intern one more time.

So my question is, should I spend one more quarter to retake two math classes so I can get a accounting minor degree? It is necessary/helpful when finding a job (particularly in tax)? I will have all my required education credits for CPA exam done by the time I graduate.

Thanks everyone!"

Being divorced has given me a new perspective on my life and I realize that more than needing a job, I need a career. I need to know that I, myself, can provide for my child. While I love being a SAHM and being a caretaker for my family and would love to do it again one day, I know that is not the best thing for my son. I cannot rely on another man that is not his father to provide for me and him. I need to do it myself. Which means I need a career. I don't need a job, I need a career that will grow and allow me to provide for him equally along with his dad (my ex).

In my previous life I was in restaurant management, and while I enjoyed it at the time, working nights and weekends and busy holidays just plain sucks. So I don't want to go back to that. I pretty much did that until the day I gave birth and was a SAHM ever since. That's my job experience. But I am a leader. I work hard. I am detail oriented and smart.

I started studying to take the LSAT but then I started to read advice about the best way to do it and the overall message is ""DON'T"". Which scares me! So I started to look into coding and going to a developer bootcamp. I've always loved computers and while I don't know the languages, I am probably more technical than the average woman and I've always been curious about this field. But the cost of a boot camp is close to $20K (sounds ridiculous to say that given I'm considering law school...I know!).
The issue is that time is not on my side. I'm 36-years old and have a 7-year old son. My alimony ends in 28 months. My clock is ticking. I have the time now to spend in school all day, learning a trade or degree. I don't have the time to work an internship for the summer to see if this is a field I'll really like. I don't have the time to try one thing and if it doesn't work then try something else.

I don't want to be a disappointment to my son, or myself. I don't want to be a leech on my ex-husband. I don't want to find a new husband because it's an easy out. The next 5 years of my life is going to pass and I want to know that the decision I make today is a good one.

I need help. I need guidance. I need someone to ask me the right questions so I can hear what my conscience is saying to me.
TLDR: SAHM wants to go to Law School or coding school. Deadline is 5 years. Which direction do I go?"

Project info is in the readme, but I'll give a quick rundown here for people who are skimming. Basically the project uses a recipe website API to grab a recipe for you (either completely at random or based on particular ingredients which you can input). It can then make a shopping list for you. This was my first experience with writing a GUI in python, but I found PyQt5 to be pretty easy to use.

The goal was to have a personal project that I could use on resumes for internships and such (I'm in school for CS currently), as well as something my roommates and I could use if we needed some inspiration.

Anway, feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

- I just graduated in May from UC Merced (10 year old school so still new, but I would still say somewhat rigorous because they're trying to match the rigor of their fellow UC sister schools) with a 2.94 GPA in Mechanical Engineering. (Used to be above 3.0 but I took a large course load my final year to graduate in 4 yrs as opposed to 4.5-5 and took a hit grades-wise)

- I worked as an intern at a global HVAC company in Minneapolis last summer. Most of my work was data analysis but that required condensing a lot of data. It was there that I first started to learn to program. I learned VBA on my work time to create a script to condense the data much quicker than I would manually. Impressed my supervisor as it wasn't really my job to do that. 

- Since then, I've learned a bit in some other languages. I took a MATLAB course and have used it extensively for the courses for my degree. I've been learning some Swift in my free time (I wanted to create a bus app for my former school's bus system and I'm still working on it but job apps have taken priority as of now). I've also learned a but of FORTRAN but I don't really use it anymore. I think I get the basics of coding which allows me to transition languages somewhat quickly but I'm still very raw when it comes to more advanced stuff

- Pretty strong understanding of math courses like linear algebra, calculus (multi-var and such), probability and statistics, numerical analysis. My grades ranged from As to Cs, but I think my understanding is strong because I reinforced a lot of that math in my engineering courses. 


Overall, I want to do this because I've really grown an interest in CS recently and I've been stuck at the crossroads of whether I should start over and go back to school for it, or start my career in ME, which I've grown less fond of recently. I've been mostly applying to jobs that have allowed me to combine the two subjects such as controls, or more programming related ME jobs. I believe this program would allow me to get a job in ME while still getting the chance to learn CS. I think I can balance it and thrive in both but I also feel like certain factors hurt my chances (limited CS experience, small non-prestigious school, slightly lower than 3.0 GPA). What do you guys think? I also saw that they hire a lot of working professionals so if I go for it, should I push off the application closer to the deadline to see if I get a job before then that I can add to the app? "

My friend (21M) decided that it would be a good idea to contact a firm on my behalf  and without my knowledge to ask about an internship for me. I had talked to him about how I was thinking about emailing them to see if they had any openings. I never would have guessed that he would do something so foolish and unprofessional as to contect them for me.

He forwarded their conversation to me and it seems the two people responding tried to keep things factual, but it was easy to see that they were baffled. I really want the internship, but I'm not quite sure how to go about repairing the damage caused. I know that I need to explain the situation, apologize, and maintain professionalism from now on, but how far is too far? I don't want to throw my friend under the bus and look like a horrible person. So how can I express my shock and regret without worsening the situation? Should I respond to both people who sent replies to his message, or choose one and stick just with them? It apprears that one responder has a more senior position than the other.

If it turns out that this situation is irreparable, how can I bow out gracefully?

Finally, how tough on my friend should I be so that this doesn't ever happen again? What he did was extrememly inappropriate, but I don't want to come off as so angry he won't listen to me.

I guess it when it comes down it, I have a general idea of steps I need to take, but this kind of situation requires finesse and I'm not so good with that."

It will be sticked, probably forever, so, if you actually read this right now, this is how it all starts.   


Soo, i think i should begin with myself, since this subreddit is primarily about me:  
My name is Alex, i currently live Tübingen, Southwest Germany. I was born March 1996 in the german town Bergisch Gladbach, and shortly after my parents moved to Cape Coral, Florida, where i spend the first few years of my life.  
That itself is not very interesting, but for me it was a wonderful time, the atmossphere, the american lifestyle, and almost always sunshine. The best part though, was that my parents took to Cape Canaveral. Not just once, but very often. Of the first visits i have any memory of, was that in January 2003. It was the (last) launch of Space Shuttle Columbia. The launch itself wasn´t very different than the ones before or after, but the following accident made that one stick with me until today.  
But of course, its not just Columbia that i remember, everything at KSC was aww inspiring for me. Standing right below a Saturn V
booster really makes you feel small.  
Back then was when i first started thinking about space, not just a far away thing, something from movies or books, but as something i actually wanted to go to.  Now of course, its the typical kids dream of becoming an astronaut, but for me it was not the adventure or action that interested me, but the idea of seeing things nobody else has, going places no human ever was before.  To this day i cannot imagine anything more relaxing than floating at the large window and looking down on earth, as it passes by so fast.


Not much happend the following years, i went to the pelican elementary school for 3 years, before my parents moved back to germany, and i with them. Since i was raised bilingual (german only at home, outside always english) it wasn´t that hard to fit in here, but the thing i missed most right before sunshine was the visits to Cape Canaveral. No Cinema, or amusementpark, or holidy can compare to a rocket launch, which you rather feel than hear.   


The idea of being an Astronaut moved to the back of head, mostly because as a teenager there are more pressing matters than your childish dreams. Furthermore, in highschool you realize your grades are not good enough for that. And just, why should they choose you? You would have to be better than all the other tens of thousands of candidates, and there is just no way thats possible. I now realize every other future candidate probably thought the same, and yet we still all applied, hoping not that we are the best, but that everyone else is worse than you are. That mind shift happend just a few years ago, around the age of 17. It may seem stupid to you, but it gave me hope, and for the first time i actually thought it would be possible, not likely, but possible, that i make it into space.  
So, i convinced myself to try it, to become an astronaut. Like, you just walk up to ~~nasa~~ esa, hand over your resume, do some medical tests, do some training, and head into space. Yeah, that was my idea of how it would go down. Luckily i was to young to apply back then. So i stayed in school, but started thinking about it more seriously. To see if i could actually do something like that, i wanted to try something similar. And the cheapest way to feel weightless and go up? Skydiving!    

In 2013 i got my skydiving license, and those jumps were some of the coolest things i did to date. You can´t describe the feeling of your first solo jump, jumping out of a plane, completly alone, and falling towards earth with 150km/h. I have to sadly admit that since 2013, i haven´t done a single jump. Yes, i got my license, 26 jumps, and since then haven´t used it a single time. It is quite emberassing, but i didn´t do it for some reasons:
First, it does cost money. And as a 17 year old, you don´t have a lot of that. Its like your constantly broke. Secondly, there is no dropzone near cologne. the one were i did jump was around 70km away (nevermind that i went there two dozen times, BEFORE i had a car). And lastly, i didn´t see the need the jump anymore. This one might seem weird, but the reason i started it was to get a glimpse of my dream, and since i achieved that, and got my license, i kinda got what i came for. 
Buuut, i do plan on reactivating my license, and doing the 12 jumps per year to keep it valid, maybe it can be useful later, who knows. 

Fast fowards, its May 2014, i finally finished my Abitur. With a 1,8 score its definetly not as good as i wanted, but enough to get me in most NC courses. Unfortunetly, nothing happens. Actually, i don´t do anything. I missed the Wintersemester 2014, without knowing what i am supposed to do. My parents are divorced since 2 years now, and because my mother and i don´t get along very well, i move in with my father, who lives south of bonn, in a small town called Sinzig. Except for occasional jobs, i don´t really do anything important.  
 And so i miss the Summersemester 2015. And Wintersemester 2015. Finally, my Dad threathens to kick me out in the end of 2015. I finally take enroll in a university in Geislingen. I will study Energymanagment now. Not what i actually wanted, and not something that would help me with my plans in any way. I mean, who would need a manager in space? With each day i get less interested (not that i was a lot to begin with), and by May 2016 it finally hits me that i have to do something. 
I cannot afford to lose another year. My vitae already has a giant hole in it, which will be a nightmare to explain, but if i miss the wintersemester deadline, i will have to wait till winter 2017. i would be 21 at that time, and have a 3 year gap since i left school. it would probably ruin any chance i may have left.  So, i get my ass up and start looking online what i should do next.   

A lot of people would say that its stupid to put everything on one card, and study for years just for the slim chance of getting selected. So i looked for something that would grant me a good job on earth, if my space adventure fails. My final choice was Geoscience. As an Geo engineer my job perspectives on earth are quite good, so even if everything fails, it woulnd´t be for nothing.  
 
I also started to think about my next steps. I don´t want to get stuck in a hiatus again, i have to make plans for what I do next. To sum it up, this is my ideal idea of the next 5-8 years:

Starting with my Bachelor WS 2016, i will finish it after 6 Semesters, so in August 2019. I will apply for internships outside of germany, i definetly need foreign experience. After my Bachelor, i will start with an entry position, best case with field work, at a international company, to get both experience and earn some money (yeah that actually needs to be adressed). But not for more than 1 year, so i can return to university for Wintersemester 2020, to begin my Master. I would prefer either Geoscience or Geoecology. But there are other interesting fields, and i still have a few years to decide on that. Fast fowards, its August 2022, i finished my Master of Science, its time to get actually get started.   
 
With my previous experience, internships and good score i expect to find a good position across the globe senior projekt manager for Renewable Energy companies. Analyse locations for Geothermal power plants, oversized Solar parks, city planning. Its still very far ahead, and justz speculation. When i finish my Master i would be 26. Not very young anymore, but still too young to apply (which is kinda good). It gives me the chance to ramp up more experience, get a resume, maybe some recommendations and connections. 30 would be the earliest i should apply, of course provided that there is a process going on.   
But i am confident, that SpaceX will step up its game by then, and the demand for astronauts will be higher than ever. And who would be better to explore Mars than a young Geologist?

Back to the presence. Its Juli 2016, i am almost done will enrolling in Tübingen, and confident that i can start my journey in two month. My actual, real journey, that will probably overspan my entire life. And if i don´t get a room in the dorms, i will buy a sleeping bag in sleep in my car for now. No more excuses, no more delays!

If you read this far, i want to say thank you for your time. And maybe, just maybe, i can convince you to also try, and get the job with the most beautiful view in the world.  

Updates will follow.

This past May I started an internship at a software company of less then 40 people. I end my internship in a month or 20 working days.

I'm a ""Test Automation Specialist"". I started off starting building an Automated test setup for doing functional testing on the REST API in Powershell. I set up a pretty good automated testing setup that is finding bugs .

They are rebuilding the UI right now from the ground up and have a major release at the end of August. Many people are going on vacation so my boss has had me do manual testing. That's right, I am now a button clicker. All I do now is write manual test cases. I can't automate anything because I am doing a regression on the old ui since they changed many parts of the back end(going from monolithic to distributed), and they will scrap the old ui in a couple months. 

How can I make the most of my last 20 days? How screwed am I for becoming a software developer not a QA monkey?

Got an automated testing internship, now it has become a manual testing shit show.

4v3xjt,1,2016-07-28,I [23 M] still miss my ex [25 F] of a year (2 years in relationship) even though I realize that it was not a healthy relationship,MutualisticWaffles,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4v3xjt/i_23_m_still_miss_my_ex_25_f_of_a_year_2_years_in/,"It's been almost a year since my ex and I unofficially broke up (long story) and I still miss her terribly. The part that bothers me is that the relationship was nowhere close to healthy, for either of us. Shouldn't that make this easier?

Background: I meet my ex after accidentally walking in on her eating breakfast while she was staying at a camp office (it just so happened to be a townhouse). We both kind of felt something instantly, it was nice. I was always the kid with no set group of friends, I bounced from group to group, and never felt truly wanted, but it was different now. Within two weeks we were flirting constantly, and in fact I had begun staying in the office with her. Two days before my birthday we made this whole thing “Facebook Official” as it’s called. I can honestly say it was the happiest I had ever been. 

That summer went by super quick and before we knew it I was going back to college 4hrs away! We started the long distance relationship great! We talked for hours every night about nothing just talking to each other, the highlight of my day. This went on for about two months and things started getting rocky. She didn’t like that some of my best friends were girls, and basically told me to cut them out of my life, but honestly I was so in love that didn’t trigger any warnings. So I did… and honestly I hate myself to this day for it, I was never able to mend those relationships fully! But things with my ex and I leveled off, we still talked almost every day but it wasn’t for hours, hell sometimes not even 10 mins. But again so in love it didn’t bother me. 

We maintained this relationship for about another 6 months unchanged. Then summer came and I had gotten an internship in GA, 12 hours away. This was when she decided to lay the bombshell on me that she no longer found me sexually attractive…. The rest of the summer was just sparse texts and a lot of unanswered calls from me, she said she didn’t like small talk or talking about nothing. This one triggered a warning, but I ignored it. Then came the hardest year of my life! It was Senior year of college.

As far as school and friends went it was great. I passed all of my classes became a million times closer to my friends, and had a blast! It was my relationship that made my year hard. My ex and I fought more than we talked. We went almost a week without talking and then I (it was always me never her) did something and then we would argue for an hour then not talk for another week. It got so bad I was punching cinder block walls, chugging whiskey, and banging my head off of anything hard. My friends had started to notice (obviously) and lucky for me they were always there for me! I had stopped loving her about three months prior to graduation. We broke up a week before our 2-year anniversary because she said she couldn’t make the move with me to GA.

So today is her 25th birthday and I find myself missing her more than ever, I’ve missed her since I moved. I realize now what a horrible relationship it was but I am still crying and drinking because I miss her. How do you get over someone you at one-point thought was the one but turned out to be the worst decision you ever made? 

---   
**tl;dr**: I miss terribly my ex of over a year, even though the relationship was terrible and not healthy. How do I get over her?"
4v44hp,17,2016-07-28,(Soon to be) Aeronautical Engineer: Need advice on career direction,Spiah,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/4v44hp/soon_to_be_aeronautical_engineer_need_advice_on/,"Long post, sorry. Here's a TL;DR: Big vs small company. Big company offers career advancement and a chance at ""maybe"" getting amazing job after slogging through 3-5 years of an un-ideal position. Smaller company offers happiness and great career alignment, though it may result in me straying away from ""true"" structural/aero/manufacturing.


I'm currently finishing my final internship at a large aerospace company before I head off to finish my final year of university. I'll start my post by saying, I'm very fortunate to have the issue I'm having. However, it's been a large source of stress for me, as I have a very tough choice to make about my future career. To make this long post easy on the eyes, I'll explain the pros and cons of each option, and then my thoughts comparing the two.


**Company 1:**


Prior to starting at this big company, I worked at a small, albeit quite well known design company in the aerospace industry. Enjoying art and creative ""things"" outside of engineering, this was a really cool fit for me doing design prototyping and interfacing with industrial designers to make concepts real. I spent two summers with the company, and they have seemed very excited and open about the possibility of bringing me back full time. The pay is competitive, and personality wise, I fit in better with small companies. I know I would be (very) happy there.


Pros: 

* Proven to have talent and genuine interest in the work

* Heavy design focus

* Like the people, benefits and facilities

* Behind the scenes, but makes huge impact on aerospace, feels like work ""matters""

* Customer-facing though not so much as the second option

Cons:

* Small company, lack of possibilities for lateral moves, other career directions
* Rather specific role in industry, could see myself shoehorned into a corner career-wise


**Company 2:**


On the other hand, I have spent this summer in production engineering, just to get a taste of the industry from another light. Quite frankly, I was not enjoying it, and planned not to return post-graduation. However, I recently had the opportunity to shadow flight-line production engineers, where they prepare aircraft for test and then delivery. Being very interested in customer-facing jobs and fleet-side engineering/operations, it was an awesome experience. I love learning about aircraft routes, fleet operations and testing, and to literally be able to meet returning aircraft at the gate and address engineering problems on the spot was *amazing*. However, I was told it is rarely a first job for college-graduates. The advice I was given was to initially gain experience in factory-side production (maybe 3-5 years?) and then I might see the opportunity to come to the group arise. This is likely my only chance to get my foot in this door, as the only other place to really do this kind of work is in Toulouse.


Pros:
* Very unique line of work, genuine interest in flight ops/test
* Close to planes every day
* Opportunity for immense career growth, company name recognition
* Chance to work on new aircraft programs
* Customer-facing, cool opportunities for travel, networking

Cons

* More rigid company, not as enjoyable culture
* More stress, and mandatory overtime
* Must work a few years in an un-ideal job just to ""maybe"" get position I want
* Focus on paper-pushing rather than real engineering
* No design aspect (i.e. no CAD used at all)



When it comes down to it, I really don't know what to do. I have the chance to really boost my aerospace career by staying at the big company. I've been told that by staying there I essentially ""pay my dues"" and can find myself able to realistically go anywhere from there (including the smaller company). However, I know I will be the happiest at the smaller company in the long run. Pay and location are basically the same in both cases.


Thoughts, life advice, words of encouragement? I realize that it's very obvious which companies I'm talking about. So, if you have specific advice/notes about the companies in question, please PM me. I appreciate all the advice I can get.

Cross-posting in /r/Accounting and /r/FinancialCareers.//

**TL;DR** I don’t see myself working in Accounting for more than 7 years. I’m interested in Finance and strategic planning. Should I do the 5-year B.S./M.S. in Accounting and get the CPA stamp?



Hi everyone. I'm an international student in NYC. I've just finished the second year of the 5-year B.S./M.S. program in Accounting to qualify for the 150-credit requirement of CPA. I'm in two minds about a career in Accounting versus Finance.

I found out I loved planning and thinking strategically when running my high school club. Regardless of my career choice, I have always loved Math and Excel--two magical tools humans have invented. I studied Math and Excel rigorously in Southeast Asia. When other middle school kids were playing video/computer games, I was learning MS Word, Excel, Photoshop, and CorelDraw at night with adults at a learning center. (I’m a proud nerd.) I'm interested in the markets and world economy as well. I keep up on the news while riding the subway. 

At this point, it sounds like I lean towards Finance. Upon beginning college, I declared a major in Accounting since I'd heard it was recession-proof and Accounting was the business language. In addition, my school didn’t offer a major in Finance, but a Business Management major with a concentration in Finance. I thought a bachelor’s degree in business was worthless, and I’d rather learn something technical. If I could choose again, I would still pick Accounting, Finance, or Computer Science. My liberal arts college doesn’t offer Computer Science. I’ve tacked on an IT minor, but I saved the five IT classes for the last two years. IT has always been appealing to me. My high school IT teacher, who taught me for 3 years, would be glad to hear I was learning more about IT in college.

Anyway, I’ve sincerely enjoyed Intermediate Accounting and Principles of Finance in the class setting, so I’ve become one of the top students in the department. I don't like the Auditing class, but still managed to get an A. 

I did some internal audit in my previous part-time job and in the current Accounting internship. I don't think I can do auditing for long since it gets really tedious. I just sucked it up and never complained about it to anyone. 

I haven't taken any tax courses, but I was a tax volunteer last spring. Though I know preparing basic tax returns for individuals and researching corporate tax is a world different. I've heard corporate tax is more complicated and feels enjoyable when you successfully file a complicated return. I'm not sure if I want a career in tax, but it sounds a little more interesting than auditing.

I’ve read all over Reddit and the Internet that public accounting gets you to see how multiple industries work and opens many doors in the Accounting industry if you stick around long enough, say, 3 years. That’s the only selling point to me.

If choosing Finance, I will have to land a Finance internship next summer and graduate with a B.S. in Accounting in May 2018. I may not be able to do the IT minor with the 4-year program. If going for Accounting, I will try to get a big 4 internship for at least one of the two summers remaining, manage to pass a few CPA sessions in the fifth year, and graduate with a B.S./M.S. degree in Accounting and a minor in IT in May 2019. 

With that said, I'm wondering if I should steer towards Accounting or Finance. I think this Fall semester (third year) is the turning point for me where I have to decide whether to go into Finance or Accounting, since the penultimate-year internship weighs in a lot on the first job out of college and possibly orients the entire career. 

Some people on Reddit have said they get pigeon-holed into certain jobs they hate because X years of experience is the pre-requisite for exit opportunities. I’m young and free now so I will try to soak up all I can learn to make a well-informed decision. I’m trying hard to avoid wasting my most potential years in an unsatisfying career. In addition, I understand the lure of sunk cost fallacy when jumping ship. 


Lastly, my F-1 visa status certainly makes it harder for me to get a job here. I love working in this country due to the professionalism. Unfortunately, the uncertainty of my luck with H-1B working visa will negatively factor in my career planning. I’m not trying to stay in the US at all cost and will be open to relocation to other countries. If necessary, I will come back to a US business school for an MBA.

Thank you for reading my unorganized thoughts laid out on the computer screen. I’m living all by myself in this city. I feel bewildered and desperate for advice. I’d sincerely appreciate any tiny input."
4v4gjw,19,2016-07-28,"Which book/resource to read for using R for, well..., actually statistics?",GMarthe,rstats,https://www.reddit.com/r/rstats/comments/4v4gjw/which_bookresource_to_read_for_using_r_for_well/,"A little background. I am an economist, with a somewhat rich background in econometrics, currently studying statistics at an Uni.
I have recently gotten an internship in web analytics and have since been using R on a daily basis. 

I consider myself pretty fluent in terms of data wrangling, cleaning, variable creation, plotting and etc.

However, a couple of days I had to perform an anova test on many many groups and got stuck really fast on how to get that type of analysis flowing. And, as an avid learner, I got around those problems.

However, that got me thinking that I do not really know the strengths of the R ecosystem as a statistical programming language besides running lm, glm or aov with broom and presenting/discussing those results.

An example just happened right now. Struggling with this feeling I just opened the MASS documentation, and checked that there is a very nice implementation of the generalized least squares method for regression, something that I ~~struggled~~ studied a lot in econometrics that I was unaware existed. Another example is how easy it is to run a Tuckey HSD, which I am familiar with, but did not know it was so easy to run it in R.

So what I am asking is if there is a resource that focus on those strong aspects of the R ecosystem i.e. easy model building/comparing.

**TL;DR:** I use R a lot, but am not aware of the strictly statistical functionalities  of R, Can you point me somewhere?"

1. I officially end my internship on August 15
2. My internship started in May
3. I fly back to school on September 29
4. My current internship is paid




I am a culinary arts student that is interning as a cook at a restaurant - this is part of my school's curriculum. One of my sous chefs asked me if I would stay longer because he likes the way I work. Even though I am flattered that he offered this to me, I am starting to realize that this part of the restaurant industry isn't for me. As a result, I sent an email to a local food R&amp;D company looking for a short internship/shadow at their facility for the remaining time I have before I move back to school. Reason being is because I want to experience other avenues in this business. The problem is they never got back to me, despite all the calls and emails. Should I keep contacting them?




My question is this, should I stay at my internship for a longer time even though I dread going in  now? My Dad told me that I should ask for some time off and just go back to work in September and ask for less hours (My internship has gotten to the point where I am considered more of an employee than an intern). My sous chef said that this wouldn't be a problem. He also said that he understands if I don't want to stay any longer as well.

If you were in my situation, what would you do?"

As a result, I sent an email to a local food R&amp;D company looking for a short internship/shadow at their facility for the remaining time I have before I move back to school. Reason being is because I want to experience other avenues in this business. The problem is they never got back to me, despite all the calls and emails. Should I keep contacting them?




My question is this, should I stay at my internship for a longer time even though I dread going in  now? My Dad told me that I should ask for some time off and just go back to work in September and ask for less hours (My internship has gotten to the point where I am considered more of an employee than an intern). My sous chef said that this wouldn't be a problem. He also said that he understands if I don't want to stay any longer as well.

If you were in my situation, what would you do?"

***
Alright 2 months ago I started a subreddit called getcertified. Basically after a long askreddit comment chain we realized that there were HUNDREDS of sites online that taught many things that could be used to help get people jobs from coding languages, actual languages, design, and even online certifications there's a lot of resources out there to learn basically everything. So we choose to create a subreddit. Since summer school I've gotten a bit off track. But now I want to start working on it. I thought OSU students (like myself) would love this idea since we don't always land an internship every summer and since it's online it's accessible basically everywhere. 

Goal
***
The main goal being that you have multiple people trying to contribute to learning something with tangible goals making it easier for the individual. Every wanted to learn spanish from doulingo or coding from code academy or a class from MIT coursework but it never got anywhere? Basically this subreddit is made for that. And there's not limit. Along as more than 3 people agree a group goal will be set and progress will be handled by me on a wiki or something. So if you ever actually do something you have the documentation, story, and skill for those job interviews. 

Last word's

***
Doesn't matter if your a engineering or a history major. You can always pick something up from these websites like (MIT courses) and be able to put that down on your resume. So come check it out. "

We're both in college, and we both just started working. She works in retail, I intern at an engineering company/office job. She's 19, and I'm 22. We've been together for going on 3 years. She and I have had a hard time seeing each other, because of our unaccepting moms, but we've always managed to make it work and at least talked a lot each day. 

Ever since we both got jobs, I feel like we barely talk. I've tried to tell her this, she says sorry, and how tired she is (she's got some family and health problems), so I understand. 

But I'm starting to feel like we're both letting this relationship slip/she's feeling too comfortable if we keep this up. We've made out most times we see each other, but not as intensely as I'd like. As far as sex, we rarely get the chance, and I can't even remember the last time we had a sexual conversation. Not sure if I'm overthinking this or being needy, but anyone else ever experienced this? I do love her, but I don't know what else to do with this ""distance"". Any advice on how to improve our relationship? I appreciate it! "
4v5nj0,3,2016-07-29,About to graduate this spring with a BA in marketing - Past work experience is haunting me though,PoopSoupOnly,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/4v5nj0/about_to_graduate_this_spring_with_a_ba_in/,"I'm 24 and I have a year left of school. While I'm happy I'm finishing and getting out, I'm pretty scared that I'm not going to find a job based on my past employment. Since I've been 19, the only work experience I've had is in the medical marijuana / i502 recreational cannabis industry here in Washington. My intentions were to make a life long career out of it when I was younger, but for the past few months I've been having a lot of second thoughts.   Although I love what I do, I don't think doing psychical labor all day under HID lights is a great long term plan.

I'd really like to get a professional white collar job once I graduate, but I feel like no one's going to take me serious when I apply. Although it's a legal industry here, there's still a lot of people that are against it. I'm starting to think that my only options are to lie about past work experience, or pretend like I've been unemployed and have been focusing all my time on school the past few years. I really want to move back to the midwest where I'm from after graduation too, but I feel like if I do that I'll even have less of a chance of finding a job (with it being even more taboo out there.) Cost of living here in Seattle is pretty outrageous and I'd like to one day own a house and be closer to my family. I'm starting to feel like it will never happen now because of some bad decision making and choices I made when I was younger. This upcoming fall semester I've got a job on campus as a proctor for students taking online entry level course exams, so that helps my situation a little bit as far as a more respectable job, but I still am pretty worried. I'm also hoping I can land an internship in the beginning of spring to get some professional experience, but again I feel like my resume is pretty screwed and my chances are low against my peers.

TL,DR: Should I lie about work experience, or lie and have a 5 year gap of no employment on my resume, or tell the truth?

4v6l8u,3,2016-07-29,[NeedAdvice] I am depressed and anxious but it is 100% my fault.,epicboar,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/4v6l8u/needadvice_i_am_depressed_and_anxious_but_it_is/,"Hello there people at /r/getdisciplined , I have been lurking here for the past few months and I am proud of what you have and what you are working towards to achieve. I have been going through a lot of shit in the past few years and all of it is because of my attitude. This has led to mild depression and anxiety issues, but I want to be disciplined. Also fuck throwaways, I don't need one.


It was all well until 5th grade where I started to get addicted to masturbation and my performance in academics and the like stooped down pretty bad. I managed to recover during my 10th grade and 12th grade where I managed to bag a decent score, but not as good as my good friends then. Later I started giving competitive exams to bag a decent college but alas, could not keep up with my friends who managed to get into top colleges. But here is the thing, I did not work hard enough, I was cocky, I realized that and I moved on. But this is where things get worse, where I am an asshole, I knew I was all of the above but I never worked toward it.


I was a huge computer and video game addict, I used to be on the computer 5 hours after school and around 7-8 hours during breaks. I never gave attention to people, never appreciated people for the good they did, even my parents. In short, I was truly a scum, an asshole.
This continued so for to my college, for four years, I did not take advantage of situation. I did not participate in any events, no competitions, no debates. I did not do internships, while others did and now have a great job. Meanwhile my friends from high school are way way beyond my reach, being so ambitious. I used to laugh and tease them, but now I am the one repenting.


I am sitting here writing this to you guys right now, I am in a rough situation I want to get out of, and it is 100% my fault, which I am ready to admit. Discipline, as you guys suggest, is about forgiving your past, and concentrating on the present. But my past is so so bad, I don't feel like forgiving myself, I just feel I am destined for mediocrity, because I did not take my chances handed to me. It is because of my cocky attitude that I am here in this situation.


I cannot help but compare myself to others, at one second I feel a bit motivated, the next second I am reminded of my high school friends who are way way ahead in the rat race.
Due to this, whenever I try to do something better for myself I think, ""Why even bother?"".


I have had anxiety issues in the past, now even sometimes I fear that I will not achieve, I will not get a job because I am too late to do anything now, it is a consequence of my past actions
I cant not be too hard on myself, because I deserve this punishment. Others have it so hard in life, they come from horrible backgrounds and make it so far. Me? I was a spoilt brat even at the age I am now, 22.


I am a literal man-child, and would cry when even things go little bit out of my comfort zone. It would mostly manifest into anger. This would hamper my social relations with my peers and my parents. I feel so much guilt what my parents have and had to go through because of me.


These thoughts keep clouding my head, and there is no escape because it is 100% my fault, I deserve it. I am not looking for any sympathy, I just want to be disciplined now in the right way, but I am not able to think coherently, I feel so powerless, I lie on my bed all day.I have stopped enjoying playing games now, I look at people who approach me and think they only want to insult me, I cannot think positive of any situation. I cant even muster the words to appreciate anyone.


I will be moving to the States soon for graduate school, I want to come back, I want to be successful, I want a good job and I want to make it. But these thoughts don't leave me, this guilt doesn't leave me, who am I to feel guilty? I am the asshole here.
I have made similar posts regarding my career here.


You can see form the post the advises given to me, the one at the top tells what it is and is the best advice. I want to improve so bad, but I fear that its too late, I fear that all my effort will not help me get to where I am, I feel that I will underachieve and ultimately go in debt. I feel that I am in no way qualified to complain and deserve to be in this cage.

This post seems suitable for /r/depression or /r/Anxiety , but I know that this is a problem of discipline."

I'm about to enter my senior year of college and my internship is nearly half over already. It has been several weeks of the nine-to-five and I can't believe I'm saying this, but I want the summer to end. Being an only child, I was always given a lot of attention from my loving mom. I did my best to make my dad proud, but it never seemed to be enough. With his constant travelling for work, he wasn't there to see me play youth sports and was only proud when I brought home a trophy...mainly so he had something to display next to his self-made wall of fame.

You...you are my mom's best friend and neighbor and the woman I first ever fantasized about when I first discovered the joys of masturbation. You have a loving husband but over the years, something has been missing in your life. You simply don't know what yet. You and my mom both don't have to work as your husbands bring in more than enough to support the families. You often find yourself lounging around our pool with my mom.

It's Friday around 3 PM. I got off work early and couldn't wait to come home. The truth is I knew you would be over and I could get a glimpse of you in a bikini as you lay out. It's nearly 90 degrees and I cannot wait to jump in the pool. I throw on some trunks and head out to the pool and find [you and my mom reading gossip websites on your tablets](http://cache2.asset-cache.net/gc/178966602-two-women-using-ipads-by-the-pool-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=IWSAsset&amp;k=2&amp;d=EJohqlxhEoMaBN8er34Ev9POnDFgP6zdgsSFBcHKlS3lYW1bQxEjCVEV7u%2FWN6je). We make small talk and my mom excuses herself to go inside for a moment. 

The conversation between you and I continues and we get a little personal. I tell you I am not seeing anyone and you tell me your husband is away on business so you're staying alone. You tell me that you often get scared staying alone and you were thinking about staying at our house for the night since my dad is away on business as well. Soon after my mom comes out and you quickly change the subject. You and my mom excuse yourselves after and I continue to swim alone. I begin think to myself ""was she just trying to tell me something?""  

I swim for a little longer then get on a float and begin to daydream as I cannot get the image of you in your bikini out of my head. I start to wonder just what it is you two are doing inside the house and my fantasy begins to include my mom. I envision the two of you in her room slowly pulling your bikinis off as you lay next to each other and are making out. I begin to doze off and wake up sometime later. The sun is still out but it is time I head back in to the house. I grab my towel and head for the back door...
______________________________________
I will let you decide what happens from there. Do I walk in on you and my mom going at it? Do you go back home and invite me over? Do you spend the night and find a way to sneak to my room/somewhere else in the house? Do we include my mom as well? (if you cannot tell, a kink of mine is definitely incest). We could both play the role of her and direct her based on whose turn it is. You can determine your age in the RP, add more back story to your character, and make any other changes you like.
___________________________________________
I'm pretty open sexually. Some of my other kinks include being dominant, anal, light bondage, deep throat, threesomes, public sex, and age play (18+ only). But I'm open to any and all suggestions. I am looking for long term RP for this. "

We are in a critical moment, since we're both still living with our parents and don't have a stable job. I've been doing a paid internship for the past year while doing translations on the side, but I don't earn enough to move out. She had a couple of full wage jobs but now she's unemployed. She stays home doing house chores ans trying to stay busy but she's the kind of person that really suffers those situations, and this makes her bored and in a bad, bad mood.

This is influencing our relationship, and I feel so helpless and powerless about this situation. I try to cheer her up, and I usually succeed when we're together, but as soon as we part ways she falls back into what I'm starting to think might be depression. I can't stand seeing her like that, she's not the positive, cheerful girl I knew anymore. I want to help her, I want to help **us**, but I don't know where to start. Tomorrow Luckily I'll start my summer holidays until I'll be back at work on Semptember, so I'll soon have much more time to dedicate to her.

One BIG factor is also her delicate health. She's had a few issues lately, most of which concern her lady parts. We've been on a sex break for the past...I don't know, 2 months? And we're really struggling to keep it together. We have the drive, but we can't, and she feels guilty but I know that deep down she blames me as well because before being active with me she didn't have those problems (nothing tragical, but yeast and irritation are driving her nuts). Her last exams are clear, and I'm going to get tested too just to be sure.

I'm worried all these things put together might leave an indelible mark on our relationship. I don't want to give up on us but it's becoming more and more difficult dealing with her moodiness, which is only emphasizing her (and my) flaws.

I don't really know what to expect from a post on the internet, but I need to talk to someone about this.

Thank you for reading.

A little background: I'm mexican, and even though i'm middle class, my family lingers more on middle/lower class, money sometimes comes (in big amounts) and sometimes it doesn't but it didn't use to affect us a lot.


Fast forward I'm 19 y/o and I get my first job (yay!) in a call center (nay! :() things seem to go downhill and my dad wants to buy my sister a phone and doesn't have the money (without telling me), I start looking for people who can sell it to him and when I do find someone (a friend) he tells me that he will pay for it.
The thing is the phone costed 5500 pesos (about 293 dollars) and he just paid 500 pesos (27 dollars) my friend kind of got mad at me because I (dad) wouldn't pay and I ended up paying for the phone.
I know it sound like lol that's a really cheap phone but i actually got paid waaay too little (around 265 dollars a month)

almost like 4 months later he asks me for money because he can't pay the credit card and I lend them the money, but he hasn't paid me back (this was like almost one year ago lol)

They also, wouldn't buy anything for me because ""you have a job, and you have to pay for your own things""

But then I quit in December, I just got tired of working there and I wanted to rest a little bit, but that was a huge mistake, I couldn't find a paid internship until late april and my mom and dad were just awful, they would scream a lot at me and when I would ask them for money the would get really mad at me


Fast forward to july 2016, I'm 20 y/o and now am an Intern, it's a good company, I love what I do and adore my coworkers but pays me like 20 more dollars than my previous job (I really don't care), and my mom just won't shut up about needing money in a passive agressive way, I usually ignore her but she's getting worse, and things got awful last night when my sister bought some jeans this monday but they didnt' fit her (i dont even know why she didn't try them) and seemed really sad, and I found it easy to say ""i can pay for them and use them"", because, well they fit me. I've been asking them how much they cost but they kept telling different amounts (making them more expensive) so last night I asked them for the ticket and they went livid, they kept telling me that I didn't trust them and that I don't love them, but they were almost 10 dollars, cheaper than they were telling them.

So they won't talk to me, calling me cheap and that I'm ungrateful, am I being a bad daughter?

**EDIT:** i'm a girl :)

It might be rambling. Sorry. **To skip the Russian novel of a preface and get to the current violence, jump to where the bolded heading is.**


I'm a guy who has always struggled with low self esteem. When I was in high school I ate my lunch in the bathroom because I was nervous about sitting alone and looking like a loser. In college it improved and I had a very intense relationship with a girl, and had my first kiss and lost my virginity. When that ended, I had a long dry spell, and that's when I met my current girlfriend of 3 years.

I was a senior and she was a freshman. I was her first kiss and she lost her virginity to me. This is a big source of contention because I was her first, but she was not mine. (This often comes up now with fights where she'll say something like ""at least I've never been with other people!"") When I was a senior our relationship was great. When we first began I was very passionate towards her, and would sing her to sleep every night and write poems and devotions to her. In the beginning of our relationship she would often have long bouts of crying because she thought I was so sweet and caring. She told me she feels such powerful emotions and doesn't feel like she has the power to control them. She told me her biggest fear is that I would get tired of her HUGE emotions and would get tired of her and leave her. I held her and said it's OK, I'll always be there for you. In the first 3 months we grew so close that although we didn't officially move in together, she stayed over my place every night. We talked about growing old together and picked out kids names and planned where we would live when we finished school.

Some of the first big signs of our future problems happened during breaks from school. She would be devastated and she would want me to spend all day and night (14 hours) on the phone with her. I wanted to talk to her a lot too, but the pressure to be on the phone that long was too much. When we were back during the semester things were amazing again and we went everywhere together.

**The problems start**
It was after I graduated that things got bad. I have a biochem degree, and there are no tech companies near where we went to school. We wanted to stay together, so I just decided to move in with her. This has really hindered my career progression and right now I'm unemployed. Living together also increased the number and severity of our fights. Before we would have a little fight and make up, but now that we don't have our own domains, our fights just escalate and escalate. I also feel isolated because she gets very upset with me when I call my family because she doesn't like them. Right now my life consists of staying at home or visiting her during school and also writing her class essays (probably unbelievable based on this poorly structured post but I write awesome essays). She pays for almost everything in the relationship because I am unemployed with no savings.

**Yesterday**
Yesterday is a perfect example of our current relationship problems. She just got a very prestigious internship but it is in the city. To make the commute feasible we're staying at my parents' house for the month and I'm driving her to work and waiting in the hospital all day for her to finish work. Living with my parents is tense because she hates and resents them. Yesterday was actually OK and we were affectionate to each other until nighttime. At night we went to Trader Joe's and got some frozen dinners. She also begged me to get wine because she's underage. I don't like to buy alcohol for her because I used to heavily abuse alcohol. We have had many arguments about this that have gotten physical with her hitting me and verbally abusing me because I have denied her. She feels this is unfair because she can't buy it herself. To prevent these fights, I bought the wine. 

When we got home she proceeded to drink the wine much too quickly. She kept rapidly drinking her glass and refilling. She had finished 3 glasses before I even had any. I didn't want her to get a hangover for her prestigious internship, so I tried to cut her off. I also know that if she gets drunk she gets even more physically/verbally violent and also quite clumsy. I said she could have 1 more glass that I refill (a very tiny portion) and she reluctantly agreed. When I went to the bathroom and came back I saw she had refilled her glass already. I told her this was it for the night because she had her (much larger) refill. I proceeded to chug the rest of the bottle so she couldn't have any more secretly. This set her off. She kept saying that I micromanage her and don't let her do what she wants. She said she hates me and I'm the worst person in the world. She called me dumb and a loser for not having a job. She says ""fine we're broken up, I don't love you."" This is her standard reaction when she gets mad, and I kept saying I did it to help her and that I loved her. I told her that if she's getting this mad about not having a little bit of wine she probably has an unhealthy relationship with alcohol and she snapped that I was the alcoholic. Her anger kept building and she eventually started hitting me. When she hit me it hurt, and I said ""stop hitting me."" This got her even more angry because in our small house my parents could probably hear. She told me to stop being so loud, and every time she would hit me I would say stop hitting me (apparently too loudly) and she would use that as justification to hit me again. At this point I called her a cunt and used very mean language towards her to let out my frustration which made her even more violent. I also called her ""psycho"" and ""crazy"" because of how she was acting. She smashed her wine glass which spread glass on the floor and minorly cut my feet. Then she smashed my phone against the wall and I had to wrestle with her for valuable electronics to prevent her from breaking them. This wrestling turned into a real fight where I started to hit her back out of anger. I've done this a few times out of anger and I always regret it, but I can only take so much before I start to get violent back (I know this is wrong but it's SO DIFFICULT NOT TO!) She said she was leaving, but I didn't want to let her drive with the alcohol and her emotions distracting her. I had to wrestle her for the keys as well. She went outside and walked around at this time. She's done this before and if I don't follow her she says I'm abandoning her. I followed her for a bit and told her to come back and apologized for hitting her. She wouldn't come back to me, so I just went home and left the door unlocked so she wouldn't be trapped outside all night. Even after all our fighting, I still wanted her to come back and sleep to be prepared for her internship. She eventually came back and I told her to sleep in the bed, just give me a pillow and a blanket and I will sleep on the couch. She refused to give me these so I try to grab them which leads to more wrestling. At this point she is sober so I give her the keys and tell her to leave and we're done. She refused and told me that I said I would never leave her. She said that she shared her greatest fear and I promised I would never leave her and that I broke my promise. She threatened to kill herself if we break up or I leave or make her leave. The fight continued until we were both bruised and too physically exhausted to continue. Before we went to bed she kept asking for me to apologize for calling her a cunt because that was too far. I apologized for hitting her, but wouldn't apologize for saying mean words. She insisted we sleep cuddling together even after our huge fight together.

Now today, I'm sitting at the hospital (her workplace) waiting for her to be done work and then we're going back to our place near the college campus tonight. I told her she can go back by herself so she can feel consequences of her actions. She said she would agree to see a psychiatrist if I agreed to come back with her. Just typing out this long crazy story is making me realize more and more that I shouldn't be with this person, but I still can't help but love her. I know that her visiting a psychiatrist will help her, but I can't see how it can make her overcome emotional issues this deep (I think she has BPD and told her this but its shitty to diagnose someone with a mental disorder). It's so weird, because most days we are super affectionate and loving for each other and then others she gets toxic and we have insane fights. Some weird part of me still has hope that she'll be able to overcome this, and that we'll still grow old and have kids. So that's my story. I know the obvious advice is leave her. Knowing myself I probably won't take it. Just felt I had to get this out somehow. I've called domestic abuse hotlines, but most of them don't want to talk to me after I say that I hit her back (maybe they think I'm trying to spin the story).

**tl;dr My girlfriend got insanely physically/verbally/emotionally abusive when I tried to get her to stop drinking (so she wouldn't be hungover for her job). I hit her back. I probably won't leave her. How can I prevent her from escalating fights to this level?**"

I'm a guy who has always struggled with low self esteem. When I was in high school I ate my lunch in the bathroom because I was nervous about sitting alone and looking like a loser. In college it improved and I had a very intense relationship with a girl, and had my first kiss and lost my virginity. When that ended, I had a long dry spell, and that's when I met my current girlfriend of 3 years.

I was a senior and she was a freshman. I was her first kiss and she lost her virginity to me. This is a big source of contention because I was her first, but she was not mine. (This often comes up now with fights where she'll say something like ""at least I've never been with other people!"") When I was a senior our relationship was great. When we first began I was very passionate towards her, and would sing her to sleep every night and write poems and devotions to her. In the beginning of our relationship she would often have long bouts of crying because she thought I was so sweet and caring. She told me she feels such powerful emotions and doesn't feel like she has the power to control them. She told me her biggest fear is that I would get tired of her HUGE emotions and would get tired of her and leave her. I held her and said it's OK, I'll always be there for you. In the first 3 months we grew so close that although we didn't officially move in together, she stayed over my place every night. We talked about growing old together and picked out kids names and planned where we would live when we finished school.

Some of the first big signs of our future problems happened during breaks from school. She would be devastated and she would want me to spend all day and night (14 hours) on the phone with her. I wanted to talk to her a lot too, but the pressure to be on the phone that long was too much. When we were back during the semester things were amazing again and we went everywhere together.

**The problems start**
It was after I graduated that things got bad. I have a biochem degree, and there are no tech companies near where we went to school. We wanted to stay together, so I just decided to move in with her. This has really hindered my career progression and right now I'm unemployed. Living together also increased the number and severity of our fights. Before we would have a little fight and make up, but now that we don't have our own domains, our fights just escalate and escalate. I also feel isolated because she gets very upset with me when I call my family because she doesn't like them. Right now my life consists of staying at home or visiting her during school and also writing her class essays (probably unbelievable based on this poorly structured post but I write awesome essays). She pays for almost everything in the relationship because I am unemployed with no savings.

**Yesterday**
Yesterday is a perfect example of our current relationship problems. She just got a very prestigious internship but it is in the city. To make the commute feasible we're staying at my parents' house for the month and I'm driving her to work and waiting in the hospital all day for her to finish work. Living with my parents is tense because she hates and resents them. Yesterday was actually OK and we were affectionate to each other until nighttime. At night we went to Trader Joe's and got some frozen dinners. She also begged me to get wine because she's underage. I don't like to buy alcohol for her because I used to heavily abuse alcohol. We have had many arguments about this that have gotten physical with her hitting me and verbally abusing me because I have denied her. She feels this is unfair because she can't buy it herself. To prevent these fights, I bought the wine. 

When we got home she proceeded to drink the wine much too quickly. She kept rapidly drinking her glass and refilling. She had finished 3 glasses before I even had any. I didn't want her to get a hangover for her prestigious internship, so I tried to cut her off. I also know that if she gets drunk she gets even more physically/verbally violent and also quite clumsy. I said she could have 1 more glass that I refill (a very tiny portion) and she reluctantly agreed. When I went to the bathroom and came back I saw she had refilled her glass already.

*****

Susannah smiled at my over the top of her wine glass. ""To a successful first date."" I raised my glass and sipped and she looked down, then glanced back up at me with seductive eyes. 

I tried not to let myself get carried away, ever since my break up with Emma it had been hard to find someone to connect with on a deeper level and Tinder dates always seemed to carry an extra degree of sexual frisson, so maybe I was reading too much into it. Of course, no matter how well it went, I always had to deal with… my issue. 

“Psst.” I ignored the whisper from somewhere below me took a bite of my salmon en croute. 

I met her gaze again. “So Susannah, am I right in remembering that you work in fashion?” 

She laughed and reared back, letting her breasts strain against the fabric of her tight top. “You could say that. I put it on my profile as it sounds more impressive than Sales Assistant at Top Shop.” I smiled and she continued hurriedly. “But I *am* going to Art College at the moment, so maybe one day.” 

She knocked on the table for luck and I made the mistake of looking down. As soon as my gaze lowered the pepper pot began to wave at me. It raised its tiny hands to its mouth. “Psst, *Dave*.” 

I looked up again, trying to concentrate. “I hope you’ll remember me when you’re in Milan and putting on your first show.” She laughed and her smile made my heart skip a little. This girl was seriously pretty and I could not mess it up with… with my issue. 

“Dave, Dave, *Dave*!” I glanced down and saw that the pepper pot had worked its way over to my plate. It saw me look and threw up its arms to me. “I *LOVE* you Dave. Take me home with you. Make me yours!” 

It was happening again, but this time I would *not* let it ruin the night. I picked up the pepper and put it back into the middle of the table, only having to shake my finger slightly to make it let go. 

Susannah was nibbling at her salad. “So you work for a bank?” 

“Just an intern position at the moment.” I tried to ignore the pepper inching back across the table cloth. “But that finishes in the next few months and I hope to move into foreign finance, working with the IMF, or World bank, something like that.” 

She nodded coyly and reached out, taking my hand and meeting my gaze with her soft brown eyes. “That sounds so… so sexy.” 

Time stood still, the restaurant and everything faded away and I knew with some certainty, that I was getting laid tonight. I cleared my throat. “Well, I… uh… that is…” 

I froze as something fell into my lap and looked down to see the pepper pot was missing from the table top. I pulled back, dropping Susannah’s hand and stared down at my crotch, just in time to see the small pepper pot push in past my zipper and into my trousers. There was a blissful moment of nothing and then suddenly the searing pain of pepper touching my most delicate parts. 

It was instinctual. I was on my feet and acting before I knew what to do. The pepper was flung across the room and suddenly all eyes were on me and I looked down to find I was holding... myself and trying to wipe the pepper off me. 

Susannah’s eyes had grown huge and for just a moment I could see how this might look and I tried to recover myself. “No, no, no, no, no, no, this is a mistake, an accident.” She fled, wordlessly and as the manager approached I tucked myself back into my trousers and pulled out my wallet, dinner was over. 

The ride back home in the taxi was fairly quiet, although the seat tried to massage me and the headrest cooed sweet nothings to me until it was time to get out. The only good thing to come from the evening was the fare meter, which rolled itself back and then coyly fluttered its buttons at me, in a vain attempt to get my attention. 

Back in my sparse apartment I flopped onto the sofa and cracked open a beer, ignoring the cat calls from the cutlery drawer and eventually I heading to bed. Laying in the dark I wondered if I would ever find someone to replace Emma, or if my curse would stop me from ever finding love again. Lovely Emma, sweet Emma, if only it could have lasted, but they just didn’t make washing machines like they used to.

If you happen to see the Bill Clinton five minute TV ad for Hillary in which he introduces the commercial by saying he wants to share some things we may not know about Hillary's background, beware as I was there for most of their presidency and know them better than just about anyone. I offer a few corrections:
Bill says: ""In law school Hillary worked on legal services for the poor.""
Facts are: Hillary's main extra-curricular activity in 'Law School' was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a 'Federal Agent.' She went to Court every day as part of a Law student monitoring committee trying to spot civil rights violations and develop grounds for appeal.
Bill says: ""Hillary spent a year after graduation working on a Children's rights project for poor kids.""
Facts are: Hillary interned with Bob Truehaft, the head of the California Communist Party. She met Bob when he represented the Panthers and traveled all the way to San Francisco to take an internship with him.
Bill says: ""Hillary could have written her own job ticket, but she turned down all the lucrative job offers.""
Facts are: She flunked the D.C. bar exam, 'Yes', flunked it, it is a matter of record, and only passed the Arkansas bar. She had no job offers in Arkansas, 'None', and only got hired by the University of Arkansas Law School at Fayetteville because Bill was already teaching there. She did not join the prestigious Rose Law Firm until Bill became Arkansas Attorney General and was made a partner only after he was elected Arkansas Governor.
Bill says: ""President Carter appointed Hillary to the Legal Services Board of Directors and she became its Chairman.""
Facts are: The appointment was in exchange for Bill's support for Carter in his 1980 primary against Ted Kennedy. Hillary then became chairman in a coup in which she won a majority away from Carter's choice to be chairman.
Bill says: ""She served on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital.""
Facts are: Yes she did. But her main board activity, not mentioned by Bill, was to sit on the Wal-Mart Board of Directors, for a substantial fee. She was silent about their labor and health care practices.
Bill says: ""Hillary didn't succeed at getting health care for all Americans in 1994 but she kept working at it and helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) that provides five million children with health insurance.""
Facts are: Hillary had nothing to do with creating CHIP. It was included in the budget deal between Clinton and Republican Majority Leader Senator Trent Lott. I know; I helped to negotiate the deal. The money came half from the budget deal and half from the Attorney Generals' tobacco settlement. Hillary had nothing to do with either source of funds.
Bill says: ""Hillary was the face of America all over the World."" (LOL)
Facts are: Her visits were part of a program to get her out of town so that Bill would not appear weak by feeding stories that Hillary was running the White House. Her visits abroad were entirely touristic and symbolic and there was no substantive diplomacy on any of them.
Bill says: ""Hillary was an excellent Senator who kept fighting for Children's and Women's issues.""
Facts are: Other than totally meaningless legislation like changing the names on courthouses and post offices, she has passed only four substantive pieces of legislation. One set up a national park in Puerto Rico. A second provided respite care for family members helping their relatives through Alzheimer's or other conditions. And two were routine bills to aid 911 victims and responders which were sponsored by the entire N.Y. delegation. Presently she is trying to have the US memorialize Woodstock.
Here is what bothers me more than anything else about Hillary Clinton. She has done everything possible to weaken the President and our Country (that's you and me) when it comes to the 'War on Terror'.
1. She wants to close GITMO and move the combatants to the USA where they would have access to our legal system.
2. She wants to eliminate the monitoring of suspected Al Qaeda phone calls to/from the USA.
3. She wants to grant constitutional rights to enemy combatants captured on the battlefield.
4. She wants to eliminate the monitoring of money transfers between suspected Al Qaeda cells and supporters in the USA.
5. She wants to eliminate the type of interrogation tactics used by the Military &amp; CIA where coercion might be used when questioning known terrorists even though such tactics might save American lives.
One cannot think of a single 'Bill', Hillary has introduced or a single comment she has made that would tend to strengthen our Country in the 'War on Terror'. But, one can think of a lot of comments she has made that weaken our Country and makes it a more dangerous situation for all of us. Bottom line: She goes hand in hand with the ACLU on far too many issues where common sense is abandoned.
Share this with everyone you know, ask them to prove Dick Morris wrong. Think about it - he's (Dick Morris) said all of this openly, thus if he were not truthful he'd be liable for 'Defamation of Character' !
And you better believe Hillary would sue him.
Her winning in 2016 means the final death knell for America! Her whole public life has been a LIE.

Going outside for a brisk fast walk I can get 1,000 steps in 15 minutes. In some part of my brain it doesn't make sense how I can be walking back and forth, over and over again, during my internship. The objective data of 5k steps is harsh but helpful in making goals.

I'm basically working the job of a Medical Assistant getting patients started before they see their physician. This also involves getting on the computer constantly. So I know it is sitting to use the computer repeatedly. Standing isn't really an option right now because I know I'd hurt my back bending over to use the computer, but I do stand and get up as often as I can."

To make the commute feasible we're staying at my parents' house for the month and I'm driving her to work and waiting in the hospital all day for her to finish work. Living with my parents is tense because she hates and resents them. Yesterday was actually OK and we were affectionate to each other until nighttime. At night we went to Trader Joe's and got some frozen dinners. She also begged me to get wine because she's underage. I don't like to buy alcohol for her because I used to heavily abuse alcohol. We have had many arguments about this that have gotten physical with her hitting me and verbally abusing me because I have denied her. She feels this is unfair because she can't buy it herself. To prevent these fights, I bought the wine. 

When we got home she proceeded to drink the wine much too quickly. She kept rapidly drinking her glass and refilling. She had finished 3 glasses before I even had any. I didn't want her to get a hangover for her prestigious internship, so I tried to cut her off. I also know that if she gets drunk she gets even more physically/verbally violent and also quite clumsy. I said she could have 1 more glass that I refill (a very tiny portion) and she reluctantly agreed. When I went to the bathroom and came back I saw she had refilled her glass already. I told her this was it for the night because she had her (much larger) refill. I proceeded to chug the rest of the bottle so she couldn't have any more secretly. This set her off. She kept saying that I micromanage her and don't let her do what she wants. She said she hates me and I'm the worst person in the world. She called me dumb and a loser for not having a job. She says ""fine we're broken up, I don't love you."" This is her standard reaction when she gets mad, and I kept saying I did it to help her and that I loved her. I told her that if she's getting this mad about not having a little bit of wine she probably has an unhealthy relationship with alcohol and she snapped that I was the alcoholic. Her anger kept building and she eventually started hitting me. When she hit me it hurt, and I said ""stop hitting me."" This got her even more angry because in our small house my parents could probably hear. She told me to stop being so loud, and every time she would hit me I would say stop hitting me (apparently too loudly) and she would use that as justification to hit me again. At this point I called her a ""c-word"" and used very mean language towards her to let out my frustration which made her even more violent. I also called her ""psycho"" and ""crazy"" because of how she was acting. She smashed her wine glass which spread glass on the floor and minorly cut my feet. Then she smashed my phone against the wall and I had to wrestle with her for valuable electronics to prevent her from breaking them. This wrestling turned into a real fight where I started to hit her back out of anger. I've done this a few times out of anger and I always regret it, but I can only take so much before I start to get violent back (I know this is wrong but it's SO DIFFICULT NOT TO!) She said she was leaving, but I didn't want to let her drive with the alcohol and her emotions distracting her. I had to wrestle her for the keys as well. She went outside and walked around at this time. She's done this before and if I don't follow her she says I'm abandoning her. I followed her for a bit and told her to come back and apologized for hitting her. She wouldn't come back to me, so I just went home and left the door unlocked so she wouldn't be trapped outside all night. Even after all our fighting, I still wanted her to come back and sleep to be prepared for her internship. She eventually came back and I told her to sleep in the bed, just give me a pillow and a blanket and I will sleep on the couch. She refused to give me these so I try to grab them which leads to more wrestling. At this point she is sober so I give her the keys and tell her to leave and we're done. She refused and told me that I said I would never leave her. She said that she shared her greatest fear and I promised I would never leave her and that I broke my promise. She threatened to kill herself if we break up or I leave or make her leave. The fight continued until we were both bruised and too physically exhausted to continue. Before we went to bed she kept asking for me to apologize for calling her a ""c-word"" because that was too far. I apologized for hitting her, but wouldn't apologize for saying mean words. She insisted we sleep cuddling together even after our huge fight together.

Now today, I'm sitting at the hospital (her workplace) waiting for her to be done work and then we're going back to our place near the college campus tonight. I told her she can go back by herself so she can feel consequences of her actions. She said she would agree to see a psychiatrist if I agreed to come back with her. Just typing out this long crazy story is making me realize more and more that I shouldn't be with this person, but I still can't help but love her. I know that her visiting a psychiatrist will help her, but I can't see how it can make her overcome emotional issues this deep (I think she has BPD and told her this but its shitty to diagnose someone with a mental disorder). It's so weird, because most days we are super affectionate and loving for each other and then others she gets toxic and we have insane fights. Some weird part of me still has hope that she'll be able to overcome this, and that we'll still grow old and have kids. So that's my story. I know the obvious advice is leave her. Knowing myself I probably won't take it. Just felt I had to get this out somehow. I've called domestic abuse hotlines, but most of them don't want to talk to me after I say that I hit her back (maybe they think I'm trying to spin the story).

tl;dr My girlfriend got insanely physically/verbally/emotionally abusive when I tried to get her to stop drinking (so she wouldn't be hungover for her job). I hit her back. I probably won't leave her. How can I prevent her from escalating fights to this level?

Attached a few pics of bruises she left on me. There are more but I'm taking the photos in public so I can't show them all. http://imgur.com/a/eurLA"
4v7syo,4,2016-07-29,Fall internship vs courses,vin_kaushik,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4v7syo/fall_internship_vs_courses/,"I have a good chance of getting an internship at my friend's company but on the other hand I would lose the chance to pursue some courses I have really wanted to take such as Concurrent programming and cloud computing(a heavy project based course). I still haven't been able to add concurrent programming however due to lack of seats and there's heavy competition to get a seat for this course.

I wanted to know if it's better to hold out for the course and pursue courses over the fall or take up this internship opportunity.  Is it even a good decision to pursue these courses due to their long term impact on my career assuming I get the seat? The position would pay around $22/hr. It's in FL.

Please help me make this decision, I am a graduate student in CS.

EDIT: I am a masters student. And I'll be finishing next May regardless of whether I take the internship or not. My goal is to work at heavy tech company like Fb or finance tech. Eventually wish to start something of my own but this is a few years away.

4v8f1o,6,2016-07-29,TIFU by disinfecting my finger,H4sd,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4v8f1o/tifu_by_disinfecting_my_finger/,"This happened in 2014 while I was living in France.

It is summer and  my family and I are looking forward to a nice 2-weeks vacation in Greek islands. Our flight to Greece is scheduled on Monday morning. On the Saturday evening before, I notice a small infection on the index finger of my right hand, close to the nail. Not wanting to let it fester during vacation and develop complications during vacation, I lance the infection with a sanitized X-Acto blade and drain it. To disinfect the area, I rub some Chlorehexidine on it.

Because I really don't want to be bothered during vacation, I decide to soak a compress in Chlorhexidine and dress it around the last phalanx of my finger overnight. In the event I didn't fully drain the infection, the overnight soaking should take care of it, right?

I go to bed and, during the night, feel some slight discomfort an that area. I ignore it, believing I might have slightly over-tightened the dressing and not wanting to get up at 2 or 3 AM to handle it, and get back to sleep.

I wake up the morning after, take the dressing out, and find the soaked skin completely white and wrinkled. It’s looking gross, but I’m not really concerned about it as I figure the skin probably spent too much time being wet, and that it should dry out in a matter of hours. Being Sunday morning, doctors are closed, so my wife insists that I go to the ER and have my finger checked out in case something needs to be done before we leave for Greece.
The intern that checks my finger confirms it will dry out during the day, and that there's nothing to worry about. She's nice and gives me antibiotics for 3 days, just in case.

The skin dries, and the wrinkles slowly give way to a huge blister. By Sunday afternoon, the last phalanx of my finger is covered by a ¼ inch-thick blister. It encompasses the top, sides, and fingerprint areas. I realize that, on top of disinfecting my finger, I actually chemically burnt my finger with Chlorhexidine.

This is my right hand, and I am right-handed... I can't use my index finger for about 2 weeks but still enjoy the vacation. My finger takes about 5 weeks to heal and develops hypertrophic scar tissue that encroaches on the joint, preventing me from bending that phalanx more than 30 degrees.

Over the following 12 months, the hypertrophic tissue softens enough around the joint that I recover almost all mobility. As of writing, a part of the burnt skin is still rigid and slightly discolored from the scarring, and will stay this way for the rest of my life. Luckily this is on the top and side of my index finger and doesn’t bother me whatsoever.

TL;DR: I soaked the last phalanx of my finger in Chlorhexidine overnight to ensure an infection was fully drained, it burnt my finger the day before going on vacation. I developed scar tissue and needed 1 year to recover almost full mobility of my finger."

4v8un8,2,2016-07-29,Adventure Log Archive (6/27),ArcaneDetective,Narntorni,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narntorni/comments/4v8un8/adventure_log_archive_627/,"**Preface:**

We had 4-5 new players join us this week. I think we had 11 players and 2 DMs in total. With the additional new recruits we decided it was time to take out Tanner Town (heh, alliteration).

I’d like to thank the newcomers for joining us again. The help of our pre-generated adventuring interns was much appreciated, although I suspect the actual characters will be traumatized/brain-damaged from their ordeal (i.e., I see many custom made characters in their future. Remember, you can carry over your treasure/experience.).

**Adventure summary:**

Given our large numbers we opted for a two pronged attack on Tanner Town. The plan was to infiltrate the city to lay charges in two separate large towers near the outer wall. Detonation of the towers would cause them to crash into and breach the outer wall thus giving easy access to the armies waiting outside.

Author’s note: The Tanners are some kind of animated leather golem abominations that were kidnapping people for their skin, so I don’t think we took out any hospitals, orphanages, or pet shops in the bombings…we didn’t check or ask though…

“Gold Team” assaulted the NorthWest tower by airship and consisted of the following members:

* Bobo the level 3 Lore Bard (intern #1)
 * Made hilarious use of Vicious Mockery (one of the Tanner Minotaur guys was literally and metaphorically thick-skinned, but many others were very sensitive to Bobo’s insults) and one amusing use of Crown of Madness
* Eugeo the level 3 Eldritch Knight Fighter (intern #2)
 * Made good use of Thunderwave and Fire Bolt in addition to his melee attacks. Also found some boxes that we stacked to get into a high window, thus avoiding another fight.
* Alinar the level 6 Horde Breaker Ranger veteran
 * Made good use of Spike Growth, Hunters Mark, and his Horde Breaker ability. Shot some Molotov cocktails out of the air during the grappling hook assault on our airship.
* Matthew the Cleric(3)/Rogue(1)/Fighter(1) (freed from his cursed armor courtesy of the time skip)
 * Made excellent use of Pass Without a Trace (group stealthed from the ship to the tower), Healing Word, the Defensive Duelist feat. Interns and Alinar spent a lot of time getting knocked unconscious (insert Archer joke/quote “that’s really bad for you”) and healed/revived which kept the Tanner Minotaur preoccupied.
 * Personally, my vote for MVP this week.
* Grisel the Bear Totem Barbarian(5)
 * Once again took damage like a boss continuing her streak of never being knocked unconscious, but ending the fight with 1 hit point.
  * Grisel’s note: Was only one to not be knocked unconscious at least once in the final fight.

Gold team arrived at their tower with enough time to get in a short rest before receiving the signal to detonate the charges. Much needed since the Minotaur hit very hard.

“The Fighting Mongooses” assaulted the other tower via a sewer route. I only got a short summary of their adventure, so it’s less detailed (possibly misremembered) and lacks a team composition/performance annotations.

* They decided to take a shorter but more dangerous path through the sewers
* Avoided some sort of blood fiend
* Walked into some kind of tunnel sized worm (“This is no cave…”)
* Fell into a large jagged hole (think pachinko machine for adventurers)
* Finished the final battle (after the detonations) much more efficiently and provided aid by taking on one of the Tanner Minotaur originally fighting Gold Team which we really needed.

End result: Tanner Town is cleansed of the animated leather menace.

Treasure: assorted minor items and gold

4v8uo3,1,2016-07-29,New Grad here interviewing for an OR training program!,essenceofjoy,nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/4v8uo3/new_grad_here_interviewing_for_an_or_training/,"I am incredibly excited, nervous, and honored to have the opportunity to interview for a Perioperative nurse internship at a Level 1 Trauma Center in the city. It'll be a 6 month intensive program with a 2 year job commitment, and that's pretty much all I got from the phone call earlier. My interview is on Monday. 

Unfortunately nursing school did not provide many opportunities to explore the OR and see what an OR nurse does and I've been doing a lot of research this afternoon to prep myself for my interview. So far, I've gathered that OR nursing is not your traditional kind of nursing and that it is very team oriented, which are two things I am looking for as far as what I want for my nursing career. I am going in with a completely open mind and the understanding that this will be a huge learning curve for me, but I am willing to learn and adapt! As far as my experience goes I worked in the mental health/maternity field throughout nursing school and have been working in a psych hospital this past year, having had my fair share of working with a difficult patient population. I am ready for my next chapter!

Anyway, who else has gone through an OR internship/residency? What has drawn you to the OR? What are challenges that you have overcome? What do nurses and managers look for in a new grad going into the OR?

Thanks!"

I love someone for 8 months till now and he mainly does not know till now that I love him as a lover not a boyfriend .. At the same time we do not talk since last week 🙂
Lets say my whole story since the beginning ..
I love a guy who is 7 years older than me .. I am 21 years old ..I met him through an internship ..
Through the internship .. I found that he has the same way of thinking and he is not complicated .. And he is the best guy I want ..
One day .. I had discovered that he is married and has a daughter 🙂
Honestly .. I just got surprised but I did not think even for a second that I will know him again or he is a cheater ..
I went and asked a lady whom I also know in the internship if he is really married .. And she said yes all people know .. Anyways .. I started telking her that I thought that he liked me and related stuff ..
Throughout the months .. We started knowing each other more and more .. However I did not tell him that I knew that he is married .. I only said in a indirect way .. I asked him ‘Are you in a relationship ?? How is it ?? .. He told me It is a complicated relationship and When I see you .. I will explain it to you ..
Note: Through the 8 months we did not meet outside the internship .. We never went out together .. Everytime we agree on day to meet .. In the first month .. Honestly I am the one who cancels the plan but when I found that I had done that 2/3 times .. I found that that pissed him off .. Therefore I decided not to cancel it again whatever are problems I have .. Unfortunately Once I tool this decision .. And everytime we agree on a date He tells me a non-convincing excuse on the same date .. And That lasts for months .. Some of the excuses .. ‘Busy’ ‘Playing football’ ‘Travelling’ and so on ..
One day .. In June .. When He did the same and canceled the plan .. I decided to end up everything and not to talk to him again .. Firstly he got surprised .. And then he said ‘Ok Bye’ ..
I stayed exactly two weeks not talking to him .. And I returned talking to him through sending him a whatsapp telling him .. Call me.. He definitely called and we talked and laughed as if nothing happened ..
We stayed this month .. For me is the best month for our relaionship .. I knew alot about his lifestyle .. His work .. But I did not know anything about his marriage .. All that is through whatsapp and phone calls only .. We also did not meet ..
July had come and problems started again .. He started disappearing for days .. For example if I texted him on Saturday .. He replies on Tuesday as if he did not disappeat for 3 days .. Claiming that he is so husy at work ..
Note: he did the same at the same time he was canceling any plan we agreed about .. Half of March and April ..
Lets talk about last week which depressed me alot ..
We were texting each other on Whatsapp on Saturday .. Suddenly I had found that no text is delivered to him .. I called him alot but mobile was switched off ..
Another Note .. He switches off his mobile connection (puts the mobile on flight mode) after his working hours because of the clients call him alot for work .. Therefore he puts it on flight mode and open wifi ..
So I got afraid ..
I sent him text message ..
He replied next day once his mobile phone had Been opened .. That he is fine and he is updating the software of his phone ..
That stayed 2 days .. Which I doubt that the problem is only in updating software ..
I called him alot and I sent him lots of text messages ..
After a while I decided to put hisnphone nukber on another mobile at home and see if his whatsapp is working .. And What I expected was true .. His whatsapp was working ..
I decided not to let him until I understand everything .. I hate myself if I did not understand a ceetain issue ..
At Tuesday he called me and hebtold me ‘Yes I was blocking you’ because his work mate which I mentioned earlier in my story told him that I said bad things about him .. And that I disappeared and I do not talk to her again ..
Another Note hahaha : I stopped talking to all people I knew in the internship long time ago (nearly four months ago) for certaon reasons ..
I told him Yes I said bad things in the beginning but I did not explain why ..
He told me I love your honesty and I will immediately unblock you .. We we stayed an hour talking .. Telling me how his life went during the days that we were not talking in .. And he told me that his software was damaged amd he fixed it then his class mate told him this .. So he was angry and he blocked me ..
Once we Finished the call .. I was sending him a whatsapp text .. IT HAD NOT BEEN DELIVERED ..
I send him an normal text mesaage on his phone .. He did not reply .. I called him ALOT on Wednesday .. He did not answer neither calls nor text messages .. Through those messages .. I told him.my story with his work mate .. And Honestly I had lied in a part of it .. I said that she is the one who started taling about him that he is a cheater . although I am the one who told her that I knew that he is married Although I thought he was single .. And that she is the one who told me that he is married
But I told him the rest of story without lying ..
I do not know why I had lied ..
Anyways ..
On the same day ..
He sent me text message .. Saying that he was busy ans he did not read any message of mine and he said “Wait .. Just finished work”
Since this message .. I had not received any message or call from him till now ..
I tried calling him alot yesterday .. But no reply ..
I sent him whatsapp on another number .. Yesterday .. Telling him .. That if there is another issue he is mad from me because of it.. Face me .. Tell me …instead of this silence and disappearance ..
I told him that he did not remove any blocking and that made me confused .. Although he said that he removed it and we were fine while talking on phone ..
And I told him that nothing deserves all that .. FACE ME with any issue instead of ignorance ..
Unfortunately .. He did not call me till now .. He travelled for a vacation today ..
I really do not know what to do .. I want this relationship back..
He considers me a friend not a lover and I know that from the beginning .. And I accept that He is the perfect guy for me …
I really do not want him to be angry from me and to continue this block ..
What should I do ??
If you have any questions let me know .. Or if there is something not clear let me know as well ..
Please help me ..
His birthday is in september..
I was thinking of that I do not have any connection with him this August and then I surprise him with a present on his birthday .. What do you think ?.
Honestly I miss him and I can not imagine that we are not in touch for days .."

So, i graduated at the end of march. First, I took some time off. A month later I started looking for jobs. I graduated with a masters in neuropsychology, but my internship focused on VR apllications, biofeedback en serious gaming. I fell in love with the research area and have been looking for  job in serious gaming ever since. However, since my masters degree isnt a perfect fit i knew it would be hard, but i thought that if i just went for it eventually I would be ok.

So a month went by and I almost insta-landed a job. However, after the final meeting when i thought i was 'in' it promptly didnt work out. The man i had my interviews with however, wanted to help me out in coaching me for a new job. It was not his decision to hire me or not and we connected over the course.

Now either big name researchers and corporations either only tespond to one e-mail and never give any further information, or don't even give me the time of day. It is very frustrating if you are being ignored by a large part of the community/workforce in an area you like to enter. For example, i send an e-mail to a company developping AR technollgy in the US. I got a quick response stating they ran out of visas untill late 2017. So i responded back: what if we could combine it with a PhD in-company? This way I can work, and get in on a different visa.

No response, just like alot of others. All other responses aren't rejections, but stating they have no vacancies at this time but are interested in the future.

Now in the meantime I try to push myself to learn/read up on serious gaming each day but I find it hard to get motivated through the feeling of futility of it all. I put in the work much easier if it's to reach an existing and clear goal. 

So I guess I just needed to get this off my chest. Of course I will keep going and its also a matter of being 'discovered' and having luck, but I feel my motivation dwindling while others around me appear succesfull."

Our main plan was to return to the magic stone factory. On our way there we found more lifter golems. We actually managed to reactivate them and get back to the Reclamation Plant. The golems were used to help construct an outpost at the Reclamation Plant and we built a trade route back to the “Dwarf Fortress”. We haven’t named the new outpost, so someone should think of something (e.g., Ooze’s Prison, Clean Room, Alchemist’s Retreat, etc.).

Resuming our journey we came across the Mercury Lake again. Similar shenanigans as last time ensued. Matthew had other business--so we didn’t have his restoration magic--but Alinar recently learned those spells as well, so we made it across mostly intact. Grisel found out that the market for the poison is poor/saturated and that they’re only worth 5 gold each. She didn’t like the price, but bought 30 more vials, so now she has 59 vials of the mercury poison (she gave one to Eugeo for testing purposes).

The first new room that we explored had Kenku in it. The second Grisel walked into the room they attacked her by dropping very heavy rocks on her (we found out that the toroid stones can be made heavy using a magic word).

Grisel’s note: Some Kenku are real jerks and/or murder hobos.

Severely bloodied (those rocks were really heavy/painful), Grisel retreated while Billy cast fog cloud and attempted to negotiate. When negotiations broke down Arannis cast Suggestion, used his special Portent ability to force a resistance failure, and told the Kenku to leave. The encounter ended, Grisel drank a potion of greater healing, and was healed by both Alinar and a new Paladin intern—we didn’t ask his name… The room contained the toroid stones that we found out can be made heavier or lighter on command.

The next room had soapstone cube stones that have cold magic properties. Also in the room was an imprisoned ice elemental—our Cleric intern (didn’t write his name down) spoke Primordial, so we got to hear his story. Seemed pretty lame to leave him chained up so we freed him in exchange for information. We won’t be able to make the cold magic stones anymore though.

Author’s note: apparently the Kenku were taunting the ice elemental too (throwing fruit and stuff at him). Yep, jerks.

One of the pieces of information that we got from the ice elemental was the combination to a secure office where we found two magic rods that can turn the stones into one-use magical melee weapons and some information about the Bibliomancers (something about more exotic magic stones like time magic). The weapons have a moderate chance of destroying the stone once used, but most of the time they just require that the stone be recharged. Eugeo has one of these rods, but the other is still up for grabs.

The next room contained some kind of magical musical instrument quintet golem and magic pyramid thunder stones. Some of the more senior members of the group have had deadly encounters with these kinds of golems before, so we decided to leave the stones and golem alone and went to the next room.

The next room contained tumblers filled with the head-exploding river stones. It also had the guy from the market that allegedly murdered his friend in the market and started this whole adventure. He was bunkered in a makeshift brick fort. Billy failed to negotiate a peaceful solution and then started a fight with failed attempt to charm him with the Hypnotic Pattern spell (we had pretty bad luck in general). Arannis blindly threw an exploding tile into the room which started one of the tumblers on fire. Given the seeming lack of progress from the first three plans, Grisel tried to frighten/intimidate this guy into submission by charging into the room and throwing her weight into the brick structure. It worked well, but in a way that she did not anticipate…and not in a good way.

Apparently, as a final act of desperation, this guy decided to kill himself and everyone else by detonating one of the tumblers. This set off a chain reaction that filled the entire room and halls with the activated head-exploding stones. Grisel was the only one in the room that took the full brunt of this, but four of the party members down the halls were knocked unconscious by the ensuing barrage of magic bullets. Despite being in his brick fortress our suicidal friend did manage to kill himself. Being nigh invulnerable, Grisel managed to stay conscious and—with the help of Alinar—pulled the unconscious companions to safety, stabilized them… and apologized.

Grisel’s note: I still don’t understand that idiot’s reasoning. Highest damage taken to date: 93 points. Times knocked unconscious: 0.

Treasure: 2 magic stone rods, 3 Jewler’s kits, assorted magic stones, and a few mundane items/tools/letters

Gold: 415 gold, 7 silver per party member (from selling stones minus the cost of the outpost and trade route construction)

Experience: 1100"
4v8zle,1,2016-07-29,Some advice on what i should be prioritizing at the moment?,BlueDaruma,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/4v8zle/some_advice_on_what_i_should_be_prioritizing_at/,"I worked as a Software Developer in Cleveland for one year after graduating with a B.A. in Computer Science, but eventually left due to an admitted lack of interest in the field and with what I was doing. I eventually decided that I'd rather pursue something that I'm passionate about, and have since moved to San Francisco to pursue a career in Animation. Aside from currently taking classes to prepare for this industry, I'm also job hunting, but am a bit unsure as to what exactly I should be looking for, aside from the fact that I'm leaning more towards contract/ part-time work to devote time to my studies.

Despite being a computer science graduate in California, I've been trying to stay away from strictly coding/ software based jobs, as I'd likely repeat what happened in Cleveland as a result. However, after weeks of searching AngelList, Indeed, and LinkedIn, these seem to be the only sort of jobs that I'm qualified for. On the flip side, because I'm only currently acquiring the necessary skills needed for an animation based job and am lacking the portfolio/ photo reel required by many animation companies, I also don't feel ready for the jobs that I'd like to get into either, especially since, despite loving art and animation, the classes that I'm taking now are the first ever sort of ""formal"" training.

With that being said, I'm a bit lost as to what I should be aiming for, or what my next step ought to be. Instead of job hunting for something that admittedly be temporary, should I focus on portfolio building and maybe try applying for animation internships? I'm a bit concerned in terms of money, as I'm more or less supporting myself at the moment. Going back to Computer Science, my formal training is in back-end development, but I have some interest in front-end/ UI/ UX work, despite only briefly touching upon it while in Cleveland. Most jobs also require portfolios/ reels, which again, I don't have. Maybe I should consider taking online classes for this?

As you can see, I'm a bit lost. Any sort of advice or ideas would be greatly appreciated."

My situation is a bit of a tricky one, first some background: I am in my early twenties and studying Computer Science in a Bachelor program. I am currently working as intern at one of the audit big 4 in first level support. I like the job, I have great colleagues and the general atmosphere in the company is really nice and enjoyable. My internship will end in roughly 2 months about that time I would go back to university. I was informed that our IT dept. is currently recruiting 20 and 40 hrs/week work forces, being already in the company I would score a job there with ease. I know an intern colleague who has just applied for the same position and he got it within a day, so staying would not be an issue. However first or even second level support is not really my dream job, I would like to go into software development and as such I have already started looking for possible jobs after this internship with at least 2 positions that would fit my profile.


Naturally this is where my wisdom ends. I don't know if I should apply at my current company for a position I would be guaranteed to get, but it's not what I really ny dream job or pursue a kickstart into a software development career and start applying for other jobs right now. Of course there is the third option of not working at all after my internship and going back to Uni without a job, but being in my early twenties and this being my first job I feel like I am already in a huge disadvantage in the job market with the little experience I have.



I appreciate all comments and help you folks have for me. Cheers!"
4v957n,3,2016-07-29,Working on moving out (+backstory),TheHoneyMustard,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4v957n/working_on_moving_out_backstory/,"Hey, I'm a long time lurker on Reddit and today I decided to stop being a chump and make an account.

I'm working on moving out, but money is a legit problem for me (as of anyone). I'm starting Community College in 2 weeks (August 17th) and I have no car. If I can get enough money, I'll buy a van and do the ""van-life"". 
I
'm going to CC for 2 years before transferring to a 4 year Uni, so when I get there I will probably stay in a dorm. My mother is super manipulative, selfish, delusional and of course narcissistic. 

She has a bad smoking and drinking habit, and if she's mad at something else takes out her frustrations out on me. For example, when I was 12 (I'm 18 now) she had been out all night drinking and when she came home she found me eating a bowl of cereal. She proceeded to tell me I'm lazy and the reason our home looks the way it is (she is a hoarder) and that she 'doesn't like my personality' and 'doesn't want to be my mother anymore'. 

She chased me around the house and ending beating me with a broom, succesfully knocking one of my teeth out. She says she doesn't want to be like my Grandmother (who is her x10) but she doesn't see how much of my Grandmother she is. 

She often slaps me in my face if I 'back talk' her (AKA have an opinion) or hits me with her cane (she is disabled) if I don't do what she wants quick enough or to her liking.
I have recorded her saying she ""owns"" me and me retaliating her nonsense, along with other recordings.

She's been smoking for 35 years, and everytime I suggest that she should quit to save money and better her health, she tells me to 'shut up' and that 'she is grown and can do what she wants'. People often ask me if I smoke because it can be smelled in my clothes. It's super embarrassing because in the small neighborhood I live in no one has any filter and it hurts. 

Our arguments have been getting worse everyday, and if I don't 'obey' her, she uses the ""I'm your Mother!"" card or threatens to kick me out and disown me. My brother moved out at 19 to go to NYC to live with my Grandmother. 

He's a freeloader and a womanizer and evil just like my Grandmother. Him nor my Grandmother can tolerate me unless I have something they want, so going up state to live with her is not an option.

I have no other family except them and a missing bipolar Aunt. I have no money, nowhere to go, horrible mental health, etc. I'm a Graphic Designer/Video Editor (self-taught VE, pursuing GD in college as a career) and I have been looking for easy paid internships I can do to earn a few bucks here and there to save. I did a internship for a company 2 months ago for $100 and my mother immediately took the check without even letting me say goodbye to it.

I would open a bank account and do odd jobs over the Internet but were are on Section 8, and since I am 18 now, the government will be checking my information and take whatever money I earn as ""income"" and take half for rent. 

I am not able to get an actual job unless I move out and get off my mothers lease, but I need an address to do so and can't use mine because of the Section 8 ordeal. 

I am super stuck and don't know what to do.

My next best option is to save my leftover financial aid money, do work-study at my school for pocket change and dish it out hoping I can survive a year of school living in this home while going to school.

If anyone of you have any tips or tricks, share experiences, or would like to see my work if you're interested in supporting me in anyway just comment below or send me a message.

Thank you so much for reading this brick wall of text.

TL;DR: My mother is an emotional and sometimes physical abuser. I want to leave but am stuck. Send halp pls."

4v9eap,219,2016-07-29,Review of BAPE Osaka &amp; My First BAPE Purchase (Shirt),audidass,streetwear,https://www.reddit.com/r/streetwear/comments/4v9eap/review_of_bape_osaka_my_first_bape_purchase_shirt/,"**The Product**: 

http://imgur.com/a/Xm1Wl

I tried to get some glow-in-the-dark shots but they didn't come out too well. You can tell that the kind off-white/limey colored patches are the glow-in-the-dark ink. 

**Store &amp; Service**

The BAPE Osaka store is located about 30-40 minutes away from Dotonbori street by foot, in Minamihorie. It’s on a sidestreet from a bigger street featuring the Supreme Osaka store, a Champion store and some thrift store. You can hit one after the other no problem. But tbh I didn’t hit any of those since the day I got to Osaka I decided to go buy some BAPE and went off with only that goal in mind as soon as I dropped off my luggage.

I was sweaty af as I made my way into the store because it was humid af and I tend to walk fast. So that was kinda embarrassing, walking into this immaculate boutique with a sweaty brow and in flip flops and some basic ass olive shirt (also complete with its own sweet sweat decals). I guess my SPRING SUMMER 16 SUPREME BACKPACK made me fit in more though because when I got there it was full of gaijin hypebeasts just like myself. Nah not really full, but there were two dudes, one Japanese and one American decked out in Palace and Supreme getting ready to bust over a shark hoodie. American dude was hesitant in buying but the Japanese guy was like come on lol do it. 

As far as the sales associates go, they were fashionable (all wearing some sorta BAPE piece(s) but nothing over the top or too loud) and really good at their jobs. To this extent, I mean that they acknowledged me when I came in but didn’t bumrush me asking if I was looking for something and let me browse totally at my leisure while hovering not too close but not too far away. IMO, that’s the sort of impersonal and efficient treatment I prefer. I’d just have to look at them for them to be ready to answer a question or get an item but their presence didn’t feel overbearing. It might be some sort of weird placebo effect from this being my first time in a higher-end store such as this than what I’m used to, but that sort of behavior from the sales associates was a nice change of pace.

The store itself is on the smaller side when compared to the BAPE stores in Harajuku and Shibuya in Tokyo. It has shirts and hoodies on the first floor, with button ups and more shirts and some shoes on the second floor. The interior has a bunch of mirrors that make the place look really spacious though. I was honestly surprised that it was as small as it was, after like 5 minutes of walking around inside thinking there was gonna be more in the back or something. As I said though, the store itself is super clean. White tile and big glass window panes let in a ton of natural light complimented by the nice lighting they have inside. The shopping experience was like fucking primo but again, maybe it was because I had just walked 40 minutes to get there and was excited af to buy some BAPE. I spent about 30-40 min instore just looking at stuff.
Eventually I decided to buy a shirt because I was into the design and I needed more white shirts in my wardrobe. The following is detailing my thoughts on that shirt.

**Material &amp; Construct**

The shirt itself is made from very thick fabric. Think luxurious Carhartt. Its heavy, dense, and a little rougher in texture. Soft or smooth are definitely not the words that come to mind first when describing this piece but its not the same as some random heavy workwear shirt. Definitely wouldn’t say this is the most breathable shirt I have. I didn’t wear it much except once on a date in Tokyo at night during my trip because I knew that I’d sweat in it something heavy if I were to spend the day walking around in it. The stitching is pretty nice and very solid throughout. The collar is also pretty durable, doesn’t feel like it’ll stretch out or anything anytime soon.

I didn’t notice any loose threads on my piece and after looking through the store for 40 min, I didn’t notice anything of that sort on the other items either. The screen-printing was also pretty top notch. The ink was on pretty thick and very sharp in contrast on the fabric. The particular shirt that I got was glow in the dark, so some ink can be seen in low light. Kind of a novelty and gimmicky but whatever. It looks cool regardless.

One surprising thing that I immediately noticed was how clean cut the labels inside and on the sleeve wear. Like the logo on the sleeve edge and then the tags on the inside of the neck, there sides were so clean cut and crisp and popping. Usually regular clothes has tags that are kinda scraggly or bent. These were popping up right at me and super clean cut. I was weirded out that it was one of the first things I noticed as I was checking sizes.

**Fit**

Speaking of sizes, if you go to the store and don’t know your size for a shirt, they don’t let you try on the shirts in the store. Probably because they don’t want to mess up their stock with sweaty tourists popping shirts on and off. You can try the hoodies on no problem, just not on your nude bod. I copped a large because large usually fits me pretty well in America. However, the cut and sizing is not exactly the same. In America I could get away with some mediums but if I were to cop a BAPE medium, I don’t think it would fit me as well as a Large. So go your size, but if you are kind borderline, it’d recommend doing a size up.

The fit itself was great though. With regular shirts, it feels as though the fit is [ ] that shape, if you were to imagine looking through your shirt on the bottom before you put it on. With BAPE, it felt as though it was instead a more conical ( ) shape and thus sat a little tighter but by no means overbearingly so. It was as though it was unintentionally a fitted t-shirt, but not as tight. 

**Cost**

Was about 7600 Yennies, which is about 76$. So a decent amount cheaper than the 120$ that I saw the shirt going for new stateside. 

**Overall Impressions**

To me, it seems that with BAPE I was paying more for the experience of shopping at one of their stores and for the brand rather than the quality of the item. It is absolutely the best shirt I own in terms of quality, make no mistake in that sense. However, I think a lot of what sets it apart physically from other shirts that I have is somewhat negligible regarding my decision in buying it when simultaneously considering the price. The fact that the shirt used is such a nice quality, the fit is great, the print is great and the tags are great does not warrant spending 120$ on it, nor 76$ imo.
 
However, what does warrant those prices are how much I like the brand and the design along with the fact that I bought it at the store with service that I enjoyed. I’m a student traveling on internship money so I don’t have a shit-ton to throw around anyways but I don’t regret the purchase at all especially since I can say I’ve bought BAPE in Japan, which to me is pretty cool for what its worth. 

I suppose that’s the case for most higher end brands though, the fact that after a point you aren’t necessarily paying for quality but rather moreso the brand and creativity/exclusivity of a piece. Yeah some can argue that the APE head and text aren’t all that creative but I don’t want to get into that here. 

Overall, if I get the chance to go back to Japan, I’ll probably hit up another BAPE store and get another piece. But I don’t think I’ll be buying anything from them stateside anytime soon.

edit: It's possible that the store will have blank shirts there just for you to try on and figure out your size, mine just happened to not the time I went I guess."

I love someone for 8 months till now and he mainly does not know till now that I love him as a lover not a boyfriend .. At the same time we do not talk since last week 🙂 Lets say my whole story since the beginning .. I love a guy who is 7 years older than me .. I am 21 years old ..I met him through an internship .. Through the internship .. I found that he has the same way of thinking and he is not complicated .. And he is the best guy I want .. One day .. I had discovered that he is married and has a daughter 🙂 Honestly .. I just got surprised but I did not think even for a second that I will know him again or he is a cheater .. I went and asked a lady whom I also know in the internship if he is really married .. And she said yes all people know .. Anyways .. I started telking her that I thought that he liked me and related stuff .. Throughout the months .. We started knowing each other more and more .. However I did not tell him that I knew that he is married .. I only said in a indirect way .. I asked him ‘Are you in a relationship ?? How is it ?? .. He told me It is a complicated relationship and When I see you .. I will explain it to you .. Note: Through the 8 months we did not meet outside the internship .. We never went out together .. Everytime we agree on day to meet .. In the first month .. Honestly I am the one who cancels the plan but when I found that I had done that 2/3 times .. I found that that pissed him off .. Therefore I decided not to cancel it again whatever are problems I have .. Unfortunately Once I tool this decision .. And everytime we agree on a date He tells me a non-convincing excuse on the same date .. And That lasts for months .. Some of the excuses .. ‘Busy’ ‘Playing football’ ‘Travelling’ and so on .. One day .. In June .. When He did the same and canceled the plan .. I decided to end up everything and not to talk to him again .. Firstly he got surprised .. And then he said ‘Ok Bye’ .. I stayed exactly two weeks not talking to him .. And I returned talking to him through sending him a whatsapp telling him .. Call me.. He definitely called and we talked and laughed as if nothing happened .. We stayed this month .. For me is the best month for our relaionship .. I knew alot about his lifestyle .. His work .. But I did not know anything about his marriage .. All that is through whatsapp and phone calls only .. We also did not meet .. July had come and problems started again .. He started disappearing for days .. For example if I texted him on Saturday .. He replies on Tuesday as if he did not disappeat for 3 days .. Claiming that he is so husy at work .. Note: he did the same at the same time he was canceling any plan we agreed about .. Half of March and April .. Lets talk about last week which depressed me alot .. We were texting each other on Whatsapp on Saturday .. Suddenly I had found that no text is delivered to him .. I called him alot but mobile was switched off .. Another Note .. He switches off his mobile connection (puts the mobile on flight mode) after his working hours because of the clients call him alot for work .. Therefore he puts it on flight mode and open wifi .. So I got afraid .. I sent him text message .. He replied next day once his mobile phone had Been opened .. That he is fine and he is updating the software of his phone .. That stayed 2 days .. Which I doubt that the problem is only in updating software .. I called him alot and I sent him lots of text messages .. After a while I decided to put hisnphone nukber on another mobile at home and see if his whatsapp is working .. And What I expected was true .. His whatsapp was working .. I decided not to let him until I understand everything .. I hate myself if I did not understand a ceetain issue .. At Tuesday he called me and hebtold me ‘Yes I was blocking you’ because his work mate which I mentioned earlier in my story told him that I said bad things about him .. And that I disappeared and I do not talk to her again .. Another Note hahaha : I stopped talking to all people I knew in the internship long time ago (nearly four months ago) for certaon reasons .. I told him Yes I said bad things in the beginning but I did not explain why .. He told me I love your honesty and I will immediately unblock you .. We we stayed an hour talking .. Telling me how his life went during the days that we were not talking in .. And he told me that his software was damaged amd he fixed it then his class mate told him this .. So he was angry and he blocked me .. Once we Finished the call .. I was sending him a whatsapp text .. IT HAD NOT BEEN DELIVERED .. I send him an normal text mesaage on his phone .. He did not reply .. I called him ALOT on Wednesday .. He did not answer neither calls nor text messages .. Through those messages .. I told him.my story with his work mate ..

And that she is the one who told me that he is married But I told him the rest of story without lying .. I do not know why I had lied .. Anyways .. On the same day .. He sent me text message .. Saying that he was busy ans he did not read any message of mine and he said “Wait .. Just finished work” Since this message .. I had not received any message or call from him till now .. I tried calling him alot yesterday .. But no reply .. I sent him whatsapp on another number .. Yesterday .. Telling him .. That if there is another issue he is mad from me because of it.. Face me .. Tell me …instead of this silence and disappearance .. I told him that he did not remove any blocking and that made me confused .. Although he said that he removed it and we were fine while talking on phone .. And I told him that nothing deserves all that .. FACE ME with any issue instead of ignorance .. Unfortunately .. He did not call me till now .. He travelled for a vacation today .. I really do not know what to do .. I want this relationship back.. He considers me a friend not a lover and I know that from the beginning .. And I accept that He is the perfect guy for me … I really do not want him to be angry from me and to continue this block ..

4v9ztu,40,2016-07-29,How to Apply for Graduate School,milker12,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/4v9ztu/how_to_apply_for_graduate_school/,"I’ve seen a lot of questions about grad school in this sub recently (and /r/geology) and see some advice I don’t necessarily agree and a few unanswered questions and I wanted to form a comprehensive guide. I’d like to preface and say that this is specifically for American students so some of the advice might not apply outside of the US, and my expertise comes in hydrogeology, so other disciplines may be slightly different. I welcome any input and dissent among /r/geologycareers. I never had a guide for this and did it on my own, so I hope this can help out those of you looking into the process. 

**Is Grad School right for you?**

Grad school isn’t the right option for everyone, don’t do it because you’re not sure of what you want to do or because you’re not “ready for the real world”. You honestly don’t need a masters to be successful in geology (although today’s market makes them very valuable). For environmental a BS will do fine for lots of jobs (maybe not in today’s market…), for O&amp;G a masters is pretty much a most today, other disciplines will vary. It really depends on your future goals if grad school is a necessity. If you want to do field sampling, a bachelors will be great, if you want to become a researcher with the USGS you’re going to need some more education.

You should do it because you want to commit yourself to researching some really cool things and developing a strong skillset while strengthening your network connections. You get more time for summer internships, get to take more classes in your field of interest, and you get to put all of your skills at your disposal to solve a problem no one else has. 

In today’s market I have to recommend a masters and not PhD for your first degree, even if you’re sure you want to go into academia. Jumping into a PhD is a risky move, and will cause a net negative in career income 9/10 times, so a PhD is definitely not a decision to be taken lightly. Masters are certainly king right now and you can do it fully funded. 

**How can I be competitive for Grad School?**

Schools like a candidate with a wide variety of experiences. They want to see you’ve done undergrad research and presented it at regional/national GSA meetings. They also like internships relevant to your field, like working for an engineering firm or a government agency for a summer. Summer REUs are also huge advantages to applicants, so be on the lookout for those after your sophomore and junior years. To be competitive at mid-tier schools you’ll typically need a GPA &gt; 3.2 and a GRE of 150Q/150V. To be competitive at top programs (top 25 or so) you’ll typically want a GPA &gt; 3.5 and GRE greater than 160Q/155V. These aren’t hard prereqs of course. Other factors such as your connection with a professor at the school, recommendations, and current funding situations can push these stats up or down considerably. 

If you find a class super interesting ask the professor you had if they are looking for any research assistants, many would love the opportunity to work with a bright student. I can’t recommend having undergraduate research enough to make yourself competitive for graduate school. Being able to say “I did research and presented it at a conference” will tell graduate committees you’re a solid candidate.

During undergrad you’ll want to have two semesters each of chemistry, calculus, and physics (preferably calculus based physics) in addition to your core geology curriculum. If you have the opportunity to take more math and chemistry that’s great for applications, and especially good for fields related to those extra classes. If you don’t take these classes you can expect to take them remedially in graduate school.

Take the GRE summer before your senior year and use a prep class (such as an online one like Magoosh). Study for a few months in the summer (maybe 10 hours a week), don’t devote your entire life to it, but know the test pretty well. If you get a decent score (&gt;310 total or so) I wouldn’t bother retaking it, unless you’re shooting for top programs.

You’ll want recommendations from professors who you’ve done research with and who can speak to your ability. Ideally you’ll want 3 professors you’ve done work with, but many of us only have one professor who we worked with so have other recommenders such as other geology profs or internship supervisors. This is another reason why REUs are huge, they allow you to get another reference from an expert who otherwise you would not have been able to work with. 

When I applied for my masters I only had 1 professor recommender, but she was my research mentor and I aced two upper level classes she taught so it was a good letter. The other two letters were from my internship supervisors who were able to speak to my work ethic in my field of interest. They key here is you don’t want your boss from your landscaping job here, you want someone who knows a thing or two about your field.

**How do I find the right Grad School?**

Narrow down your interest, decide if you want to go for oil and gas, hydrogeology, geochemistry, or any other discipline within geology and have potential subfields in mind (for hydrogeology you might be really interested in contaminant transport, for example). The idea is to find a semi-fit between you and a professor. Expand your horizons, consider applying to both computational and field based programs.

Once you know your field, look up schools in states you might find desirable (if you want to stay in the Midwest, look at Big 10 schools for example). If you don’t know where you want to end up google a list of AAU and Carnegie 1 Schools, as these are the nation’s top ranked schools and will typically have the most funding available for graduate students. Go down a list of these schools and google “XXX University Geology Department Faculty”. Once you have a faculty page Ctrl+F a keyword for your goal (e.g. “hydro”, “water”, “petroleum”), and click the professor profiles who match up. If there bio sounds relatively interesting and you think you might have a match make a note of the professors contact info for later. Some schools will have clunky webpages that need a little more work to get around, but in general it’s not too hard in today’s world.

Additionally you can of course ask professors at your own university for recommendations for faculty you could work with, they could have a specific colleague in mind. They could also rate your application and give you target programs.

**The Process**

I would compile a list of maybe 15 professors you think have cool research at schools you would consider attending. I would then send emails to all of these professors, preferably sometime between August and October of your senior year. Send a short 3 paragraph email with an introduction, why you think there research is cool, and why you think there is a fit. With the email attach a CV and your unofficial transcripts. There is no safety schools for grad school, only contact professors if you think there is a legitimate chance you’d go there if accepted and offered funding (obviously you can have preferences). Each application will cost upwards of $80 (Application fee and GRE scores), so don’t waste your money applying to a ton of programs.

A CV is pretty much an expanded resume. To make a simple one take your resume, add a section titled ‘research experience’ and do a few sentence description of your project and state the professor you worked with. Then have another section titled ‘poster presentations’ or something to that line, and put down all posters you’ve presented at your school and conferences related to your research. Finally I would add a section titled ‘awards and honors’ and put down all scholarships you’ve gotten, all research and travel grants, and any other notable achievements. That will work for a CV for any graduate application. Please have a professor go over your resume and CV as sending a bad resume is incredibly embarrassing and unlikely to get a response. 

So after you’ve sent these emails you will get some bites and some no-responses. I would personally not bother applying to schools where the professor didn’t respond as it’s probably not the best sign. The professors who respond may mention their interest in your application and respond in turn with more information such as current projects or their expected funding for the year. They may even offer to have a phone call or meet with you at GSA to discuss the possibility of graduate work under them. From these I would take my top choices and focus on these schools. I’ve known very smart undergrads who only applied to two schools and didn’t get in or got waitlisted at both, so they ended up not ending up at a graduate school. Apply to at least 4, ideally 5 or 6.

Try to keep an ongoing conversation with these advisors throughout fall semester and update them with your semester and how your application is coming along, maybe once every other month send an email. Work diligently on your personal statement during the fall semester and have it proofread numerous times as this is one of your main selling points in your application. Each school should have personalized statements and discuss your fit with the professor at that school and why you're a strong candidate.

Once your application is in it’s a waiting game until early spring semester before you hear details. Some programs will send cold rejection emails and nothing more, others will offer to pay for you to fly to visit the program if they like you. When you’re deciding take the visits seriously and don’t bother wasting a Friday flying to a school you’re not interested in. Choose the professor you feel most comfortable with, not just based on how prestigious the program is. If a school doesn’t offer to fund your degree (via Teaching Assistantships or Research Assistantships) consider it a rejection, do not go to grad school unfunded. Don’t rush to sign a letter of intent from the first offer you get, wait until you have heard from your top programs. Most R1s honor April 15th for commitments, so don’t feel rushed. Offers will typically come out anywhere from late February to late April.

**Miscellaneous**

When I applied for grad school the first time I applied to 6 schools, and got in to 5 of them and fully funded at 4 of them. Of the 5 that offered me 4 also offered to pay for me to visit at the department’s expense. I took up two schools on their visits since they were my top 2 remaining and declined the others. In the end I declined a few of the top ranked hydro programs for a less prestigious one because I liked the project a lot and had a very good fit with the advisor and recognized that the advisor was very well connected in the area I eventually wanted to work in. I had a tough time deciding but it was definitely the right decision to follow my gut. Later for my PhD I ended up going to one of the “elite” programs.

On a side note if anyone is curious in my opinion the top **hydrogeology** programs right now (in no particular order) are Stanford, Wisconsin-Madison, Colorado Boulder, Arizona, and Penn State. Honorable mentions go to New Mexico Tech, Clemson, Kansas, Iowa State, and UT – Austin. I’m not going to rank top geology programs in general because each school has its own strengths and weaknesses. I left out plenty of good hydro programs so don’t feel like these are the only ‘good’ schools by any means. I would argue prestige isn’t as important for a masters (except Oil and Gas), but if you’re going for a PhD you definitely want a top ranked program. 

I know this was lengthy but hopefully you got through it. If you have any questions or need clarification on anything please post, I’d be glad to help as best as I can. If you disagree with anything or have anything to add please do, I’d love to see other opinions related to grad school."

I'm focused on embedded systems mostly, FPGA's etc, low level applications (C to ASM), and some DSP here and there.   I spent 5 years to get my bachelors, and set up my masters. Doing this allowed me to finish up my masters in one year, so 6 to go from highschool to masters.   My university was lacking in general for CompE instructors, and so most of what I learned was through broad guidance and lectures. For reference, I was never aware of ZYNQ chips asynchronous multiprocessing (AMP) being a thing, and had never worked with a real time operating system. 

*I've had a few internships where I build up ZYNQ systems or a custom embedded microprocessor from scratch, but I aside from those and personal projects, my experience is limited. 

I've known that there is a lot that I don't know and I am learning a *LOT* in this first month at my current job.  I know C pretty well, C++ a little less. VHDL and ASM I'm very good with. Python, bash, perl, etc I'm competent in as well.. (see: common languages from 2000's).  

To get to the point, I'm wondering if anyone can give me some advice on where to go from here. Important languages to learn (I'm starting on Verilog &amp; system Verilog / system C), or things to be aware of.  I'm aware D is getting popular in robotics too.  

Really, at what point do I know too much but not enough?  Would moving to different jobs periodically look bad?"

The schools in particular I plan on applying to:

* UC Berkeley
* UC Los Angeles
* UC San Diego
* UC Irvine
* UC Santa Cruz

Extracurriculars: President of CS club, Volunteer programmer for school, Summer internship as a developer, JV swim team (1yr only)

**Questions**

Do my academics justify mainly applying to UC's being a good idea (and do I even have a chance at Cal/UCLA) or should I look at CSU's as well? Is there a reason why I should also look at private universities as well?

And then I realized that I didn't have any good reason why it is the case that it is unretrievable. Pushbullet already broke down the obviously frivolous barrier of easily and instantly sharing content between your devices, and extending that content to the clipboard. But the content sharing of the clipboard doesn't have the history that the rest of the content does. And I can't think of why there would be any technical barriers to that, being that Pushbullet's servers already have the content in them to offer universal copy and past. It is just a matter of saving them the DB, and making it another tab in the ui.

This could be an intern project and would be a game changer!

Please, please, please make this happen, and make it happen soon! My life is missing out on that functionality, and if you don't offer it, I will end up having to spend dozens of hours myself setting this up, and end up having to pay to host a server for myself.

4vaxpc,1,2016-07-30,"My [25m] Girlfriend [22f] Has no General Interests or Passion, or Respect for Me",grherbel,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4vaxpc/my_25m_girlfriend_22f_has_no_general_interests_or/,"Hi everyone,

Let me say that I know that the whole “we have no common interests” thing is a cliché by now. I’m thinking my situation goes a little bit beyond that, but I guess we’ll see. I am also having trouble condensing all my thoughts into a cohesive flow, so I’m going the bullet-point route. 


**My background:**


* Haven’t dated much

* I was homeschooled, fairly sheltered


**The situation:**

* Been dating a girl for almost two years
* She’s currently doing an internship four states away
* She’s been gone two months
* I’ve had time to reflect



**The issues:**


* We have no common interests. But more than that, she doesn’t seem to have interests… period. I have the following main passions: music, the outdoors, fitness. Lesser ones: books, movies. It’s not just that she doesn’t like my music, my taste in movies, or weight lifting. It’s that she doesn’t like any version of those things. Movies are generally boring. She can’t “get into reading.” She doesn’t listen to music, and she hates working out in any way. The outdoors… kind of? She’s open to it, but never experiences the awe of nature that I do. I suggested a book to her today that I loved and thought that she would, too. I thought we could discuss it after. She refused to give it a shot.

* She is very, very rarely intimate with me. She likes to cuddle, but doesn’t like to kiss beyond a peck. She used to like it more, it seemed. I’ve asked her why she isn’t much into sex-related stuff, and she said maybe she got it all out in high school (?!). I asked why she doesn’t like to kiss me much anymore. At first, she kind of laughed it off. When pressed, she said she didn’t know. I couldn’t get any more out of her.

* It’s impossible to have a deep conversation. Anything I bring up gets short responses or dismissive acceptance. Example: Recently, I opened up (to the point of vulnerability) about how I’m having a hard time with my job, and she said, “yeah, it’s tough.” That was that. I wished I hadn’t said anything. What we normally talk about is limited to what we’re doing at the time or how our days went.

* I feel like she doesn’t respect me. She never hesitates to point out when something I like is stupid to her. Last weekend I went to see Star Trek. I told her that’s what I was doing, and she said the movie sounded stupid. I recently shared a song with her as kind of a joke, knowing it wasn’t her style, but she listened to the first part and said it was awful and disgusting (this was a Skillet song, guys). That hurts, and I told her that. She said “Sorry I made you feel that way,” and that’s it. I think she thought I was hurt because she didn’t like it, which is not the case. It’s how she made me feel about liking it myself. I attempted to explain the difference, but I don’t think it took. 

* More on the respect issue: I have a dream of being a writer, and I am making some money with that (but I’m also working two day jobs). I’d love to make it a main income someday, and I mentioned that once. She said, “yeah, but you can’t make a living doing that. You need benefits. It’s really a hobby, right?” That might be true, sure, but at least I have a dream, right? 



So, after having typed all that out, it looks like there’s three main points that I’m struggling with:


1. She has no interests or passion beyond the Bachelor, therefore we have nothing to discuss. She is unwilling to try any of my stuff (except an occasional camping trip). 


2. She shows no sign of respect for me. Hopefully that comes across in the right way to you… I’m not demanding it, but I do think I’ve earned it. 


3. She seems unable to communicate with me effectively, and I don’t know what to do about it. 

You may be wondering what attracted me to her in the first place. Well, she’s very attractive, has a goofy sense of humor (like me), super-sweet personality, great with kids, we have the same core values and beliefs, and she was very open with me about her life up to the point I met her, so communication seemed great. What does she like about me? No idea. 


I don’t know what to do, guys. She comes back in a week, and I want to have a big, long, face-to-face conversation about the root issues here. I’m hoping this all makes sense to someone out there who has a bit more experience with relationships than I do (I was sheltered). What do I do if she won’t respond in a meaningful way? When it happens, this can’t be a one-side conversation. 


tl;dr: girlfriend has no interests or passions of her own, doesn't want to try mine (calls them stupid), and can't seem to communicate about it. "

I went on two rotations: ops and now in dev. I did my part for ops but was informed in the mid point review that I don't ask for help when stuck, should communicate more, ask more questions and be more proactive in getting work. They assured that technical ability is not a problem but my attitude and soft skills are a deal-breaker if I want to work for them after my degree.

The truth is different though. I am NOT confident in my technical ability and that is why I am seen so passive. I actually like to pester experienced people with questions but I simply suck technically. I can't even formulate a right question. I am only a week into second part of the internship in dev role and got this confirmed. The code base is huge, written in a language I don't know, using web dev methodologies I am not aware of and principles from networking classes that I could not take. In other words, a new grad with my background would fail the interviews completely for this team. All developers in the team are of senior level, there are no new grads without experience and they are not looking to hire newbies to their team because work they do is critical to whole infrastructure and they cannot afford mistakes.

I was told to reflect on those remarks and turn the ship around in a remaining month. I am grossly underqualified for a role technically and apparently suck in social situations, making me a horrible candidate. I was questioning if career in software is for me as well and was diagnosed with medium depression by a doctor. It causes me to be disinterested in most things. I am doing okay in CS and like the material but when it comes to programming, I just seem to lack passion for it.

I also remember a couple of interviews I attended where the feedback was that 'you just give a wrong vibe' or 'we are looking for better soft skills and technical knowledge'. I guess the comment about 'vibe' was that I was not showing enthusiasm etc. I did mess up on a couple of technical questions but recovered afterwards. I also asked a fair amount of questions about how team works, software lifecycle and training/help available. I concluded that lack of passion for software seems to be a big 'no hire' indicator for the above interview experiences.

I would appreciate some advice regarding this. "

I graduated about a year ago with my MSW and was able to secure a job right after in a different state.  I knew going into SW that I did not want to be a clinician, as my interests skew more macro and program management.  The position I accepted is very clinical, but when I was offered the position I was told that I would be doing case management and working with a population that I have a high interest in working with (Deaf and Hard of Hearing).  I had done a clinical internship and was comfortable in taking a clinical position, with the understanding that it would help me get the experience I need in the field to work my way into a more macro position.  This job being clinical does give me hours and supervision towards my LCSW.  I learned quickly that I would not be doing much case management and ended up not being able to work with my preferred population.  I am actually doing primarily therapy with individuals with ASD.  

I'm now looking for a different position after giving this one about a year.  I've been networking as much as possible and most people from this area are telling me to stick it out until I get the LCSW.  The thing is, I don't think I can stick around.  I'm increasingly frustrated by the job itself for reasons I don't want to go into too much detail on, but mainly it is not a good fit. It has gotten to the point that I am starting to consider leaving SW in general (which I am not ready to do). 

Now to my question.  I have been offered a position with CPS and I am very excited about it. However, it will not help me get me to my LCSW.  I'm torn about whether I should stick it out and try to find something else that will help me get my LCSW (as I'm already half way there) or if I should go for the CPS position.

This is bad on it's own but I also have a compromised respiratory system because of a double wammy of walking pneumonia and some other infection as a teenager. If I come down with pneumonia again I'll need to go to the hospital. 

Well shortly after moving in together FDH scared the crap out of me. I woke up to see him shaking and having breathing trouble in his sleep (he snores badly). He wouldn't believe me so I texted his mother to see if this had ever happened before. She said not this specifically but there was A LOT of other health stuff that my SO was ignorant of. His memory was something that concerned me so I asked her if she'd mind if I popped by to get some notes on family history to bring to the doctor. She said not at all. I should have known better.

So I show up notebook in tow. She asked what's been going on with him and I tell her general stuff...Sleeping  a lot, snoring, poor memory, etc etc...In particular I was concerned about sleep apnea. FMIL instead pulls cat butt face and says she believes him to be depressed.    Apparently there's an extensive history of depression and other mental illnesses in his immediate family. As someone with a history of depression (who was in the beginning of a depressive episode at the time) this was really upsetting. 

She explains how she believes that ""it's just all become too much."" I ask her what she means...She explains that she believes we moved in together too soon (we were nearly 23 and 24 and had been together for 3 years. He was a college grad and I was in my last semester). She said that she believed ""the pressure of getting a job (that I pushed him to interview for...That he'd had for more than 6 months...And he worked from home), supporting you, and moving out"" had just driven him into a deep depression. For some reference he was supporting us monetarily at the time but that didn't mean I wasn't pulling my weight. I had my own job, was studying for my GRE, teaching a class, doing 90% of the housework, and paying for my own animals and expenses. I was doing the absolute best I could and was seriously over worked. I was having regular panic attacks and just felt like shit. I didn't have time to see my friends, some nights I didn't have time to shower, I was getting sick, and eventually the house turned to hell because I just didn't have the time to clean it. 

FMIL proceeded to ask ""When is your lease up? Did you sign six months or a year?"" I told her a year...See she'd hoped that if it was up in a few months FDH could just move back home with her. She said she'd have a talk with him but for me not to tell him I'd spoken with her because (and I quote) ""He can see me manipulating a mile away...Plus he'll be mad that you talked to me behind his back""  As I was about to leave, just feeling like total shit, she stopped me and said ""You know I don't think it would be a bad idea if you told him you wanted a break, took your animals to your parents, and just stayed there for a week or so to give him some time to himself."" 

I went home and FDH could immediately tell something was up. At first I lied and said I just wasn't feeling well...Then i just broke down in ugly tears. Snot everywhere. He put down whatever he was doing, snuggled me, and asked what the hell was going on. I just blubbered out something about making him depressed. He laughed and said ""What? I'm not depressed! And if I was YOU definitely wouldn't be the cause of it! You're the best thing in my life. Where is this coming from."" So I told him. At first it was ""well she's just being a mom. The depression stuff is just a mom being concerned about her kid"" Then I got to the ""she suggested I tell you I want a break"" thing. I don't think I've ever seen his face change so quickly. He was ready to tell his mother off but I (stupidly) said not to because I was afraid it would blow back onto me.

A few weeks later we were visiting for some reason...And this bitch starts ragging on our house. Yes it was our first place so naturally it was shitty...But damn isn't it kinda supposed to be? She tells him ""When you work from home you should come here! I'll make you a snack and then just leave you alone."" He asked why on earth he'd do that when he has his own place? She says ""Well it would be different if your place was actually NICE but it's just so small, dark, and depressing."" Oh lord...""Mom that was exceptionally rude. Our place isn't big but I like it because it's OURS. I'd rather be there in OUR HOUSE than here in  yours any day."" We left shortly after that. 

She tried to pull the same shit when our lease was up a couple of months ago and moved into our new, beautiful, place...""Oh that's SO EXPENSIVE! Did ya'll sign a 6 month lease or a year?"" This time I let FDH deal with it ""mom we looked at less expensive places and they were either too far away from work, in an unsafe location, or in really bad condition. This is in our budget and we like it."" ""Well I just think you shouldn't be renting and saving your money to buy a house and move away."" ""FMIL what do you suggest then?!"" ""WELL I THINK YA'LL MOVED OUT TOO SOON AND SHOULD HAVE WAITED!"" ""FMIL we were 23 and 24 years old and together 3 years. How much longer should we have waited?!"" ""I'm not talking about this anymore...""  You're right FMIL. We won't be discussing this anymore. We are goddamn adults and we do very well for two people less than 2 years out of our bachelor degrees. We have a beautiful home, great careers, completely support ourselves, and have a pretty bitchin life. Take your salty ass somewhere else. 

Honestly this bitch...All of her kids have the hardest time being adults. I was the reason FDH got his first job (at 21) which she kicked and screamed about (he was TOO YOUNG and should have been concentrating on his studies...He'd just get a good job out of college). I'm the reason FDH finally moved out of his parents (at 24 years old she said he was too young). I'm the reason he applied to the internship that got him the job he has now...Oh and I'm the reason he applied for that job too. I found our first home. I found our second home. I'm the one who taught him how to make a doctor's appointment (24). I'm the one who's gotten him to eat healthy goddamn food (seriously. When we got together his veggies were limited to green beans from the can, corn, and potatoes. It was hamburgers all day every day). Shortly before our first anniversary she told him we were ""getting too serious too quickly""...WTF does that mean? We weren't living together (and wouldn't for 2 more years), we weren't engaged. We had a normal fucking relationship for a 20 and 21 year old! For fucks sake I taught him how to use a goddamn mop (21).  Every single time he's done anything remotely adult my crabby cakes MIL criticizes and bitches about how he's ""too young' to do normal ass adult shit. But yes bitch. I'm the one who made him depressed and he totally needs to move back in with you. "

So the basis of this scene is that I play a young (college-aged) nurse or caregiver who is a genuine do-gooder type, sweet and spunky. Her first job (either intern or recent grad) involves caring for a few older men who live in a home by themselves. It might be attached to a larger hospital or retirement home but these guys, while older, have certain degree of independence while still requiring some help. 

The effect that the presence of a young, fresh-faced and eager girl with them is noticeable and, at first, she delights in being a bit teasing and flirty with them. 

But, she quickly realizes that teasing alone would be cruel and figures, why not, she can make these men feel good in other ways too! So she quickly becomes their enthusiastic sex toy, delighting in the attention and the compliments they give her as she uses her body to get them off just about any way she can. 

Thats the basic gist of it, just a good-natured girl ""giving back"" in her own special way. I want it to be rather teasing at first and we can escalate it at different paces for different characters (please be open to playing a few!). We can work out characters and backstory in PMs as well as anything else that we should go over. 

Kinks are definitely up for discussion but I'm thinking teasing, exhibitionism oral, anal, cumplay, etc. are good. Possibly we could work in some toys, watersports (if you're into that), and whatever else.

Hope to hear from you!"

About me: I have an AAS in Computer Science from a Community/Technical college in Minnesota. I have quite a few other credits from an additional AAS, and misc. Liberal Arts credits. I achieved these degrees online and am comfortable with difficult classes in this environment. In my AAS I saw a broad coverage of languages, learning COBOL, VB, C++, Java, Python, SQL, and MS Access (and a bit more). Now I'd like to focus on what I think of as 'higher level' topics such as algorithms, discrete math, calculus, and generally bigger picture software development. I've never...actually coded anything outside of class. Partly due to work and life limitations, but really it's a matter of I'm just not that motivated outside of work to work on it. Please let me know if it's a huge red flag, as I sometimes wonder if this is the right career path for me. I'm passionate about new technologies, and love to read about emerging tech, specifically consumer products, and love helping a building people up. I see myself as working for a few years learning the ropes, and then trying to focus on teaching within a company, or possibly recruiting...

Limits: I am limited to online, as I am active duty military and not able to move to a school, or be committed to one near me. My ability to have an internship during school is limited due to this, as well. Also that means the school must be regionally accredited for my tuition assistance. While I'm not explicitly against 'Private, For Profit' schools, I am definitely leery of them. 

My plan is to finish this bachelor's in the next 3 years, as well as my military commitment. It's difficult to narrow down the school choices, or know what online options are worth their salt. 

I'm getting a bit wordy, so I'll end here and answer any questions you might have. I'll just end with saying I've been so encouraged by this community. Your interactions and helping others is awesome to see. "

For purely financial reasons, I haven't finished cool, however, I've spent the last several years studying (and attempting to ""breaking into"") copywriting.

I've attempted freelancing to little success (and several burning experiences), I've constructed a creative spec portfolio, I've done an internship with a startup company, and I've interviewed for a handful of *paid* writing positions (without any offers).

In that time, I haven't had a day job because I quite literally wasn't able to find one in the depressed part of the Pacific Northwest I was living in; even Vector Marketing stood me up.

I've since moved back to my hometown of Minneapolis. I'm likely looking back at returning to school for my marketing degree. Things have improved a little, but I still don't have a job, and that this point, I'm frankly terrified of the idea of working after being out of the arena for so long.

My last ""real"" job was night shift janitorial work at a major concert venue (which is a fancy way of saying I scraped up beer-crusted confetti off the floor). It was tough work, and I had some scary experiences walking back home in the small hours (I couldn't afford a car back then, either). 

That's kind of what I know, and I'm genuinely scared of the idea of working now. I've invested so much of my self-worth into how I ""earn my bread"" and have just fundamentally *not* earned said bread for so long, that it's difficult for me to make sense of it.

I've kind of resigned to the fact that I lack the credentials and experience to get an entry-level job in my chosen field, so I'm biting the bullet and looking at significant debt (like a lot of us) so that I can finish my degree.

I'm terrified that I won't have the opportunity to enter the bottom rung until I'm in my late twenties, and I'm more terrified of the idea that I might do things ""the right way"" with a mixture of obtaining credentials and dipping into entrepreneurship and ""new economy"" ventures, and just not make it.

I know, a lot of this probably sounds like it's me. I'm willing to admit that I'm certainly *some*of the problem, and I know I'm quite depressed about my lack of financial independence and ownership, but it ain't all one me.

It's a week in which a well-known personality is trying to prove he truly belongs in the big leagues.

I'm talking about Stephen Colbert. To the surprise of many, ""The Late Show With Stephen Colbert"" has taken a long time to forge an identity. Is it a talk-show spoof? ""Charlie Rose"" with laughs?

Problems in the ratings and a change in executive producers have proved that no one is quite sure. It failed to get an Emmy nomination as best variety series.

This week, ""The Late Show"" is going live, to best react to whatever happens at the Republican Convention, and Colbert has responded with his best shows yet. There's a relaxed tone in his delivery and jokes that reflects its host has come home. After all, political conventions is where Colbert first made his mark as a ""Daily Show"" correspondent.

Colbert's re-introduction Monday of his old Comedy Central persona -- the Bill O'Reilly clone who pledges allegience to ""truthiness"" - gave a lot of us goosebumps, and not just because it came with a Jon Stewart cameo.

Colbert had found himself -- by playing someone who is not himself. Since then, he seems more interested in serving his own instincts rather than the audience, a wise rule for anyone not named Jimmy Fallon.

The interviews over the last two days have been shorter -- and sharper. Colbert has abandoned, at least temporarily, his urge to ""show off"" his intelligence and versatility (The exception: A taped musical number on Monday night that I could have done without).

He's more willing to showcase others, most notably Broadway standout Laura Benanti who did a wicked impersonation of Melania Trump Tuesday night.He even made clever use of a quick-witted intern who he brought out to talk about her impromptu make-out session with guest Keegan-Michael Key (also very funny in a sketch about being the only black man at the convo).

He's also stopped straining to show how much affection he has for bandleader Jon Batiste, spotlighting fresh musical guests instead. Tuesday's performance by NAF, a new group led by Jenny Lewis, was simply terrific.

This is also supposed to be a golden opportunity for Trevor Noah, but he didn't take much advantage of the ""Daily Show"" being in Cleveland on night one. He might as well have been broadcasting from Duluth.

Both Noah and Colbert poked fun at Trump's rock-star entrance before introducing his wife. Colbert's walk on, which included a tribute to James Bond movies, was better.

Noah, who I like a lot, may eventually rock in Cleveland. Colbert may fall back on old habits. But right now, the veteran holds a commanding lead.

The race for laughs gets even more heated on Wednesday with special editions of ""Full Frontal With Samantha Bee"" and ""Real Time With Bill Maher.""

I'm gonna be up late.

I graduated in 2012 and have been working since, now going for my masters. 

Here in India, we do not have flexibility to opt in for courses. The colleges have a fixed syllabus for every stream. So someone doing a B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering would be given 5-6 subjects (you call them courses) to be studied every semester. You cannot replace the course with something you find useful.
 
Now I am totally confused on what I need to select and how many courses to complete. My program requires me to complete 4 (at least 2 from department) graduate half courses in the first 8 months (fall and winter) before I can move to the internship phase of next 8 months (summer and fall). Since this is a professionals master's degree and the time involved in class is just 2 semesters, I was wondering if I could soak some decent knowledge in ML and Distributed Computing.

So my current enrolment looks like:

* CSC2221H F (Fall) Introduction to the Theory of Distributed Computing
* CSC2515H F (Fall) Introduction to Machine Learning
* CSC2415H S (Winter) Advanced Topics in Distributed Computing

I need to select one more course (if I understand the concept of half graduate course correctly). I was looking for *CSC2541H S (Winter) Topics in Machine Learning* or *CSC2506H S (Winter) Probabilistic Learning and Reasoning* but both of them have their sections full and I cannot enrol in. Moreover I can select 2 courses from other departments, but have no idea where to locate relevant courses in other departments.

Anyone who can guide me on this or can discuss the pros/cons of this particular course selection would be great!

4vfm4k,8,2016-07-31,On the job safety?,vid_eng_throwaway,VIDEOENGINEERING,https://www.reddit.com/r/VIDEOENGINEERING/comments/4vfm4k/on_the_job_safety/,"How do you handle on the job safety where you work? I work for a university and our events are almost exclusively crewed by student interns. Neither myself nor my boss have ever received anything in the way of safety training.

Nothing is setting off alarm bells for me, but I have some concerns.

* Sometimes we put cameras on single sections of scaffolding. Do we need handrails all the way around? Can we climb the side of the scaffold or do we need stairs or a ladder?
* The camera positions in the press box all have garage doors that open to the outside. The ledge seems a little on the low side and there are anchors on the floor. Are we supposed to be tying ourselves off? If yes, how do we tie off the talent?
* Some of our camera positions are on steel platforms with integrated ladders and handrails. Do we have to tie ourselves off there?
* What's our responsibility to visiting TV crews? Are we responsible for making them follow the rules?
* Do we have to take any special care in inclement weather? Extension cords in the rain, frostbite in the cold, lightning safety, etc.
* What about trip hazards? Do we need yellow jackets for everything?

I brought my concerns to my boss and we kicked it up the chain. Unfortunately, the answer we got wasn't that useful. Our higher up seemed to agree that we had valid concerns, but he wasn't really sure about any of it himself. He also wanted to avoid calling in the campus safety people. He seemed to think they would blow everything way out of proportion and that we would end up with more than we bargained for. Frankly, I can see his point and he's also not somebody I want to make an enemy out of.

At this point I'm not really sure what to do. I don't think anybody in our department is qualified to handle any of this safety stuff. I don't want to make enemies nor do I want to have the safety folks come in and make mountains out of mole hills.

Advice?

4vfnqg,0,2016-07-31,Concerns about freshman year internships,mrstat88,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4vfnqg/concerns_about_freshman_year_internships/,"Hi, I will be a freshman at a top 5 CS university this fall. I have been doing some research lately on the best ways to secure summer internships. A lot of the advice says things like make your own website, do some personal projects, have some stuff on your own github, etc. 

This concerns me because I have very little coding experience and haven't done any personal projects and don't know any HTML or CSS, and most internship applications open this fall and close around December. I'm worried that I won't be able to do well in my classes or socially while teaching myself how to make a website or do personal projects.

Overall, there just seems to be very little time to have a decently bulky resume unless you've been coding for a while. Any tips or feedback would be much appreciated!"
4vfo6e,17,2016-07-31,My (mostly positive) story of 2L year - why law school can be good for some people,ojndsfgoaog,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/4vfo6e/my_mostly_positive_story_of_2l_year_why_law/,"So I was one of those people who went to law school because I had nothing else to do. Got great grades in undergrad, etc. but totally lost when it came to the real world. Career student.

I read up on here and other places about how big a mistake I made, but it turned out to be the opposite. I hope this helps a few people considering law school out there, or who are in it and doubting what they can get from their experience. I'm not at an amazing T14 school. I'm at a T2, but I've still grown tremendously as a person in 2 years - more specifically, in 1 year (2L year).

**ALL of this happened within 1 year**:

* OCI - My first EVER interviews were OCI. I was a sheltered, spoiled tendie loving kid for all intents and purposes. I'm good socially, but never had to get a job where I interviewed. I did well at OCI, but didn't land a job because a) it's hard to at a T2 and b) I didn't even have a 1L summer internship!
* Landed a solid 2L summer gig despite not doing that 1L summer internship. Note that my grades were still pretty solid and I interviewed well, so that carried me, but I lazily skipped 1L summer. Obviously still wouldn't recommend skipping 1L summer AT ALL - it's my 1 big law school regret because it cost me any shot during OCI.
* Made law review, which sharpened attention to detail. 
* Made a lot of new friends through one change - I stopped waiting for people to come to me and approached them. A total heel turn - I have a good core of friends now, and a lot of solid acquaintances (including professors) just by doing that. There are people I met this past year that I can't even believe I hadn't met a year ago, because we quickly bonded over law school shit. 
* Tried a (mock) case and won it. I remember walking out of as a mock juror during 1L thinking how I'd have to do that in 2L, and I couldn't possibly do it. I did, and it was actually fun.
* Got an interview for a state supreme court internship (didn't expect it due to my lack of a 1L summer and the other candidates), then landed that internship, then wrote the full opinion for a case. By far my biggest confidence booster. Told the judge and clerks that I'd never forget them taking a chance on me.
* Internship, 2L job, law review, advocacy course made it so I don't fear LRW nearly as much as I used to. It's still a lot of work, but I believe I can do it now
* Started on the path to fixing my crippling depression and anxiety. I have phobias I can't even post on a throwaway. I'm able to mask them with a smile, but they are debilitating and come from a lack of interaction and fear of rejection that's built over my whole life. This year changed that in a *huge* way... just by forcing myself to send in a few applications and say a few hellos on top of studying.
* Last but not least, fell in love

It might have been the best year of my life. My point in posting this isn't to gloat, it's to show you that it's possible for you to evolve quickly in law school and grow a lot. It's not all doom and gloom. I did my school work in 1L, but I didn't have any summer job and hardly talked to anyone. I'm at a T2 school not a T14. I didn't have a reason to go to law school at all. I went because I was a good student. Yes, I made law review, so I wasn't ""lazy"" in terms of studying - but I lacked so many strengths that others had... everyone else seemed to have a goal in mind and I didn't. Everyone seemed to be in rhythm, and I wasn't.

All of that can change in 1 year. I took more chances last year than I ever had before... I genuinely didn't even expect interviews, yet I landed that state supreme court internship over people who (seriously) were considerably higher ranked and just as, if not more capable, than me; I had maybe 3 real friends from 1L. Many of the people I befriended this year didn't even know I existed, that's how much of a ghost I was in 1L. The girl I fell in love with said as much to me!

You can better your situation in big ways no matter what school you're at, what reason you're in law school, or what you have or haven't accomplished yet. Give yourself a serious push and I'm sure you'll see growth in *at least* one way, if not more... and some stuff might be very unexpected. 

Good luck!"
4vfrwh,1,2016-07-31,MacBook choice for Journalism student,ChickenParme,AppleWhatShouldIBuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWhatShouldIBuy/comments/4vfrwh/macbook_choice_for_journalism_student/,"Hello,

First, I apologize if this is an inappropriate place to post this. It involves a few questions pertaining to my specific situation, though I would understand if the moderators must remove it. 

I'm leaving for college (undergrad freshman) in a little less than a month, and I don't have a laptop. I didn't have one through high school, just used a desktop at home.

I understand that this is a poor time to purchase a MacBook. That side, it's probably unwise of me to go to college with no computer.

Just to give some background, I am a journalism major in NYC. I don't anticipate changing my major, at least in the imminent future. I'm hoping to snag an internship but that's optimistic. My classes this year include a journalism course, a communications course, a psychology course, and a public speaking course. My school recommends a MacBook (not necessarily the Pro) for the major. 

While I'm not entirely sure what the classes are like at the moment, I don't anticipate having to do a lot of work (such as video editing) that requires a lot of processing power. Again, not entirely familiar with the courses. 

I use my computer to create and edit documents/presentations (mostly using Google Docs), check and respond to emails (frequently for work), FaceTime, download large video files, browse Reddit, sync my phone, upload photos to the cloud, and occasionally stream video. -- pretty basic stuff. I'm hoping I am able to use this computer for around five years. 

I have a few options, and I was wondering, which one, if any, are advisable:

(All models would be entry-level)

1. Purchase the 2015 MacBook Pro

2. Purchase 2015 MacBook

3. Purchase 2016 MacBook 

4. Purchase ~$300 Windows 10 computer, use it until 2016 MacBook Pro is released. I'm not super comfortable with this option as money is sorta tight with an already-burdensome student loan, in addition to having a potentially poor-performing laptop. 

I was leaning towards purchasing a 2015 MacBook. My reasoning is that I'm not a heavy user, it is nearly identical to the 2016 MacBook, the portability is very convenient, and the lack of bleed from the backlit keyboard is also nice considering I do a lot late at night (not nearly a deal breaker of course). 

Some cons include the smaller size and the lack of USB ports, and presumably lower battery life. It's priced about the same as the MBP, and I would be making a lot of sacrifices performance-wise (though I'm not sure a user like myself would necessarily be affected) and I would really, really hate it if the new MBP came out a month later boasting way better features.

My profuse apologies for the wall of text, I thank you if you have read (or skimmed) this far as I have had extreme difficulty making this decision. Thank you

4vfs4r,2,2016-07-31,I hate my retail job so much it's making me miserable. How can I quit without causing any issues?,notsomagical,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4vfs4r/i_hate_my_retail_job_so_much_its_making_me/,"So I was hired at my local Disney Store about a month and a half ago. I had previously worked at Walt Disney World in the College Program and I loved it, so when I moved back home I applied at my local Disney Store to get some of that Disney magic. I liked it at first, but pretty much since training ended I've hated it. It's ended up to be nothing like I thought it would, and I'm being scrutinized and judged my entire shift. It involves a lot of upselling, which I'm not comfortable with, and I feel like I have to be too fake. I have to come up with these corny ways of saying things which I don't like. Overall I just don't think working at the Disney Store is a good fit for me, and I want to leave.

I want to work for the company again, and if I end this job on bad terms I could be listed as a restricted rehire, or not hirable at all. So it's really important that I don't end this job badly. When I was hired I told my manager that I was ending school this summer so I would be free the rest of the year, and I told her that I was fine with the hours so I can't complain about my schedule.

I'm going to see if it's possible to transfer from the Disney Store to Disney World, and hopefully that's possible and can happen asap. But if I can't transfer within the next few weeks, then I need another option, because I won't make it much longer. I dread work so much, and it's making me miserable, and I'm so tempted to just quit, but since it'll affect my future status with the company I haven't yet.

So since I know I won't make it here much longer, what is the best way or reason to quit? If I found an internship related to my degree would my manager still view that badly? I've also never quit a job before, they've kinda just ended or had a time limit, so how do I even do that? I really wanted this job to work and I'm really upset it isn't, but it's nothing like I thought it would be, and I need to move on to make myself happy. 

TL;DR: I hate my job, it's not what I expected, but I want to work for the company in the future. What is the best way to quit without burning any bridges?"
4vftm1,1,2016-07-31,How to handle settling into new job?,csburner,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4vftm1/how_to_handle_settling_into_new_job/,"I was recently hired into a dev position which I frankly thought was a shot in the dark when applying, I thought I had bombed interview, and then got a stellar offer. I was going into senior year of school, but looking for jobs or well paying internships because I couldn't afford rent any longer. 

So I am now in my first job, without a degree, when the offer was made they acknowledged I would be 'sort of like a junior dev' but that they treated all their devs more or less the same. I'm not super managed in my job, was handed code base day one told to look over it and start trying to fix bugs on the board. It's nice to not have someone breathing over my shoulder, but at the same time it would be nice to have some good guidance in first dev job. (The hire previous to me with 5 years experience has stated publicly that our onboarding process is shit.... which for essentially a junior dev isn't ideal.) Anyways, I got some bugs fixed that first week, am learning my way around the code base, and the languages and frameworks we use.

However, I can't shake the feeling that I was a mistake in their hiring process, and I'm working 70+ hrs a week partially because of that. We are actively growing and have interviewed 10 experienced, qualified devs in the last week and made 0 offers. Why on earth would you hire me for experienced dev price when I can contribute less? (I'd probably feel more secure in my job if they paid me 30k less)

It would be nice to have more gentle guidance at least like ""hey here is an item on the board that you should look at,"" or perhaps an idea of what being successful looks like, but all I have to go off is what everyone else here gets done. I'm working about 70 hrs a week trying to learn all the new stuff and contribute to the team, and stressed even though I have indication that I'm doing poorly. 

I have a one on one with manager weekly and CTO monthly, and would like to use these to talk about my concerns without coming off as completely in over my head (ie I don't want to lose my job). Any good ideas on what to say, how to get in less over my head?

**tl;dr: Started first job, feel like I'm seeking have little guidance at work, feel like I'm overpayed. Want to convey feelings, maybe get some guidance, get an idea of how I'm doing from management so that hopefully I can stress less and get up to speed faster without getting fired. Help? **"
4vfywf,1,2016-07-31,21 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4vfywf/21_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong.

As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation.

Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my kinklist if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!

During my time at university, I found that CS is awesome and I liked a wide variety of CS areas that I got to explore. I also have grades in around 10% percentile of people at top institution for CS among mostly excellent, smart individuals. My programming chops are weak though. I am too slow and don't enjoy coding that much. I am also having hard time at my internship right now where I try to make sense of huge web hosting system written by ancient programmers using ancient tech like Perl. Honestly, I am underqualified for the role because whole team are senior engineers with 10+ years exp in development and they do not accept new grads there. I went for CS because there was nothing at a time that peeked my interest more. I work on an Android app though and enjoy it so far but find professional development intimidating and my morale is at all time low.

This experience got me thinking about how I can best contribute to the world. Another area would be life sciences. I looked into bioinformatics. The reqs seem daunting though: PhD in the field, heavy algorithmic thinking component. I cannot answer most questions I see on Glassdoor, Leetcode and was trying to become better but I learn so slow that cannot help to think that my brain are not wired for software engineering unlike some other excellent people and friends I know. While persistence and hard work would make me an average developer, I hardly see myself happy in the long run.

I also recognise that time is ticking away...and that it is harder to turn ship around when older and commited to a career. I am 23 right now. I don't see myself being more than average in this field. I think that working in the field that enhances science and lives of people like bioinformatics would keep me content with what I am doing though. I just don't know if I am good enough for this.

Can people comment on my observations so far? Anyone working in health IT industry or bioinformatics? I am in UK if that helps."

My dream has always been to finish my novel but it's been in the works for the last 3 years, writing a script, drawing out characters, I've finished two pages almost (graphic novel) but I still always go back to change things. nobody is impressed with my drawings and I don't really get support, my bf of 5 years is great but he's honest and isn't into art as I am so he's not really interested in my hobbies, but he's in other stuff and I try to learn but I'm too slow and lack of interest makes it harder.

I just feel like the human race should just die out, I'm so sick of people and human beings, I exercise by taking hour long walks and push ups, sit ups and Squats 3-4 days a week but my energy is still low and my hate and wish to die never goes away. I love my bf and he makes me laugh and happy most days but I always wish he would be more romantic or sensitive but I can't force him to be like that and I don't want to change him.

I fantasise being with fictional romantic relationships in wonderful worlds when I take my walks or am on my own or even when I'm around his friends.

I have a bachelor degree in digital media but it just introduced me to Adobe software and people picked it up faster than me working at places as illustrators and I can't get anything but into graphic design places, which I don't have experience in either. I did internships as a graphic design intern but they told me I wasn't knowledgeable enough, since my course only introduced us to photoshop and illustrator each for one semester and I never used it until my uni course.

I just want to die it feels like something better would await me. I just wish it would happen soon, even if I had cancer I wouldn't do anything about it because I think at least ppl can accept it as a natural cause of death rather than commit suicide,  but waiting is agonising and I think that's probably why I'm so irritated and angry lately.

I just lost faith in people,  even when I hear good things happen I just feel that should be the norm! Is it really so rare we need to celebrate it?

Im just so bored with life, people are so predictably selfish or deluded in some ways, it makes me angry that they assume I have nothing better to do than my cashier job.

Im so sick of feeling like an ant and part of a growing population of people where I'm nothing special to anyone, just the bubbly weird girl that people make fun off or never take seriously"
4vgy92,301,2016-07-31,"Me [21 F] with my SO [24 M] 1.5 years, he says I'm delegitimizing his feelings by not wanting to be in an open relationship anymore",lyarly,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4vgy92/me_21_f_with_my_so_24_m_15_years_he_says_im/,"I'm gonna try to make this as short as possible:

We started out as FWBs, slowly morphed into a really nice relationship. Been long distance pretty much the entire time cause he graduated from our college like right as this whole thing started up. However he and I travel a LOT to see each other so it's manageable. I guess I should note that it was definitely me who did the chasing, not him.

Ok so here's the dilemma. We've been in an open relationship pretty much the whole time we've been together. At first I was like ""okay yeah this is fine"" cause he said it was really important to him and also he didn't really take advantage of it at all. I don't think we would have made it this far if I had said no. Plus since we started out pretty casual it wasn't that big of a deal. I didn't really want to have sex with other people so it was whatever for me. We've been more or less together for over a year now.

I'll be honest, and I've been honest with him too about this, the whole open part of our relationship was never my favorite part but I did it because I knew it was important to him with us being long distance and all, plus he did it pretty sparingly. And he always told me the day after if he had slept with someone, we're very honest with each other.

Cut to now - we've really been going back and forth on this lately, I've really been disliking it lately. Maybe this is because I haven't slept with anyone else the entire time we've been together and it feels really one-sided (mostly by choice, but I haven't actually met anyone I was interested in either), maybe it's because I'm living in a new city this summer for an internship and I have no friends and I'm lonely and I'm just projecting, maybe it's because it's increasingly making me upset when he tells me stories and I'm picturing him with another girl. Maybe because lately sex feels really cheapened when he tells me stories about how he got too faded and slept with some random chick, so funny right??

Anyway, circumstances have changed and we're about to spend basically the next three months together (with a couple short breaks). I've been thinking about it a lot and I decided to tell him I don't want to do the open thing and actually be firm about it. At least for the foreseeable future until we are long distance again, after which I said we could discuss it but I didn't make any promises.

So we talked... And oh my god. It was so difficult. He agreed to it but he did not make it easy for me. I'll try to sum up a few things we said to each other.

* He says I'm changing our agreement on him, I say that circumstances changed and our relationship is a lot different now so yeah minds change.

* He says that being allowed to be himself and express himself and be honest was one of his favorite parts about our relationship and a big reason why he respected me so much. I said us changing it now doesn't negate that. He agreed that it doesn't negate it but it changes things?

* He says this is really important to him and it really bums him out that i don't want to do it anymore. Meanwhile I'm pretty much crying this entire conversation cause it's stressing me out so much. He says sorry that this is hurting me but he just wants to be honest with me about how he feels so he agreed to it but wanted to tell me why it made him upset. I said that we are about to spend three months together, why are you making such a big deal out of this right now?

* I should note we both agreed that once we were in the same place we wouldn't want or need to sleep with other people. I reminded him of this and he said I'm always gonna be far away. Granted, this was at a very tense point in our discussion and our future is uncertain, but I'm making plans to be with him as soon as I can. And like I said, the next three months we will be together!

* Background info: He dated a girl for four years through high school and a bit of college, they were long distance for a bit due to him doing a study abroad and he admittedly said he kind of pushed her into doing the whole open thing. He slept with someone on his study abroad and felt so guilty about it cause he knew his girlfriend really wasn't okay with it and they broke up soon after. He admits it was cheating.

* He uses that as evidence that me changing the rules up is going to give him the opportunity to resent me and lie to me, to which I pretty much said was a self-fulfilling prophecy and kind of bullshit.

* He said I was delegitimizing his feelings - I said I get that it's important to him and I'm constantly trying to understand him better but to be frank my feelings outweigh him in this one imo. I said that he was being selfish. He said that he thought I loved and accepted this character flaw of his and I didn't know what to say.

* He said ""what if I'm at the bar and I'm getting hit on, it could be a really fun thing to do that I would enjoy but I would have to say no"", he said he thought he could have his cake and eat it too, I said that most adults can control themselves when being hit on and don't resent their partner for it.

* He said that this was sort of part of his sexual identity sort of like being straight or gay. After all was said and done I pretty much told him that I thought this was really unhealthy and he should maybe talk to someone about it. He said he never thought this was unhealthy until now - ""Why am I this way?""

We talked for an hour and it was honestly horrible. I cried the whole time. He agreed to try it ""my way"" but I feel really really shitty about the way this went down. I'm not sure what to do - I don't plan on going back on my word but he really upset me with all the things he said last night and I'm not sure how to deal with it. It feels like there's this dark cloud hanging over our relationship now.

IMO, I think he's being selfish and I'm not trying to delegitimizing his feelings, but the fact of the matter is I can't stand imagining him with other people right now and I don't see why we need to be open when we're about to be together for a significant amount of time. This just seems like our values are at odds and it doesn't seem like he is valuing my feelings all that much. I'm glad he was honest with me but at the same time I somewhat wish he would've just been like ""ok, I don't love the idea but I'll do it cause I love you"" and rant to someone else about it. But I also don't want to dissuade him from being honest and expressing his feelings to me.

Where do we go from here? Am I in the wrong? I never wanted to be that girl that tried to change someone but I guess I am and maybe that's really horrible?

I won't go into all the things that make this relationship great, nor will I say he's perfect otherwise cause he's not. Neither of us are. But this is a real sticking point in an otherwise very good relationship. I'm not planning on breaking up with him now but I don't know if I can handle this stress. I really think he needs to talk to someone. Does this sound unhealthy to you or am I really delegitimizing him?

Please give advice if you can. I'd really appreciate it.

---   
**TL;DR**: Told SO I don't want to be open for the foreseeable future, he agreed but is extremely upset because it's important to him to express himself this way. Can't decide if he is being unhealthy or if I'm being shitty and trying to change him. Need advice on how to work through this."

4vhgou,7,2016-07-31,Could use some help: Serve or manage?,HalfBaked24,TalesFromYourServer,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/4vhgou/could_use_some_help_serve_or_manage/,"Hey everyone,

I could use some insight and opinions regarding a decision I'm trying to make. As the title suggests, I'm debating whether to serve or manage.


First, let me tell you my background and what brings me to this decision. I'm a young (24) man that just moved across the country to begin my first full-service management job. After completing a manager-in-training program and working in my own store for a short period, I quit a few days ago. I was really struggling to enjoy myself throughout the training program and ultimately didn't feel the restaurant was a good fit for me.


I graduated from culinary school with a degree in Restaurant Management 3 months ago and had a corporate management job lined up in my dream city, Boston. I was super excited to have a great opportunity out of college and kicked ass throughout the training program, despite being unsatisfied with the work.


I spent the last couple years primarily working in a casual fine-dining establishment, with an internship at an awarded ""new and hip"" farm-to-table restaurant. I was very proud to work at these restaurants and generally loved the quality of the service and food. The restaurant I started managing a few months ago was a drastic change from this. Half the food is cooked in a microwave, the staff is unprofessional, and the overall quality of the restaurant is mediocre. Even though I was managing, I wasn't proud of what I was doing.


Hospitality is my passion and what makes me happy. I study food and beverages in my spare time and constantly try new restaurants. I want to work in a restaurant that I'm proud of. The issue that I ran into when I  applied for management jobs months ago was that the type of places I would love to manage weren't interested. 


I took the corporate job because it paid fairly well, offered a training program, and gave me the opportunity to learn management. Now that I am looking for a new job, I'm trying to decide if I should pursue another management job at a restaurant (that I might not be entirely proud of, but would gain management experience) or serve at a restaurant that I love and find a way to work into management over time.


I'm personally leaning towards the serving option, but it is tough to accept after just having a management job and acquiring my Restaurant Management degree. I appreciate if you read through everything, as I know it was sort of a spilling of my feelings. Has anyone experienced this before or have an opinion/advice? I know that I will ultimately have to make this decision myself, but I appreciate other points of view."

4vhnfn,26,2016-07-31,[Story] The story of a homeless man. A story to inspire.,Str8Business,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/4vhnfn/story_the_story_of_a_homeless_man_a_story_to/,"I am apart of another forum and they said to post my story on the reddit as a lot of people would really enjoy the read so I am here doing it. 
I would first like to say, this is a story of my life over the last 10 months. There will be no TDLR.
I have not taken the easy way out of like and I will not. This is a story of inspiration. If you have been sitting on your ass not chasing your dreams you better today.
Many of you know me on this forum. Actually it just came to me that today is my 6th year.
It was a warm night on July 30th. I was out having fun before I went up to college and a drunk driver rear ended my vehicle. Totaled it. Gieco said you owe us 1500 dollars. All I could think is fuck how can I get around town now and come up with this much money.
A month passes, i paid it and I bought a moped. Moped was stolen three days later.
I then was evicted from my apartment because all the stores did there summer hiring already. Plus I had no source of income because my mom made to much money for I to get a Pell grant.
I moved into a friends house and I was living with him for a few months and the day after thanks giving on the way up from back home. I have known these guys for 5 years. Guy stole my grandmas gold chain, TV, and sound system and said I couldn't even use his bathroom so I took a piss on his porch. All I had was a duffle-bag with a hygiene kit, a pillow, a blanket and a bag of cheerios. I walked to a near park and I lived a homeless life for a month and a half. I wrote this story for my professor because he wanted to hear my experiences. I will not copy and paste it.

""The Poor Mans Dream: The Experiences of Living with No Wealth""

Since I was a little boy I had a dream of getting my doctorate and becoming an engineer and an inspiration for people all across the world. I will highlight some of the experiences I have been through and some life lessons I learned. Living a life without a home is tough. If you believe in yourself like I did, you can get out of any bad situations if you vision yourself and put the work into what you believe.
I spent the week before thanksgiving with my two best-friends at the time and before I came down they told me. I would not be allowed to sleep at their house anymore, I brushed it off because of the things I have done for them I could not imagine them kicking me out to be homeless. I went through the week with love and joy spending it with my mom and grandma and immediate family with everyone that truly cared about me. I enjoyed a good thanksgiving dinner my grandma and mom made and the day after thanksgiving, my two friends and I headed back to Tallahassee for college.
It was a treacherous four-hour drive with my two friends saying I could not stay at their house anymore after I allowed them to stay in my apartment for 4 months before I was evicted. I was evicted because I was not able to secure a Pell Grant after I was selected for verification and my mom made too much money but still lives paycheck to paycheck being she’s a single mother. She gave me a car for college and on my way to Tallahassee it was totaled by a drunk driver who rear ending me on the highway. I drove it to Tallahassee and took it to Geico and they said it was damaged beyond repair and that they will auction it off for the lien on the vehicle. I was prepared to pay the deductible but they would not take it. Thus leaving me carless and without transportation. I applied to all the jobs in the surrounding areas with no luck since it was after fall semester hiring. Since I could not find a job in the surrounding areas I decided to buy a moped. Three days later someone stole the moped and parked it at Joe Louis Apartments, which is known as a bad area in the city of Tallahassee. After 6 months I received a phone call from a police officer stating he found it. I had to pay $200 for towing fees, it was broken and did not run due to water condensation in the engine.
During this time, I did not call my mom because I did now want to stress her out with my situation because she lives an impoverished lifestyle. November 26th, 2015 is a day I will not forget. I only had the clothes on my back, a duffle bag with a hygiene kit, a blanket, a pillow and a bag of cheerios. I walked to the nearest park from “The Commons” Lake Ella were I slept for 1 ½ months. The first night of walking, I walked to a pavilion where an older black man was laying down resting. I plopped my stuff down with mixed feelings and I rested my head in my arms crying in sorrow to myself for a few hours before a church group came and the black man called me out and said “you better get some food if you do not want to starve.” I got up and waited in the long line with the other homeless people to be fed. They brought Publix chicken and a handful of pastry dishes for desert. In the pavilion there are ledges for support near the ceiling and once I got my food the older black man, his name was Billy Smith, said to go grab more desert to put up in the storage area. After dinner I spoke to Billy until early morning and about how I ending up sleeping at a park and he asked me one prominent question, he asked “Why did you pick this pavilion” I answered, “I felt safe here” from that moment on he believed God had sent me on a path of enrichment. The following days I lived a homeless life asking for socks and undergarments and wet wipes. A man named Jim came to the park the following days and he gave me a sleeping bag, blankets, pair of socks and sweat pants. I thought I was in heaven. I was truly grateful for the people around me. When I slept on concrete, the coldness of the night seeped through the concrete causing me to become cold. I quickly learned to put 4 or 5 wool blankets down to stop the coldness from reaching me. I awoke everyday between 6:30 – 7:00 AM, because of a duck in a group who Billy named “Crazy eight”. They were a family and they made there runs every morning to wake up each one of us by quacking next to our ears. If it was not the ducks, it was the city workers blowing leaves and telling us to get up and to move our stuff. I preferred to be woken up by the ducks. Church groups would also come out 2-3 times a week for breakfast. It was sausage and eggs and fruit loops. I also lost a lot of weight not being around food and living under a dollar a day. When I did have money it would go to Circle-K’s polar pop for sweet tea. While I was homeless I also learned a few mental skills. One night, an older woman from the church group came over to speak to Billy and I. She sat and spoke to hear our stories and after. She asked if she could do anything for me, I simple replied “a hug”. The mental breakdown of one when they are sleeping outside homeless can cause grief in ones ability. I simply wanted to feel loved, she gave me a hug and her husband was bickering for her to hurry up so she scurried off. I knew I had to get some form of transportation if I ever wanted to get enrolled in college and back on my feet. I had the opportunity to work for another homeless (Residential challenged) man whom I cut lumber for, for a day for a bicycle. I walked it home due to it having no seat. I saved the little bit of money I had and went to Joes Bike Shop in Lake Ellas park and I paid joe a few bucks to fix it up for me. That same night, I was robbed by another homeless man. He came and rummaged through all of Billy and I’s stuff and took a sleeping bag. The following day I biked to College from Lake Ella with my duffle bag and got registered for school. I went over to the Financial aid office to try and finally get a Pell Grant and a older women told me it would not be possible until this fall and If I wanted funds I would have to take out student loans. I took out a student loan and that is the only reason why I am in school right now. I then went to the Food Pantry and received a bag of long lasting shelf life food, the lady there helped me and she offered me a hug and I really needed it at the time, I was in tears in stress that day, she could see I could of used one. I than learned about were a homeless shelter I had to wait a few hours for the line and to be called then had to describe what happened and why I was homeless and I just took a shower and left. The people at The homeless shelter. People are typically dropped off there from the prison. Thus leading the atmosphere full of drugs and bad influences. I felt safer at Lake Ella. A week went by and I needed more clothes, luckily up the street there was a thrift shop that treated homeless people well. I was able to receive a pair of pants, a shirt, undergarments and a few pair of socks. The only showers I had were with wet wipes and showers were few and far between. As time went on, On December 9th it was a rainy Wednesday morning, when the veteran outreach program came out to Lake Ella and a young lady came up to our pavilion to see how we were doing and I told her what happened. She then called Youth Outreach and they asked me my story and invited me to PitaPit for lunch and I helped them pick some places to plant some trees. I went to the Transitional Living Program and I met the other youth and the management and they invited me out to the first annual “Sleep Out” Where community leaders and business owners come together to raise awareness for youth homelessness. I was able to foster a relationship with a County Comissioner from District 3. He then allowed me to sign up for a municipal entrepreneur internship. I then was featured on WTXL ABC 27 in January to talk about youth homelessness. I slept that morning in a bed and took a shower. The following morning I went to go get a background check and drug testing. I biked back to Lake Ella and then on December 12th The Tallahassee Fire Department sets up a yearly fellowship lunch at Lake Ella Park. This is were I met an individual named Troy. He is a Fire Captain a station. He took me to lunch and also asked what happened and he was surprised to see how goal-orientated I am. He then offered to pay for me a hotel for a week and he gave me $50 to spend. I bought subway sandwiches since I had a BOGO coupon for the week. That following week I received a phone call saying I passed my background check and drug test saying I could move in. I gathered my belongings and my bicycle and threw the bike in in the back of Troys trunk and headed off to the TLP. I am now currently in school with a 3.66 GPA and I am saving funds along with being active in several organizations around the school and community and becoming an inspiration to many.
With the experiences I have had, I noticed greatly the amount of influence money has on an individual. I also realized that people hold onto their egos to much in society and for us to act in unity we must break barriers with one another. I firmly believe a nation divided is a nation that will fall. I want to bring unity to the world and to share my experiences in inspire young individuals to work together and to forget about the items around them as it all does not matter. I also want to achieve a Ph.D. in Physics or a Masters in engineering with a minor in physics. Success starts with us. The more we help others, the more joy we will carry in the world and make us a person, who people want to work with. Since I now stay in a Transition Living Program. I am able to first hand get my education and show people that joy is inside every individual.

There is my story so far from the spring. Since I wrote this I have also conducted 2 summer camps for children for robotics teaching middle schoolers how to code and the mechanical aspect of robots.
I also do a local camp for children that survive severe burns or chemical burns and we take them out fishing just to have fun and non judged. I also just obtained a job with the cities IT department, I have also completed 2 internships with the county commission and I am a poll worker.
Last week I took a tour of the capital building with the Florida governor.
This has all happened in the last 10 months. If you give yourself excuses you will only be hurting yourself with regret as you get older.

Best tip of advice I can give you is to believe in yourself. Make a plan for your vision and that you are the equation of your top 5 friends.

My parents took me to a therapist when I was eight and he only blamed all my problems on them and I know my parents were doing everything they could to help me out. I didn't have many friends growing up and all the close ones I had ended up moving out of our transient neighborhood. In high school, I was well known for being the lonely deaf kid with the funny name who got really good grades. I was never bullied but I hated how everyone felt bad for me. People tried being my friend and I turned them away because I just didn't want to be there. I regret that so much.

Now I'm in college and things are turning around. I have friends now, fell in love for the first time, my grades have improved since my poor freshman year, I have a good job, live in house with three other roommates, work out often, and actually smile at people when I meet them. I should be happy but I'm not. The girl I've fallen for has given me no signs of wanting more than our nice, little friendship and she probably has a crush on my closest friend, while I have no clue how to make a move on her and let her know I have romantic feelings for her. My course load next semester is going to be insane and I don't know how I'm going to be able to balance an internship, 17 credit hours in engineering classes, and extracurricular activities along with the demoralizing frustration that I can't make my friend feel the same way she makes me feel.

I've been trying so hard to be normal like everyone else. But it's hard ""to fake it until I make it"" when you have absolutely nothing. I've never been invited to parties, had sex, or even kissed a girl. Whenever these topics come up in conversation, I have to smile and nod because I have nothing to add. It feels as if the only way to stop feeling bad is to experience these things but I have no idea where to even get started. And even then I'll probably find something else to feel bad about.

I look in the mirror and see an attractive guy who dresses nicely and works out but deep down I know that I'm not like everyone else. I look like I should be like everyone else and I feel pathetic for even feeling bad about myself."

Here's my strategy:
Start off by coding from scratch every DS and Algorithm on it, I know of. Follow up with questions on SPOJ and Leetcode and maybe Hackerrank (?). Code everything from CTCI at least once. Then later for specific companies, look at geeksforgeeks/glassdoor for previous questions.
I would be glad if you could offer up any tips ? Your own experience would be an icing on the cake."

So I'm a Canadian who's looking to visit Cape Town for a month. I've been traveling around since i've finished school and did a summer course in tech abroad. I'll be starting work in September back in Canada so I figured when else would I get to spend a month elsewhere?

 I just wanted to get your opinion on whether it's a good time still with the weather/meeting people etc since I hear it's off season. Would it be a long shot to look for internships etc? I'm thinking doing something would be the best way to meet people/living in a hostel. I'm trying to avoid being too touristy, but i'm open to suggestions!

4vi9yd,19,2016-07-31,Quantitative Ranking of FFRK Characters (damage dealers),Undergrad26,FFRecordKeeper,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/4vi9yd/quantitative_ranking_of_ffrk_characters_damage/,"UPDATED: 7/31/2016; 1:30 AM

This analysis is for CURRENT GLOBAL STATE as of 8/1/2016.  JP characters were previously included, but removed to eliminate confusion.

In my internship this summer, I am learning tons and tons of Excel.  I figured, why not do something useful with it... like making a theoretical ranking of FFRK characters?

The goal of this list is to rank our Level 80 characters by their potential as physical damage dealers.  This is based on a normalized score of categories, using the following weighting:

**Damage Potential** - 80% of score

- ATK: ~~25%~~ 20%
- SPD: 5%
- Weapons: ~~20%~~ 15%
- Ability Damage: ~~30%~~ 40%

**Survivability** - 15% of score

- HP: 5%
- DEF: 5%
- RES: 5%

**Other** - 5% of score

- Flexibility: 5%

**Notes**

- All stats come from /u/Enlir's awesome spreadsheet - I have excluded all JP characters.  Note that some characters on this list may not have their MC2s yet, but are represented on Enlir's spreadsheet.  Feel free to ignore them, but the mathematics does not change.
- As a baseline, I make the same assumptions that /u/Hitoseijuro uses in his DPS analysis - that shout will be used and ""averages"" what a U/U+ mob defense with breakdowns will hover around.  You could make many different scenarios of elemental weakness, multimob, etc., but this analysis does not have that dynamicism built in... yet
- Weapons - ~~binary score based on ability to use swords OR at least 4 weapon types~~ score is based on the availability of 5 star relics across realms (e.g., 1 point for swords, 0.6 points for spears)
- Ability damage - relatively scored based on /u/Hitoseijuro's [awesome table](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/4to8t8/mathcraft_current_power_of_5_abilities_and_why/) - only the maximum damage combination is assumed; only abilities available as of 8/1/16 are used in this analysis.
- Flexibility - binary score based on ability to use at least one other 4* non-combat category (like Dancer, Bard, White Magic...)
- SBs are *expressly* excluded here... we are primarily concerned with their ability to deal damage without them!  Obviously if you have SBs, those characters will become prioritized for you.
- This is really just an experiment!  Happy to adjust and think through this with fellow fans

Without further ado...

4via4x,1,2016-07-31,Review my background essay,marauderpadfoot,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/4via4x/review_my_background_essay/,"Can someone give me pointers about my background essay. Am I missing any core things they are looking for? I guess it's hard to be interesting and cover everything in just 2000 characters. I was not able to add my intern experience or on campus work, is it too heavy on college. BTW graduated last June so gives you a perspective of where I am.

I don’t know when it happened really, when programming seamlessly transitioned from a chore to a passion through which I began to express myself. It was this fundamental shift in perspective which drove me to graduate from UCI in just three years with a BS in Computer Science, excluding the family death causing me to miss an exam and retake a class my second year. One of the highlights of my undergraduate career was researching under Professor Sheu my sophomore year; who introduced me to the concepts of big data management and the practical applications it drives. I was tasked to statistically analyze, using Python and Scala, the performance of an in-house semi-structured database, AsterixDB, with comparable solutions such as Hadoop and present my findings to my peers.

This opportunity peaked my interest and drove the inspiration behind my two senior projects: NoteShare and Fabflix. While taking my discrete mathematics and algorithm design courses, I experienced first hand the importance aggregating notes and decided to create NoteShare. Inspired by Facebook, this online web-app allowed users to create profiles and online classrooms, send friend requests, and share notes. Fabflix on the other hand was a core project that went too far. Initially the motive was to create an online platform where users could browse and purchase movies. However, long after the course was complete I continued to apply the knowledge I learned from my information retrieval and machine learning course to create my very own recommendation engine.

Currently I am a software engineer at AT&amp;T where I design and develop algorithms for their in-house recommendation engine. My current focus is on analyzing behavioral viewing patterns to create user profiles. Though my undergraduate education is complete, I believe the OMSCS program will be an excellent opportunity gain a deeper understanding of key concepts such as machine learning and algorithm design empowering my goal of becoming a data scientist.

4vifhl,2,2016-07-31,Is 3 Weeks enough time for SB and FLs?,mostinterestingtroll,Mcat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mcat/comments/4vifhl/is_3_weeks_enough_time_for_sb_and_fls/,"Due to a summer internship, I finished my content review a little late. Test date is August 25th. Have not taken a diagnostic yet. 


Do you think 3 weeks is enough time for  practice? I was planning on doing the following:


* NS Diagnostic

* NS 1

* EK 1

* EK 2

* EK 3

* EK 4

* AAMC Scored 


With the Section Banks in between (tho... any recommendations on best time for that?)


I have till Aug 11th to reschedule to Sept 10th, but I'm not sure if it'd make much of a difference between I'll have classes for two weeks. I'm considering cancelling and taking it in January if my FL scores look bad. 



Is this doable / a decent plan? Or does it depend on my initial FL scores?


Can spend as much time as possible per day. 



Thanks!"
4vifnt,1,2016-07-31,"Recent Grad, 22k Student Loans, Struggling to Find Work",stdntloans,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4vifnt/recent_grad_22k_student_loans_struggling_to_find/,"Hello everyone,

I graduated back in May with a BS in Accountancy and a 3.7 GPA. I've had my resume reviewed by pretty much everyone at my school's career center, have been applying diligently and I haven't had any luck when it comes to getting called back for interviews.

The issue is that I'm 21 years old and I've never had a job in my entire life. I didn't do an internship while in college and I wasn't involved on campus at all. I pretty much just studied and played video games for 4 years straight. I screwed up pretty bad and I feel like I just wasted 4 years of my life. 

So now I'm half way through my grace period and I'm looking at pretty bleak job prospects. Part of me wants to just give up and enlist in the US Air Force, but most of the jobs I'm interested in require security clearance which I probably wouldn't get if I'm falling behind on my student loan payments.

As of now I have $35 dollars left in my bank account. I live with my parents who pay for everything, but they're starting to get rightfully annoyed with me and I need to find something to do.

So assuming I enlist in the air force (I don't want to be an officer), would I have any options available for me when it comes to deferring my student loans? Around $4000 of it is private with the rest being government loans. I believe around 10k of the government loans are around 2%~ interest rate. I realize that if I start the enlisting process tomorrow it will probably take around 6 months until I would leave for bootcamp, assuming I don't have any disqualifying medical issues, so should I try to at least find a regular minimum wage job in the mean time? I don't have any references to use and I don't have friends or anything like that so I feel sort of stuck in that regard. I just want to start taking responsibility for myself, but my mind is going in 100 different directions right now.

We have not included any deaths that could not be verified or connected to the Clinton scandals. All deaths are listed chronologically by date. This list is current and accurate to the best of our knowledge as of August 1, 2000.  

**Susan Coleman:** Rumors were circulating in Arkansas of an affair with Bill Clinton. She was found dead with a gunshot wound to the head at 7 1/2 months pregnant. Death was an apparent suicide.  

**Larry Guerrin:** Was killed in February 1987 while investigating the INSLAW case.

**Ron Brown:** The Commerce Secretary died on April 3, 1996, in an Air Force jet carrying Brown and 34 others, including 14 business executives on a trade mission to Croatia, crashed into a mountainside.

**Charles Meissner:** died: UNK – Following Ron Brown’s death, John Huang was placed on a Commerce Department contract that allowed him to retain his security clearance

**William Colby:** Retired CIA director was found dead on May 6,1996 after his wife reported him missing on April 27,1996. Apparently, Colby decided to go on an impromptu canoeing excursion and never returned.

Strategic Investor had covered the Vince Foster suicide and had hired handwriting experts to review Foster’s suicide note.  

**Admiral Jeremy Boorda: **Died on May 16,1996 after he went home for lunch and decided to shoot himself in the chest (by one report, twice) rather than be interviewed by Newsweek magazine that afternoon.

There were other reports that Neil Moody had discovered something very unsettling among his stepmother’s private papers and was threatening to go public with it just prior to the beginning of the Democratic National Convention. He was alleged to have been talking to Bob Woodward of the Washington Post about a blockbuster story. Witnesses said they saw Neil Moody sitting in his car arguing with another person just prior to His car suddenly speeding off out of control and hitting a brick wall.  

**Barbara Wise:** Wise a 14-year Commerce Department employee found dead and partially naked in her office following a long weekend. She worked in the same section as John Huang. Officially, she is said to have died of natural causes.  

**Doug Adams:** Died January 7, 1997- A lawyer in Arkansas who got involved trying to help the people who were being swindled out of their life savings. Adams was found in his vehicle with a gunshot wound to his head in a Springfield Mo. hospital parking lot.  

**Mary C. Mahoney:** 25, murdered at the Georgetown Starbuck’s coffee bar over the 4th of July ’97 weekend. She was a former White House intern who worked with John Huang. Apparently she knew Monica Lewinsky and her sexual encounters with Bill Clinton. Although not verified, it has been said that Lewinsky told Linda Tripp that she did not want to end up like Mahoney.  

**Ronald Miller:** Suddenly took ill on October 3rd,1997 and steadily worsened until his death 9 days later. (This pattern fits Ricin poisoning.) Owing to the strangeness of the illness, doctors at the Integris Baptist Medical Center referred the matter to the Oklahoma State Medical Examiner’s Office. The Oklahoma State Medical Examiner’s Office promptly ran tests on samples of Ron Miller’s blood, but has refused to release the results or even to confirm that the tests were ever completed.  

Had been investigated by authorities over the sale of his company, Gage Corp. to Dynamic Energy Resources, Inc. was the man who tape recorded Gene and Nora Lum and turned those tapes (and other records) over to congressional oversight investigators. The Lums were sentenced to prison for campaign finance violations, using “straw donors” to conceal the size of their contributions to various candidates. Indeed, Dynamic Energy Resources, Inc. had hired Ron Brown’s son Michael solely for the purpose of funneling $60,000 through him to the Commerce Secretary, according to Nolanda Hill’s testimony.  

**Sandy Hume:** On Sunday, February 22nd, 1998, Sandy Hume, the 28 year old son of journalist Britt Hume, was reportedly found dead in his Arlington, Virginia home. Aside from the statement that this was an “apparent” suicide, there remains in place a total media blackout on this story, possibly out of concern that the actual facts will not withstand public scrutiny. Worked for Hill magazine, about Congress for Congress.  

**Jim McDougal:** Bill and Hillary Clinton friend, banker, and political ally, sent to prison for eighteen felony convictions. A key whitewater witness, dies of a heart attack on March, 8 1998. As of this writing allegations that he was given an injection of the diuretic lasix has not been denied or confirmed.
 Died on March 8, 1998  

**Johnny Lawhon:** 29, died March 29, 1998- The Arkansas transmission specialist who discovered a pile of Whitewater documents in the trunk of an abandoned car on his property and turned them over to Starr, was killed in a car wreck two weeks after the McDougal death.. Details of the “accident” have been sketchy — even from the local Little Rock newspaper.  

**Charles Wilbourne Miller:** 63, was found dead of a gunshot wound to the head on November 17, 1998 in a shallow pit about 300 yards from his ranch house near Little Rock. Police found a .410 gauge shotgun near Miller’s body and a Ruger .357-caliber revolver submerged in water. Investigators concluded the Ruger was the weapon used by Miller to kill himself. Yet, two rounds in the handgun’s cylinder had been spent.  

He had long served as executive vice president and member of the board of directors for a company called Alltel and was deeply involved in his own software engineering company until the day he died. Alltel is the successor to Jackson Stephens’ Systematics, the company that provided the software for the White House’s “Big Brother” data base system and that was behind the administration’s plan to develop the secret computer “Clipper” chip to bug every phone, fax and email transmission in America.  

**Carlos Ghigliotti:** 42, was found dead in his home just outside of Washington D.C. on April 28, 2000. There was no sign of a break-in or struggle at the firm of Infrared Technology where the badly decomposed body of Ghigliotti was found. Ghigliotti had not been seen for several weeks, commercial cleaning companies may have been contacted in order for the offices to be cleaned.  

Ghigliotti, a thermal imaging analyst hired by the House Government Reform Committee to review tape of the siege, said he determined the FBI fired shots on April 19, 1993. The FBI has explained the light bursts on infrared footage as reflections of sun rays on shards of glass or other debris that littered the scene.  

“I conclude this based on the groundview videotapes taken from several different angles simultaneously and based on the overhead thermal tape,” Ghigliotti told The Washington Post last October. “The gunfire from the ground is there, without a doubt.”  

Ghigliotti said the tapes also confirm the Davidians fired repeatedly at FBI agents during the assault, which ended when flames raced through the compound. About 80 Branch Davidians perished that day, some from the fire, others from gunshot wounds.  

Mark Corallo, a spokesman for the congressional committee chaired by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said that police found the business cards of a committee investigator in Ghigliotti’s office. Corallo said Ghigliotti’s work for the committee ended some time ago.  

**Tony Moser:** 41, was killed as he crossed a street in Pine Bluff, Ark on June 10, 2000. Killed 10 days after being named a columnist for the Democrat-Gazette newspaper and two days after penning a stinging indictment of political corruption in Little Rock.  

Police have concluded that no charges will be filed against the unnamed driver of a 1995 Chevrolet pickup, which hit Moser as he was walking alone in the middle of unlit Rhinehart Road about 10:10 p.m  

Police say they have ruled out foul play and will file no charges against the driver because he was not intoxicated and there was no sign of excessive speed.

4vitr8,1,2016-07-31,"18 years old, graduating college in two years, will be debt-free, and looking for advice",adunna,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4vitr8/18_years_old_graduating_college_in_two_years_will/,"Hi /r/PersonalFinance,

I am 18 years old, and will be graduating university in two years with no debt and a degree in Computer Science. I currently do short term investing, and have made about 15% return in the past month on an initial of $30k. I plan to be in CS for only 4-5 years to build capital as I am good at it, but my end goal is to be either in the markets, own a business, or preferably both. I much prefer the business world, and the money that can be made, to working a desk job at a computer.

My parents make about $200k joint per year, and I already have a retirement fund started. My personal goal, as bad as it sounds, is to get as much money as quickly as possible. Whether I do this in the markets, which is unlikely given that is usually built over multiple lifetimes, or do it with developing an app, product, etc. with my CS knowledge, has yet to be determined.

I have been taking courses online in investing, and any input on the following questions would be much appreciated.

1. Does anyone have any advice for me, in general, regarding investing or personal finance, in order to accrue a large amount of wealth since I am starting so early? Or, does anyone have any other tips/advice that would prove useful in my lifetime?
2. What are any warnings people have?
3. Are there any courses, resources, etc. that are very helpful in learning how to invest properly that anyone recommends? Or, any on finance, business, etc. in general that are well-regarded?
4. Are there any internships or ways to get advisors, or for lack of a better word, teachers for investing? An interest may be managing a hedge fund at some point, if this helps in any recommendations, and I've read that doing research at a hedge fund is a good method to get your foot in the door.
5. With how the US economy is going, it's frightening to have long term holds right now, as I feel that everything is overvalued. That is one reason I am trading short term. Another reason for short term is that I'm able to build capital much more rapidly. Is it wise to invest in, for example, Vanguard or mutual funds right now due to GDP growth slowing and other markets experiencing worse conditions?

I also posted this in the daily thread in /r/investing, but I wanted to see if you all at any different opinions - a response to any of the questions above, or just any other comments/responses would be much appreciated.

Thank you in advance, and I apologize for the wall of text - just wanted to make sure I had enough details."
4vj3zh,1,2016-07-31,M4F -- Game of Thrones...House of Lies....The Office...Let's play!,bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4vj3zh/m4f_game_of_throneshouse_of_liesthe_officelets/,"---Game of Thrones---

Cersei Lannister: I'd love to play a guard that she takes a liking to and is actually able to 'make' her do things that she wouldn't normally. She likes his assertiveness and the fact that he is unafraid to tell the queen to bend over like a common whore, or get on her knees and swallow no matter how little she cares to do so.

Daenerys: For her, I'd love to play someone that can take her away from her 'Queenly' state and make her feel like a dirty young girl again. Whether that's one of her closest bodyguards, a trusted adviser, or a soldier for her army..... or maybe she gives her body up as a prize to a much needed ally perhaps?

Shae: After all that she did? I just want to treat her like a whore at the whorehouse.... Is that so much to ask?

Others: Arya Stark, Catelyn Stark, Margaery Tyrell

---House of Lies---

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly, Buffy the Vampire Slayer

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!"
4vj6lz,3,2016-07-31,Starting in technical sales?,Britito,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4vj6lz/starting_in_technical_sales/,"Hey guys,

I'm a CS student in the UK. I've spent the last year on an industry placement a a medium-sized software company that makes CAD/CAM software. It was enjoyable enough, though hardly the most interesting stuff. I never dreaded going to work, but sitting and and programming internal dev tools all day was hardly the most engaging work.

Since that internship ended early summer, I applied for summer internships, and got a technical sales internship at Cisco. I'm just finishing that now, and I rather enjoyed it. The work seems more intense, but far more varied and more interaction with people, which is something I missed at the software company, despite being somewhat introverted. 

So, what sort of career paths are there for someone in technical sales? My official job title if I went with Cisco for grad would be Systems Engineer, which seems to differ from company to company. How hard would it be to change roles, and what's the job market like?

tl;dr Am CS student in UK, considering technical sales, what can I expect?"
4vjq7v,2,2016-07-31,New job at big company has been going terrible. Looking for advice on transitioning to a startup.,rsheeler,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4vjq7v/new_job_at_big_company_has_been_going_terrible/,"So started my new-hire career and so far it's been going absolutely terribly and I would like to get out before my ""new hire"" 6 month status expires.


I work at a very big company so I am getting VERY lost in the bureaucracy no matter how much I advocate for myself with my manager or our program manager etc (of course in a professional way). I'm not even doing development work and I was hired as a developer along with being told that's what I would be doing. I took the position because I was very excited to become a better software engineer and to work on complex technologies, as that's how I was sold the position. However that's not at all what I'm doing. I also strongly dislike how many people are in it because ""it's a job"", when software development is my passion.


I am really looking to work for a startup because after working for two large companies for 3 years I feel like I am missing a lot of opportunity to ""build"" something and really jump into learning. (My last company I worked at for almost 2 years straight and was a ""intern"" to ""software engineer"" while completing my senior year). I want to be around other people who are as enthusiastic about technology as I am. I've had two mentors and both have been older gentlemen who are still as excited about building things as I am. They have also advocated that they preferred the pace of startups.
I browse AngelList daily, have been working on expanding my portfolio, and working on problem sets some hiring companies require. After this novel, I would greatly appreciate others advice on the matter and how I might be able to transition to a role at a startup? Has anyone been in a similar situation and if they have, what have you done about it? I've also been at my current position for 2 months."
