2ud5hw,0,2015-01-31,[21/m] Doing Things With a Good Friend That's In A Complicated Relationship,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2ud5hw/21m_doing_things_with_a_good_friend_thats_in_a/,"This is a long story. I apologize in advance.

I started college 3.5 years ago; I'm in my last sem. now doing an internship from home (30 mins away from university). I went in saying I wouldn't even think about a relationship for the first year. Literally the second day I offered my help fixing people's wifi access and I wandered into a room that held a girl that would become a fast friend.... and huge crush. She was the first girl I stayed up until 2 AM for (I'm an early to bed guy). We did a lot together, but I was innocent and shy at the time, so I never stepped up. She ended up with a guy from her high school, I kept my distance out of respect.

Fast forward three plus years later, and I'm fresh out of a relationship. We've been best friends. I fell for her because she was quirky, so intelligent (we met at the honors college at our university), into music (I'm a music guy and we both have really weird taste), well-spoken, and she's just beautiful in every way you can imagine. I told her the week before winter break that I still had strong feelings for her - this two weeks after I ended a 9 month relationship that resulted in my loss of virginity and ended not too well. Nothing happened, really. She just apologized for telling me about her sexual exploits with other guys and said she felt bad.

Fast forward two more months to now. I asked her to a good friend's party last night since I am not at school and am not in the social circles anymore, but can go back some weekends. We had an awesome time last time, so we went again. I had nowhere to stay, so she offered me her bed. I declined at first because I respect her far too much, but she said (repeatedly) that it'd be okay because we're ""comfortable with eachother enough"" and ""it's not like we'd do anything."" Well, we both got fairly drunk, but stopped around 11PM. We left at about 12. She lives with her sorority sisters, so when we were in bed about 15 minutes, they barged in and started a conversation with her for about 15 more. They left, we chatted about random stuff...

Then we started the talking about other stuff. I finally got up the nerve after taking two months to build up my self-esteem and my confidence (lots of exercising and doing good work helped) to ask her on a date - a real date, not a friend-date like we'd done before (just things like making dinner, watching movies, etc.). I had nothing left to hide, really. That was the last thing I wanted to do with her - try a real relationship. 

Then she told me that she had a guy somewhere else. She had studied abroad, and apparently this guy and her were going to get together after this year's summer for a while while she's looking for a job stateside. They were on a ""fool around, but nothing serious"" since they would be well over a year apart, and apparently she did that (she said she got promiscuous when drunk) and felt alright about it. However, she told me that she couldn't do that kind of thing with me and feel alright about it. 

I have always held her in the highest regards, so of course I said it was alright. I had no intention on doing anything past that, and we've always been very close. She then continued with how she always felt very close to me and she cares about me, not like other people. I said the same. Truly, I have three best friends, and she is one of them. I would do anything for them. I can't remember verbatim what we said directly, but I had said something that made her cry (happily) because it was so sweet. I know that it's my personality; it's not something I do for some sort of reward. Honest.

By this time it was about 3, and we were very close to sober. I know I was; I drink a lot of water, and she has a high tolerance. Needless to say... We kissed. Then... we kissed some more. And then we ended up doing everything. As I told her, I was incredibly surprised - not in a bad way - but it was not my intent. She laughed it off and said that it was alright and that it was very good and she liked it as well. Her only worry was that it would be weird and, in her own words, that ""she would hurt me."" I'm fairly sensitive, so I can understand this.

We continued this kind of thing in the morning. I can't say I've slept naked with many people - in fact, only two. It's very special to me. We weren't awkward in the morning. We aren't right now, either, even though it's back to texting for another two weeks.

_

Okay, so that's the situation. Sorry it was so freakin' long.

My question is this - what do I do? I would include more profanity because I'm so out of my normal league that I've never been this baffled. I'm hell-bent on not losing this friend, but I doubt that could happen as close as we are. I think we discussed how it may not be a one-time thing (the romantic/sexual stuff), but I'm not sure, as it was very a ""in the moment"" thing. 

My problem is that I don't know what to do about the ""other guy."" I don't know if morally I feel bad about doing this when they ""agreed"" to this kind of thing, and we both feel this strongly about it. My problem is that I'm more of a romantic than a bedroom savant, and prefer dates and movie nights to romps under the covers... Which is what she doesn't want.

Any advice? At all? I'm so lost here.

Blissfully, stupidly happy.

But lost.

2udi6g,1,2015-01-31,Dealing with husband's super selfish personality flaw,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2udi6g/dealing_with_husbands_super_selfish_personality/,"Ok so here is the deal, I [24f] have been with my [24m) SO for 8 years. We married after college two years ago and were both virgins ( this matters later). We have a pretty good relationship, respect each other, split responsibilities down the middle for the most part, talk, enjoy each other etc.

The problem I am running in to is he, being an only child, has always had these super selfish tendencies that are slowly adding up and causing me a lot of irritation. Coming from a large family of five kids, some of the principal traits I learned are putting others first, and sharing. He, on the other hand struggles with these things. Don't get me wrong, he is super selfless towards other people, his friends, clients, coworkers. But when it comes to me, he doesn't seem to think I count. 

In the bedroom: since we are each other's only sexual partners, I understand that at the beginning of our marriage, things were slow to pick up. A few months In, though,
 at one point when I asked him why we only had sex on weekends he flat out told me that it was because he was lazy. He was doing grad school and an internship at the time so I figured that mindset would change after he graduated. It did not.

I have talked to him many many times about this, suggested ways to make it more appealing for him, purchased sexy underwear and other sex related things, sent him pictures and though these things have worked, it is strictly when he is in the mood and still one day a week max. He has even started neglecting to even make sure I am ""getting there"" while we have sex. 

Outside of the bedroom: here is why I am bringing this to redit and not my family who would undoubtedly make this more awkward than it already is. He has, in the last year driven drunk at least three times that I know of. He has a friend who owns a bar on the other side of town and goes there after work or sometimes when I am not around due to working my second job. He claims that he is an introvert and so when we are home together that is his reason for not wanting to cuddle or have sex ( says he needs alone time). So the fact that he feels this need to go to the bar rather than be home alone just blows my mind and insults me to my core. Anyway, he gets drunk, drives home and gets caught by me. I am sure I don't need to explain why driving drunk is not only going to ruin his life if he gets a DUI or accidentally kills someone, but will ruin my life and everything I have worked so hard for too ( house, pets, financial security). 

He has ( for the third time) promised me that he will change his habits, go to the gym instead of getting a drink, blah blah. I honestly want to believe him. I love him, I have a life with him, I would like to have kids with him. We have been through a lot together, but I sometimes just want to punch him in the face. 

He ha such little consideration for me in the areas where it matters the most that I just don't know what to do. Every time I think about talking to him, the things I come up with in my mind are so hurtful and degrading. I want to scream at him and I know that in another three months we are going to be having the same conversation. 

I guess maybe I am not looking for advice ( some would be appreciated) as much as someone who can be empathetic. I don't like badmouthing my Husband to people we know for obvious reasons, but I need to get it out there with some kind of audience. 

(Slightly unimportant tangent) the least important jerk move that he pulls  is not sharing food, and while it is a little thing, it is the most poignant thing that sticks in my mind. I absolutely hate when he is selfish about food. He has never once gone hungry, so this behavior really just irritates me. 

TL;DR my husband is not being considerate of me at all and I am starting to get fed up. "

2udibs,23,2015-01-31,[A/Ne] Progress,lurker019,incest,https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/2udibs/ane_progress/,"So I posted about my relationship developing with my Aunt a few months ago. Post can be viewed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/2kerpu/ane_did_not_expect_this/)

From where we left off, it sounded as though I was possibly pushing for a romantic, long-term relationship sort of thing. That wasn't the case in reality, and we've moved on to an extremely sexual relationship.

Our relationship has sort of become easier to manage, because I've now moved out (saved up off my part-time job, and now engaging in an internship role alongside study). I've wanted an investment property sort of venture for a while, and my parents have been helpful.

So anyhow, Madison and I sort of slipped away from the sexual aspect a month after, but the fire rose again when I officially moved into my new place. We had a family gathering at my parents' as they wanted to celebrate I suppose. When Madison arrived with her children/my cousins, it was fairly casual. She didn't seem to react any different to before our sexual encounters, and just gave me a regular hug and moved on to helping a hand with the other aunts. The night went past, and nothing really seemed to occur. Rarely spoke, as I was too busy mucking about with my younger cousins, and Madison was doing her thing. I couldn't manage to get my eyes off her though, as she was dressed in a gorgeous bright orange dress, that fitted her perfectly, showcasing her gorgeous bottom, as her brunette hair casually fell over her perfectly shaped breasts. Might I add, she wore her black glasses, which she rarely did to such family events, which hinted to me that she's telling me something as I'd told her on numerous occasions that it turned me on.

Anyhow, the night finished, and everyone had left. It was my last night at home, my stuff had been moved by my mates and I over the past few days, and I was off to normal work the next day. 

My internship is a few weeks in, and I'm working in a regular office in the city. The office is a few streets away from my city apartment. I was with a new work friend during the lunch break when I received a text from Madison. It was unexpected, though I wanted this. It was a general 'hey, how are you' kind of conversation, until eventually I asked her to come over, because I really just wanted to be with her alone like a few months back. She told me she'd set up a babysitter quickly, and get back to me. As I thought, I received another text an hour later, saying she'd be there at 7, and asked me to text her my address. I did so, and I was ready. I didn't have to do much, as I know she's a flexible and easygoing woman. She's not fussy, and a bottle of red would be enough to get started with. The work day continued, and I can't explain how hard it was to not think of the possibilities of tonight. I had really missed her.

So forward to getting home. I took a nice warm shower, put on some chinos and a shirt, got some glasses out and awaited her. I put on the tv and sort of just tried to relax. The doorbell rang soon, and I instantly got an erection. I knew it was her, and the blood just started rushing. I approached the door, and it was her.

She had come straight from work, and what she wore, didn't help what was happening in my pants. Once again, it was her work apparel. A short, tight black skirt, that clearly outlined her slender, fit body and figure. She wore long sleeve, white shirt, that was almost too tight, with her sleeves rolled up, and the top buttons undone intentionally for me to see her lace red bra, which I'm sure she changed into at some point. Her hair was tied up in a ponytail again, and the glasses were there. I hadn't realised I didn't mention a word, and she instantly embraced me. Eventually she pulled back, and I said fuck it, and went in to kiss her. Not a word was said, and she managed to take control. She slowly pushed her way inside while my hands slowly made their way onto her tight butt, and she began to let out deep breaths onto my neck. The moment sort of blurred as we took a halt, and we backed up. Don't know why. Everything went back to normal, and I closed the door, and offered her a seat. It was just weird, a moment of heat, then a moment of some awkwardness. We didn't address the elephant in the room, and just got into a conversation about regular stuff as I poured a few glasses of red.

A few glasses later, I find Madison cradle onto my lap, pulling her tight skirt up, allowing me to get a closer feel. We begin making out, and minutes later, her shirt off is and so is mine. I find myself kissing her neck, as she breathes deeply and lets out a few moans near my neck/ear. She eventually pulls back, grabs my face softly with both her hands and brings it near her face where we continue to kiss. I decide I can't hold on any longer, and pick her up from where I'm seated, and we rush into my room. From there on, words can't do justice to what happened to me. 

I find myself losing complete control, and being dominated by my 27 year old aunt, who sports a gorgeous body. She strips off my pants, and underwear, and takes off her skirt and shirt and begins to give slow pecks or kisses all over my erect penis. I'm lying down in bed, and she sits in front of me, bending over, giving me a perfect view of her face with glasses, and her bottom, wearing a red lace bra, and matching panties. Eventually, she begins to slowly suck my penis, which doesn't last long, as she once again cradles on top and begins to slowly insert my penis inside her vagina, after teasing me by taking off her bra and panties carefully. From what I could see, I saw a very moist and wet pussy, which probably rushed even more blood to my penis. As I entered inside her, I could literally feel and hear the wetness in her vagina. She instantly began to moan, and pulled both my hands onto her bare breasts. She moved her waist back and forth, up and down at a slow pace, leading to me eventually pulling her away, and bending her over. She allowed and spread her butt cheeks open wide. It felt like a dream. I inserted my hard penis inside her vagina, as she strained her back up, and turned her face around to look at me. The sound of me pushing into her wet pussy from behind, her eyes looking into mine, her hair, her glasses, and more so, her telling me to 'fuck her harder' made me cum like never before. Moments later, we landed back on the bed, exhausted after only a brief encounter, which felt like hours. When the breath was caught we began to kiss again, leading to another short session, which felt even better. 

After that, it went back to normal. We got cleaned up, dressed, and I decided to ask her out for dinner. It was reaching the 7.40-8.00 mark. She was more than happy and we headed out. Nothing interesting happened thereafter. We had an enjoyable meal, and I dropped her off to her house a little late. She didn't leave me without kissing me for a long 5 minutes, which made me think I had time and the energy for 3rds tonight, but she rid me of the opportunity as she left the car. I headed home, and replayed the night again and again.

Work went back to the usual next day, and we texted a fair bit throughout the day. Fast forward to now, and me and my aunt have been doing this more often, now that I have more freedom and a place of my own. Some nights we just hangout, watch a movie, and some nights its an onslaught of oral sex. I'm not seeing anyone my age, and from what I know she's not either.

We have an extremely sexual relationship right now. We feel comfortable though, and its usually un-noticable in front of family. We haven't done anything crazy - closest thing might have been a blowjob in the kitchen while I was on the phone to my Mum (enjoyable might I add). But yeah, I really wanted to just share this experience, and get some input on what people think might happen later on. I mean there's no love, its purely sexual. We treat each other right, and theres no intention of marriage or anything. "

Long: I could use some help and encouragement. Heck, I could have used it a long time ago, but I wasn't aware.

Background: I graduated college with a comp sci degree in '13 after having a pretty successful time. I even had an internship across the country with Amazon, which was amazing. I don't know what happened, but as soon as I graduated and moved, my entire self esteem and self worth fell out from under me.

Now here I am, in desperate need for a job and this degree sitting next to me that has no use. I LOVE problem solving, programming, and working with people, but I'm absolutely paralyzed at the thought of being judged or failing tramendously at interviews.

The longer I've held off on trying, the scarier it is to me. I must be terribly out of touch with how to go about solving problems or discuss my education/internship. I mean, being out of school for so long and without a job, *would anyone even hire me to begin with*?

I honestly don't care about the pay. I enjoy the work and I want to improve my skills (though I do need an inflow of some money, so I can't exactly volunteer). I'm a short girl who has put on some weight over these last two years. I have a high pitched voice and in the back of my head wonder if I'm being taken seriously.

I need a job in the bay area and I don't understand why I'm so afraid or where my old confidence went. I need it back. I need to know I have a chance out there - this is what I really, really want to do......

2ue6o8,66,2015-02-01,My 1st year progress in the quest to Financial Independence,SkinnyThing,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/2ue6o8/my_1st_year_progress_in_the_quest_to_financial/,"Hello guys,

I am a 22 year old male from Portugal, live in a rented apartment, have no vehicle, no kids (ever?), 0 debt . In the last few months I have been thinking about how I changed thought last year, how I acted, what I would change, what am I doing to reach my objectives, etc. So I’ve decided to write about my 2014 and tell you guys what I learned and how I am advancing in the path towards Financial Independence.

Backtracking a little bit: I got my Bachelor in Economics in July 2013 and I started looking for a job. For personal reasons, I wanted to get out of my parents house as soon as possible and I did not want to pursue a Masters degree right away. I wanted to work and gain experience doing something different from studying. I had been doing that for 15 years…

I got an internship as an IT Consultant in November, and started working full time in January 2014 on a 1 year contract (By the way, my contract was renewed for 2015, Wooho!). I make 10.650 euros per year from my this job. From February 1st 2014 to January 31st 2015 I spent 8.628,71€ and my total income was 12.305,75€. The extra income came from sales of small items I owned, debt my father owed me, gifts, interest from a savings account and a small side job. So, I saved 29,88% of my total income. If we subtract the extra income, my savings rate was 18,98%.

How do I feel about this numbers? They could be much better of course, but for the salary I make and for a first year of living on my own, I think it is a good start. Keep in mind, I moved to my own apartment with my girlfriend, so I had to buy some furniture and appliances. The idea I'm trying to pass is that maybe 1500+ euros of expenditures were typical of someone starting a living by himself, and are unlikely to be repeated so soon. If you guys find it interesting, I can breakdown my expenditures by category and give some explanations.

Some notes: No, I did not starve at all (In fact, since I turned vegetarian this year, I've been practicing cooking every week), my apartment is not perfect but its nice, I spent money on a few “luxuries” I wanted, started going to the gym regularly, never had money issues, and I even went on a cheap vacation to the south of Portugal. It was kind of a surf trip (expect we don’t surf =P) because we would sleep in the van and just go from beach to beach as we went south.

Having given you guys an overview of my situation, there is a sense that I was planning all this right from the start. That is incorrect. I always had a saving mentality, but in the beginning of 2014, I knew nothing about Financial Independence. In my mind, now that I had a job, I would just try to do it as best as I could, buy a few videogames for when I was at home, and life would be good. Well, turns out that, I started to dread my everyday life. Only around November did my mood started to turn around.

I realized I hate the rat race. I want to be healthy, and in order to do so I have to cook at home and exercise. To do that, you have to give up some of your free time to prepare and do those things. After 8 hours of sleep and 8 hours of work, you don’t have much time left. I quickly realized I will never love my current job. I realized that purchases would not make me happy. I realized that I have to be happy NOW and not when I retired. I started reading about MM Mustache, Early Retirement Extreme, and I slowly started to build a new mindset for myself. I now have goals which I want to achieve and I know they won’t cost me that much. This is all very important because I am a bit of a “whats the point of all this” kind of person. I have a bit of a depressed personality and this new mindset as started to transform the way I look at life.
 
Before concluding I would like present my macro goals for 2015:

* Use my savings and a loan from my mother to pay for a Masters in Finance (Total Cost: 14000+ euros, I am already enrolled and because I did so before the end of 2014, I saved 550€ on tuition). Yeah, next year I will actually regress in my quest to FI (at least in financial terms), but I feel I have to invest further in my education if I want to retire in my 30s. This will take most of my time.

* Continue to develop the habit of reading in order to improve myself.

* Build a small garden in my appartment. Not only will I learn a lot, I can also have fresh vegetables from time to time AND I already have an idea to make some extra income.

* Improve on building everyday happiness. This is probably more important than savings rate. We can't wait decades in order to start living, one has to try being happy now. Adjusting ones routine according to this mindset is important.

* Continue to gather spending data and optimize my expenses. I already know I will spend a lot on tuition (which is a one off expense), but besides that I already built a tiny monthly budget that covers my needs. This step is important for me to realize how much I really need in order to retire and live comfortably by my standards.

After this wall of text... feel free to comment :) (if you actually cared to read the whole thing).

Thanks."

**About the author**

*Julius Busch (23) is a former IDG intern and was figuratively born with a gamepad in hand. As a film student with a Bachelor's Thesis on the topic of ""Dramaturgy in videogames"" he extensively occupies himself with the narrative potential of our favorite medium. In his spare time he enjoys writing and was responsible for the screenplay in several film projects. His dream is to one day work as an author for a videogame. To him there are few things as thrilling as a well told story.*


**Hero's image in Dragon Age: Inquisition - Bioware and the god complex**


*Julius Busch feels harassed by Dragon Age: Inquisition's constant shower of praise - which wouldn't be necessary if Bioware took its own game world more seriously.*


We all know the feeling of having an admirer. Someone who tells us at every available opportunity how great we are, who cheers for us in whatever we do no matter how mundane and insignificant the task. Best case scenario that someone is our grandmother or a beautfil girl which makes the whole affair enjoyable, but it can get pretty annoying fast.

At some point we might start to feel slightly uncomfortable, at the very latest when our admirer stands in front of our window and wakes up the neighborhood with their serenading.
Dragon Age: Inquisition is that admirer. A game, whose entire concept was designed to flatter the players and pump them full of praise until they explode.

I felt harassed... by a videogame!



**Power fantasy videogame**

Videogames are usually power fantasies, which isn't exactly breaking news. The feeling of being the pivotal point of a world and shaping it after your own ideals with life and death decisions fulfills an emotional need which dwells deep inside all of us.
Videogames allow us to live out these basic instincts, to escape everyday life and become a hero without having to face the fatal consequences of failure in reality.
Bioware utilised this and made an entire world in Dragon Age: Inquisition lie at our feet.

What else is one of the most important emotional needs of humans? Correct, love. Consequently, the developers filled the world with interesting and well-written characters and allowed us to seduce them during our adventures.
The result is the Bioware formula which brought us some of the best and most acclaimed role playing games of all time.

It's a formula which doesn't give priority to fun, but rather the emotional stimulation of the player. Bioware wants to drag our hearts and souls into their worlds.
So far they've always succeeded, but Dragon Age:Inquisition follows the formula so to the letter and mercilessly efficient that it's sometimes painful.

**Unconditional praise**

It's this feeling that something isn't quite right. Everything is going a bit too smoothly. The praise which we are showered in doesn't feel right, because we never really had to earn it. At the beginning of the game we wake up with our super power and are capable of doing what no-one else can.

Without having lifted so much as a finger we are the last hope of the world. And without even knowing why or how it happened we stumble into the role of the Inquisitor, a god-like, renowned super hero, whose righteousness none of our followers question from this point onwards.

When you receive that much unconditional praise in reality you tend be wary. And so an attentive player is going to frown in Dragon Age: Inquisition as well and will see through the cold calculation the game uses to crawl into our heart. The effect is so disconcerting that I couldn't fully immerse myself in the game's world over long periods of play.


**The accepted illusion**

When you play a videogame you enjoy the deception and welcome your own emotional manipulation. Videogames as a narrative medium are significantly more abstract than movies, for example.
When playing there is an unspoken agreement between the game and the player. The player agrees only to do things which are supposed to happen within the game's systems and the game in return provides the illusion of freedom.

That's also the reason why a friend who's just watching for a couple of minutes and never made said agreement cannot understand what it is that's supposed to be so great about it. 
No videogame narrative can exist without this agreement. When we play Dragon Age: Origins, but don't accept the absence of a jump function, the illusion fails. On the other hand our brain is quite good at letting itself get manipulated until the point where we simply don't want to jump anymore.

Exactly this functionality of the brain is also the reason why we could experience great adventures with only a bunch of pixels in the early days of videogame history. The degree of abstraction was higher, which means achieving illusion was more difficult, but the basic principle remains the same.


**The need for praise**

The illusion fades when we notice the instruments which create it. Some more tact with its flatteries would have done well for Dragon Age: Inquisition. A bit more ""good game"" and a bit less ""good player"". But only a little bit less, since praising the player is an essential element of video game dramaturgy.

In a movie we passively follow (in most cases, anyway) the story of a hero or anti-hero who is likeable, or at least appealing in some ways. Characters like the much discussed Walter White from Breaking Bad demonstrate however, that we don't necessarily need to be on the protagonist's side for the narrative to work.

With a game, that's different since we are the protagonist. In the moment where we take control of our character we make an agreement that we are one with it within the game's world. For this symbiosys to work it is imperative that we can like our character and identify with it. 
Each interaction of the game's world with our character is an interaction with us. And we want to be acknoledged by the game's world.


**Damned to succeed**

Let's look at the common trial-and-error model Dragon Age: Inquisition uses as well. The game only progresses if the player succeeds, in case of failure no progress happens. This results in the following problem: The story only progresses when the player accomplishes the goals of his missions - and when they do so, they expect a reward.

The rewards are generally gameplay (e.g. new weapons and other items) as well as narrative related (praise, increasing power of the protagonist). Hence it is quite difficult to orchestrate a setback in the story, i.e. a narrative failure, since the game's model requires all game related goals to be achieved.

Concretely this means that it would be dramaturgically disconcerting to have a player win a boss fight only to show a victory cinematic in which the boss beats the player. (That doesn't mean something similar hasn't been done before. Off the top of my head I can think of several examples.) We speak of ""ludonarrative dissonance"".


**Success comes slowly**

It is therefore essential that our progress within the game is always understandably related to the narrative interaction of the game's world with our character and the possibilities of interaction between our character and the game's world. The further we come, the more awed other characters react to the presence of our hero and the more abilities we can learn to overcome specific obstacles.

The player has to have the feeling to deserve the praise they get. Which means that when I haven't done much more than press ""New Game"" and I'm told in the very first dialog that I'm a super power, the last hope of the world and I need to defeat evil then my first reaction is: Houston, we've got a problem!

A narrative like that cannot work properly when the world threatening conflict (antagonist) and the conflict solving super power (protagonist) are introduced right off the bat.

We either have a renowned hero, whose adversary is introduced during the first act (e.g. super hero movies) or an already threatened world in which our (at first) inconspicuous protagonist becomes the only person able to defeat the threat through some coincidence (e.g. war movies). Rarer, but still possible is a combination of the two (e.g. Lord of the Rings).


**Character without personality**

Consequently, in my opinion, the game's start already is poorly chosen. It is as impersonal as possible, which has the advantage that the developers don't have to create different versions depending on race and class choices. With a true prolog before the conflict erupts, in which we can invent the former life of our character before it changes forever, could have prevented or at least alleviated some of the above mentioned problems.

It wouldn't have had to be as varied and elaborate as in Dragon Age: Origins, but without independent research we know basically nothing about the background of our character, yet are asked about it at various points in the game, which feels strange to say the least. One might say that as a player we are not informed enough to speak for this character and make decisions in his/her name.

Over the course of the game our followers often talk about how difficult it is to see the human being in us and not just the pure ideal of the powerful and sent from God Inquisitor. That almost seems self-ironic, since Bioware's presentation leads to us never really getting to know our character beyond those ideals.

The man or woman with the green hand says what we tell him/her to do, but to really immerse yourself in his/her world of thought is difficult.  Particularly since we're never quite certain how much of our past is predetermined and how much the developers left to our own roleplaying-fantasy.


**What am I fighting for?**

A prolog would have clarified that and increased our identification with our character. The players' motivation wouldn't have been ""This world has problems and I was sent by the heavens to solve them"" but rather ""My world is in danger and I'm going to fight to save it"" which worked well in Dragon Age: Origins, for example.

At this point I feel it is important to note that I don't view Dragon Age: Inquisition as a bad game. On the contrary, the presentation works great over long stretches of the game despite all the issues I mentioned. Some scenes were so epic I felt tears welling up in my eyes - despite the obvious exploitation of my power instincts.

This article is not supposed to provide an overall verdict of the game. My goal is to analyse a general problematic of video game dramaturgy with the help of an example where I thought it was especially salient.


**Take the world seriously!**

Videogames are an art form (if and why is a discussion for another day), which - due to the immense costs of production - depend on positive reviews by the gaming press and players in order to reach as wide an audience as possible.
While a movie conveys a narrative to a passive audience, videogames create a multidimensional system, in which players can influence the story and actively experience it, with the added challenge that the game has to be fun based on gameplay alone.
It is clear that this split between profit based mainstream demands and being faithful to your artistic vision is incredibly difficult.

Blockbuster franchises such as Call of Duty and Assassin's Creed have long dropped those aspirations, which doesn't automatically mean that they can't be valuable gaming experiences. But Dragon Age is filled with rich background stories and is a fantasy universe created by its developers' blood, sweat and tears. I want future adventures in this universe to be created with the same passion.

That is why I appeal to Bioware and other developers: Don't give us all the power to play god in your world right from the get-go.
Take the world you created seriously, then us players will have fun earning its praise. Don't follow the Ubisoft formula of having thousands of irrelevant side activities and collectibles, just because that is the current trend.

Don't put a dragon in each of your areas, because thirteen-year-old Johnny thinks dragons are cool. Listen to our feedback, but only use what you yourself want in your game. You will always hear complaints about something from us. More often than not they will even be justified, but in the end we don't know the formula for the perfect game.
There is just one thing that absolutely cannot be absent: The passion of an ambitious team with a common goal. You are the artists, it's your game, your vision. I, as a player, am only grateful to participate in it.

2ueop2,10,2015-02-01,My [21 M] recently ex-gf [21 F] is now in a psychiatric crisis center after I broke up with her and it's my fault,ihurtsomeone,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ueop2/my_21_m_recently_exgf_21_f_is_now_in_a/,"Recently I ended a three year relationship with my GF. We've had relationship trouble in the past, including break ups, but we always found a way to get through it. I've been dealing with feeling dissatisfied in the relationship. Like I didn't have the passion for her like she did for me.

This semester at school is her first time back for a year long internship. So we were long distance that entire time. Around October or November I started thinking a lot about our relationship and I think I was staying for all the wrong reasons.

So yesterday was the day after we had broke up. And it was an ugly one too. She feels like I'm not giving her a chance to work on things this semester and get through things. I just couldn't find any enthusiasm in myself anymore.

We were talking on the phone and she was reiterating all of this to me when she made a comment about wanting to stab herself in the stomach. She's struggles with depression and had to go to a psychiatric crisis center for about a week last winter before she left for her internship. I couldn't do nothing, knowing she was having those thought so I called the police in order for them check her well being. I had to sit in the cruiser and I was terrified not knowing what would happen. They told me she agreed to have them drive her to go see a counselor.

When I got back from work later that day I saw texts from her telling me they were sending her back to the crisis center. I felt so terrible. I called my Mom to tell her the situation and I sobbed like I had never sobbed before. This is ruining her semester and all she's been telling me is how completely alone she feels now. I want to see the positive side of it but I know she wouldn't be there if it wasn't for me.

She was the best girlfriend someone could possibly ask for. Her love for with had no end and I threw it all away. I'm so confused right now. I don't know what it is about me that can't appreciate her. I'm starting to think that we should have worked on things. That everything I thought was wrong just a result of my inability to commit and feel satisfied. But we've broken up so many time before that I have absolutely 0% confidence in any of my decision making regarding that relationship.

I just need some perspective. I want someone to be able to tell me what I really want. I wish I wasn't so dissatisfied with her for my little stupid reasons. I hate myself for doing this to her, for being such a terrible boyfriend, for everything.

I just need someone to talk to I guess.

2uers7,3,2015-02-01,"[Meds] First time to the therapist, first time on meds (Venlafaxine)",JGWol,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2uers7/meds_first_time_to_the_therapist_first_time_on/,"Hey guys. So, I have been dealing with general anxiety for most of my life. Social anxiety being a really big one. I'm a full time student, full time worker, and grew up in a pretty dysfunctional family. Got teased a lot growing up for my weight and other things.

The reason why I decided to see a doctor was because I was making a lot of improvements in my life, but I still was feeling like nothing was improving. A paradox that only anxiety creates. Losing tons of weight, got a really good internship, amazing grades, and friends that care about me. Most importantly, my dad moved out (one of the best things to happen), and my family life has drastically improved as a result.

However, I could never find myself being comfortable with what I had. So, cue a therapist.

Sat down, rambled for about an hour, and she gave me the diagnosis. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). I was relieved it was not anything more than that.. She prescribed me 37.5 mg Venlafaxine XR for the first two weeks, and 70 mg for the next month. 

The medication came on pretty strong the first day. I took it three hours before my 1 PM class, and by the time I got to school, I had this very mild feeling of warmth throughout my body. It was like someone had put a heater inside me. My feet felt springy, and I noticed I had _no rambling thoughts_. Some strangers drove next to me on my way to class, and were asking me directions. I did not even think twice about it; I walked up to them and helped them out. I even said some really funny shit in the process that I don't remember, but hey.

Class that day was great. on mondays I am in from 2 till 10 at night, which is usually a huge bore. However, I found that I was 1) more focused, and 2) less anxious, so I did not spend any energy paying attention to the time. I think that has to do with the mild benefit Venlafaxine has on ADHD symptoms. Also, usually half way through each class I get a little impulsive and act out. None of that happened. I still cracked jokes here and there, but I felt like my timing was much better. 

Two days ago (five days on the medication), I got invited out to the bar by a friend of mine that I absolutely adore. Very beautiful woman. The night out was awesome. I still had some jitters, but most of that was because a lot of old high school friends were there that night too, and so I felt some residual anxiety from those days. However, I was MUCH quicker in recovering my composure. I never locked down. I was constantly ""on the move"", talking to randoms and enjoying myself. I even ended up spontaneously dancing with the girl in front of a packed bar. It was great, because afterwards I was getting _a lot_ of attention from women. I felt normal.

And no, I was not drunk. In four hours, I had three beers. Without the meds, I could have _fifteen_ beers, and still never muster the courage to dance with a girl. Ever.

Guys, if you are suffering from anxiety, please see a psychiatrist. Get therapy. It's really really cool."
2uezwd,3,2015-02-01,Looking for advice on summer intern,EngrPSU,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2uezwd/looking_for_advice_on_summer_intern/,"Alright, I'm having an issue that is probably only really common with engineering students... Multiple offers.

I'll lay it out for you all and maybe someone can help me decide whats best because I've been unusually indecisive. 

I'm currently working part time with a medium size manufacturing company where I go to school that produces automotive wiring as a Facilities Engineering Intern. 

I have received offers from both A) A renowned diesel engine manufacturer for a Manufacturing Engineering Intern in a heavy engine plant, and B) A grain processing company as an Operations Management Intern.

Both offers allow for direct hands on experience with projects. Offer B probably allows for more direct experience seeing as how they don't have an engineering department on site. Although the Offer A is better because they have an engineering department although I most likely wouldn't get as much hands on. 

Pay is about the same, with Offer A not providing housing, and Offer B providing and covering all housing costs. 

I think my real issue is that I know offer B is going to be easier because I don't have to look for housing and its a bit closer to home. Offer A provides a position and title that is similar to what I would like to do after school, or so I think at the moment.

I got offer A after offer B and I haven't signed anything with offer B but I accepted their offer and toured the place. So I have to basically renege on offer B if I go elsewhere.

TL;DR having indecisive moment and should most likely follow my gut. "
2uf0bi,5,2015-02-01,So I watched Transformers 4 and it made me think about this subreddit.,[deleted],movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2uf0bi/so_i_watched_transformers_4_and_it_made_me_think/,"I did. Willingly. I watched that entire movie. It was a toss up between that and Big Trouble in Little China so yes, myself and my friends fucked up. We fucked up big. 

I know it's going to be hard just to get past that statement, but we made the best of it although this might perhaps be the first movie on personal record that actually cannot be improved by beer. In fact, we came to the consensus that the writers had to be drunk to write the screenplay. Not just regular drunk either, I'm talking aggressively blacked out drunk. I have nothing in particular against Bay's films, I've watched a lot of them. But this one was something special.

Regardless, I started thinking about this subreddit because I remember when it came out that a lot of people vouched for it here. Not all, but there was maybe a 40% split of people who were like ""expected dumb fun and was not disappointed"" or ""me likely splosions"". I can say without even a glimmer of doubt that these people are either so stupid they approach trogolodytic levels and only managed to type those comments while pounding their learning-disabled ham fists on their keyboard in a fit of excitement due to the many bright colors on a screen in rapid succession, or they were given cold hard cash to represent on the internet.

This film was a tragedy on so many levels that the portions of the movie that made me laugh the hardest were neither jokes nor anything involving humor. It was the first time I've ever stood up after it ended and said, and I quote myself, ""We need to let people know what happened here today, so that it never happens again.""

So I'm making good on that promise. 

Let me spoils some wondrous portions of this epic film by Michael Bay.

* There is a samurai robot from space. He speaks in a stereotype-laden SAMOORAAAAI FWOM JAPON accent. I assumed he was constructed in space Japan. Sure it's a downgrade from the two blackface hatchbacks but missing that criticism from the second film and doing the exact same thing again seems like it would take actual effort.

* Optimus Prime flies away into space on a jetpack after a speech that makes literally NO FUCKING SENSE. He sounds high, or maybe something hit him too hard in the motherboard and caused some serious system faults.  ""Whenever you look to the stars, think of one of them as my soul. Defend this family autobots. As they have you. Defend. All they can be."" That's literally the last few words then he flies away on a jetpack. So where the fuck did the interplanetary jetpack come from. They drove or walked everywhere all move, flew in an alien jet thing, and let's not forget the second movie where a major plot point was Prime gaining and then subsequently losing a jetpack add on. Where the fuck was the jetpack at Prime? Do you know how useful that could have been?

* The product placement. Sure, we've heard about it but it's another thing to see it. The metal transforms into a Beats Pill stereo during the demonstration part at the corporation. I'm surprised they didn't transform bumblebee with Beats By Dre headphones on or something. A bud light truck blew up and threw blue bud light cans everywhere, and this was sad and tragic on its own but there were actual close ups of the cans on the road. Then Mark Walhberg stops and here we all paused and were like ""I bet he drinks one."" which I took a step further and was like ""Maybe he will make an exagerrated AHHHH sound and wink at the camera."" Spoiler, he chugs one in a guys face. No wink tho sadly.

* Bumblebee is now known as ""bee"" to everyone apparently. Why is it bee, why not ""Mr Bumble.""

* The special effects are horrible, and I mean horrible. They look cartoonish and out of place. Everything from the beacon things to the robots looks terrible, like they farmed out the effects work to interns and just spent the duration of post production getting fucked up off paint huffing with the writers. They finally just said fuck it to making actual transformations because the ""new"" robots all fly around in a swirl of disconnected metal when they change. Despite having this property they are apparently solid enough to damage when formed. It makes no sense, and looks terrible.

* There are parts, bumblebee flying on the dino robot particularly, where you literally cannot tell what the fuck is going on. It's a tornado of dust, explosions, and shiny shit that occasionally takes a break to crash into a building.

* Speaking of the buildings: everything is stuffed with fireworks. These are not explosions, they are clearly fireworks and they shoot out of the ground, cars, every single building, the transformers, etc. 

* What the fuck are the dinos doing. At the end I saw the dinosaurs and I was like, ""wait... what the fuck are the dino ones going to do are they just gonna like, run off into the forest?""  Spoiler: The dino ones just run off into the forest for no reason. The end. 

* The dialogue is so fucking awful that I can say with confidence that I am completely correct, any random sample of off the street persons could write a better script.

* Human loading effort: The humans are trying to load this tactical nuke bomb thing into a hovering ship. 3 autobots stand there and don't help. Then they get hit by fucking missiles and the ship crashes. This is similar to the magical jetpack criticism.

* Kade blocks a downward thrust from a three story tall robot with a sword. That's thousands of pounds of force, but the movie constantly reminds us he doesn't date so maybe he has superhero level forearm strength. Also the daughter thing, we get it, she is 17 so maybe stop with the ass shots Bay. Then he threatens to punch the boyfriend/SPONTANEOUS PLOT DEVICE in the face and never does. Just one fucking punch Bay, one. Don't ever blueballs an audience like that again.

* The boyfriend randomly shows up and ramps his hatchback to save the family early on and punches a guy in the face in midair with the tire. It's transporter 2 ""scrape the bomb off"" level retarded.


Thank you for listening, I had to get it all out. This movie is going to be stuck in my head forever, don't make the same mistake. The only logical explanation for this movie that I can think of is Michael Bay is actively trying to make these movies so incredibly shitty that he gets removed from the projects. I don't know how he failed and it made money, because he succeeded in making something so incredibly terrible that it defies description.

2uf412,12,2015-02-01,"2 weeks sober, never going back",smithw13,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/2uf412/2_weeks_sober_never_going_back/,"20/m here. I just wanted to share my story and hopefully provide some inspiration to some of you out there.

My relationship with pot has been a tumultuous one. It all began in 9th grade, when I started dealing for absolutely no reason. I had never smoked before and did not smoke at that time, but I thought it would make me cool I guess- I didnt even need the money. 

Fast forward to tenth grade, and Im smoking a horribly rolled joint in my backyard and was AMAZINGLY high. I was instantly in love.

To give some background, I was always super athletic. Always had a crazy good body, washboard abs, broad chest and one hell of a wide back (ask me how that body is now). For the rest of high school, I would smoke for a couple months, get caught or in trouble, then would be forced to abstain for even longer. In hindsight, through this cycle, I realized that all the peaks in my life were during these periods of forced abstinence.

Fast forward to my freshman year of college. Throughout my junior and senior year of high school, weed was especially scarce due to me being drug tested by my school. By the summer before college, I had the best body I had ever had, incredibly good grades and one hell of a bright future. But when I hit college, I realized that I had something I had never had before: FREEDOM. What began as a casual joint with my roommate turned into an eighth every couple of days.

By the end of my first semester I was a lazy fuck with a 2.8 GPA (I get that that is some people's idea of doing well, but it is well below the standard I hold myself to) and a dad body. I no longer had my routine of school, study and working out. I barely went to class (and always promised myself that this is the last one I would skip), could never even STOMACH the idea of working out, and studying quickly turned into all nighters before the final.

The second half of my freshman year in college, it quickly turned into a quarter ounce every few days. I had told myself that I needed to get my shit together over Christmas break, and went in with the right attitude. But soon, my laziness got the better of me. My GPA plummeted to a 2.4, and I was smoking and drinking more than ever.

Over the summer, my pot use slowed down dramatically, just due to availability and circumstance. This led me to thinking ""hey, Im not addicted! If I need to stop, I can stop!"" 

That was the most dangerous mentality that I have ever developed. There is a stark difference between being forced to quit, and having control over your habit. 

I took the fall 2014 semester off, largely due to finances and my opportunity to work an internship. I moved to another city temporarily, and got my own place. Now I had disposable income, a place to smoke, and a dealer that lived upstairs. Oh no.

Fast forward to December and an eighth a day, and my life is in shambles. I dont do anything except work and smoke. I havent made any new friends in my new city, and xanax has made an appearance in my life. I dont want to bore you with details, but the month of December became pretty disastrous. I would black out on xanax, alcohol and weed. Before I moved back to my collegetown, I blacked out so hard that no one could reach me for 3 days, and it took me two days to find my car (the city towed and misplaced it, I have NEVER driven while intoxicated). 

I got back to college town, and was able to slow down due to the holidays. But soon after, I continued on my path of destruction. I told myself that it was time to give up weed. And I did, but replaced it with lots of xanax and lots of booze. 

Still undergoing tests to determine if I am epileptic or not, but I had a seizure a few days after taking a high dosage of xanax. I continued down my path of destruction anyways, often injuring myself physically (due to the loss of motor skills when you mix alcohol and benzos). About 2 weeks ago, I had a realization; an epiphany of sorts.

  I can keep going down this road, and hit rock bottom eventually. Or, I can quit while I am ahead, accept the consequences, and do damage control. I chose the latter, and I am never going back.

 I know that technically the xanax caused me to quit all substances, but xanax wasnt the problem. I could truly stop xanax whenever I wanted (and since have. BUT, I am aware of just how addictive they are, and benzos are something that you should NEVER EVER FUCK WITH RECREATIONALLY I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH!!!). The problem was marijuana. I had no control over it. I spent all my disposable and indisposable income on it. I chose to smoke over activities I previously enjoyed. Productivity became little more than an abstract concept. 

I realized I am too smart and have too much of a future ahead of me to be conscious of my addiction and not do anything about it. I realized that my relationship with weed and alcohol was affecting my future. So I walked away two weeks ago, and I havent looked back since.

My mind hasnt been this sharp since I was in highschool. Holy shit. I can think critically in class, Im wittier than I have ever been before, and I just feel cleaner. I rejoined my old gym, and have started to build a healthy relationship with her again (I worked out FIVE times this week, AND I cant wait to go back next week!).

Throughout the first week, I struggled with the thought of NEVER SMOKING POT AGAIN. It seemed so awful. But then I read Josh Gordon's (of the Cleveland Browns) open letter. It reaffirmed what I already knew, and cemented my fate. 

I know that this high I am on is temporary, and there will be lapses and times when its hard. I made all of my close friends through pot. They are super supportive, but I think that while I am still figuring things out its best if I take a break from them. Surround yourself with people with similar goals, and you will flourish.

I have also been talking to a therapist to help me figure things out. So far, the insomnia has been UNREAL. I got some sleeping pills which I take with melatonin...they dont do shit. But hey, Ill get there eventually. You will too. You just have to make the conscious decision. You can't waiver, you can't reward your sobriety milestones with the thing you quit, and you can't use in moderation. I've tried everything to try and moderate my weed use, including rationing my supply. ALL FAILED. So far, the only sure fire way to quit is to stop entirely. That is just reality. And if you can't see that, then you perhaps are quitting for the wrong reasons. Do it because it will make you a better you."
2uf48x,1,2015-02-01,"I have relationship anxiety [23/f] after a series of abusive relationships, I turned down an awesome guy I really liked [26/m] multiple times because I wasn't ready for a relationship. we haven't talked in awhile and I'm pretty sure he hates my guts, is there anything can I do?",restlessinrustle,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2uf48x/i_have_relationship_anxiety_23f_after_a_series_of/,"prepare yourselves. it's a long one, but it is divided chronologically. 

a year ago, I had just gotten out of an abusive relationship that went on for almost a year, before that.... I dated a guy for three years that was emotionally abusive and manipulative towards me. needless to say, I was not really looking for anything serious after *years* of awful, awful relationships. I wanted to be single for awhile, I ended up staying with friends in another state for awhile so I could focus on myself and being more confident in my dating ventures. 

I created a pof profile when I was back home, before I left the state, I had put on my profile that I was looking for friendship at this time, because I just got out of a relationship, and I didn't feel like I was ready. but I was open to something more serious down the road for the right person. I didn't think anyone would be interested in me, so I didn't do anything with it until I was about to come back home. as I was weeding through emails after weeks of not checking them, I stumbled upon this one email that really stuck out. 

he said that he understood what I was going through, and that he just got out of a relationship as well, his ex had cancer and she was a real source of negativity because of her illness making her irritable and depressed- understandable. he wasn't looking for anything serious, and he wasn't looking for a f-ck buddy either, but he did miss spending time with upbeat people, and I sounded like someone he could get along really well with. 

fast forward a week or two, I come back to my home state. I reach out to him on face book, and we set up a time to meet each other in person. he worked at a restaurant and he was a bartender, so I get there in the early afternoon, sit down at the bar and he buys me lunch. I had a babysitting gig to get to  at six thirty in town,  so we end up talking while he is working for six hours. I find out that we have a lot in common, and I am absolutely impressed with him. I end up missing the babysitting job and they tell me that they found another sitter, I told him that I was free. he seemed really excited but had made other plans, but told me that he would be home in a couple of hours, and gives me his address. I show up a couple of hours later. he shows me to his bedroom, and walks into the living room, his roommate says something about how he is always bringing girls over, and he said something really quietly to his roommate(which I find out weeks later, that he said I would be the only girl he brings over from now on, and that he wouldn't have to worry about him bringing over other girls) 

after weeks of spending almost every day together, Christmas rolls around and we spend the weekend together (except for Christmas day, we both spent that with family) he asks me if I want to be exclusive with him, because he wants to be exclusive with me. I say that I was ready for that, he is very happy about this. he tells me that he deleted his dating profile and told people that he wasn't interested. I did the same thing, and things are going well. he is drinking one of these nights and tells me that he loves me, along with other adorable things. I brush it off thinking that he is just drunk. I brought it up a couple of weeks later, and he seemed very nervous with it, and changed the subject.. a couple days later, he gets into a fight with his brother-in-law and gets thrown into the drunk tank. I didn't know this, but he sent me a text saying that he couldn't go out with me to zoo lights. I asked why and I didn't get a response. A couple of hours later, I find out that he's in jail! so I send a message to his mom on face book (who I haven't met before) saying that I was willing to help if she needed anything, she was really sweet. so he gets out of  and he sends me a message on fb saying that his mom wants to meet me, and that he was thinking about me the entire time he was in there, and that he wished he had my number because then he could have called me. 

later, he is driving me home and he was saying all of these extremely sweet things. I noticed his demeanor was less timid than before. he said that he realized that he wanted us to more than friends, more official. then panic hits me. I sit there as he continues talking, silent, frozen, wide eyed, nervous beyond belief. I realize that he might ask me out, I wanted him to, so badly. but he is such a good guy and we are extremely compatible, but I have only had two relationships and they were both awful experiences. I blurt out that I  have awful anxiety with relationships and that I am not ready for being his girlfriend, but I want to be and that I am sorry. I could tell he was hurt by this, and a bit confused... he paused for a couple of seconds, and says that we don't need labels to define our relationship, but that he would like to spend more time with me, if I was interested in that. I said I was. we arrive at my home, and I am so very nervous, that I just get out of the car and run into my house. as I get out he said ""aren't you going to kiss me goodbye?"" but I didn't. he closes the door and drives away. I send him a face book message saying that I was sorry. and that I should have kissed him goodbye, and that I was just so uncomfortable that I felt the need to leave. he said that he understood, and that he was sorry for making me feel that way, and that we could talk about it at another time. he reveals that he also has anxiety in this area, because of his last relationship. 

a couple of weeks later, I get accepted to an internship with Sundance. I tell him about it, and he is so excited for me. I tell him that I would be gone for a year, he didn't seem to be excited anymore, he said I should follow my dreams in a really sad tone. I changed the subject, I went out with my friend [24/m] to zoo lights,  because he had been working the last night that they were open. I told him that it was fun, that we went to zoo lights, then back to his apartment and watched tv, and then he took me home.he asked me if I liked him more than a friend. I said no, and then I asked him why he asked. he said that he wanted to see where my heart laid, I asked him where he thought it laid. he said, well, first of all, I know you love Sundance, and that you want to be a part of that, and then I think you like this guy (his name), I said that I liked him more than a stupid internship. I then say that I missed snuggling with him and then he says I haven't seen you in a three days, how do you think you are going to deal with being away for a year. and then I said I wasn't sure, and that I could find myself in an awful position because I need cuddling every once in awhile. then he said I don't feel like I *need* to cuddle, but it is nice to have. then he says that he worries that I would deem him unfit at some point during that year and break his heart by being with someone else (to be fair, I had cheated on my last boyfriend who was abusive) I reassured him that I would never cheat on him, and that he was the first person I ever cared about. he says that he doesn't think that he could be without me for a year, and then tells me that he needs space. 

I don't talk to him until my birthday, a couple of weeks later. I started a new job, and I met a guy while I worked there. because I assumed that he was never coming back. so he sends me a message, asking me if he could take me out for my birthday. I say that I would like that. he picks me up from my home, and as we are driving he says that he doesn't want me to get drunk since I worked the next morning, but he said we could hang out at his house. I agree to that, and then he starts talking about how much he missed me, and that he was sorry if he hurt me (which he did) by jumping to conclusions. and that he would like to try out a relationship, and he felt he was ready. I tell him that I am kind of seeing a new guy, so we could only be friends at this point. he seemed really hurt by this, which just broke my heart because I was still interested in him. he end up going to his house, his mom is there and I say hello to her, and we go into his room. when we get in there, he tells me that he never told his mom that we stopped talking, so she assumed we were dating. and that I was the only chick besides his last girlfriend of a year that met his mom. I take off my heels, and I am having a hard time with it, I look up and he is staring at me, smiling. I said ""what?"" and he said "" nothing. I just really, really like you"". he gets up and goes into the kitchen and makes me a drink, and I and sitting there in his room, listening to music on my phone. he walks in, hands me my drink and looks down at my phone. he looks at my phone, refers to the band I was listening to and asks me if I am okay. he knows me too well. I say that I really like him, and he is so perfect, that I feel like I am going to mess things up with him. so I should just not date you so I never mess it up. and then I say, what if you change your mind? what if you don't like me anymore? and he said that people change their minds, and I start to tear up. and then he rubs my arms and kisses me on the forehead and says that he doesn't think he will. we end up going out to dinner, he says more sweet things. and I basically have the best birthday of my life.

 the next morning, as he is driving me home he says that he was really glad that I went out with him the night before. we keep in contact until valentine's day. a couple of weeks later, valentine's day was a day or two away, I spent the night at his house, we were cuddling in bed and I was really sick. I end up falling asleep, and I have an awful fever and he wakes me up, gives me a cup of ice water and tells me that I should drink it so my fever will go down, he rubs my back as I start to fall back asleep and I tell him that I appreciate him taking care of me, and that I had a great present for Valentine's Day. he asked me what is was, I said that they were a secret, but he would love them. in the morning, he drops me off at home so I can get ready for work. he tells me that he isn't much of a fan of Valentine's Day, and that he didn't really believe in celebrating it. and that he felt sick anyway. I tell him that I already got the present, and that I would appreciate if he could power through the sickness for just a few hours if he could come with me to it. I bought him tickets to Monty Python's Spamalot, this was going to be the day that I asked him out. the day of, he tells me that he is sick and that he appreciates it, but he doesn't want to go. I get really upset because I went to a lot of trouble to get the tickets, and I paid $300 for them. he says ""it is very sweet but it puts too much pressure on me to give you a good present for Valentine's Day"". and once again, I am heartbroken but I didn't want to waste the tickets. I call up the guy that I dated for awhile when I started my new job, even though we weren't dating at the time, when we go out. we realize that we still liked each other, and dated again for months. 

I was still dating this guy in May when I see him again. I check out this new restaurant in my city, I am enjoying my dinner and I am reading a book when I look up and see him, he is working at this restaurant. I am surprised, and drop my glass spilling water everywhere. I leave money on the table, grab my stuff and run out. I send him a text apologizing for the mess, and that I didn't know that he worked there now. he said that it was okay, and that he actually wanted to say hello, but they were busy. I tell him that I moved into this apartment close by, which I had put in an application for the last time we talked. but I don't think he knew I actually moved in. he suggests that we hang out "" since I am working only five blocks away, five days a week. but you can come hang out in my restaurant whenever you aren't working."" I tell him that I am dating someone and that I didn't think it was appropriate for us to be hanging out. and I didn't talk to him for a couple months after that. 

Near the middle of July I call him by accident while trying to call someone else with the first 6 numbers of his phone number, I leave him a message thinking it is someone else. he texts me and says that he listened to my message asks me what is going on in my life. I tell him that I have a new job, then he congratulates me and says that his brother-in-law is suing him for damages from the fight that they got into, and that he has to go to court over it. and that he is going to be in for pre-trial the following morning at 8 am. I suggest we meet up for coffee, but then I over slept and didn't have time. I texted him apologizing and asked if he was free later in the day, he wasn't. we didn't talk to a couple more weeks.

I go to his restaurant, hoping he will be there one night. and he isn't... I ask his co-worker if he is there, and she said that he usually works mornings. she asks how I know him, and I say that he is a friend, she is sitting at the bar, off the clock. we start talking, and she asks me if I am dating anyone, I say no. she asks what my type of guy is. I describe who my dream man is, and she smiles ans says that sounds like (his name) why don't you go for him? I say well, I would like to, but the timing never lined up with everything going on in his life, but I am sure he is dating someone right now anyway. she says he isn't dating anyone right now but he is getting a puppy. and she laughs. on the way out, I get her number, and let her know that it was nice to talk to her, and that I might go for him if I ever have the guts. I end up talking to him on the phone later, and he says that he missed me, and that he had his final court date later that week. and he wanted to know if I wanted to spend some time together. I said I worked a lot, but maybe if I have time later in the week. I end up going to his restaurant after work one day. and he is working, it is really busy, so I write this cute note, that outlines everything I like about him, and how much I want to be with him. I give the note to him, he hugs me, and then I walk home. after he gets off work, he texts me that it was nice that he had someone who cared about him so much, I take that meaning that he isn't interested... and I  leave him alone, I get back together with my boyfriend from before.

to my surprise, he calls me up a couple of days after that, and he asks if I could come hang out, but he was sick. I was taking a sick day off of work too, so I go out there to see him. I didn't have a car at the time, so I took a bus. his mom picks me up from the bus station, and drives me there because he was too sick to drive. she says that she hasn't seen me in awhile, and that it was nice to see me again. when I get to his house, she has to leave, so me and him are alone. he tells me that he still didn't tell his mom that we weren't dating, just in case. I sit on the couch next to him, and ask him if he needs anything. he says "" maybe a glass of water?"" I grab him a glass of water, and then when I sit down next to him again he says ""I think I am ready to date you"" I tell him that I have been wanting to date him for a long time, but now things are a bit more complicated. my phone starts to ring. I step outside and answer it, it is my boyfriend. and he is wondering what I am up to, I tell him that I am over at (his name)'s house because he is sick, and I wanted to check on him. he said that it wasn't okay (which I totally understand), and I said that I knew this, but I was legitimately worried. he said that he wanted to break up. I start bawling, and say fine. I walk inside, I can't stop crying. he asks me what is wrong, I tell him that I just broke up with my boyfriend. he starts hyperventilating and falls off the couch. he is on the floor, and he starts seizing up, and he says ""oh my god, we need to get to the hospital. grab my keys and phone."" so I do that, then he says ""I have to admit, I did some Ecstasy last night"" I was shocked, I never seen him do anything besides drink. but I help him into the car, we drive to the hospital, and he has his fists clenched, and he is breathing hard. I am trying to stay calm, he is going in and out of consciousness. on the inside, I am freaking out, on the outside, I am trying to stay calm. I just repeat ""just hold on, stay awake"" over and over. we get to the hospital, I ask the lady to grab a wheelchair at the emergency exit, we get him into the wheelchair, and I go park the car. I run back into the emergency room, and he is sitting in his chair, out of it. wheel him over to an area where there is another chair, and I sit there. I am holding his hand, he asks me if I can call his mom, he tells me the number, and he says ""save it in your phone, you will need it."" so I call her, and leave her a message that we are at the hospital. they check him in, and I get a call again from my boyfriend. 

I step outside and answer it, keeping an eye on him from door. he asks me what is happening, I say that I am at the hospital with (his name) and that I will be there for a bit. and that I was sorry. he said that he would pick me up, and I said alright. but I couldn't leave until his mom was there with him at the hospital. he asked if that was his mom on the phone, I said no. they were taking a look at him in one of the triage rooms, and I peeked in, and they said he seemed to have had an anxiety attack. they asked him if anything stressful or traumatic happened today, he looked at me and said no. I felt so awful. I caused this. and so I wheeled him back to the waiting area. his mom arrived, so I asked her if I could get them anything from the cafeteria. so I was walking there, and my boyfriend calls me, telling me that he is there. I see him in the hallway, and he is asking me what is going on, I told him what happened.  and he says that he is going to take me home, but he wants to see his guy, I say okay. but I needed to get something for them to eat first. get the food and we are walking back, he walk up to them, I give them the food. and I say that I am going home, and then my boyfriend waves at them and says ""I am her boyfriend, (his name)"" and glares are him and his mom. he looked so disappointed. 

as I get in my boyfriend's car, I get a text saying ""thank you for being here for me today, you didn't deserve to be thrown into a situation like that. I really, really appreciate that. and you can always count on me for friendship."" I also got a text from his mom, she said ""thank you for being there today, I don't know what I would have done if you weren't here"" my heart sank because I knew that I was the reason for it. my boyfriend was happy that I helped him, but I never told him that I was the reason for it, or what led up to it. two days later, he called me, and he asked me who I would choose.I said that I didn't know, but I wanted him. I asked if I could have a couple of days to think about it, and he said yes. a couple of days later, I called him up and told him that I would worry that I would be too much added on top of everything else, and that when I was on a better track in my life, maybe we could revisit it. I regret not picking him multiple times over, and I just wish I wasn't such a coward. I really, really fear that I will hurt him, and I didn't trust my abilities in relationships. now that I know I can do it, I want to try it out with him. but I don't think he would be interested now that I am single.  


TL;DR I was asked out multiple times by this awesome guy, over the course of a year, but I rejected him because I was never in a position where I was ready for dating someone I really liked. I had only been in two very abusive relationships, and that is all I knew at the time. now, I regret it. because I had so many chances to be with a person that I really clicked with. I honestly feel like I should tell him that I want to date him, but I doubt he still is interested. or cares. I haven't talked to him since August, so I feel like I royally f-cked up. I tried to call him a couple of days ago, but he didn't answer. is there anything I can do to show him that I am ready for a relationship?"
2uf7w7,0,2015-02-01,First date seemingly went very well... now she's unresponsive... what do I do??,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/2uf7w7/first_date_seemingly_went_very_well_now_shes/,"This might get long but bear with me, I really need this help. I know I'm overthinking this a LOT, but I can't help it. It's all I've been thinking about and it's starting to drive me crazy lol.

I was on Tinder for a while, and had a few lines back and forth with a girl. Then she stopped responding. Not unnatural. Well, I eventually decided to delete the app and I copied and pasted the following to many girls. ""Right. Well, if you change your mind, here's my number ____. Shoot a message sometime, let me take you out for coffee:)"" I sent this to mostly a lot of girls who ended up not replying to me, and honestly never thought it would work... it was more for the gags. Well, I got numerous numbers over the next few days.

This particular girl was insanely pretty. She lives near/goes to the same uni. She texted me, then added me on FB and we continued talking there. Literally sending essays... she's smart too. She also added me on snapchat which we frequently used. I'll let it be known she's a bit slow at replying sometimes though... she knows how to put down her phone. Fast forward a few weeks, and we've decided to meet up for coffee.

Asks me to meet up with her somewhere on campus... of course she's with all her friends, so it's a bit awks to get her. But we start walking to the mall (I work at Starbucks so my whole gag was ""I can get you free coffee!!!"" haha). And we're talking... sure there are awkward pauses, but either she or I fill them in. She's engaged... talking... answering questions... asking me questions. 

Then we decide to walk back to my place and hang out there for a few hours. Only chatting. But again, she seems to engaged... nothing shows me she's uncomfortable (for godsake she came back to my place!!!). She's smiling, laughing and it honestly feels great... We're on the same page about relationships (she brought up her ex so the conversation naturally steered that way). We didn't talk about us specifically, obviously, it's only the first time meeting. She was saying she's not really into hookups, she doesn't like it (I think she tried that over the summer). She asks me about Tinder and if I've met some people, and I said yeah... she asks me if that means I've had sex with people and I say yeah a few... jokingly ""hope that doesn't make me trashy"", and she laughs ""don't worry I'm not judgy"". 

Then she needs to leave so I walk her to the subway... even though it's like 15 minutes away, she let me walk her instead of ""no, no don't worry"" or anything. And even then, we were engaged and talking and she was still asking me questions. She even joked I could help her with her philosophy essay because I took the same class last year!

Later that night I sent her two snapchats... the first ""hows that work coming along?"" and the second was something random (I was stoned and listening to loud music with a friend lol). She opens and doesnt reply... ouch, but she's done this before.... maybe she'll send something the morning like she does... nothing... I wait all day, and decide jjust to send her a text. ""Sooo have you chosen the topic to go with your philosophy essay??"" And of course... nothing. Yet she's watching my snapchat stories and going on twitter. My phone IS a piece of shit and I'd love to think that my messages arent going through or hers arent coming in... but I highly doubt that.

Now I don't know what to do. Girls are either super into you, or not at all. Or somewhere in between and still need convincing... she's obviously not into me because she'd be making a point to talk to me. If she wasn't into me and she knew that 100%... well I'm sure she'd have deleted me from FB and snapchat by now, and all the little things like deciding to still come back to my place after having lunch out, and letting me walk her to the subway and stuff. I know she's SUPER busy too with school and internship but what gets me the most is that we were talking about communication and how technology has stopped people from actually talking, and I was saying how I dont like when people arent upfront. I'd rather someone say ""sorry, I'm just not interested"" than hear nothing back... and now she seems to be doing just that!

I think the only chance I could possibly have with her is, maybe she's unsure and we just need to hang out a few times and get to know each other better... I'm thinking of texting her sometime tomorrow (give her space today) with something along the lines of ""Soooo if you're free sometime this week, let me take you to the red bench:)"" (the red bench is a coffee house that also makes cookies and frozen yogurt, it's neat). I'm not sure if adding ""Honestly though, if you're not interested... you can just say, I wont be offended but id rather know for sure"". 

See, I don't know if that would be too ""clingy"" or not... but how else can I guarantee SOME sort of response??? She was telling me she left her ex because she met some other guy over the summer... supposedly a ""douchebag guy"" but they could talk at least. SO maybe she thought I was too nice? I have no idea. Maybe me sleeping with others turned her off. I haven no idea. All I know is that everything seemed to be going SO well, I totally thought hands down we'd get a second date... now It's looking quite bleak. All I want to do is hangout with her again, get another chance to have her know me a bit better. At the end of the day, I know I can't force something... but I really do think seeing her a second time can help... like, I'd need to grow on her. 

Funny enough I met another girl on tinder a while back who wanted to be ""just friends"". Eventually, she kissed me (even though saying before she didnt think she could be attracted to me that way), then it was casual sex... and her telling me that it was perfectly fine how it was without feelings coming into play... then a few weeks later her telling me she was developing feelings. I'm still dealing with that, but I mean, goes to show that if someone is on the fence about how they feel, it can easily go either way the better you get to know someone! 

Any ideas?"
2uf8o5,8,2015-02-01,My Mother the Proto-Narcissist: Origins,octopusghost,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2uf8o5/my_mother_the_protonarcissist_origins/,"This is a bit of a strange tale, because my mother wasn't really a narcissist in the sense that most of the Nparents described here are. She really loves and cares for both me and my sister, she just goes about expressing that in a way that will sound rather familiar to most people here, and mostly because her mother was truly a full-on narcissist.

My mother came from two rather rich families. The details aren't important (no it didn't trickle down to me as my mother was disinherited by her grandmother for marrying a Jew, and her alcoholic father divorced her mother and started another family), but what it boils down to is that she lived alone with her Nmom in an apartment in downtown Chicago and spent most of her summers away at various camps. Her mother was extremely disinterested in anything she did, and mostly ignored her until she turned twelve. My mother developed fairly early. Especially in the breast area. At this point in time, her mother was an actress and actively dating an endless string of men in an attempt to find a replacement for her ex-husband before she became too old to be desirable (spoiler alert: she didn't). When my mother hit puberty, her mother suddenly started to notice that her dates were paying attention to my mother, and my mother would often get more attention from men than she did on the few occasions they went out together for local social functions. At this point, the disinterest turned into outright hatred. Suddenly my grandmother started to referring to my mother as “bitch-brat” whenever they were around other people. My mother dealt with this by applying to college in her junior year of highschool, and moving the fuck out at the first possible opportunity.

Now, in a sane world, this would be the end of this part of the story. Unfortunately, it isn't. Several years went by wit little to no contact between my mother and her mother. My mother went to college, finished her major, went and lived in Soviet Russia for two years, came back, complete pre-med and then medical school. Then, while my mother was in her internship, she got a call from her mother. She had fallen down the stairs and broken a hip, and needed someone to take care of her while she got a hip replacement. She was still alone (and pushing 60), so she guilt-tripped my mother into letting her move in with her.

Now at this point my mother was extremely busy. Her mother envied her life (or more specifically the fact that she had one), and constantly tried to undermine her. There were constant complaints about my mother never being around even though she was in the middle of an insane amount of work. Once her mother healed, she practically refused to leave because “she didn't want to be alone in her old age”. Once my mother had finished her internship, she moved again for her residency. She left her mother her old apartment. A few weeks later, her mother followed her and got an apartment in the same building with her. I'm not clear on exactly what happened after this, but my mother ended up moving halfway across the country and didn't tell her mother where. She met and married my father without telling her mother. She never even told her mother that she had children until about a month before her mother died. At this point her mother was so senile that she didn't even recognize my mother as her daughter.

Thanks to you all, I have found my passion!",At_Work_Now,keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/2ufe16/just_a_thanks_to_everyone_on_this_subreddit/,"I wanted to say thank you to everyone here.  I've been lurking this sub and /r/ketogains for about a month now. 

I started keto about a month ago and through talking with friends and the advice on this subreddit, I've been able to lose 11 pounds (about 5 of that was from water weight) in just under 4 weeks.  I started at a 16.1 percent body fat (bod pod tested) at 171.6 pounds.  Before I started keto I was just restricting my calories and ended up starting keto at 168 pounds.  I am currently weighing in at 157 pounds.  I'm not sure what my BF is right now but visually I'm sitting between 12 and 13 percent. I'm getting tested again come the end of February.

I feel more alert.  My depression has been minimal.  I no longer want to commit suicide.  And most importantly I found the direction I want to go with my life.  I have just filled out an application to go back to school for a degree in human nutrition and food.  This should take me about 2 years to achieve and by the end of this I will be applying to a dietetic internship to become a Registered Dietitian.

The way I came to this conclusion and this direction in life was that I enjoyed talking to people about the science behind keto.  I also enjoyed seeing people's reactions to how much weight I have lost (73 pounds) since I began my journey toward a healthier life style 7 years ago.  I've already been told by a few people that I have inspired them.  If i can help 1 person reach their goals, or even just make that initial step, like my friends, Lyle McDonald, martinus, and everyone on this subreddit, then I will have had an meaningful and excellent life.

Thank you all again, keto saved my life and gave me purpose."

I am really interested in heading in this direction with my career and this would be a great opportunity at a company that is well known in my region. 

A little background on myself: I am a senior in a Computer Information Systems program and I have had multiple courses focusing on java, html, css, javascript/jquery, sql (using mysql/mysqlworkbench), php, networking,  and project management. 

I have completed a range of class projects using all of these technologies and I have been working in the IT department at my school as a student web developer managing and creating content with dotnetnuke, sharepoint, windows server 2012, and sql server management studio for just over a year.

I have never used a lot of the software they mentioned in their job listing (SAP Crystal Reports, BusinessObjects, Clarity PPM), and I have never done any sort of network analysis or design work. 

So, my question is this: How do I leverage my current experience while minimizing my lack of real networking experience in this situation? While I have a basic understanding of what the job entails, I really kind of feel like I am jumping into an entirely new world. 

Suggestions on things I should be reading up on before my interview or terms/concepts I should understand would be great as well.

Any help would be appreciated!

2uftmg,42,2015-02-01,"Exodus: or, Out of the Den of Beards",[deleted],neckbeardstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/neckbeardstories/comments/2uftmg/exodus_or_out_of_the_den_of_beards/,"From here on out, the euphoria intensifies, and this little saga runs from the beginning of my last semester in high school through the summer before college. This installment is probably gonna be hella long, so hold onto your rosaries, cause we're going in.

Let's meet our cast.

Dramatis Personae:
&gt;* Apollonia (Me. You probably remember me from last time.)
&gt;* Herodias (A legbeard. Tumblrista ""social justice warrior"" before either became noted, and pouty storm cloud personified.)
&gt;* Saul (A boy. Used to be cool, now rules his little high school club with an iron fist. Actively seeks to undermine anything he doesn't personally care for.)
&gt;* Sarah (A girl. Used to be one of my best friends till she started dating Saul. Token hot girl, main m'lady of this robotic Sodom.)
&gt;* Lot (A boy. I went on a solitary date with him before these tragic events. Has the personality of a roof shingle. Big in later chapters.)
&gt;* Berith (A neckbeard. Freshman when I was a senior.)
&gt;* Solomon (A wise man. The engineering teacher and teacher-sponsor for the Robotics team. A dear friend of mine, to this day.)
&gt;* Moloch (A creep. You probably remember him from last time too.)

I was a member of my school's FIRST robotics team since I was a freshman, but things started changing my senior year. I was kept on as someone who's capable of understanding scientific concepts and being able to fluently write them, and because I'd made a number of friends on the team. It was truly like a family.

My dad skipped out on my mother, brother and myself when I was just a kid, (my brother younger still,) and I found a father figure in Solomon. He was, for all intents and purposes, a hippie such as myself, and we could easily bond over folk songs and flower crowns from the start. He saw me through the roughest of times for me in high school. I still go to his family functions, I'm great friends with his wife and kids.

Solomon wanted to ensure that the team would be an open space for any who were interested, and the team remained this picturesque democracy for years. I was able to work my way up to a leadership position, and by senior year I had perfected a week-long workshop on teaching kids how to write, whether or not it was their inclination. To take a kid who shamefully admits that he doesn't know how to write well and be able to explain that it's no different than building a robot, or a bridge, or anything else is really one of my favorite things on this good earth.

But when Saul was made president of the team, things started to go to shit. Saul and I had freshman orientation together, I remember sitting cross-legged with him listening to Solomon tell us about wiring. He was like a second little brother to me. But that minute gift of power changed him. Suddenly, any idea that he thought wasn't the best was thrown out in infancy. He went so far as to declare my fields of expertise, Writing and Outreach, redundant. It stung, being excommunicated from something I'd given my all to, but I had other circles.

I started writing for the school literary magazine, and since I'd recently gotten an internship at a community theatre, life was looking up. This theatre gave me the opportunity to perform my poetry at charity events, and I was finally able to make a name for myself.

About a week before this towering pile of flaming shit burned down, I had a lunch date with a new kid at school: Lot. Lot had just moved to the US from Montreal, and it was nice to have someone to speak en francais with who wouldn't judge my terrible grammar. In all honesty, I've had surgeries more pleasant than our date. I even had to pay for my own pasta-salad. Little did I know that Lot was on the team this year.

I couldn't speak accurately of my intentions, but I went back to Solomon's room one day to either gloat or see how badly things were going without me. All the girls on the team had been subjugated to minor roles and cleaning duty while incoming freshman boys with no experience were given leadership roles. Saul was off his rocker with power. Apparently, his thirst for power and validation came from his girlfriend Sarah's recent leave of absence for college, (she graduated a year before us.)

When Sarah transferred to an in-state school and was able to come back to the team (and Saul) as a mentor, God had chosen to re-introduce me to this state of chaos. A recent influx of funding turned the humble un-used classroom behind the gym into an all-out manufacturing Mecca. They had a CNC router and lathe, and an entire store-closet for wheels alone, (this was about a year before 3D printing made it big-time.) It was like high school Andrew Carnegie with his parents' credit card.

I was gone for four months, tops, and already everyone had forgotten my name. So, little poet in the big city, I ask the closest person where one could find Saul or Sarah.

This person was Berith. Berith was tall, maybe 6'4"", lanky as the grave, with a nose with no bridge and eyes like a shark's. No facial hair yet, though. He just stared at me, slightly glaring, and asked what I was doing there.

I explained that I used to be on the team, I just came back to visit Saul and Sarah, only to have him begin to quiz me on everything from programming to scientific history. Part of this included me upholding the absurdist aspect of Schrodinger's Cat, and him literally chasing me around a wooden table because I was wrong. I shit you not, in an attempt to uphold the slightest semblance of personal space, I had to use a table as a buffer zone. Thank Christ I left. This little skirmish between Berith and myself had attracted Sarah's attention, and she came over to rescue me. Berith greeted her the way a five year old would greet their nanny, and he even bent down to give her a hover-hug

Sarah and I used to be the absolute picture of bosom friends. Then she started dating Saul, and his more heartless elements started to rub off on her, including claiming poetry is useless to society and laughing in my face despite me spilling my heart out on serious issues. Like lemon juice in a papercut. Like salt in the stigmata. But part of me still loved Sarah, part of me always will, and it greatly pained me to see her engineering genius reduced to volunteer babysitter.

She effectively pulled me away from a frothing Berith, telling me she has someone to introduce me to. Dreading another Berith, I puffed out like a songbird. Chin up, boobs out, it's fucking showtime.

I was not expecting Herodias. Herodias was a sophomore girl, almost a full foot shorter than me, (I felt so powerful!) with pretty chestnut hair cut short and smooth, milky skin. She had big, brown doe-eyes that I would have killed for. She would have been simply stunning if it weren't for everything else about her. I can only describe her general theme as ""Lisa Frank meets Marcia Brady."" Herodias had been brought on in my stead as the writing expert as well as head of outreach. It's a very surreal experience to see that your replacement is some small, almost spherical ball of hatred and tacky sweaters.

And almost spherical she was! I don't have a problem with the body-positivity movement, (I think it's great!) but I'd just never seen someone whose torso looked not like the soft rolls of Rubens' muses, but something akin to a hard exoskeletal ball. I was a little concerned, to be honest.

But I was immediately happy to see that Saul hadn't squashed out all the girls from the team. I cheerily introduced myself, and was rudely greeted with only a scoff. 

We tried to have a conversation, if you could call a one sided stream of insults toward me a conversation. Among other things, she accused me of being classist, (I'm poor as the dirt) because I read the classics and not fanfiction. She accused me of being homophobic, (I'm bisexual, no small feat in this home Missitucky) because I don't have a problem with staying in the closet. And best of all, she accused me of being a phony activist because I don't run a blog about social issues.

I told her that no, I didn't have to run a blog about social issues, because I'm out living them. I'm out at protests, I'm out talking to the young people on the streets rather than just using them as talking points. I was so morally disgusted with her that I got up and walked away.

Sarah hit me up on Facebook that night and asked me to come back and do my workshop one last time, for old time's sake, and she was sorry about Herodias. I agreed to, over a Skype call, and such began my descent into Hell. It's been said that any story that can be told is, at heart, the Orpheus story. I know what happened to Lot's wife, (actual Lot, not roof-shingle Lot.) she turned to salt when looking back; that wasn't gonna be me. 

The call went well enough through the actual lecture, with Saul, Sarah, Solomon, Lot, Herodias, and a couple more in ""attendance."" Hopefully I actually got through to one or two of them. However, when all was said and done, Herodias couldn't let it go. She let loose a barrage of complaints. How was she to do any of this when so and so stresses her out as it is? Everyone on the team is mean to her! Why should she bother being nice to anyone when they step on her precious fee-fees? I even tried explaining to her that I was in her shoes once, my depression was bad too, I did some time in psych wards, and her insistence that she has it worse than the whole world (including starving kids, orphans, AND starving orphans!) was bordering on the offensive.

She didn't care. Why would she? I tried to keep her talking for as long as possible, hoping the conversation would cycle back to something harmless that maybe we could see eye-to-eye on. She let it slip that she should be taken seriously because not only was she not like the rest of the dumb female sheep who are into /makeup/ and /romance novels,/ she was dating a smart senior guy. This conversation was sounding strangely familiar, but typical me, I couldn't place it at the time.

So naturally, I asked what his name was, what he wanted to major in, the works. When she proudly announced his name was ""Moloch,"" my jaw hit the ground.

I'd like to chalk it up to being in shock, but I gave her a hastened ""congrats"" and ended the call. I didn't tell her at the time what he'd done to Ruth and myself. Now, I wish I had.

These are just the headliners in this circus of beards, and in my handful of hours back for a visit, I had been sexually propositioned and insulted more times than I could count. Any neckbeard who complains that he wants to see the asshole that girls go for should be given a mirror because never in my life could I explain something so eloquently as that simple look of self-realization. 

Take away whatever morals you want from these doleful stories, but know that these people, self-aware or not, are not limited to my seedy southern hub-cities; they are everywhere. You know one, hell, your parents may have been one. And if you yourself were once this same puddle of arrogance and poor hygiene, then I salute you. Your reformation is nothing short of holy.

**tl;dr:** I return to my old high school robotics team for a day only to be harassed and spiritually disappointed.

2ufwne,0,2015-02-01,"Details on Marvel Projects, Incl. Short List Of Directors For Thor: Ragnarok",the_marvel_intern,marvelstudios,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/2ufwne/details_on_marvel_projects_incl_short_list_of/,"So pour one out for me chaps, I've been laid off!

Quick backstory on me, I started off as an Intern with Marvel Studios back in Summer 2013. By end of that year I was hired on as a PA for a prolific staff member of Marvel Studios. I generally assisted with day-to-day operations on many Marvel projects. As such, I got to see a lot of stuff the fans would like to know.

However, at the beginning of this year, I was laid off. What a shame huh? Well it's Marvel's loss as I really don't give a shit about what I know, and care even less about what I was asked to keep quiet on.

Most of the stuff I knew is public knowledge at this point: Russos are negotiating to direct Infinity War I/II, Inhumans and Cap Marvel will act as an informal middle point. So don't think two films, think four. These films are meant to incorporate a lot of what was great about the Infinity Gauntlet storyline, but will also pull some clever twists that even the most seasoned nerds won't see coming. This won't be a straight up adaption.

What may be more interesting to fans is who Marvel wants to direct Thor 3, or Thor: Ragnarok. Marvel internally is treating this as if the Thor films are in critical condition. Many felt as if the first film had too much humor without striking the right balance, and that The Dark World had too many behind-the-scenes issues that in Marvels eyes, prevented it from being as big of a hit as it could be.

Marvel is looking for a director who will treat the Thor franchise with a lot of respect. Taking in the source material more, and dropping characters like Darcy who Marvel sees as being 'forcefully manufactured'.

As for who could direct Thor: Ragnarok, the front runner is currently Adam Mckay (Anchorman). Mckay who has mainly directed comedies, did a substantial re-write on Ant-Man. During this time, both Marvel and Mckay saw a lot of potential on both sides in working together. Mckay understands these characters, more so then the perception of him probably allows. Also, because he's worked with Marvel, the studio is comfortable working with him and knows the type of output he'll churn out.

Also up for consideration is Gareth Edwards (Godzilla). Who was the front-runner for some time. The main reason Marvel isn't 100% behind him is simply timing. Edwards has Star Wars and Godzilla 2, and a small window between both films where he could direct the Thor sequel. If timing was to work, both parties are interested. It's said that it was Edwards ability to balance the large scale battles of Godzilla with the brevity of the human characters that has Marvel confident he's a good fit for the job. By time I was let go of Marvel, no one knew with any certainty if he would do it or not.

The final candidate is Matt Reeves (Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes) who is being considered mainly due to his success in taking over the Apes franchise from Rupert Wyatt where he dug in his heels and really created a better film. Marvel is essentially hoping someone can do the same with Thor, and thinks that he has a good vision for the third Thor film.

Is there more? Hell yeah! I have a notepad in front of me that I furiously wrote in for a year. This is only four pages of my 200 page notebook. Do I want to transcribe more? Yes. Will I do it now? No. I'm going to come back and give you guys more if I feel like it's something worth knowing. 

For now,
Cheers!"

There are only two gyms within a reasonable distance, so I called them both and neither will allow me to do the full lifts. 

I've been lifting/working out in some capacity for the past 5 years, but only got serious about getting strong in the past two, then picked up weightlifting last March. 

Weightlifting is the first one that I've truly loved, and I don't want to lose the progress that I've made in the last year. I have a fairly strong foundation, and realize that for the next six months or so I'll have to focus on building my strength and such, but I have no idea what sort of program to follow.

Are there any weightlifting specific programs out there for building strength while maintaining as much progress as possible that don't include the full lifts? One of the gyms does allow cleans though, so they're still an option.

I had a coach for my first few months, but he moved over the summer and I have lost contact with him since. I drop in at a local crossfit box every once in a while to get my form checked, but I'm afraid of asking anyone there about programming because I know the answer will be to just get back into strictly crossfit; which wouldn't be an option even it I wanted to given my future gym choices.

Sorry for the lengthy post, but you guys are great and I can't wait for your insight! Thank you!"

I really want to get into IT as fast as possible to start working with computers, however I really don't feel as I have the qualifications to work in the field yet.

I have found at least two Entry Level Tech Support job postings saying A+ cert is a plus.

What should I do with my month until school starts? Should I study for the A+ cert and try to earn it to get into a tech support job? Should I study for CCENT or a Microsoft certification now instead? Or, should I do Codecademy and learn to code all of those languages, hoping that it all looks good on a resume for software jobs?

Graduating in December. As experience, I built a webapp that downloads mp3 metadata from an itunes database based off of youtube URLs. I was also a math tutor once. I know that I want to do web-dev, haven't had enough experience with front- or back-end to really know which I'd like to choose. Next to this, my experience is practically nil. I had an interview with Amazon once and bombed it due to severe underpreparation.

I feel like my efforts are better spent by: (1) practicing interview questions, (2) getting small programming gigs (jobs, side projects) to gain skills, have fun, and build my portfolio, as well as to narrow down what aspect of web-dev I'd like to focus on (3) going to a career workshop to refresh myself on what companies are actually looking for.

Really, I feel like my skills are best suited for little gigs than for summer internships. [Here's](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kq298r7w9cydwg7/cv_sep2014_critique.pdf?dl=0) my latest resume.

My experience at career fairs has been asking different companies what they're about, perceiving myself getting shot down once recruiters glance at my GPA (2.6), and being generally clueless.

I'm really just looking for one or two compelling reasons why I should go anyway. At this point I'm convinced it's a waste, but I can't help but feel a sense of irresponsibility by not going. More importantly, there may be some benefit to going that I may not be seeing right now.

It feels kind of silly having these on my resume, but they're the only real job experience I've had. I have a few questions:

1. Will I be laughed at having these on my resume?

2. Should I take them off altogether?

3. Am I totally fucked not having any relevant job experience?

EDIT: Thanks for the advice, guys. I think I'm going to keep the jobs on my resume, but I shortened the descriptions and tried to highlight relevant experience I gained from them like some of you suggested.

People normally describe me as funny and charismatic; I get called handsome *for an Asian dude* (lol) and go to the gym 4-5 times a week. My height's clocked in at 5'7. I'm not saying these things to brag or otherwise, this is all just for context and to establish the fact that I'm more or less a well-adjusted Asian male. I'm not chad thundercock, but i'm not beta billy either.

I've had different girlfriends of different ethnicities (white, Mexican, Asian) all throughout high school and college, but looking back at it now, I've almost always had to put in the effort and make the chase. All of my relationships have been forged from my sacrificing a large amount of time and energy. I thought this was normal. I thought that meticulously thinking about what to text back and how to plan future dates was just a fact of life, and actually, it is for a lot of people. That was my reality about three years ago. 

Fast forward to my third year of college, I decided to study abroad. My first choice was Hong Kong, but my dad convinced me to go to Singapore instead because they're all native speakers of English. Sure, why not, Singapore it is. I tell all my friends about the prospect and surprisingly enough, one of them decides to come with me. Now this guy, let's call him Jim, is a real good lookin dude; about 6-feet-tall, beautiful wavy blond hair and blue eyes, water polo player - you know, the kind of guy you'd see in a magazine (actually, this guy at the time was aspiring to become a full-time male model / actor). He had always gotten girls pretty effortlessly (unlike myself) in college, I mean how could you not with stats like that. 

So Jim and I enroll into the program and get all of our shit together. Off we are to Singapore. Things go swimmingly and we find ourselves an awesome condo with 4 other exchange students. Classes start, but who really cares? I meet some cool people in class and through my roommates - before we know it, we more or less had formed a social circle and started going out for night-time shenanigans every weekend. And that shit was **eye opening**. For the very first time in my life, nearly all of my interactions with women felt natural and unforced. I was generating interest &amp; attraction from women for just *being myself*, something that had never happened before on a regular basis. Women were visibly enjoying themselves around me, and I was in awe of that concept, which kind of goes to show you how much western society can fuck up your head about these things. Not surprisingly in the end, I was getting large amounts of interest from women of different nationalities *except* for other Americans - business as usual there.

Now what about Jim? I thought he would have done spectacularly in Singapore, but not really. Don't get me wrong, he still did alright, but I think that years of being put on a pedestal from American girls probably messed up his head in a way too. Girls in Singapore don't go head over heels to chase white guys (at least not a majority of them) - over there, Asian males are the sought after demographic in parallel to what white guys experience here.

In total, I spent five months there studying abroad and ended up enjoying myself so much that I decided to take a summer internship there. I came back to the states for about 5 months for the spring semester and went back for another 3. I enjoyed it even more my second time around. To be honest, it's completely jaded my views on dating here - I really can't be fucked with spending hours chasing women of inflated value with my deflated value. 

So, that's why I'll be leaving my cushy job in San Francisco for the humid heat of Singapore. If any of you reading happen to be there or have connections there, let's talk! I'll be hunting for employment pretty soon.

 **TL;DR: Grass is greener on the other side.**

Wish you all the best, bros!"
2ugczz,2,2015-02-01,Asking for a promotion,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2ugczz/asking_for_a_promotion/,"Hello everyone,

I started a research job back in July, and since then have taken on a variety of large scale projects, including some that involved flying out to customers to make presentations.  My boss has continually praised my work throughout the past eight months, and I've had senior VP's tell me that I'm doing a fantastic job and they're glad to have me on board.  I was recently asked to take on a large-scale analytical project that would require hiring an intern to work under me.

Now that it's almost time for my performance review, I want to work up the nerve to ask for a promotion.  When I was hired, I was told that one of the best parts of my company was the ability to move up quickly, and that people at my level generally get promoted within 6 months- 2 years.  I know I'm on the low end of the range but I think I've accomplished a lot considering my short time here.

I recently looked at the HR descriptions of my job vs. the next level up, and I think the level of depth I've gotten into in my projects, as well as my expertise level, match the higher job.  I have 2 major things working against me at this point:

1- My age.  I graduated a month before I began my new job and am still seen as the baby of the company
2- Another person at my level in my department, who is 6 years older than me.  He started the same month as me but transferred into my department from a different one within the same office. My company likes to keep everyone on an ""equal"" level and may not want to promote me without promoting him, especially because he's been at the actual company longer than me.

I really think I deserve this promotion and a raise.  However, I fear being ""put into my place"", and I want to avoid the image of the entitled Millennial who has an overinflated sense of their own self worth.  How have you ladies (especially new grads) gone about asking for a promotion and/or raise, and do you have any advice for a first-timer?  "
2ugk92,1,2015-02-01,Why an early start makes all the difference,MMYourWay,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2ugk92/why_an_early_start_makes_all_the_difference/,"I have started working at the age of 12 or 13. No child labor, I was a baby sitter, then a tutor to smaller kids, and since I also played the piano well enough, my music teacher would lend me the music room at lunch time to teach a one hour lesson. I remember I charged about $20 for that hour and that was HUGE money. While my friends were bored at the cafeteria, I was making money!

 

My high school was in a privileged neighborhood and most of my friends had big allowances. Yet none was to the tune of the $500+ I was making with my part time jobs. After school, I would pick up two kids and help them with homework until their mother got home. At 7pm I was home and ready to have dinner and study a bit.

 

Studying came easy so it didn’t take much time. I remember I bought myself a TV because I was bored, and looking back, I had 5 customers for tutoring or piano at any given time, plus the occasional baby sitting, my own piano, horse riding and tennis lesson, was a girl scout, spent some time playing the organ at church, and still had time to be BORED!

 

Moving on to college, I always had 2-3 gigs going on, there is a list of my odd jobs here, from McD employee of the month to technical engineer for a computer multinational, I worked ALL the time. Most of my classmates were party animals ”too busy studying” to work. Better said they wanted to have fun and be careless for another five years. Today, they make six figures and are slaves to their jobs, paying back student loans for fun nights they don’t remember a thing about, and I am the one laying on a hammock under the sun.

 

Today, I can barely handle half a dozen workers on the house and a hobby blog. Why am I bragging about the past? To show you that your most productive years are while you are young. Do you remember college, when you could sleep for two hours and be back in class in the morning? I did that too. Except I was a waitress until 2am and class started at 8am.

 

All those jobs allowed me to graduate college with savings, buy a property during the last year and set off to travel the world for a year instead of entering the rat race. As of now, from what I read on other blogs, and what my friends share about their finances, I still have a bigger net worth than most people my age.

Starting early gave me an incredible advantage. After a short career with an average salary, I was able to leave the corporate world at 29 and do what I wanted with my life and time. Let’s run a few numbers.

 

If you start saving $1,200 per year (just $100/month) from age 20 to 25, then $3,000 (up to $250/month) from 25 to 30, at a rate of 7% you will have $25,843 when you are 30. Yes, the rate is high, because you are young and can take some risks. Then let’s say you start a family, have kids, and stop saving but leave your savings at 7%. When you reach age 50, you will have $100,000 just for saving less than a car payment each month from 20 to 30.

If you start when you are 35, and save $4,000 per year, it will take you 15 years at the same rate to reach $100K. You will have invested $60,000 instead of $21,000 to get the same nest egg of $100K in retirement.

Remember that $100K is nothing when we talk about retirement, so while it may be easy to find $4,000 a year in your 20s, at age 35, finding $40,000 per year to build a million dollar nest egg is another story.

 

How to find more money while you are young?
Be careful about college. I went to college because I didn’t know what else to do. I wasn’t passionate about my classes and don’t think I have learned a lot during those five years. Had I taken a job as a bank clerk or some low entry job in a company, I could have started around $20,000/year, and probably ended after five years around $35,000. Considering I was able to save $25K on half that salary, I would probably have saved $50K by age 22. College ‘’cost’’ me $25K. After that, things would probably have evened out, between hiring a college degree me with no experience or a 5 year experienced me with no college degree.

If you go, find a cheap degree. There are lots of way to study cheaply. You can get into a smaller college, then transfer for the last years into a more prestigious one. Find a job on campus, that will give you free housing, or a big discount on tuition.

Delay lifestyle inflation. I didn’t own a car until I was 30. In Europe, public transportation is easy and I always lived quite close to work. A car was not a necessity, I rented one when it was. You don’t have to live with your parents until you are 30, but if you can’t comfortably afford your lifestyle, try to do without.

Take ANY job. While you are young, don’t be too regarding, a job is a job. I flipped burgers, changed babies and faked smiles at Disneyland but it was money. You can do with the lack of sleep or the physical effort, go earn some money. If you are lazy now you will be worse in 20 years. Sure you could try to get a fantastic internship at your favorite company, even better. But if you don’t get it, find another source of income.

Be good at it. Even if you are flipping burgers, try to be the best you can, and negotiate a raise after a few months. I was teaching an adult French class at night and the language school shamelessly underpaid me. After a few weeks of excellent feedback from the students, I went back and got a 20% raise. You will probably be in an underpaid position, competing with other students who lack motivation, if you shine a little you can earn more, save more, and exit early.

 

Try your best to get an early start. If you didn’t do it for yourselves, tell your kids.

Currently work full time doing circuit board repairs and setting up linux computers for a small agriculture based company. My heart is in programming hence why I'm going back for my CS.

I've been offered to work part time during school which would be 8AM-12PM/1PM every day. I don't think this would be very accommodating. If I took a min. wage job I could still swing my bills and it would leave a lot of flexibility for internships."

This picks up right where that one left off.  I have been having a real problem coming up with an ending for this one.  When mental illness is the main subject matter there's really not much room for a happy ending.  Mental illness doesn't just go away.

So, cheers.  Enjoy.  :)

*************************************************

“Hello,” she said.

“Renee, you ok?” Tom said.

“Tom,” she breathed a sigh of relief realizing it was him.  She had completely forgotten about being on 
the phone with him when she ran out of the house.  “Yea, I’m alright.  I’m at Mel’s in the parking lot.”

“I’m on my way home now.  Renee, what exactly are we dealing with here?  I mean, should I be worried 
going inside?”  

“I don’t know.” She said, “He was just sitting on the bed when I left.”

“He didn’t come after you did he?”

“No, he didn’t.”

“You don’t think he would hurt the dog do you?”

“The dog is with me.”  Even though Samael had come with her, she found herself still considering that 
question.  Answer was still no.  

“Well I know how he can be sometimes, Renee. ”  Tom said.  He paused and she heard him puff his 
cigarette.  “I’m going to come down to Mel’s.  Just sit tight ok.”

“Alight.  I think I’m going to head inside.  They might think it’s weird that I’m just out here in the parking 
lot.”  

“Alright.  I’ll see you in a few.  Bye.”  

Her phone vibrated as he spoke.  It was either another call coming in or a text.  She pulled it away to 
look.  A text, from who she couldn’t tell.  “Alright,” she said, “I’ll talk to you soon.  

She ended the call and then scrambled to read her message.  Somehow she was both disappointed and 
relieved to see that it was Hali.  “Anthony got called back into work all night.  Come over and drink some 
wine with me.” The text read.

She texted a polite decline and put her phone down.  Samael paced in the back seat and then plopped 
down and started to lick himself.  Another text came through from Hali, “Is everything alright?”

She got out of the car and wondered what to do with Samael while she was inside.  

“Renee.” She heard suddenly, “Thought you left.”  Brenda was stepping out the door and lighting a 
cigarette.

Renee stammered, trying to think of an explanation, “I… I did.  I just went home to change my clothes.  
I’m meeting someone here.”  

“Oh.” Brenda said, a puzzled look in her eyes.  She was hoping Brenda didn’t notice that she was 
wearing the same clothes she had worn to work today.  

“It was kind of an unexpected thing.”

“And you brought your dog, interesting.”  Brenda walked closer to the car to pet Samael’s head.

“Yea well, he’s been cooped up in the house all day.”

“Oh my God Renee, what happened to you?”Brenda asked, pointing at the fresh bruise on her chest, 
just barely peeking out from under her top.

Renee felt like a deer in the headlights.  She had never been a good liar.  “It’s nothing.” She said, giving 
an uncomfortable little chuckle and fumbling with the zipper on her hoody.

“Nothing?  Really?” Brenda said, “Because it looks like a bruise to me Renee.”

“Brenda, I’m fine.” She said, “Just don’t worry about it, please.”  

“You’ve worked here for how many years now?  I think of you as family and so help me God Renee, if 
that man of yours is beating you I’ll—“

“He’s not… beating me.” She said shakily, groping for an explanation, “Things, uh, just got a little out of 
hand… in the bedroom.  That’s all.”  

Brenda’s angry expression slowly turned to a mischievous smile.  She gave a small laugh and took a drag 
off her cigarette.  “Somehow I’m not surprised.  I figured you twowere probably into some kinky shit.  
Those European guys… I’ll tell you, I learned a thing or two in Germany when I was there.  Is he a biter?”  

“Yes,” Renee admitted, “He’s a biter.”

“Oh, well sorry for thinking… you know.”

“It’s alright.”  

“You coming inside?  You can bring the dog.  We let Frank bring his dog in here all the time.  Yours is 
welcome too.”  

***

Anders looked down at the floor by the bed.  A pair of Renee’s socks were laying there.  They were 
green tie dyed and practically glowing against the neutral grey carpet.  There was nowhere he could look 
without seeing something that reminded him of her.  Her things were everywhere.  And now that she 
was gone what would he do with it all?  Would he box everything up and give it away?  No… he couldn’t 
do that.  

He wondered who he should call first.  Her Mom?  Did they already call her Mom?

As he sat, still in wet clothes considering all these practicalities the realization slowly crept into his mind 
that he would never see her again.  He would never sleep in late with her on a Sunday morning again, 
never get drunk with her again, never hear her laugh or look into her eyes again.  He swallowed back all 
the emotions that were trying so hard to escape.  There were so many things he would have said to her 
if he’d known earlier in the bathroom was the last time he would see her.  

Wait a minute… he thought to himself.  The bathroom was after the phone call.  Did he dream that she 
was still alive?  Could he have dreamt the phone call?  He looked for his phone on the table by the bed.  
It wasn’t there.  “Please don’t be in my pocket,” he thought, digging in his soaked pants and finding 
nothing.  

Where the hell was his phone?  He was a creature of habit and always kept it on the table when he 
slept.  He turned toward the bathroom, thinking maybe it was in there.  But as he turned his foot 
bumped something hard.  He looked down to see a green, blinking light.  How the hell did his phone get 
down there?  It was almost under the bed and he was so close to stepping on it.  The green light meant 
he had a message…

He quickly picked it up.  The message was from Renee, “Brenda wants me to work late, be home in 
about an hour.”  It was sent at 4:03.  He opened up his call log.  The last call he got was from a restricted 
number, at 3:33.  What a number, he thought.  333 had such Occult significance.  

What the hell was going on here?  He sat down on the bed again, confused.   

He picked up his phone again, and dialed her number.

One ring… he thought about how messed up this situation was.  Either some Sherriff had a lot of 
explaining to do or he really was losing it.  Neither would surprise him.  He had been losing it since 2006.  
It could have been a mix up.  Some other Renee Garasey’s body could have been pulled from the 
wreckage of an accident somewhere.  It couldn’t have been *his* Renee.  

Two rings…  His grip tightened on the phone and he found himself holding his breath.

Three rings… his heart rate quickened.

""Hello.” He heard her say at last.

He sat in silence for a few seconds, pondering the sound of her voice.  Was *this* real?

At last he spoke, “Renee, what happened?  Are you alright?”

“Yea… are you?”

He paused, not sure how to answer her.  “I don’t know.” He said, “I’m really confused about some 
things.  I got a call from someone claiming to be a Sherriff, telling me you were…” he didn’t even want to 
say it.  

“Telling you I was what?”

“You were killed in an accident.” 

“Oh my God…” she said softly.  “Where are you?”  The odd, cold tone of his voice made her wonder if he 
had done something stupid.  Did he get that call before or after the shower, she found herself 
wondering a lot of things.  

“I’m at home, where are you?”

“I’m at Mel’s.”

“I’m coming down there.  I need to see you.” 

“Alright.  We will figure all this out.” She reassured.  

He wasn’t so optimistic, but he said anyway, “Yes, we will.  I’ll see you shortly.” And then he added, 
“Love you.”

As he changed from his wet clothes to dry ones, his mind raced.  He hadn’t told her he loved her in 
weeks.  It was just something he didn’t say.  His parents never said it to each other when he was growing 
up.  And neither of them ever said it to him either.  He grew up thinking that was just something people 
didn’t say except in the movies.  

This train of thought continued in the car on the way to Mel’s.  He remembered his first girlfriend, Ella, 
and the first time she ever said it to him.  He was 15 and it was the first time anyone had ever told him 
that.  Of course he said it back, and at the time really believed it.  It was hard to believe he had ever 
been that naive.  He was infatuated, that was for sure.  This infatuation lasted 9 months.  

She was 18, three years older than him, five feet nothing, curvy, and full of attitude.  

Things ended when she took an internship in Trondheim.  Of course she swore this wasn’t the end.  Oslo 
and Trondheim weren’t that far apart.  She was going to take the train home every month to visit.  She 
would call every day.  After her dramatic goodbye, she came home once.  Then he never saw or 
heard from her again.  Not a call or anything.  She didn’t even have the respect to break up with him.  

Then, a year and a half after Ella, came Helena.  With Helena, there was no doubt.  He was *crazy* in 
love.    He didn’t even want to think about life without her.  She was the first thing he thought about in 
the morning and the last thing he thought about at night.  Suddenly all those cliché’s he had heard all his 
life made sense.  But apparently she didn’t share his enthusiasm.  He still remembered so vividly going 
up to her apartment and catching her with that other guy.  It was something he would never forget.

She had ruined that damn Misfits song for him forever.  He wouldn’t deny that he had fantasized about 
committing the acts described in the song once or twice.  

Renee though, she was different, in a lot of ways.  He didn’t want to imagine life without her either.  But 
unlike with Helena, he didn’t think he would ever *have* to.  

As a child his parents and teachers were concerned that he didn’t speak enough.  He was told his 
shyness would hold him back in life.  And as an adult he found that was true.  No one remembers the 
quiet guy.  His sister Livia probably heard him speak more than anyone, even Ella and Helena.  

In the states, he was the quiet foreign guy, and nothing else.  He had his circle of friends.  They were 
people he drank with mostly, and played music with.  But even with them, he was still a man of few 
words.  

The night he met Renee, though, something just clicked.  She had a small cut on her wrist from work.  
She made one joke about stigmata and it was all over.  Having always been interested in Theology, he 
had to comment on that.  He had been looking for a way to start a conversation with her all night.  She 
had come out with Curtis and Sandra, and met him and Tom for a drink.  The two of them spent the rest 
of the night talking, pretty much ignoring everyone else.  She didn't find his accent annoying like most people did.  And he didn't feel nervous an on edge while talking to her, like he did with most new people.  After the bar closed they all came back to his 
place, and she finished the night in his bed.  

People told him he shouldn’t give any respect to a woman who gave it up on the night they met.  That 
didn’t matter to him.  Some could also say he was just as bad for trying.  

It had been nine years since he’d been with anyone.  He didn’t find out for months that Curtis and 
Sandra had brought her there that night to set her up with Tom.  But that didn’t matter either.  Shit 
happens.

Of course his family was also pissed at him for dating an American woman.  Did they really expect him to 
live in the US for so long without eventually taking a liking to someone here?

And his friends no doubt had some interesting commentary as well.  He had been single the entire time 
he had known everyone in the US.  Tom and Allen even joked around about him being asexual.  So, 
seeing him with a woman was completely unfamiliar to them.  

It seemed like the drive to Mel’s was taking twice as long as usual.  It was probably all in his head.  

***

Renee was seated at the end of the bar alone when Tom came through the door.  Denise had brought 
her a Blue Moon that she didn’t even order, sat it in front of her and said nothing.  She barely sipped at 
it.  She fidgeted with the orange wedge in it as Tom sat beside her and ordered himself a Guinness.  

“Have you heard anything?’ he asked.

“Yea.” She said, lifting the orange wedge from the top of the mug.  “He called me. “

“And?”

“He said someone called him and told him I was killed in an accident.”  She said softly, pulling peel from 
the orange.  

“That’s fucked up.  Who would do that?”

“No one would do that Tom.  Either someone made a mistake or he…” she trailed off.

“He what?”

“Imagined it.”  

“That’s crazy.” Tom said, sipping his Guinness.  “How could anyone imagine that?”

“You should have seen the look in his eyes Tom.  It was like he wasn’t even there.”

“Are you sure he was awake?”

“Seemed like it.  You mentioned something about sleepwalking before.  Has he done that in the past?”

“Not that I know of, but he does take meds to help him sleep.  Haven’t you ever heard of people on 
Ambien doing crazy shit in their sleep?”

“He doesn’t take Ambien though.  He takes over the counter stuff.”

“Yea, but how much of it?  Enough of that might do the same thing.”

Renee finally took a sip of her warm Blue Moon and turned toward him.  She leaned in and pulled the 
zipper on her hoody down.  He saw the purple bruise on her breast.  “That’s where he pinched me.”  

“Shit,” Tom said, “he really wasn’t messing around was he?”

She put her head down and choked back tears.

“Hey,” he said, patting her on the shoulder, “Just relax.  It’ll be alright.”

Would it, she wondered.

There's a long story, but I'm going to try and keep it as simple as possible. I floundered at a 4 year doing something my heart was not in for 5 quarters. Winter quarter was horrible and my GPA suffered dramatically from it. I dropped my classes in the beginning of Spring of last year and took a break in order to try and figure out what I wanted to do with my life. I decided I want to be a Doctor, preferably an ER Physician, but we'll see where I end up. I couldn't transfer to any State schools because they are only accepting upper division students for transfer. Molecular Biology is the major I am interested in.
So I am now taking courses at a community college. I have an internship with COPE at a local hospital doing 2 shifts a week. Took 16 units this Fall, aced my Anatomy class, and got an A in the others, bringing my GPA up to a whopping 2.99. I am living at home, so I don't have to worry about paying the bills at the moment. 

I am way behind where I want to be. I am in Chem 1, Calc 1, Public speaking, and Critical Thinking/Writing class this Semester, which will complete my AA, but my advisor tells me I should get through my year of OChem, Bio, and Physics before transfering so that I have a better shot of making it in.
Looking at my schedule now, Chem 2 is planned this summer, with OChem 1, Calc- Based Physics 1, Molecular Bio, and Calc 2 in Fall 2015. That doesn't look feasible to me. 
So my thought was, what about Chem2 and Calc 2 in the summer? 
That way I have 3 classes Fall and Winter, and transfer the Fall of '16.

Am I on the right track? Should I take these classes in the Summer, is it possible to do so and maintain a good GPA? I feel like I am setting myself up to fail by trying to get these done all at the same time. I've shot myself in the foot enough in my college career and I'd like to avoid doing so again. So if anyone could give help me out, I'd really appreciate any advice. I want to be a Doctor, and I'm willing to work my ass of in order to do so."
2uhm19,0,2015-02-02,Summer Plans?,[deleted],premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/2uhm19/summer_plans/,"Hey guys, I just had a questions about what I should try to do over the summer. I'm a freshman right now and I'm not really sure what to try and do over the summer. Sorry for the long rant in advance haha. 

Most of the research internship programs require you to be a sophomore anyways. Even those that don't generally require at least one teacher recommendation. I did fine my first semester, but I made the mistake of just going to class and studying. I didn't really get to know any of my teachers through office hours and three of my classes were intro level classes with around 200-300 people, so any recs I could get would be very superficial. Also, I feel like it's too late for most of them? Other than NIH, I know most places are due in mid-February at the latest, which really wouldn't be enough time for me to get a solid app in. I really regret not thinking about this stuff earlier - I told myself I would over winter break, but I just couldn't really get the motivation to do anything academic over break. I did do an internship at a university near my house, so I have that if nothing else works out, but I would kind of prefer to work somewhere else. The lab and professor I worked under were great, but the lab mainly focused on bioinformatics, while I want to try to work in a more wet lab setting. I think I'm also not sure whether to go into a research internship since I am working in a research lab this semester anyways. I feel like maybe I should use the summer to get volunteering in or clinical experience instead. 

I guess my question would be what would be a better option over the summer? A research internship or some sort of volunteering/clinical experience? Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't be doing either just for my app - if I got the chance in a lab or volunteered somewhere, I would make sure those places were doing things that I genuinely enjoyed and found interesting before committing. I'm just not really sure which option to go for and would really appreciate any advice. Thanks!"

But seriously, does the chemistry dual major help out? If so, in what ways? I'm committed to Chemical Engineering, but I'm not sure if the chemistry dual major will be worth an extra organic lab + Pchem and a couple other Chemistry classes. 

The computer science minor isn't a big part of this, it'll be ~3 credits a semester, and I enjoy programming, so I picked up the minor to learn more, as well as ""verify"" to employers that I understand programming, rather than being like ""I code in my free time"".

2uhphj,1,2015-02-02,Summary of my college experience.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2uhphj/summary_of_my_college_experience/,"I can't remember the first time I saw you but I know the first class we were ever in together. At that time you were just the girl who played a college sport in our department (call you G1). I transferred in my sophomore year you were an incoming freshman. Finished this year and I didn't talk to you once. This year I was struggling with my identity (due to being socially awkward and having a porn/masturbation addiction |I have now gotten it under control|). I also sat next to this other girl who I never talked to once the whole year but we are now great friends (call you G2). Even took me awhile to realize that that was her. I made no new friends the first year at school. I had only talked to two people who also transferred from the same school to the same degree. On to summer school. I made my first two friends who I see and talk to regularly (call them F1 and F2). The next year rolled in I didn't notice G2 at all. I remember looking for jobs and asked a professor if I could use him as a personal reference. G2 was also in his office and asked the same after me because I asked. I made another friend at school (call you F3). He and I were in most of the same classes. I ended up making another friend later because we walked back to our cars after doing HW and it being around midnight (call you F4). I had no idea he did drugs like crazy. Last few weeks of school left and we could pick our groups for a project. F3 asked me if I wanted to be in his group. He recruited me because I'm on the top in the class. Said we would also have G2 and another guy in the group. At the time I didn't like G2. I though she was super bitchy. But agreed because I knew it was a good group. I ended up developing a huge crush on G2. I now felt like I had some good friends. Semester ended and almost everyone was taking the semester off to go do internships but me. I went back in the spring not knowing what to do since my two closest people were not here. G2 was there but I didn't notice her. An internship came up somehow and I got it and drop classes and got the hell out of school. I remember sending F3 a message and he was so happy for me. This internship was the most life changing experience I had ever had. First time living on my own. I had lived with my parents up to that point. Overall I didn't like my experience there but it was good for me. Now I'm back at summer school and with my friends. I walk into the lounge and start talking to friends I haven't seen in awhile. I walk into class I see G2 I walk right up to her and ask her how she has been. I sit down right next to her. I had to take a deep breath before doing that. My gosh she is beautiful. I want to ask her out but know I won't. Go to lunch with F3 and another guy (F4) we all like G2 but they tell me she has a boyfriend. I'm like fuck. Story time: I remember sitting in the lounge and hearing G1 talk about a dinner she went on with another person people are telling her it was a date. She ends up getting tearful about it. I still pat this time have no feelings for her but thought this was funny. Now she becomes the person who doesn't know what a date is. I end up smoking weed with most some of these people for the first time in my life (yes the guy who I said did drugs supplied it. F1 through F4 were there. F1 didn't smoke nor had he ever). I regret doing this. When the fall starts my senior year we seniors all have one thing on our minds get a job. I end up getting a good job. Not in the ideal location but still a good job. During this time I realize that I don't like G2 the way I though I did. She reminded me of my brother after she broke her phone and was explaining it to me. Now I'm set with a job and don't have any girls I'm considering pursuing. Then I get this dumbass idea. I want to try and hook up with this slutty girl from our class. This last about a month and she gets a boyfriend and I easily forget about her. Drum role please, Wait for it... A class that I'm in I would sit on the back row. G1 one week just decides to sit back their next to me. I don't know why she just did. I end up talking to her some. I realize that she is a really cool girl. I also realize how cute she is. I think what I also like is that she is kind of awkward like me.  I now have an official crush on G1. With only about 3 weeks left I decide I want to ask her out. I am too much of a wimp to do so. Now I decide that I will ask her out in the following semester. It's been three weeks and I still haven't. Crazy to think that I will be graduating in 3 months and will be gone. She will still be in School until the end of the year. I have been around her for 30 months and didn't make any moves much less notice her. Now I'm going to try and get her at the 2 minute warning.  Your time in college is so precious. Don't waste it waiting for girls. If they aren't available move on. The first two and a half years in college I didn't look for girls because I wanted to be with someone who was in a completely different state. Give it up. I wasted another 9 months wanting this other girl who had a boyfriend. Don't do this to yourself. I am still going to try and make something happen with this girl. She will be around extra time after school is done because of sports and I will be as well because I won't be starting my job until a month after graduation. We could still make something work out. She is going to do an internship over the summer at a place 7 hours from where I will be working. I will be only 4 hours from school so I could visit on weekends. Maybe get jobs in the same place someday soon. Who knows. I just need to try. I have forgotten the past I merely need to let people know who could be in my shoes what not to do. I am going to ask her out.

2ui4xo,1,2015-02-02,Career advice.,Kiraar,InformationTechnology,https://www.reddit.com/r/InformationTechnology/comments/2ui4xo/career_advice/,"Hello.

(First let me apologize for my english, as it may be mistakes in my post.)

I am in the need of some career advice about work and or further education.

I am currently 19 years old working as an intern/apprentice at a city council. Which has rougly 500 clients/users, a wide aspect of users, all from totally incompetent users, who call 1-2 times a week to some people who solve their own problems and call maybe once every 6 months.

I have about 6 months left of my internship at which I will take my ""apprentice test"" if I pass I will have certificate of apprenticeship. 

This will be August 2015, I have 2 choices.

Get a job which is relevant for IT-Support (Which seems like a bitch to put it mildly in my city) or go back to school, study for a year, and eventually study at the university and get a bachelour of some kind. 

I would mostly like to continue working at my current job, but that is out of the question considering they are not allowed to hire interns due to it being state/goverment. 

Are there any tips and or guidelines on what to do if I'm applying or looking for work within IT-Support? I'm always early at work, I work late if needed, I love working with support and computers."
2ui5z7,55,2015-02-02,Is/was anyone else just mediocre?,fitman14,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ui5z7/iswas_anyone_else_just_mediocre/,"I was taking a look at resumes from students at Stanford, MIT, CMU, etc. and they just blow mine out of the water. They all pretty much had a better resume than me before they even graduated high school. I also took a look at the work they did in their internships in the big 4 and I feel like I would get completely behind if I worked there. 

Right now, I'm going to be graduating in a year from a mediocre university(ranked mid 30s in CS) with barely any projects even though I've been taking programming classes since 9th grade. I'm the epitome of that CS student that did the bare minimum to get by. I've started working on a Django website and it's been going really slowly and I feel like someone could do the work I am doing in an eighth of the time I am taking. 

A small part of this post was an attempt to get a pity pat on the back, but the main thing I was wondering is how much better/more efficient can someone get at programming over time? Was anyone else just mediocre and became really good?"
2uidfe,8,2015-02-02,Need advice for working with depression.,Rachelo11,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2uidfe/need_advice_for_working_with_depression/,"Hi, this is my first time posting here it's not exactly something I'd ever considered before but I could really do with some advice right  now. 

I was diagnosed with clinical depression and put on Citalopram just over 2 years ago since then I've seen counselors who didn't really help too much and tried quite a few things. I've had some ups and some downs. 

About 7 months ago I decided to take a year out of uni and started a year long internship in a new city although my uni decided to count it as a placement year as part of my degree. About 4 months into the job things started to feel bad again. I had a really tough time and for the last 2 months I've been working flexible hours, only going into the office 2 - 3 days a week and working from home the rest. 

I've been completely honest with my employers about my illness and how it affects me. 

At the beginning of December my new doctor changed my medication and the company I worked for offered to pay for me to see some private counselors. It took me a while to work up the courage to get in touch with them but I've finally started seeing a new counselor 2 weeks ago - I really like here and I feel like we're making some great progress and she could help me in the long term. 

However, this weekend I had a really bad down period, didn't sleep last night and woke up late for work this morning. I figured I'd ask my manager what I should do - I explained to him what happened, how I was stressing out and should I come into the office and work late or work from home? His response was that it was probably time I looked into leaving the job. 

He knows I don't want to do this because:
- I can't afford to not work - I'll have to leave my flat which will lose me my £1,000 deposit (which at 21 is almost all my savings), and I won't have anywhere to live because I can't go back to my family 
- It will mess up my uni course because this is supposed to be a placement year as part of my degree
- Having the job is at least giving me something to work towards getting better for

I'd say about 80% of my anxiety at the minute comes from the fear of losing my ob because of my illness and this is just making it worse. They always say the work I do is fantastic and that's not being affected, it only affects the times I can get in the office and sometime my relationship with the company's managing director because he scares me a lot. 

When they told me they thought I should consider leaving I told them I didn't want to and I said that I thought I was making real progress with my counselor and couldn't we just wait and see if I get better from that? The reply I got was: ""You had the option to see a counselor since November, so it's not like this has only just become available to you"" - which really upset me and it kind of misses the point of having a counselor in the first place. You actually need to see them to be able to work on making things better. 

So now I'm really scared and worried. I don't want to lose this job, I can't, it would ruin everything. But can they fire me if they don't want me any more? 

I'm really stressing here and I'm in an awful, awful place today because of all this. "

First of all, I would like to apologize for this ridiculously long post and for any mistakes that I will made in this text.

I don't know where to start. I've been thinking about this sub and whether to wrote to you about my mother or not whole last week and then, yesterday the girlfriend thing happened and now I just feel like I lost my life.

I was raised by my mother and grandmother, father was kicked out by mother when I was 3 months old due to obsessive drinking. We never were rich but we were never extra poor either. Then, when I was more or less 14y old we have to move out of our flat because mother was not paying rent. We moved to a lesser standard apartment in an 100y old flat ( many of them are still standing in europe) no hot water( but where is an electric water boiler), no central heating ( there is a masonry heater for coal). 

*** a word of reference, for those of you living in western countries these living conditions may be unacceptable but in my country some people are living in those conditions, and I'm not saying about total lowlife***

When I was maybe 10 mom started to have a drinking problem. As a child I didn't notice that then. We went to the grocery, she bought herself one, two or three beers and I would get a pack of chips with pokemon tazos inside. Sometimes she would fight with my grandmother but I wasn't paying attention. As time passed the fighting became more and more intense to the point that sometimes mom wanted to hit grandmother ( who was in her 80) and vice versa. I have started to see what is becoming of my mother. I wanted to reason with her, then I yelled at her, threaten her that I would break every bottle of beer that she will buy. Nothing worked. I even begged her to  stop drinking or smoking ( she is a smoker also, she started when she was 18 I think and have had a small break when she was pregnant with me).

I knew that we have had problems with rent by then, I've had intercepted written demands for payment from time to time. When I confronted her she was always telling that she will pay them. Maybe I didn't want to think about it because I was afraid of what would happen. About 5 years ago (maybe more) she sold the house with land on country that belonged earlier to Grandmother. It wasn't new, it wasn't pretty but it was something. Grandma always told me that it was supposed to be mine, that someday I will restore the house and my children and grandchildren will play there. I'm no real estate agent but for me it was worth at least 20-30k. She sold if for like 7k.

When Grandmother figured it out ( because mom didn't told us) things went hot. There were fights every day for month or more. I think when it all went silent Grandma just lost the will to live. She lived in that house nearly her entire life and now it was gone. To put things worse the house was bought by the family that we never had good relations with. She sometimes said that she want to die already etc. She passed away 3 years ago and then our financial situation gotten worse. I was on a second year of college ( out of three) working on my bachelor's degree. Mom was unemployed when Grandmother died but found a job as security worker with a disability group.

***a word of reference, there is a practice in my country when you have a disability group ( being acknowledged by the state that you have a disability, there are three of them 1st,2nd and 3rd) to employ such people as a ""security worker"". But the term is just for show, this is not a real security, more like caretaker or janitor. The company for employing people with disabilities gets subsidies from government (only for the 1st and the 2nd group)***

I thought that maybe something will change. Later that year I started a relationship with a girl that was in the same group in college. Things went good up to certain point ( more on this topic later) Started English tutoring. I even got to go on 3 month erasmus internship in Spain together with my new girlfriend. That was probably the high point in my life as i wasn't abroad earlier.

When I returned all the problems hit. As it turned out our rent debt was over 15k and the housing association was getting ready to throw us out. The car was sold ( Mom said that it has broken beyond repair but i don't believe her). There was no electricity. I cried the whole first night after our return. Spain was great, and now reality in my country was hitting me hard. The contrast was just too much to bear. I don't know what I would have done if not for my girlfriend. I immediately went to a currency exchange and payed 3k of debt. I talked with mom and we agreed that we will pay 500 monthly ( the first few months I could pay only 100 and she was supposed to pay 250, then when I would finish college and find work we would pay 250 each; the rent is 250 btw).

She didn't pay at all and I didn't have any significant money left. GF paid the rent for couple of months, 2k total. Then I finished college and found a shitty job at grocery for a minimal pay. After two months I went to an academy when I worked and learned how to operate CNC machines ( still minimal wage but I could work on weekend for extra pay). By then I was paying rent, electricity, TV and the internet, buying food, bought a car ( cheap and old but still).

About a year ago, after 3-4 months at the academy I've decided that this work is not for me. I've always wanted to work in an office and not on a production hall. I've started to look for some other job and since may I work in logistics department in production company in my home town.

The pay is good, I'm now earning more that at the academy plus all weekends. But somehow I don't feel it. The car broke down to the point of no repair in September. I've had to take money credit to buy a new one. And mom is no helping. I don't know if a bailiff is taking her pay for some other debts that i don't know of but now she's bringing home less that 50% of the pay. Basically she has money only at the beginning of the month. Then she buys a bit of food, some chemicals and that’s it. The rest goes to beer and cigarettes. And by the end of the month she is trying to borrow money from me because she does not have any cigarettes left. 

A week ago I turned 25. I am a 25 healthy young man who can't find happiness in his life. Nothing that I do makes me happy. I'm constantly thinking about money and counting my expenses to be able to save some money. I'm trying for 3-4 years to save for a new PC and can't do it. I'm frustrated to the point that a stupid whole in my pants makes me go through the roof because I will have to buy new ones that a didn't planned in my expense plan. I feel that I'm losing my girlfriend because of the person that I'm becoming.

I wasn't always like that though sometimes I find it hard to believe. GF said that last year was the one that changed me. We have a conversation about this in November. I've been thinking about it a lot and I can see two ways that lay before me.

I can move out, start living with my GF or find some roommates. I think that the best way will be to completely move out of town, seek a new job somewhere else. Start anew. Maybe this will be like a cold shower for my mom. Maybe not. I fear that by moving out I will sentence my own Mother to a life in poverty. I fear that her problem with alcohol will become even greater but on other side I don't want to be her private ATM because that's how I'm feeling now.

I can stay with her, most probably dooming my relationship ( if there is still one). Become even more bitter but maybe preventing her from dying of alcohol or hunger. She is my mother after all and I don’t want to see her suffer.


I don't know what to do. Like I said I'm frustrated, stressed, bitter and nearly all I think about is money and how it is the solution for all my problems. I don't want to be like that. I want to be funny, caring and intelligent guy that my girlfriend fell in love with.

Some economical data for context ( all netto values)
Minimal wage 1200 let’s say credits
Average wage in my country 3000
My current wage 1900


That was the thing that I've been struggling with, whether or not write to you guys. But yesterday, yesterday all hell broke loose.

GF texted If I would come to her to help her study ( she had an exam later that day on college, two years ago I've talked her into doing a master degree in finance; she has bachelor degree in English studies just as I) I comply and go to her. When I'm with her she started to cry, she said that she hurt me and I couldn't believe what I'm seeing/hearing. She finally told that there was this guy at work, they were going to and from work together and the company was sending him off to work in another city. She said that when on Friday he drove her off he tried to kiss her and she didn't allow him. Then on Saturday he wanted to meet to explain himself. Earlier that day we went to a bar to celebrate my birthday (which were 4 days prior) with some mutual friends from college. We gone home quite early because she was to be studying. But she met him and according to her he started saying how terrible his marriage is ( yea, he has a wife, no kids as far as I know). I don't know what she said to him, probably something similar as we have had our own problems ( me being bitter, not enjoying my life and as a result not caring about her the way I should). Then she said that they kissed. 

She was crying, she said that something changed when she realized the he was going away. She said that she loves me but doesn't know if she want to be with me in a state that I am now. We met one more time in a car when she returned from the exam. We talked about it, I've tried to get more details and context of that kiss but couldn’t get anything out of her. She told me that she already talked about that with her friend and she told her to think about all this. The worst thing is that I don't want to talk with any of our mutual friends about this because I don't want anybody to be thinking of her as ""bitch"" or ""cunt"" and I know that most people will think something along these lines.

I don't know what to think. The good thing is that she told me herself on the next day that something like that happened, but it doesn't ease in the pain. My trust is broken, my heart is broken, I am broken. I think that I want to forgive her and that sometimes makes me hate myself. 
I really thought about her in terms of marriage and kids and all of that. She was my light in a tunnel that is my life. Now I don't know a shit, I'm sitting in work writting all this and nearly crying.

She said that even though she's not justifying herself the state of our relationship played big part in this. I think that this is bullshit. If she was unhappy she should have worked with me to improve things or just leave, not run to some married guy who was near. Of course I was not an ideal BF but I love her with all I've got.

I am/was her first boyfriend. First kiss, first sex, first everything.
That guy is now out of the horizon, he is 300km away from our home town.
I think she got emotionally attached to that guy.

&gt; He didn’t know what his father did in the war

&gt; More than a million people visit the Auschwitz Museum each year. Many of them search for information about family members who lost their lives in the camp. It is highly unusual, however, for a son to recognize his father in one of the photographs—when the father is wearing an SS uniform.

&gt; The story began in the spring of 2007. A group of visitors arrived from Germany. After touring the main exhibition, they joined an educational workshop at the Roma and Hungarian exhibitions. After the summing up remarks, one of the participants came up to Jacek Lech of the International Center for Education about Auschwitz and the Holocaust.

&gt; “He was an older man, about 65 or 70. He told me that he recognized his father in one of the pictures in Block no. 4,” Lech recalls. “I asked him if he was sure that it was Block no. 4, because visitors usually recognize relatives in the pictures of prisoners, which hang in blocks no. 6 and 7. He confirmed that it was Block no. 4, and said that he would give me more precise information the next time he came back to the Museum.”

&gt; In late July, the man returned to the Museum. This time, he had a family album with him. He asked if he could go to Block no. 4, where one of the rooms contains photographs from Lili Jacob’s famous album depicting the procedures used with an arriving transport of Jews. “We stood in front of one of the pictures showing an SS physician on the ramp selecting new arrivals for death in the gas chambers,” recalls Lech. “The German visitor pointed to a young man wearing an SS uniform, standing to the left of the physician, and said, ‘That young man in the SS uniform is my father.’ He laid the album on the window sill and showed me four photos from the album.”

&gt; One showed a man in an SS uniform during drills, the second showed him with his unit, the third showed him in an SS dress uniform, and the fourth, taken after the war, showed the same man, in civilian clothing, with his family. It was undoubtedly the same man as in the 1944 photograph from Birkenau. Lech recalls that the visitor seemed shocked. “He hadn’t known anything about [his father’s] wartime past.”

&gt; We know little about the SS man. He was born near Potsdam in 1906. After passing final school exams, he worked as an apprentice to a carpet dealer. Later, he became a deacon with the Knights of Malta, got married in 1937, and settled in Berlin with his wife.

&gt; “The son knew almost nothing about his father’s wartime fate,” says Lech. “He was born in 1942, and said only that his father was held by the British until 1947, and became a pastor a year later. He died in 1988. His widow told her son that his father had served an internship as an orderly in a mental institution in Berlin in 1937, and might have been at one of the Nazi euthanasia centers in 1941.”

&gt; The staff of the death camps in occupied Poland were recruited from the euthanasia centers organized under Aktion T4. The man in question might therefore have ended up in Auschwitz, leaving his wife and newborn son behind in Berlin.

&gt; No information about this particular SS man has been found in the personnel records in the Archives of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. However, this does not mean that the individual in question did not serve in Auschwitz, since the Germans destroyed an enormous number of documents before liberation. Lech says that the son recalled “finding transfer orders to Auschwitz dated 1942 at home, along with a receipt from the camp storehouse for a pair of suspenders and other SS uniform accessories.”

The son knows that there are some records there, but German law prevents him from obtaining them while his mother is still alive. During his last visit, the man said he would contact the Museum as soon as he receives any new information. Perhaps we will then learn the solution to this puzzle."

I’ve finally decided share them and will do so over the next few weeks.  First story?  The bluescreen of minor inconvenience.

Back when Microsoft announced they were dropping support of XP the hospital panicked and we began upgrading everything to windows 7.  During this time I received a ticket that read:
“I have a bluescreen.  Can you please have a tech come look at it?  Thank you.”
I made my way to her room, introduced myself.  She greeted me politely and showed me her computer.  I didn’t see a bluescreen so I asked her what the issue was.  She pointed to her background and said “There!   See?”

“But that isn’t a bluescreen that’s a…Oh”

When we made the jump from xp to 7 we disabled background settings so the users have our light blue hospital colors as their background no matter what.  It wasn’t a “Bluescreen”  it was a “blue screen”.  She wanted to know how to change her background, which I told her she could no longer do.  She expressed her sadness to this change, but thanked me for coming so quickly and bid me fair well.

2uizbz,15,2015-02-02,[Career] Hopefully some helpful advice from personal experience (O&amp;G Related),[deleted],geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/2uizbz/career_hopefully_some_helpful_advice_from/,"Firstly I want to start by saying I am a grad with a BSc in Petroleum Geology from the UK, currently working on an internship in a commercial role within the O&amp;G sector- I am due to start my MSc in Petroleum Geoscience and managed to secure funding for it so all this is from personal experience. I am not an expert but thought of long time sharing some -hopefully- useful tips I picked up along the way.  I don't want to sound rude as **I've been there myself** but I see a few headless chickens on here, and I don't blame you.

**1)Keep up with the market/industry**

This particular 'tip' is especially relavant now due to slump in prices and the uncertainty. I don't mean you have to all go out and become analysts, but after all you're in the industry because you are interested in it, so it wouldn't hurt to read a few insight articles from reputable sources. A recent interview I had, the first question asked was ""Do you know the price of Brent crude today""...so take these things into consideration. 

A few good places to start that I like are:

http://oilprice.com/

http://www.rigzone.com/

**2) Understand the Industry you're going into!**

This should actually be number 1, but anyway, by this point I mean understand the oil and gas value chain. Know what upstream, mid and downstream means and what it entails. This then makes the company research step of any job application easier, as you then have to see where your company fits into this value chain. 

A good place to start is this interactive display by Total:

http://www.total.com/en/The-Oil-and-Gas-Value-Chain

**If you combine points 1 and 2 you already are a step ahead in the applications as you have a firm basis for your research. I feel that undergrads, grads and all job searchers alike spend too much time researching for things they should already KNOW. The only thing that you should be researching is new news related to that company that may pop-up in interviews**

**3) Know what your industry goals are**

This doesn't mean you need to know the field you want to go into. The great thing about the O&amp;G industry is it is so diverse- both technically and socially. BUT it helps to know what motivated you and what aspect or sub-discipline you can see yourself in. Are you a reservoir engineer? a Topsides facilities manager? a Flow Assurance Specialist? a Production Geologist? Knowing what these roles even means would show the interviewer or even in your application that you have thought about your future. I know this is hard as sometimes you just want in, but companies aren't going to want someone who is just there for the money, they want real investment, so someone who cares about their future is what they will go for. 

- Some questions that usually pop-up in interviews or applications related to this:
  - Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
  - Where do you see yourself fitting in to our organisation?

**4) Education**

This ties in to all of the above. Some people, like myself are too reliant on the university to feed us directional information, by which I mean, content that is related directly to the oil and gas industry. Now I learnt by my 2nd year, this isn't going to happen. I understood that to be a good Petroleum Geologist, I needed to take the initiative and find the links myself. This isn't difficult when it comes to geology and the beauty of being a geologist in the O&amp;G industry is that you get the chance to work on almost all geological disciplines. 

An example, in my sedimentology class we were going over glacial sedimentology, specifically trough mouth fan deposits. As a petroleum geologist, my main focus was on how good these deposits are in terms of reservoir quality- to do this I used the class to understand the process and asked the professor after of my questions. The next step was I got him to send me some papers. I did this in all of my classes where it wasn't directly aimed at O&amp;G. This will build your knowledge- *people tend to focus too much on their CV* and forget to actually learn and get good grades. Most of my achievements, in fact all of them were merit based on my education and what I achieved in that. Now I'm no genius, but if you put your head down and show enthusiasm, you will be rewarded. 

**5) Work Experience**

Now moving onto work experience. Almost every company you apply to will want 2 things: good grades and some industry experience. The latter is not necessarily important if you have other experiences. By this I mean ""work experience"" in technical jobs doesn't just have to be in professional environments, but of course it helps. 

A good example of what I'm trying to say is as follows:

Student A and student B apply for a Geoscientist position at Nasa to go to Mars and to map the whole planet. A has worked for BP and Chevron whilst maintaining a 65% overall average in his degree. B on the other hand is a first class student with a 85% average and 3 research experiences working within the departmental research groups, she also has a few other part time roles from which she displays transferable skills.

Now you'd probably think that A would fair better off than B due to the work experience BUT B would be equally competitive with her education and research background. 

Hopefully my point makes sense- basically don't be discouraged by lack of direct work experience. See the below article for reference:

http://www.rigzone.com/news/oil_gas/a/136909/Top_Tips_Applying_for_Your_First_Graduate_Job_in_European_Oil_Gas

**6) Networking**

This is the bit which I would say a lot of young people are very poor at. It's a hard sell in my opinion. I'm a confident guy when I know my stuff, and in a professional environment more so. HOWEVER I suck at general conversation, in these situations, I am the least confident. What I recommend however is getting over this fear. It's hard to make cold approaches which is why it's good to stick to small talk and then make the bigger approaches. An example would be that if you're meeting someone after you've seen their presentation or you know a little background, I'd make an approach from that. If not, the usual icebreakers as suggested in the below weblink would suffice.

https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20130526234123-15077789-6-secrets-to-better-networking-at-conferences

I want to reiterate that I sucked at this, but at a recent event where I wanted to come across strong and having the chance to have lunch with the people who will interview you and have seen your presentations is not worth losing, I sucked it up and just went in with a smile, said hi and stuck out a hand for a handshake. Not long after I was conversing for 10 mins with a very pleasant lady from a big company. Get out of your comfort zone and you'll be suprised how far you'll get. 

**Another important networking tip** is that it doesn't all have to be in person. Linkedin is a god send. But you also have to take note of **a very important point which is that when you approach people, don't always look for jobs**. I have spoken to so many people who have given me great career advice which is very valuable. Also people like to talk about themselves, so don't just say ""Hi, my name is such and such, can I have a job please""...go with ""Hi I would love to hear more about your career, some advice on career paths"" etc. 

**7) CV**

This one is short and simple. I have family all over the world so I know how different formats vary so please PLEASE make sure you know the who/what/where etc of the place you are applying to and make sure the format is applicable. Do your research people! 

Oh yeah- tailor the CV/Resume to the job. It's good to show you have many talents but less clutter and more need-to-know would be nice!

**For now that's what I have. I'll leave you with some interview questions which may or may not be useful. Like I said above, I'm starting out so take all the above with a pinch of salt and if any industry guys has anything to add or change/correct me on, please feel free. I am still young and low down on the career ladder so any advice is always going to help!**

2uj38c,2,2015-02-02,Looking for advice,[deleted],leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/2uj38c/looking_for_advice/,"Hey everyone,

I'm having a hard time getting sober. The past few months have been attempt after attempt to quit, but nothing seems to work. I tell my stoner friends I'm taking an extended break, and they are all supportive, but I still find ways to get high anyway. I already exercise daily, I eat as healthy as a dude with numerous food allergies on a meal plan can, and I have hobbies, but I would rather do them high.

My biggest problem is Spice, which I have quit once before. I was almost 4 years sober and then I went and messed up. Now I feel like I'm struggling to keep my head above water. It's not to the point where it was when I used before, I'm not high every waking moment, but it is daily. The last time I quit I locked myself in my apartment until the intense cravings stopped (1-2 weeks), but that's not a viable option now that I have classes, internships, and other responsibilities. I have a problem with weed too, but it doesn't have the intense physical symptoms of Spice.

I don't know where to turn. I'm 23, and still in school (behind because of substance abuse), but I don't have the type of relationship with my parents where talking to them or asking them for help would be an option. If anything, it would make things worse. I'm a pre-seminary student and I'm afraid of getting thrown out of my program, so I've been hesitant to talk with it to pretty much anyone. I was telling myself I can get help after I graduate, but I can't do another year of this, I hate it. I also don't want to go into seminary an addict, I'll feel like an impostor. I already do.

I'm really at a loss here, I would love any suggestions. Some days I find myself thinking I would rather be dead than in this cycle again. I don't want to lose any more years to this shit.

TL;DR: Have a problem with Spice and weed, can't seem to kick either. Feeling lost and defeated."

2ujgm9,1,2015-02-02,Should I try to obtain a co-op or should I be fine with 2 summer internships?,[deleted],ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/2ujgm9/should_i_try_to_obtain_a_coop_or_should_i_be_fine/,"I am currently a sophomore in chemical engineering. I know experience is a must out of a college, but I’m not sure just how much experience. 

Like many other engineering freshmen, I wasn’t able to obtain a summer internship during the summer after my freshman year. I recently accepted a process engineering internship offer for the summer after sophomore year, and I plan to do another after my junior year. 

The co-op program at my school is different in the sense that you must work for the same company for all 12 months of work (2 semesters and 1 summer). You cannot change companies for each rotation, and 2 work terms must be during school semesters. 

If I did a co-op, it would be impossible for me to graduate any sooner than 5 years at my school for multiple reasons, including the lack of chemE summer courses offered and the sequence of prerequisites to graduate. I am also worried that postponing my graduation by a year will conflict with a scholarship I have that expires after 4 years of college. However, since I am ahead in terms of general education classes, I would end up having 2 summers to do internships in addition to the co-op. 

Are 2 summer internship experiences solid when applying for entry level positions after graduation, or should I try to obtain a co-op position? Thank you for any advice that you may have. "

I would appreciate additional interpretation and feedback on my own!,porkbarbie,tarot,https://www.reddit.com/r/tarot/comments/2ujs1x/did_a_self_life_reading_by_the_horoscope_method/,"Some background about myself: 23 yr old female, currently in a long term relationship, just graduated college and looking to begin my career. Birthday May 20th.

Here is the spread: http://i.imgur.com/xGLFpD9.jpg

I chose the queen on wands to represent myself, the seeker, as advised by ""Mastering the Tarot"" for a woman of blonde hair and blue eyes. I have a hard time thinking of myself as a woman as opposed to a girl, but at this stage in life it makes sense that that is what I am.

Reading:

House 1, Aries (Personality, outlook, appearance.) : The lover, reversed. I took this as my outlook being afraid of making the wrong choice, being over emotional. Makes sense because of recent, I have been more insecure than ever in my life, and am having trouble restoring it.

House 2, Taurus (financial, material possessions.) : The sun. I will have achievement in the sciences (I graduated with a degree in chemical engineering). Simply put, I will have a comfortable life and will be successful in my field.

House 3, Gemini (Communication, brothers, sisters) : Eight of cups, reversed. This seems to mean my brothers and myself seek to find happiness, for this is how we determine success. 

House 4, Cancer (Early home, father) : Four of pentacles. This is definitely my father. Love of power, money, ungenerous. 

House 5, Leo (Children, love affairs, adventure) : The empress. I took this as I will be able to have children, whom will have a stable life. Need more help on this, I'm not currently trying to have children. Maybe this pertains to adventure or love more. Perhaps it means I will marry my partner who I'm currently with, and it will be a stable, balanced marriage.

House 6, Virgo (Health, work) : Judgement. I took this to mean better health and a career are on its way due to my judgement in actions.

House 7, Libra (Marriage, Partnership, enemies) : The fool, reversed. This means folly and indiscretion, fear holding back from new opportunities, choices made are faulty and thoughtless action. I need help here. I took it with two possibilities. One: I will let my fears of being with my current partner hold me back from the opportunity of being with him, and the decision will be a folly. Again, this leads back to house one, where my outlook on life is clouded by fear of the wrong choice. Two: being with him will be the result of thoughtlessness. I'm more keen to option one due to what shows up in house 8.

House 8, Scorpio (Legacies, money, death) : Five of pentacles. I see this as my partner and I ultimately not finding common ground, resulting in despair and poor health for myself. However, this card is a warning; if I do not find strength again from spirituality, this will lead to my fears and insecurities being my ultimate undoing. 

House 9, Sagittarius (philosophy, long journeys, dreams) : eight of pentacles, reversed. I hone my skills on less important things, such as fitness and outward appearance, which will make my journey to finding a career harder. I must find more ambition and work harder towards my career goals.

House 10, Capricorn (profession, ambition, honors, mother) : King of swords, reversed. I took this as unfair judgement from those in authority, such as hiring managers and older engineers. I have already experienced this in a past internship, where I had trouble being taken seriously as a young female entering the corporate world, which is dominated by older men.

House 11, Aquarius (friends, associates, hopes) : The high priestess, reversed. This one hurt a little, as I took it to mean I am selfish when it comes to friends. I often have trouble staying in touch with people. This could be connected to insecurities, and also a good reason to find strength in spirituality.

House 12, Pisces (Secret enemies, Karma, self undoing) : The page of wands. My tendency to be quick with emotion, anger or love, and lack of courage in certain aspects hold me back. I must find balance within myself if I am to overcome these things."

I'm making this post to hopefully get some help from the upperclassman or graduates that have gone through this situation and might have some stories or tips on how to make the most of it.

This week I have an interview with a Federal Bankruptcy Court judge/clerk and I really don't know what to expect (will I be speaking to the judge, the clerk, or both).  Also, in your experiences, what role does the interview process play?  Do I essentially have the internship already now that they've seen my grades and writing sample and I simply have to just not completely blow it, or is it still up in the air depending on if I really impress them in the interview?  Lastly, I have interest in getting into corporate bankruptcy because I've heard positive things and anecdotal evidence from others but when I'm inevitably asked why I'm interested in bankruptcy law I'm really not sure that I know what to say.

If any of you guys can help me out with all or some of these questions I'd really appreciate it.  Thanks for your help."

I'm not simply playing a numbers game where I shoot resumes here and there, but I actually apply to jobs that I want and write targeted cover letters and edit my resume accordingly.

However, I have no guarantee that any of those applications will result in interviews/offers: I am fairly unconfident, especially since I have not had any professional experience before (only worked in retail previously). While my grades are pretty decent (cgpa 3.5+), I've done cool projects in some courses, and participated in some competitions (and winning one of them), I'm not too sure how far those could possibly carry me.

On the other hand, some of my professors are doing really interesting work and I have done extremely well in their classes (and I'm in their good books). The only issue is that I would rather get an internship instead of summer research and the second big issue is that if a professor does accept to work with me, that would finalize the application. The deadline for NSERC is quite soon (February 25th?), meaning I would have to go through the professors in the next week or so. 

I am fairly confident I could score a research position but ideally, I would have an internship. The conflict is whether to apply for the research position (and thus forgo the chance for an internship) or to forget about research and hope for an internship.

Any help would be much appreciated! Thank you!"

Hey, so this is only the second time I post something on Reddit, so I hope I did everything correctly.

Recently I have been experiencing disturbing visual hallucinations, which all happened in my peripheral vision. 
I know most of the time this kind of phenomenon is just the brain misunderstanding informations in this area of the eye, and it is usually only a misperception at the end, but it wasn't these times. There was nothing looking similar to what I saw. 
There was no shape looking like it or not even colors.

The first one occured when I was around 9 years old, and it was at the time an isolated event, so I didn't think much of it until now.
I was in my bathroom, and when I walked back to the door I saw a lady in my bath tub. She had short hair, with her hands and legs tied up and she was entirely in black and white just like in old movies.

A few years later, when I was around maybe 14 I saw her again in my step father's bath tub.

Last year, when living in an another appartment I remember sometimes feeling like a man was whispering in my ear. Sometimes I would hear noises downstairs even though there was nothing/no one there and the thing I remember the most was when going downstairs I clearly heard a circus-like music, I had never heard before.
My brother and I also heard a woman scream, and it felt like it was coming from where we lived, yet no one apart from us heard it.

The strangest things that happened to me occured in the place I live now, which is my step father's place.
When going to the toilet at night I saw a shadow-like kid running from my kitchen to my living room, it freaked the hell out of me.

When going to an internship, last month, I saw a lady with wavy blond hair and a blue top crawling on the floor, however when I turned my heard the only thing there was a big gray trash can..

I know it might have a logic explanation, and I would like to have your opinions on the subject before trying to tell my mom and my doctor about it
.
I am really scared ( the supernatural being my greatest hobby yet my biggest phobia ) so please, take care of the way you will explain it to me, I freak out easily.

What is the difference of value between experience in industry and academia? (For instance, difference between a big-4 tech company  vs a university or non-profit research institution)

2.) How valuable/rare are mentors?

3.) What do I lose by staying in academia / What doors are opened by having industry experience?

I'm currently a jr. linux sysadmin with about 2-3 years experience, and have only coded for college cs and internships, so I'm a fairly weak dev.

I have a choice between an academic institution where I could grow more into more of a full-fledged sysadmin role with a mentor, and an industry position with a an established and rapidly growing startup, where I'd be working more on development in Flask, R, and mysql. The industry role is a much more hands-off role in an environment, and unfortunately it is pretty badly siloed (IT there is tiered and doesn't mesh well between their own departments, let alone an unexperienced dev in an entirely different sector of the company.)

I am currently interested with security and IoT, so a role that lets me work with SaltStack and keeps me up to date with current security practices is personally more appealing, but I want to make an informed decision of what I'd be missing."

-----

With summer coming around the corner I am still completely lost on how to find internships/summer jobs related to my degree (Software Engineering at BCIT. First year).

I have signed up for a career fair, a job seminar, and I did apply to one business (even though they made it very clear that they wanted 2nd year and on wards), but I am having trouble finding a place to do internships overall.

Vancouverites (or people in general), where does a student go to try and find a job for the summer? Is there some bundle of information out there that I don't know about?

**Additional Information:**

* I live in Vancouver but my parents live on Vancouver Island, so really I could work in either location for work.

* I am a 82% average student.

* I have past experience outside of school with the languages Java and Lua. I have experience using the API/Engines Corona SDK, UDK and GM Studio.

* From school I have gained further knowledge in Java, C, JavaScript, PHP, HTML and SQL. However, if I am to be completely honest, the only one I think I know enough about to make a contribution with at this point would be in Java."
2ukjzz,2,2015-02-02,Learning algorithms through pseudocode vs a specific language (Which algorithm book to buy?),canadiandev25,compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/2ukjzz/learning_algorithms_through_pseudocode_vs_a/,"Hey everyone, first year comp sci student here.

I want to study up on algorithms and data structures just for general knowledge, and to make internship interviews easier.

Keep in mind that I will be doing a data structure and algorithm course in about a year or two (2nd year if not 3rd). I thought I get a head start on learning some of them.

I am debating between the books Algorithms (4th ed.) by Robert Sedgewick and Introduction to Algorithms (3rd ed.) by C.L.R.S

I am considering the book by Sedgewick since it is written in Java and if there ever is a time where I must implement an algorithm, my go to language would be Java. So it would be nice to see things implemented in Java.

However, The introduction to Algorithms book seems to have a lot more detail, and is written in pseudocode, which pretty much means it can get applied to any language. Not that Sedgewick's Algorithm book won't allow that.

I need to advice as to which book to buy. I looked at the algorithm course website for my school, and it seems like they use the book Introduction to Algorithms. So if I buy Algorithms by Sedgewick, I might need to buy the other one as well.

**TL;DR** Algorithms (4th ed.) by Robert Sedgewick or Introduction to Algorithms (3rd ed.) by C.L.R.S.


Edit: I think I should state that I already know the basics of  a lot of what is presented in the book. Such as how different sorting and searching algorthims work and basics of time and space complexity (Big O). How hashmaps, hashsets, trees, linkedlists, stacks and how queues work.  I don't know how to prove any of them though (ex. I understand the merge sort algorithm, but I don't know the reasoning behind why the average case is O(nlogn). I don't know them in depth, but I did learn the basics back in highschool. "
2ukmh0,8,2015-02-02,Give (visual) journalism another shot or go into psychology/social science?,stonehallow,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/2ukmh0/give_visual_journalism_another_shot_or_go_into/,"I'm turning 27 this year. Graduated from college in at 25 (that seems old because males do 2 years of conscription in my country) with a Communications major, where I did most of my courses in journalism and filmmaking. 

Halfway through college I realised I hated the media industry (PR, advertising, even some aspects of journalism) but after doing an internship I thought photojournalism would be as close to a dream career for me as possible. I'd never be a text reporter but I enjoyed the on-the-go lifestyle of being a newspaper photographer. I worked as a photojournalist for 6 months on a contract after graduation, but restructuring made my position redundant and I was gone after my contract period. 

I had a lot of trouble finding another job - I found I did not have the necessary qualifications for jobs that interested me...these positions tended to require social science degrees like psychology, and so eventually settled for a desk picture editor job at a news agency. It was hell - totally desk bound and a toxic working environment...and so I've just resigned. 

I was planning to go to grad school for psychology to do 1 year 'conversion' course (uk system). I evaluated my personality and interests and I figured psychology is a good fit for me. Besides it simply being a damn fun job, I enjoyed the 'human' aspect of being a photojournalist...connecting with people on a deeper level than say, PR. And I always felt 'helpless' being a journalist and unable to directly help my subjects. I also enjoyed the psychology courses I took at college...and would've majored in psych if I didn't get into media/journalism school. My girlfriend also works as a psychologist and very often I find myself envying what she does at her job.

But I got a call recently from an ex-colleague from my photo days. He's now an editor at another local paper and he's invited me to apply for a 'visual content producer' position. It's as close to news photography as I can get, but I'm not sure I'd be cool with dumping my eggs in the news media basket, especially with things all going online and the 24 hour news cycle. My gut says I wouldn't be comfortable with that kind of working style eg. speed over quality..and I'd have to do 'multimedia' (new-fangled term for using audio and videos together with still images) because it's the next big thing in journalism. I have the basic skills for that but I'm honestly not a huge fan of the medium.

And if I leave the job I don't know what else I could do, with visual journalism being pretty niche. I wouldn't be able to waltz into a 'normal' office job if I ever get married and have kids, and want 'normal' work hours.

Still, going back to the newsroom would give me the chance to escape a desk bound life, and I do enjoy being in the thick of the news. I know some of the guys in the department and they're cool dudes, so the working environment would be good. 

If I go back to school, I'd be pretty old when I finish my 1 year conversion course...and I'd probably have to do 1-2 years more of school to get in-depth psychology training in clinical/educational/industrial psych. And psychology graduates are being churned out by the boatload so getting a job isn't a lock either. 

I feel like going back to the newsroom would be the 'safe' choice...I probably won't hate it and I might even grow to enjoy the multimedia stuff...since at heart it's dealing with visual storytelling, which I'm passionate about. Trying to get into psychology is the YOLO option, and I'd be almost 30 or older by the time I start to look for work, so the practical aspect scares me a little. I'm also a little wary that I'm 'idealising' psychology. In some ways it's also about choosing 'fun' in the newsroom, with high adrenaline breaking news, going to cool events, etc. versus further self-development and intellectual pursuit (I always regretted that my college education was too 'technical'/vocational in nature with the journalism and filmmaking stuff).

Sorry for the novel...any opinions?"

A few months ago (late October) while I was doing an internship I got involved with a coworker. He told me he liked me, and the rest is history. We both agreed we didn't want anything serious- I knew I'd be leaving in January and I'd never had a boyfriend before, he had just recently broken up with his long-term 'girlfriend', and he also hooks up with multiple girls (mainly from work) at the same time. I agreed to the arrangement because I just wanted to have fun, but made it clear from the start that I would be different- I didn't want to be treated like ""just another girl,"" I'd call him out on his bullshit, and I didn't do casual sex but everything else was an option. He agreed to my terms, and that's where it started.

Basically, we were the epitome of that ""couple"" who when it was good, it was FRICKING GREAT, but when it was bad, WATCH OUT. Normally, we'd get into a random argument or he'd say something stupid to offend me, I'd get upset, he'd call and sweet talk me, I'd need a day to cool off, he'd ignore me, I'd send him sexy Snapchats and dirty texts to get his attention because I don't like being ignored, we'd talk it out again and he'd say all the right things, and I'd forgive him and take him back. This happened a few times, but when it was good it was just so good I couldn't help it. I'd make excuses for him, I'd defend him when people would talk about him at work (we kept it a secret for the most part), and we'd just repeat the process. One time he did go out of his way to drive back to work and see me and talk it out for like 2 hours after a particularly nasty fight, which basically ended with me begging him to agree to keep hooking up with me until I left a couple of weeks later. After that it was great once again. 

Basically, I ended up falling in love with him. We were pretty much best friends- at least I thought we were. I told him everything, including a really big secret that I'd never told anyone else. He was my first everything. He was so good at making me feel ""different"" and special most of the time and he always talked about how amazing I am and the way he looked at me and the things we did- it was amazing when he wanted it to be. I even ended up giving him my virginity (which was a big deal for me) right before I left because we decided that we'd be friends no matter what and that we'd always be in each other's lives. He talked about coming to see me at school and places he'd take me, he talked about how he wanted to stop hooking up with girls from work, and I really thought he was starting to change.

I got back to school and at first it was fine. We had one tiny little bump but it was worked out quickly. Then, one night we got into a text disagreement about dirty texts/Skype sex that I thought was a joke, he took it too far and got offended, and he said we just shouldn't talk on technology anymore. I thought he'd had a bad day and figured I'd give him time to cool off. He sent me on Snapchat, I replied, no response. I didn't want to be the one to give in anymore because I wanted him to miss me, not my body, so I waited. A couple days later he sent me a Snapchat but I couldn't answer because I had class, I check later and see he had defriended me on everything. I open the Snapchat, it was actually a really sweet song. That night, I found out through some other old coworkers that a girl he used to hook up with (who he knows I'm not a huge fan of) had visited and they spent a lot of time together. I was devastated, because he knows that I wanted to know when he was with another girl in case I called him- I didn't want to look needy or intrude on their time because I know how I'd feel if it happened to me. And he didn't tell me. So I was a wreck and talked to this girl who had reached out to me, and I found out that this girl he hooked up with also called my coworker at 2am to tell her that I'm a manstealing slut/whore/bitch and she hates me. She also told me that I had to be careful because he's a player and this is just what he does, and it wasn't real. I was extremely upset and then I got mad, and ended up having to have a friend come over and keep me company because I was having anxiety attacks.

The next day, he finally texts me and says he heard my friends from work were ""out for blood"" and that I had randomly called a girl from work crying and complaining about him. I told him I didn't complain about him and that I had spoken to the girl (after I made sure she was okay with him knowing we had talked) and I thought we should be adults about it and talk and not let what people say about us impact our opinion's of each other. He didn't seem to be too into it, but he agreed. He called me that night and things did not go well. The second he realized I wasn't going to cry and apologize for things I didn't do, he got nasty. He made it sound like we were never friends, he asked me if I really never thought there were other girls (which is silly, of course I did), he asked me if I ever really thought that I was different, and he called me a liar repeatedly. He talked over me and cut me off, and when I finally got a chance to speak and said I wanted to have my questions answered he said no, I said ""F--- you,"" and he hung up on me. We haven't spoken since.

I'm a wreck. I cry all the time. I'm so angry. I want to slap him, I want to scream, I want to tell him how horrible he is. But I can't. I don't want him to know that I've been thinking about him. Everyone tells me I have to just let it go and move on but I can't. I need closure. I want revenge. I'm mad because I know he's probably moved on with a bunch of other girls and not thinking about me, meanwhile I'm lonely and sexually frustrated and furious with him for treating me like that and for myself for believing him and allowing him to treat me that way. I know parts of it were real- no matter how good of a player he is there were things he couldn't have faked. I just don't know how much he really liked me. I never wanted to change him but I respected that he wanted to change himself, I didn't expect him to marry me, I just thought we'd always be friends (who occasionally had really good sex). But now I don't know where we stand. I want him to remember me, I want him to know he screwed with the wrong girl, but I still love him. I don't want him to win. I had to come home from school for the weekend because I was crying so much and it was breaking my mom's heart- and she doesn't even know I had sex with him, then she'd really flip. I feel like he has so much power over me from so far away, and I can't have any power over him when I'm not with him and tempting him. I don't know what to do. I want to tell him exactly how I feel and how mad I am and how hurt and betrayed I feel, but I don't want him to know how much time I've spent thinking about him. My mom says the best revenge is living well, but I don't think he cares about me at all anymore. My therapist said he's a 13-year old and I shouldn't talk to him. I know he isn't worth it and I deserve better (he's a selfish, egotistical narcissist), I deserve someone who will fight for me for once, and he's even said that- but I cannot accept that it's over and not on my terms. Please help me. Should I call him? Should I wait until my Spring Break when I can maybe try to go see him? Should I ignore him like he ignores me and try to move on? I just need closure. I need to tell him. I just don't know.

Thank you.

TLDR: Not really in a relationship (about 4 months) but I loved him, ended on a really bad note, and I need closure so I can move on but I don't know how. "

The Krrt'arrn ship sliced through the atmosphere on the Skk'rll home planet, quickly coming to a hover and settling down on a sandy beach on one of the many small tropical islands that were the only land on this planet. Scoutmaster Svigg'ntt paced along the beach, checking the datapad on his purple, furred tentacle to see how the intern was doing. The prognosis was not good; no matter the species, one does not survive partial collapse of the cranial cavity.

The sounds of splashing redirected the Scoutmaster's attention to the waterline, where his contact, Commander Cicc'rnd, emerged from the waves. He seemed like an enormous slimy blob, 1.5x the height of Svigg'ntt, amorphous and such a dark purple he looked almost black, even in the bright sunlight and far-too-hot air of his home planet. 

Neither of them liked being here. Svigg'ntt was too densely furred for this heat and the Skk'rlls lived in the briny oceans and could not risk drying out.

This was why Earth was perfect for both their colonization efforts.

&lt;*One of my crew was severely injured in our attempts to do your dirty work,*&gt; Svigg'ntt began. He tapped the datapad until a blue hologram began projecting, showing a kitchen. &lt;*As you can see, they eat with their food arranged, almost ritualistically. They even use inanimate objects to prepare and display their food before consumption.*&gt; Neither could hide their disgust at the backwards natives' propensity of using dishes. The horror. &lt;*Furthermore,*&gt; Svigg'ntt continued, zooming in on the sink, &lt;*they are inefficient at consuming food. After they finish, they seem to remove unconsumed food particles from these objects using tools that look remarkably like your combat form.*&gt;

Cicc'rnd did not move. He rippled his skin, turning a dark red in a wave from front to back, showing anger. **[They mock us! Unknowingly, yes, but our honor has been insulted! We shall wipe them from their planet and take it for ourselves. Lights know we would treat it much better than they do.]**

Svigg'ntt performed the Krrt'arrn equivalent of a frown. &lt;*I must warn you, Commander. The individual who injured our crewman so was a juvenile, barely past their larval stage. These individuals are STRONG.*&gt; 

Cicc'rnd looked at the vitals of the injured Krrt'arrn, and rippled once more, becoming black. Resolve. **[You are physically fragile. You admitted this when you proposed this alliance, when we agreed you would take the land for yourself and leave us the sea we need, giving us 70% of the planet in exchange for our assistance. Do not worry about their supposed physical strength. Our soldiers will take care of that.]** From the water slithered several other special operations Skk'rll, each with a coral case of a coral powder with a structure similar to diamond. Dumping it all on the sand, the soldiers touched the pile and absorbed it into their bodies evenly. 

Before Svigg'ntt's very eyes, aided by the armor, the soldiers altered their shape into tall monolithic sponges, bleached white at the top, gradually becoming yellow two thirds of the way down. They faced Svigg'ntt in a semicircle rather reminiscent of Stonehenge. Before both parties returned to their ships and set course for Earth, Scoutmaster Svigg'ntt performed one of the few combat moves he was capable of. He used his tentacle as a whip and struck the Commander's armored form. A loud ***CLANG*** resonated through the soldier's body and echoed through the air.

There was no way the primitives stood a chance."

I'm a computer science masters' student doing an internship that isn't very challenging and one of my main projects is done in a desktop publishing program. The others are data parsing in Excel and moving files into a database. Selling myself based on those experiences has been hard. I have research experience as well, but it's more on the engineering side, and most jobs seem to want tons of experience in very specialized things. They also say that majoring in a difficult field due to the abundance of jobs is the worst thing you can do, well, I did just that. I'm not a very good programmer, and I frequently have a difficult time finding motivation or figuring out where to start on a project. I also don't communicate very well in interviews, and I don't know the right questions to ask, or I freeze up and forget them in the heat of the moment, even if I've read an article on good questions to ask beforehand. I blew a phone interview with a recruiter last week. I think I must have Aspergers or something.

Finding someone would be impossibly difficult for me. I'm a gay male. I try and keep myself busy to avoid that thought, especially since this is my last semester, but it does nag at me. On the other hand, I'm not even sure I want one. I am somewhere on the autism spectrum and need my personal space, and I fear I would tire of another guy quickly. Not only that, but I have a few habits that might turn guys away if ever got to the ""living together"" stage. 

Also, my parents would be less than supportive, my mom is a traditional Catholic, and my dad is bipolar and worries about everything under the sun and stays up very late drinking and keeping us up sometimes. If I were to come out, I'm pretty sure the drinking would only increase. He also suffers from worse depression and anxiety than I do, and makes comments to me about how life isn't really worth living all the time. Him being those things and my mom being absent-minded can make for a stressful living environment at times due to all the yelling that occurs. He drinks a lot, and tends to talk a lot and keep us awake at night due to his mumbling and walking around. He doesn't have a job, my mom is the one that works and does a lot of the household stuff. Sometimes I want to just leave so they can get a divorce and they don't have to worry about me; I don't think they have a normal relationship.

It's also said you have to go through these tough times in order to appreciate the little things, well, I can't appreciate the little things regardless. I don't find satisfaction in I've accomplished or what I do, and I don't really want anything out of life. We were asked the first thing we would do with a million dollars, and I couldn't think of anything beyond renting an apartment. Life is too difficult, not worth it, and I won't be able to get any enjoyment out of it regardless of the hard work I put in. Ending it sounds easier."
2ulixh,93,2015-02-02,"The Scrubs spinoff we should have gotten, and the reboot we could have.",BattleAx77,Scrubs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scrubs/comments/2ulixh/the_scrubs_spinoff_we_should_have_gotten_and_the/,"We all know the infamy behind Scrubs: Medschool. In its own right, it had very much potential, and strong characters. I think a large issue people had with it is that it didnt *feel* like Scrubs.

After beginning my fourth watch through of the series, I began to think about how this show could make a comeback, without the shortcomings of the last spinoff, and this is what i've come up with:

Scrubs: Early Years (Tentative title)

Synopsis:
We all know that the stories of the Sacred Heart gang did not begin on JDs first day.This is why I suggest a similar spin off series following the early start of Dr. Perry Cox as he enters the world of medicine. The premise would obviously be very similar to the original Scrubs, albeit with slightly different formatting. Dr. Cox does not nearly get lost in the clouds as frequently as JD, but narration can still take place as voice-overs. The series would follow Dr. Cox as a med student (a year before Scrubs took place, following the interns), and could follow up until JD and the scrubs crew arrive. 
There is his time as a student, intern, resident, and finally a few years as an attending to work with before JD and company even arrive at the hospital, so there would be no shortage of material depending on how long the show ran.

Material:
As we know, there are many players that were around Sacred Heart before JD. 
Dr. Kelso, Carla, The Janitor, Laverne, Dr. Wen and many others have been around a long time, with their own stories to tell with Perrys' involvement. To name a few examples of possible episodes;

-A story arc involving Bob Kelsos' rise from attending to Chief of Medicine
-A story arc of Perry meeting Jordan (obviously)
-Petey and his involvement with Perry and Jordan (based on Scrubs; My Own Private Practice Guy)
-A story involving the relationship between Dr. Cox and Dr. Wen

Character Arcs:
Obviously, the show would be a different beast, as the gruff Perry Cox we know and love is not the Perry Cox that has always been. We know obviously he was once like JD according to Jordan, but to see the toll the medical system has taken on him throughout his career would make the show very different than Scrubs.

I would absolutely luhuHOVE to see what this subreddit thinks of this idea, and to expand on it. Leave your comments with any ideas you have for feedback and lets try to get this some attention!

EDIT 1: I wanted to clarify one point, as far as casting. Obviously John McGinley would not play a young Dr. Cox and the rest of the cast would need to have a ""younger"" casting as well, which I believe would be advantageous in giving a fresh feel to a classic story"
2ulno7,1,2015-02-02,Trying to figure out if I made a mistake,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2ulno7/trying_to_figure_out_if_i_made_a_mistake/,"So last May I graduated with my MAACT and Bachelors in Finance both with a 3.5. The spring before that I had an internship with a Big 4. Prior to that internship and even joining the accounting program I really had no idea what I wanted to do. My school was a non target for finance and the accounting program was probably the most prestigious thing so I figured I would just go that route and figure it out along the way. The semester right before the internship I started taking higher level finance classes and absolutely loved it. It was challenging and something I found a ton of interest in. It was also the semester I took corporate tax and auditing which, to be honest, I absolutely hated. So I had a mindset going into my internship that maybe audit wasn't for me.

Went to my internship in a city away from home because I was feeling adventurous and didn't want to stay in the same city. It was hell. I literally got put on the worst clients and the people I worked with were miserable and I didn't really get along with anyone. I was in a really dark place because I had already put so much work into something that I just didn't enjoy. After that experience I declined my offer, vowing to never do that again.

Right now I am working for a family company doing finance/accounting while I try to get something else. However I keep getting turned down from jobs due to lack of experience and am really struggling to get anything. I never thought I would be in this position because I did well in school, even doing an equity research internship to get some finance experience. I have a couple friends in audit at different big 4s, and one loves it (he gets to travel because he is in a smaller office) and the other one I can tell really doesn't like it.

Now I am wondering if I made a mistake. I know I was miserable but maybe it was just that firm/city? I just don't know what to do anymore. Theres probably no point to this except I need to get it out. Anyone have a similar experience or any tips?"

It was over the past couple of days.. But first, background. I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for 5 years. This is pretty significant because we are both 20, we are each other's first significant relationship. 


Last semester I was in a class with my roommate and good friend who is single and has been looking for a relationship for awhile. We discover across from us in this class a very cute girl. Fast forward and my roommate and this girl have been talking for awhile they have gone to dinner and small dates but nothing beyond talking. I always thought this girl was cute and started to form a crush on her. This semester this girl and I have an internship and a very difficult class together that require us to spend a lot of time together. My interest in her grows, we become really good friends. She is pretty, fun, spontaneous, and essentially the perfect storm. 

Last Thursday we were coming back from our intense night class and we decide to get some food. To save some money we decide to get things to cook dinner. We head back to her place to cook. She makes me drinks. I happily drink them. After a few I am quite drunk [I'm a bit of a light-weight]. There has been flirting from both of us. She has to help me to the couch. Its too late and I am too drunk for the bus. She puts me on the couch and gets water for me. My arm is still around her from when she helped me over. 



My head is screaming at me. ""Don't do anything. You have been so happy recently, your life has been going so well."" 



I slump my head onto her chest. My hand then ends up on her chest. We make-out for about 10 seconds. We break apart after we  realize what we just did. ""Oh Fuck"" She goes up stairs to her bed. I stay on the couch. 


The next morning I get to my dorm. My two roommates and my friend are waiting for me. They are so upset at me for staying the night. I panic and tell them nothing happened. There is a heated shouting match with roommate2 [the one that wasnt seeing the girl] over how i could have possibly spent the night at her place knowing that roommate1 liked her. 


I *swore* to them that nothing happened. My girlfriend comes over. I explain to her that I was drunk and spent the night. She is okay with that. I *swore* to her nothing happened. She then goes and tries to calm my roommates that what I did wasn't that bad. She then talks to her roommates and they confirm that it isn't a huge huge deal.


About two days pass. I cant handle it anymore. I'm out to dinner with my girlfriend and I tell her everything. She is taking the news better than me. I had to stop on the way home to sob into the steering wheel. I then had to face my roommates and confess that I lied to them. 



These have been some of the worst days of my life. I never thought I would be this kind of person. I never wanted this to happen. My roommates are avoiding me. I'm avoiding them. My girlfriend isn't talking to me. I don't have many friends and my family isn't very helpful. I feel lost and I am terribly depressed. Everything was going so well until I did this. Now I have no one and will forever be known by this terrible mistake. I still have to live with my roommates, I already signed a lease with them for next year. I still have to go to my internship and class with this girl. Oh and I might have ruined my relationship with one of the greatest girls I have ever met. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TLDR**: I cheated on my girlfriend of five years by drunkenly making out with a girl my roommate has been dating. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also, sorry if this isn't to the normal reddit standards. This is my first account that I made solely to post this in hopes of somehow feeling like less of a totally shit person. 

*UPDATE:* 
Thank you everyone for your words of encouragement. I know I'm catastrophizing this. I'm taking it really hard because this is pretty much all I have. I didn't/don't have anywhere to funnel my emotions.

Also, It may not seem like a big deal to most people that we only made out. However, my relationship is a little strange in that my girlfriend and I have never had sex. We've done things but we never went all the way. She has never been comfortable with it and its her choice so I've respected it.

2ulqs6,0,2015-02-02,In a predicament between two girls.,turning_revolving,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/2ulqs6/in_a_predicament_between_two_girls/,"Hi all,

I don't want to convolute what is probably a well known situation, so I'll be brief.  I dated a girl for nearly a year.  She was a wonderful person and near the end of the relationship she began saying ""I love you"".  It freaked me out at first but I would say it back to her, because I knew she wanted to hear it.  I figured that somewhere in my silly heart I meant it too.  This was probably not smart and a sign that we needed to have some sort of discussion.  But regardless, I kept it up.  

A few weeks from there I began an extremely fantastic, real-deal, dream internship that was both very arduous and time-consuming. I would be 5 hours away.  We tried to maintain contact the best we could over the phone and facebook, etc.  


There was another girl on the internship, from the same school.  She was splendid; she had traits that, although small, were enough to stick inside my head.  I tried at first to ignore these things.  I had a girlfriend that loved me and the last thing I wanted to be was a shit head.  But it is very hard to not be a shit head.  Eventually I realized (or thought I did) that something was wrong with my current relationship.  If I was able to be swayed towards this new girl so easily then I must not really be as into my girlfriend as I thought I was.

I thought about it for a week longer and then drove home and broke up with her.  It was the most painful thing I have ever done.  I felt awful, but also felt a strange sense of relief that stayed with me for a long time.  I returned to the internship, found out that the new girl had a crush on me as well and things fell into place slowly.  She was very upfront about my last relationship, telling me that she didn't want to be someone between the two of us.  She asked that if she stopped seeing me, would I go back to girl A.  I answered as truthfully as I could: ""I would probably just be alone for a long time"".  

However, now the internship is over.  I'm back in school and live down the street from (oddly enough) both of them.  Kill me.  It feels like the excitement of seeing a new person is wearing off.  I do not know what to do; perhaps being back in town has reminded me of the past lifestyle I led with the my ex-girlfriend.  I find myself missing her and thinking about her every day.  

This is all very troubling and I feel shitty and it sounds shitty.  And it is shitty.  Any advice, stories, jokes would be appreciated now.  I feel very off-kilter and awful.  "
2um5f4,1,2015-02-03,Internships in software engineering as a math major seem impossible to find,idekia,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2um5f4/internships_in_software_engineering_as_a_math/,"I'm a senior in math with a 3.96 GPA. I have four years of research experience where I had to ""program"" (I use this term lightly) in mathematica. I’ve also had to use Matlab in some of my classes  I'm pursuing my PhD next year in applied math. If I could go back, I would have double majored in computer science. 

I’ve taken two course in C++ for elective credit. I understand the fundamentals. I know a lot about the math behind computer science (and can learn more easily).  I understand complexity, runtime, etc. I know algorithms on a very sophisticated theoretical level. 

More importantly, I feel like the design process of coding software is incredibly similar to writing a math proof. It requires perfect attention to detail, and doing it right is very different from doing it eloquently and efficiently.  Shortening a proof or problem with a relevant theorem is like using a package or boiler plate. I could go on.

It seemed logical for the next step to be a summer internship. But I’ve gotten two automatic rejections (within 5 minutes) from companies that I’m assuming automatically screen me out because I don’t have a major in {Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, …}. It’s never listed as an immediate requirement, so I just keep wasting my time.  I can’t upload a sample of my code. I can’t give an interview. I can only stare at a rejection from a do not reply email. 

Am I wrong in thinking that I’m at least enough of an asset to be given a shot? Sure, I only know a little bit compared to senior CS majors, but surely there’s use for a competent mathematician? I’m not looking for a glorious job at google. But I’m creative, motivated, and have research experience. Surely there’s some internship that could make use of someone who may need catching up on programming but can work on making advanced algorithms or doing sophisticated mathy work in xyz software. It seems like it could be a symbiotic relationship. 

Nope. Everything seems like “B.S. In computer science or equivalent or relevant work experience required.” I will keep learning. But I can’t help thinking there’s a glassdoor: “relevant work experience.” 

Tl;dr Competent math major with the mindset of a programmer. Keep getting automated rejections for summer internships in software engineering. Are there any internships you know of for a math major with beginner-level coding skills where I can hone my abilities as a programmer? If not, what should I do to get these opportunities in the following summers while I pursue my PhD. I dream of one day working in silicon valley using math to design extremely efficient, cutting edge software.

Here's the situation:

1. In my university we have a Professional Experience requirement wherein we need to work something like 90h to 120h to graduate.

2. My friend's working at this prestigious company that creates licensing software and royalty management or something. They have major clients like Marvel and O'reilly. For my country that's pretty impressive. My friend also told me how professional and friendly everyone was, so that also made me want to try out something there. He and (who I assume to be) the HR manager came to my university for a career fair and the HR manager was impressed. My friend put in a good word and she contacted me for an interview for a position that ""opens in the summer.""

3. I went to the interview, and after being asked about my experience in development they told me that they were really aching for a DBA-devops person right now. They said that they knew I was a dev first but that it would be a good experience for me and *implied* that later on they might transfer me to a dev role (but not in any concrete statement). They admitted that they brought me in thinking that this was a dev thing and that they were going to give me time to prepare and train for a DBA-devops thing. I said that I had little experience with it but told them that I was interested, at least to cover my bases in all aspects of development.

4. I need to graduate, so I have to take this at least on an internship level. I also have a $20k student loan that I'm fucking terrified of and want to get rid of as soon as possible, so I might stick there for a year to aggressively pay it off. However, I eventually want to transition to quantitative/computative finance/investment actuary/et cetera, and I really don't think that more than basic experience in DBA and devops is needed there, while developer experience is. I also don't want to lock myself in a DBA-devops career track. Where do I proceed from here? Should I start looking for other options as soon as the internship is over?"

The thing is I know this guy from a previous job (my first job, which I enjoyed). He was senior staff (but not my manager or supervisor) when I was an intern and later on when I joined the company after graduation. We haven't exactly had a good experience working with each other. I'm more of a quiet, reserved sensitive type and he's a take no prisoners army drill sergeant in your face guy.

I've always felt he was a tad biased against me because I'm college graduate and he's one of those 'school of life' &gt; book smarts people who never went to college. As an intern I was told by him harshly not to be so 'reticent' - but it's just in my nature to be quiet and more reflective, and later on even as a staffer we never truly got along/communicated well because our personalities clashed. From normal day-to-day small talk to work-related issues, we could never really communicate smoothly.

And this past week we've been emailing back and forth a bit about my application for the job, and even then I'm getting a little grated by his communication style, which probably is a huge red flag.

I'm not exactly thrilled at the prospect of him being my boss, but he's not a dick by any means, and he's fair, decisive, fights for his subordinates and recognises good work. The job scope itself would be pretty good for me, and the guy I'd be working alongside is another an ex-colleague of mine, and I get along great with him. It's just the boss factor that's really bugging me.

The only thing I want to do with my PC is to play League of Legends without problems on 60fps and watch twitch streams on 1080p , though a nice benefit would be if I could play runescape on a second monitor. That monitor is an older one and is 4:3 with 720p I think.

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

* I just want to be as cheap as possible, I think it won't get too expensive.

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

* Soon ^TM

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

* Just a new mobo and CPU. I think intern graphics would be enough right?

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

* I live in Switzerland and I'll use [this](http://www.toppreise.ch/grp1_1.html) to compare prices though I can do this by myself without problems. Just tell me what range of cpus / mobos I'm looking for.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

* I currently have a [acer emachines ET1850](http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/pcs/51049/emachines-et1850-review/specifications). Additionally I have a 3TB HDD and a Wifi adapter.

* I'll reuse as much as possible.

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* It's an option. If I can still save money in the long run (energy costs) I can do it.

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* No.

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* I'll probably use my old case.

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

* No."

From the start I thought the job was going to be teaching older adults how to type, and use office programs, and navigate the internet. From what I gather out of the interview they were looking for a break fix support to help win7 migration. Total for the whole campus about 200+ machines and 150 users. Also on the plate someone with a bit networking knowledge I knew enough to be dangerous but not enough to swim. So the boss had no problem with teaching, I have no problem with learning. Talked about on call rotation, backups, DR, and role play scenarios for the rest of the interview.

For the first couple of month I seems to make every mistake in the book to missing details from pc builds to forgetting to copy over a user favorites. To forgetting what default gateways do..:(At my six month review boss wants me to focus on doing things right the first time. He does awesome boss things and puts out fires, and defends me left and right.

At my year mark we talked about me trying out a Networking+ class and taking the network+ exam with the Comptia exam took the class and six months later failed the test. Not phased by it we keep on doing the good fight. The year goes on and I've really only helped out with one major project for the company, other things I've helped migrate multiple windows xp&gt;7. Learned how to manage an enterprise AV system and PBX phone system. Some things I would like to learn to do but boss seems to keep to himself is AD, File Services, Backups, and Virtual serve maintenance.  I have start a home lab and started to learn with a server 2008 and 2013. But really in a given month I do 100+ some odd windows updates by hand and answer help desk ticket. Should I move? Or stick with it and learn as much as I can?

Odds end: I figure a couple of months in I was a good fit the job with getting along with staff and able to adapt to work environments and tech. Pay is 15 and hour. Have not been put on call yet. But I do get to enjoy weekends and a 9-5 schedule. With no over time.

I'm being followed now....,7buses,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2un12e/i_need_advice_im_being_followed_now/,"This is it for me. I'm done. I was being driven by my father and he told me he is having me followed while I visit my boyfriend. I am so disgusted and I feel so violated.


I thought we were making progress. I came out about being sexually abused as a child in October. Parents seemed to be working to be better after I began voicing over the summer how they are hurtful and abusive. They seemed to have changed their tune, stopped giving me such a hard time about everything. Until they kept giving me a hard time about my boyfriend, so I stopped telling them where I was all the time. That's when they had me being followed.


They want a relationship with me, but they just don't understand how to have one with me. There's just something wrong with them where they can't understand things. I don't thrive in conditions where people barrage me on every medium asking me where I am like I'm 12 and don't understand personal safety, telling me I'm stupid for dating who I'm dating, or can't see me for the little them they want me to be.


They hate my boyfriend, who is my best friend. I love this man. I see a future with him. He's sensitive towards my (many) needs, smart, generous with what little he has with me, he'd kill for me, he's ambitious and he has taught me so much about empathy and not being such a pushover. His family has welcomed me and they're not perfect by a long shot, but they love me more unconditionally than my own family.


My parents completely hate him. He's not wealthy because he has his own small business, so they think I'm shooting low. They think he's lying to me, that he's really working for his mother (he's not) or that she owns the building (wrong again). They get upset because they don't understand fundamental things about his business and when I try to educate them, they scream, "" I don't want to understand!!!"". They give me all this talk about me being a strong independent woman, yet expect me to find a prince and never work.


I was fine with dealing with this. I'm going to school to be an accountant so I can have financial freedom. I was going to cut them off one day. But now that's looking a lot closer.


I think I'm going to go no contact. I've already left the car they gave me back at their house, and I'm having my boyfriend take me back to college. I can't use that car knowing the strings attached to it.


I've already found a place at school for the summer, and I'm looking into internships to make some money. I have my student loans, and my Florida pre paid runs out this year so I needed to start working this year anyway. I may be able to borrow a bike from my boyfriend's mother so I can travel in town.


This is just not easy, and is coming at the worst time. My depression is coming back in full force and I've been feeling paralyzed trying to do schoolwork lately. I feel like all the energy has left my body.

I don't feel safe using the university health services as my sister is one of the staff psychologists. I know she's a consummate professional, but I don't think she's in a neutral place right now. My sister is receiving money from my parents for fertility treatments, so right now her judgement has been cloudy and she has been enabling my parents, or justifying and excusing their actions.

I am trying to get outside more as it helps, and I've recently made friends with some very lovely people. So some things are looking up.

Sorry for the long post. I'm just trying to move forward somehow...."
2unbva,4,2015-02-03,I [17M] am having trouble telling my parents [54F] [50M] about my new girlfriend [16F].,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2unbva/i_17m_am_having_trouble_telling_my_parents_54f/,"
First off, I am an only child and I'm my parents main focus. Other than work, they don't really do much besides watch TV and spend time with me. They tend to live vicariously through me and tell their coworkers and friends pretty much everything about me. In my last relationship (my first one too) my parents told pretty much everyone they worked with about it, even to the point an intern at my mom's work told my mom what I should get her for Christmas (we broke up before Christmas unfortunately).
My parents loved my ex. She was absolutely perfect in their eyes, espically that she shared a lot of traits with them. With this new girl I'm currently with, I don't know. This new girl is amazing to me, but I'm not sure if a short artsy girl will compare to my ex who was a tall athletic girl.

My parents always talk to me about ""staying on the right track"" which basically means in my eyes ""live a boring life"". They want me to focus on school and baseball only. They even said it was good for me when my ex broke up with me so I can focus on school.
To play devils advocate, they may be right. My grades are not good. Granted, I did miss a few days because of strep throat, but I'm extremely far from getting the 3.5 they want for the second semester of my junior year. It's a month in and I'm really struggling.

On the bright side, my mom has met my current girlfriend before when she was dating her ex. My mom and my current girlfriend starting talking at a baseball game last year and my mom asked me if I knew who she was. At the time, I did not. IIRC, my mom said she was a very nice girl.

For the past few weeks, my girlfriend and I have been hanging out every day with my parents not knowing. We go get something to eat then I take her home before baseball practice and I see my parents at home after baseball. I feel guilty telling my parents I'm with a different friend rather than my girlfriend, but my parents haven't mentioned anything.
Last night at dinner, I tried bringing up the subject of having a girlfriend to my mom, but we got off topic like usual. I was going to tell her I have a date with a girl straight up, but if I did, I'd have to tell her my girlfriend's entire life story it seems judging by how my mom reacted when my friend accidentally told my mom about my ex.

Is there a better way I can handle this? I want to tell them either today or tomorrow because we have an ""official date"" planned for Friday and I would feel guilty telling them I'm going to the movies and lie about who I'm going with, I feel like I'm being immature if I do. Thanks in advance.

I came across the opening for the position of Network Operations Center Technician and I am interested in applying for the job. I am currently a Technical Support Representative at a local ISP and I think it would be a great opportunity for me to challenge myself while continuing to develop a career in technology. 

I have been a big fan Blizzard’s games for as long as I can remember and have always thought the company has one of the best reputations for quality in the video game industry. I’ve played through most of Blizzard’s releases and have most recently played Hearthstone. Having a job where I can work with products I am a fan of and be able to work with one of the most respected companies in the video game industry would be a great environment to succeed in.

My previous work experience has given me a strong background for networking and IT support. During my internship with Company1 I was able to work with a small office network and my experience with Company2 has given me insight into telecommunication networks and hands on experience with troubleshooting a variety of devices. I am also a quick learner and always looking to ways to improve. I am currently studying to acquire a CCNA certification and I would be able to apply what I’m learning to this job.

2unnjp,4,2015-02-03,"30k in loans, is it reasonable to decline an offer to live at parents' home?",Emmerz90,StudentLoans,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/2unnjp/30k_in_loans_is_it_reasonable_to_decline_an_offer/,"I am actually writing this on behalf of my girlfriend, as I would like to get some information so that I can better help her prepare how to tackle her student debt, and broach the subject of us living together while she repays her loans.

Some background: 

We have been together almost three years, and so far have not yet lived together (which has been a mutual decision).  I am a somewhat recent grad doing freelance design, and looking to transition to a full time position ASAP.  She is in her final semester of school, working toward becoming an art teacher.  She has already been promised a contract upon graduation, which would assure her a position beginning in the 30-40k a year range.

Currently, she has around 30k in student loans, which compared to what I have seen in my friends and on this subreddit, is a very manageable amount.  As of right now, she is living with her mom as she is in a full-time internship and unable to work otherwise.  Her mom has mentioned wanting her to continue living there for another year in order to save money and pay back her loan as soon as possible.  I disagree with this idea, and here are my reasons:

1) Her mom is a sweet woman, but tends to manipulate her adult daughter's emotions in order to make her feel obligated toward her.  She is often guilted in to helping to clean/care for/buy food for her mom's 20 cats.  On top of that, she usually ends up buying most of the groceries for them and cooking for them, which ends in her getting blamed for ""making the house messy"".  She has been a huge help in managing their house (which with 20 cats is obviously a big undertaking), but now that she is spending 5-6 nights a week at my place (due to my proximity with her internship, rather than driving an hour home), her mother is telling her she isn't doing enough around the house/spending time with her, and is guilting her continuously over not staying there more often.  I feel this is a toxic and overly dependent relationship on her mom's behalf, and I know that if it goes on for another year, it will only become even harder for her to get out of the situation.

2) Although I know I won't directly be able to help her pay back her loans (or at least not until I have established a career that allows me to assist with the payments), I would like to establish a life with her and help her get away from that stressful and unhealthy situation at her mom's house so she can actually enjoy her first year of teaching.  Where we live we could both easily find an apartment/home to rent for under $1000 (so $500, max, for her) a month with utilities.

So here is my question: Is it reasonable to attempt to pay off a 30k loan, while also taking on ~$6000 a year for rent?  I don't want to pressure her in to doing something that will make the next year stressful, but I know so little about how much you should expect to pay monthly on loans, or whether it is smart to not pay it all off in one year.  I also feel it is a quality of life issue, and although her mom is insistent she stays there another year, I don't think that she has the facts, either.

Thanks for taking the time to read all of this.  I'm sure I can learn a lot from this subreddit!"

I was actually shocked I had been accepted because I really hadn't done any programming before being accepted and had none of the relevant coursework - but I was ecstatic either way. Being a transfer, I'm classified as a junior but taking all the basic CS classes this year, I'm really at the level of a freshman or sophomore. 


I feel that I've been learning programming quickly and I'm excelling in my major classes, but it's already February and I haven't applied to any internships because I feel like I don't know nearly enough. Considering I plan to graduate in 2 and a half years, that only gives me this summer and next for internships. Hearing and reading how important internships are, I've come to the conclusion that an internship this summer is essential. Knowing C decently, and in the middle of a course in C++, with a little python I've been learning on the side, should I write this summer off and plan on summer courses/more side projects? Or is it feasible to get a summer internship this late with essentially only three classes of programming under my belt to date?


Note, I am attempting to build a portfolio at the moment. I'm committing my projects to git hub and working on some side projects out of school (ex. tic tac toe in the console). 


If anyone has been in a similar situation, or has any insight into this specific scenario, I would greatly appreciate your help. Thanks.  "

Since then, I've been rejected by about 15, and heard back positively from five, including two of the companies I'm most interested in. One of those two has said they want to bring me in for an interview, but they're still working on scheduling it. The other I haven't heard from since we talked on the phone a few weeks ago. They were very excited about me on the phone, though.

So, today, I had an interview with one of the other three. They really liked me, and gave me an offer on the spot. There are a few problems, though. First, they're offering less than I'd like. They're offering $55k, but I'd like at least $60k. I had a job offer for $65k a few months ago that ended up falling through (not enough work to go around), and one of the two top companies I've heard back from said, ""Oh, it'll be more than that"" when I mentioned that I was hoping for at least $60k. Second, they want an answer on Thursday. They originally wanted me to sign the offer there, but I asked for some time. Third, I didn't have a good chance to get a feel for their culture; the interview was in their corporate office, so I didn't meet any developers. Fourth, it seems like they won't be able to put me on the sort of projects I'm most interested in for a while, and I'd have to start out with other things. And fifth, as I mentioned, they're not one of my top companies. However, they're the only ones who have given me an offer so far, and they do seem like a good company overall. So, what should I do?

In case it's relevant, I live in the DC/Baltimore area, graduated with a BS in CS, minor in mathematics last May, an working through an online MS in SE program, and have seven months of experience from three internships at a well-known and well-liked government agency and a generally impressive resumé for a recent graduate.

I met this guy nearly 5 years ago in Israel on a semester-long gap program before starting college in the states (he is Dutch and was on a similar program).  We had a hot, heavy and brief fling and continued talking for a few months after we returned to our respective countries. Because the majority of our interactions had been physical our conversations fizzled out quickly. A year later I was in the middle of deciding where I wanted to study abroad for my junior year of college. Ironically, he reached out to me the day of the study abroad convention. While there, I found out that his school in the Netherlands had a scholarship agreement with mine so between that, our rekindled long distance rendezvous, and the really stellar program the university offered for my major I decided to take the plunge and go to his university. A few months before I left, he went back to Israel for a visit, had a one night stand with a South American girl and then proceeded into a LDR with her. I was pretty bummed, but decided to go on my study abroad program anyways. When I got there we decided to meet up and eventually started spending a lot of time together due to common interests we didn’t know we had until that point. We stayed platonic out of respect for his relationship (plus I dated other guys here and there). By the end of my year’s stay we were inseparable- best friends with a flirtatious edge. Since I left Holland (in May of 2013) we have remained very close. He left his girlfriend a year ago and said it was because he didn’t love her like he thought he should. 

For me, he has always been a bit of a “one that got away.” Since he broke up with his girlfriend I noticed that I haven’t been as proactive about dating so I did some self-evaluation and ultimately came to the conclusion that I do have feelings for him. SO I told him that, because 1. I didn’t want to subject you guys to a “should I tell him” advice post and 2. ugh, yolo. HOWEVER, his answer was so convoluted that I need some help deciphering. His answer is as follows: “I like you too but since we live pretty far I can’t make a judgement about how likely it would work. I know I enjoy talking to you more than my other friends and I think about you the most. The truth is I would be open to moving in together but I don’t think that can happen now. Staying friends for now seemed like the best thing to do. I also don’t want to destroy our friendship by making it more than that. But I really care for you and don’t want you to think that you are just another person for me.” 

As a side note, I am currently bound to NYC while I work to pay off my student loans/ save up for grad school. He is in a master’s program in Holland graduating Spring 2016. He has to do an internship his last semester, and I have a connection here in NY and can get him one near me. He is open to this, but prefers something “more prestigious” if he gets accepted. It hurts me that he doesn’t just jump on this opportunity to live near me. Whatcha guys think? 

Tldr; I started off with this guy in a fling, then we became friends, now there is something more but his view on the matter is confusing and I need help figuring out next moves.

Edit: Added flair. "

Wanted to explain my situation to see if anyone may have input as to making a transition within Deloitte. 
 
I am a 25 year old graduate of a state college business school. After bouncing here and there in staff accounting roles (due to low GPA), I gained enough experience and got an offer in Deloitte Federal Advisory. I've been with Deloitte for about two months, and while I enjoy the work, I've recently thought about transitioning into Finance.
This is my current gameplan. Within 6 months or so I'd like to transition out of my project and into transaction services at Deloitte. A good friend of mine is a Senior and I plan on leveraging him to see if any opportunities are available. 

I just had a few questions at this point:

What are my disadvantages where I'm at currently? Am I too old? Will Deloitte prefer recent grads with finance internships? What are my advantages I can leverage? 

Would getting a CPA help transition into TAS at Deloitte? What about CFA? 

I'm currently reading textbooks/non fiction books to get a better understanding of the industry. Any other tips to get a solid working knowledge and ace the interview?

Thanks everyone for their input."

I currently have an internship with a company I love, however with it being my first internship ever I have wanted to try and experience other places so that I may either find something better or appreciate my current job more.

I've recently finished an internship abroad at one of the top software companies (think Google, Microsoft, IBM). It has been an amazing experience and they have been very satisfied with me as well.

Today I got an offer for a full-time position at the same company starting upon my graduation this fall. It is a very generous offer for a junior position and given that I already know the team (smart, helpful, thoroughly amazing people) and the type of work (which I enjoyed immensely) from the time of my internship, this is truly an amazing opportunity.

The problem is that I am not really completely untethered. I have a girlfriend, family, friends and a whole life in my own country and leaving it would mean leaving all this behind. My girlfriend said that she could follow me when she finishes her studies, but this would still entail a considerable period of long-distance, which I don't have any experience with and I am not sure that it would work well.

There is also a thing that I am not completely sure if I want to finish my education. I was seriously considering a master's degree, which is kinda necessary in Europe due to the changes of the Bologna Process which in my country lowered the amount of coursework for bachelor's.

I am thoroughly torn. What should I do? I know that this is one of the biggest decisions of my life and I really don't want to screw this up."

I have a lot of experience behind the camera (have worked with models, fashion looks on my own) but working with this company would also give me an opportunity to boost my profile (hopefully) in the city and have access to the store's studio/clothes/models for shoots. I would also gain more experience.

But I'm also helping raise their profile (they only have an Instagram presence for photos) and this would of course be advertising for them.

But again, they're advertising this position as an intern spot (would be for about three months).

If you know me, or if you don't, it is very clear I have always loved the idea of living in England. The cottages in the country, the beautiful accents and strange double-decker buses are only the obvious reasons for loving this country so much. In 2012, I took the opportunity to live in this dream world and attend the top university for my chosen career - public relations. Coming from a small town in North Carolina and a family of normal working-class citizens, this opportunity required I spend up until the move doubling up on my classes at my then-current university while also working full time to save for my flights, visa, rents, etc. Not only did this take a toll on me but I had to take out a dreaded Sallie Mae loan with my grandparents as co-signers to make the first year happen. 

Since I have been in the UK studying PR, I have been given the opportunity to spend a year working in the industry on a placement, where I worked for a leading corporate software brand and got to spend a year working in the career my degree will take me to! I have also been able to work at marketing and public relations agencies to get the extra experience for when I graduate so I can make the most of my time here in England. I have absolutely loved studying here in England and have had opportunities I would've never had if I were still in NC, but if I can't pay off my tuition I won't be able to get my degree. 

As a foreign student I am only allowed to work 20 hours per week at £6.50/hour which barely covers my rent/bills/food, so I can't save enough to finish paying off my £11,000 tuition. During my internship year I was able to save a couple thousand and the US Gov has been able to give me £7,500 but I am still £1,999 short. I am only asking for a minimum of £1,000 to meet the bare minimum to pay at least half. 
If you can help me to pay this tuition, I would be forever grateful. Whether it's £1 or $1, anything would truly help tremendously in the journey to finishing my education and getting my degree.

Any money over my goal (in the case of it happening) will go towards the rest of my tuition and graduation fees. I will also pay it forward once I begin my career post-graduation to someone else who needs help funding their education.

I'm a 2nd year Computer Engineering student, and I'm kind of in a unique situation.

Last week, I received an offer from eBay. I negotiated the salary, and so they cut the deadline short when they accepted my request ($37/hr). I accepted the offer, and it's for a Mobile Web Engineer internship position (mobile web dev for m.ebay.com). 

Today, I received an offer from Workday for $34. I think it's a great company, rapidly growing in cloud computing with industry leading HR Software as a Service. They said it's a flexible position, I choose a project that matches my interests, skills, and experience.

Which position would you guys recommend taking (aka me applying for internships next year)? eBay is a huge company with a pretty well known brand. Workday is rapidly growing but still decently known. The salary isn't an issue for me. eBay is mobile web development, while WorkDay is flexible, probably some sort of Java. I don't particularly care for either type of software engineering, as I'm hoping to get into program/project/product management within the next few years, or even that type of internship next summer.

Issue is, I already accepted eBay, but the offer was ""at-will,"" so I can terminate whenever I want. However, my background check is processing now and I've already done most of the paperwork. They also negotiated with me and I'd feel bad screwing them.

So yeah. What do you guys think, and which position would be better for me at this time?  I'm leaning towards sticking to the offer I already accepted - eBay. Please help, thanks!

I got stuck in an insane amount of traffic, then I almost thought I was going to get there on time but I got stuck behind a fucking snow plow which kept me late by 10 fucking minutes. So I showed up 11-12 minutes late, my hair a mess since I started sweating and freaking out about all the delays. I'm so frustrated. I think I'm more upset at how ridiculous my hair looked (I'm a woman).

I like the company, and I've had one interview with them before, and several phone interviews. I've always been on time for the phone interviews, emails, thank you emails, etc, and the previous interview I was 15 minutes early. Do you think they'll look over this?

2upa3d,2,2015-02-03,My story: In love with my boss,Lvthrowaway7,lovehurts,https://www.reddit.com/r/lovehurts/comments/2upa3d/my_story_in_love_with_my_boss/,"I am going to start with post with that I am very happily married but like many of you know love is complicated and you can’t help who you fall in love with.

So, I have very strong feelings for my manager. (I would say love but maybe some people would disagree) 

I have worked with him for eighteen months, most of this time he has been my direct report or we have worked closely on other projects. Right now, we are working closer than we have ever. I am managing interns for him and the three other staff. 

Some background, I am a 28 year old female who is married to a 28 year old male. My manager is 30 years old. We all grew up in the same state. I went to college in the city that my husband and manager grew up in. (Literally my husband and manager grew up down the street from each other, but they went to different schools and were a couple years apart, so they never met – Just an interesting fact) 

So, I went to college and met my husband the first week of school and we have been together ever since. Three and half years ago, we moved across the country, to find better career options. My husband is currently finishing college, as he did not graduate in four years like I did. 

When we moved I started my Master’s program, to be able to find a good job in my field. During my last semester, I worked as a graduate assistant with a guy. This guy and I got along very well. He was very charming, but overall a very nice guy. I developed an attraction to him, a lot of girls had crushes on him, but I felt like we were very similar. He was very flirty with me and it didn’t seem to stop him that I was married, I liked the attention. It was something I was not used to being a married women. It made me feel alive. 

So, I finally told my husband about my crush on this guy, we can call him “friend”. My husband was very jealous at first, but eventually he met him and really liked him. So, I decided to bring up to my husband the option of an open relationship. I always kind of thought the idea could work. I believe you can love more than one person and if everyone is accepting it could work. I also believe that having multiple relationships is beneficial in general, because it is good to share with more than one person because you can’t agree on everything with one person and having multiple relationships allows to you grow more as a person. For me an open relationship was more than sexual. When I first brought it up to my husband he thought it was a sexual thing, and that I was not satisfied. Eventually I convinced him of my points and he was more open to the idea. 

So, I convinced my friend to be part of an experience with me and my husband to try to have physical relations with other people.  I would hook up with my friend. Then my friend convinced his friends with benefits to hook up with my husband. She was very open to sexual experiences. My husband agreed to this. It happened NYE. (Around seven months after I started my current job – This might be relevant later) 

When my friend kissed me, it was very awkward, I was worried about my husband’s feelings. I tried to move forward with the hook up, but I just felt very uncomfortable and frigid. (My husband was upstairs hooking up with another girl) Eventually I let go of my thoughts and was able to enjoy it. I liked it but felt a bit disappointed than I psyched myself out to not enjoy the whole experience. 

Afterwards my husband and I talked about our experience and both agreed it was a good experience but we wanted to take things slow. I mentioned to my husband the possibly of hooking up with my friend again and he didn’t want me to, after a couple of months I convinced him. My friend and I hooked up, it was okay, but I realized we were sexually compatible and I had feelings for someone else and I only saw him as a friend. He is still a very good friend and confidedant.

Okay back to my manager. I first met him at a professional event at my college in the middle of my last semester. Just the previous semester, I applied to several jobs and did not received any, so I was very down on my job prospects, but I was very confident in my job skills. When I first met him I did not talk to him about working, I talked to him about hosting an office visit for a professional group I was an officer for in my college. We hit it off when he mentioned he was from my home state, went to the college that my husband idealizes but could not afford to go, and was from my husband’s home town. He was also attractive and had a lot of confidence in him. I eventually applied to work in his company in his department and got an interview. During my in person interview it was evident that he was very excited at the prospect of me working for his team, a couple hours after my interview he e-mailed me and said that the department decided they wanted to have me on-board. It was my first job offer, and I had some other prospects but they were uncertain, so I took this job with my manager. 

During my first couple of months, it was evidential that we clicked more than anyone he has ever worked with. Our co-workers called us twins, even my manager called me his “work soul mate” I loved being around him. He was fun to joke with and we had a great chemistry. I think everyone knew that I was his favorite. I felt like our bond was strong, but our relationship was strictly professional. He met my husband a couple months into us working together and they instantly hit it off. I never really told my husband about my crush on my manager, but he had to know something was up when I talked about him a lot. 

We never hung out outside of work except for work happy hours, so I was unsure of his life outside of work, but I loved being around him. I would do anything to work with him and get upset on days I did not get to see him. When he got moved to a different team, he found a way to bring me over to his team to help him out with a special project. He and my supervisor, at the time, got into fights on who would get to have me on certain days. 

As our relationship deepen, he would tell me about his family life and stories of ex-girlfriends. I even helped him track down an ex-girlfriend who blocked him on Facebook. I showed him some twitter posts and he said thank you for showing him those that he said, “I can finally let her go as she's just never going to be the one.”

When we were working on New Year’s Eve, he asked me to lunch, as we were told we could leave early and I stayed after everyone left. (I often did this or found an excuse to do this) I invited my husband, and he seemed cool with, so we all talked for a while, it was the first time we hung out not with the rest of my co-workers. 

Eventually I told my husband of my deeper feelings for my manager. I know he was concern. My manager and I had a great relationship as I could sense how he was feeling. I could tell when he was unhappy. When we reorganized teams, my manager was happy to let me know we would be working together again on a more permanent basis and he was going to devote a lot of time to me. I was very happy. Unfortunately, soon after that news, he told me he was going to be taking a month off to donate a kidney to his brother and he would have to return to his home state to do this. He told me in confidence before he told the whole department a week later. I was not surprised as he mentioned his brother before and mentioned his other brother could not donate his kidney to his brother. I was sad and worried but I tried not to show it as he is not the emotional type and would not want to deal with that. I missed him a lot but I stayed in contact by sending him a couple of personal e-mails and he seemed happy I was contacting him and not getting too emotional about the situation. He also e-mailed me at work and called almost every day, except the week after his surgery, we still had a couple of projects we were working on. 

The day of his surgery I was an emotional mess, I just wanted to hear that he was okay, when he finally e-mailed the department that he was okay, I could finally breath. I was worried about him, but he finally flew back into town and the Friday before the Monday he came back into work, we threw a happy hour for him. My husband and I went and we were very happy to see him. He was very happy to see us, politely making conversation with everyone who showed up but spending most of his time with us. He seemed like he was recovering still, but he put on a tough guy act in front of everyone. 

When he looks at me, I just feel this intense connection. It is mostly likely just me. Anyway I was very happy to have him back. We started to work back together, everything was great, the Monday he came back to work we even had a private happy hour with my husband where I told him all the work gossip he missed. Soon our hang outs became more regular, never alone mostly with either my husband or another female co-worker who he became close with. (who also had a crush on him) We even met on a Sunday to play a poker tournament together where he told me that he was glad he brought someone he liked, and we walked around and it felt like a date. Someone even thought we were married. (swoon)

It all came ahead when he invited himself over my house for a private party to watch a tv show, he invited another female co-worker and her boyfriend (not the one who liked him). Although she was there it was obvious to me he just wanted to spend time with me. He brought me champagne. (I am not a big drinker) We spend around 10 hours together that day, to me he just fit in my life perfectly. My husband and him got along great. Usually he would pretend he loved my husband so much, I always thought it was to cover up how much he liked me. 

One day, I ended up outside his apartment before a work event he was driving me to, his roommate really wanted to meet me, so he came outside and talked to me a bit while my manager went inside to change. His roommate told me that he was sure that my manager would do anything for me. It made me feel like either my manager talked about me a lot or there was something more he felt. 

The next month I went on vacation for 10 days, he even called me about a work thing while I was on vacation. He joked I had too much power. 

After I came back from vacation, things felt different. I was upset at work, I felt undervalued, I felt like he didn’t care about me anymore as a co-worker or anything more. Things got out of hand I lost my cool, I yelled at him at work, told him he didn’t know how to manage me and he was a horrible manager. I felt upset right away, I tried to apologize but it just made things worst. I said we needed some time apart and he agreed. It was a horrible long month. Eventually we got over it, at least somewhat. I always feel like he is still isn’t over it though. 

Our teams got restructured and I basically became the supervisor under him. He told me he only wanted it to be me and he specially fought for me to be in that position. We were working closely together and I thought it could be great, but we clashed so much. I was too emotional when it came to him because of my feelings. Also, he was obviously unhappy at work and it was hard to deal with because we always worked so well together. Eventually I found out he wanted to leave and he was applying to other jobs, I was happy he could confide in me but I felt sad he felt that way, I knew it wasn’t me that was making him feel that way but still was upset. We continue to get into little spats and it ate me up emotional. I felt like I was on an emotional roller coaster, he was the only one that I could be mad at one moment but happy then next. Eventually he told me he didn’t understand why we fought all the time. So, I thought about it, I knew he was leaving, so I took a risk and told him how I felt about him. Part of me thought he felt the same way. He told me he didn’t know where this came from and that he only saw me as coworker and never thought of me that way because I am married. I took the words in and believed them at the time. Later I convinced myself he was lying to himself because his actions said otherwise every day we were together. I left the conversation we had about my feelings feeling better, finally get the closer I wanted. The next day we worked together and everything he said got throw out the window when I felt our chemistry together and the way he looked at me. I feel like actions say more than words. The past month we have gotten along a lot better but I still have a lot of emotional feelings when it comes to him. 

Anyway that all leads me to today, we don’t work together anymore. He got a job out of state, and I have to say goodbye to him. I cry all the time, work isn’t the same. I know it will get better eventually, but I know I will never forget him.  

Am I crazy? What is up?

perhaps you're my coach. Perhaps you're the town sherrif and I'm the daughter of someone influential/rich in town, or the town drunk's daughter?

How much leeway is there to fuck up in an interview like this?",interviewthrowawy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2uphul/my_amazon_phone_interview_experience_thoughts_how/,"So I am a 3rd year CS student and I don't have much tech interview experience. I recently did a phone interview with amazon for a software eng internship ( I passed that online coding test where you have to fix bugs and stuff). 

So, I was asked some knowledge questions based on the classes I have taken so far, and also 2 coding questions. For the knowledge questions, I was a little fuzzy on what a foreign key was in a database, but I think I explained it well enough for the interviewer, and I didn't know what a copy constructor was (strangely enough I never learned about this, and I relayed this to the interviewer), but all of the other questions I answered correctly (he asked about polymorphism, inheritance, differences in some programming languages, what a deadlock is). Then he asked me 2 coding questions, one about binary trees and another which made use of a hash table, both were relatively simple questions that I had seen in CTCI before. For both I wrote working code, but when he asked me to analyze the time complexity, at first I did it wrong, I had to get a couple hints from the interviewer to do it correctly. I also made a small syntax mistake in my second question, because I had to use a set ADT to solve the question. Since I use C++ in my interviews, I used the STL unordered_set container to do it (which is implemented internally as a hashtable from what I remember). I kind of messed up the syntax on how to check whether or not an element is in the unordered set or not (something with the end iterator or something), but it was very close, I was just missing a couple parenthesis. I relayed to the interviewer conceptually what I was doing while I was coding, and he agreed that the algorithm works. 

I have this nagging feeling I will fail though. I already failed a google interview, and I don't have that many other interviews lined up. granted in the google one I did do measurably worse, but still, I heard that incorrect syntax and stuff like I did can sometimes be a deal-breaker, and also the couple times I messed up analyzing the time complexity made me uneasy. The interviewer said I did pretty good at the end, the fact that I really need this internship makes me uneasy though, and I feel like others may have out performed me. What do you guys think, do I have a good shot? From what i have read around this subreddit, this phone interview is the final one, there are no others after this one. "

I'm about to graduate after Spring with a BS Computer Science.

I started out at my current internship doing development, adding and enhancing features / building from requirements. Then, I got interested in BDD and implemented a testing framework with Cucumber/Aruba. Lately, I've been writing cookbooks in Chef and provisioning environments on the cloud, picking up tools like Vagrant and infrastructure knowledge along the way. 

Are these skills desirable for a college grad? I've been applying to job postings and attending career fairs, but don't seem to be getting many responses - your input is appreciated."
2upk6f,44,2015-02-03,My family won't leave me alone about my dogs feeding schedule.,[deleted],dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/2upk6f/my_family_wont_leave_me_alone_about_my_dogs/,"I guess this is more of a rant than asking for advice but advice on how to get my point across to my family is welcome too.

Once my dog hit a year old he was getting a cup and 2/3 a day along with training treats and occasionally a bully stick. We kept at that for several months. He didn't get fat but he did gain two or three pounds so he wasn't looking quite as slim as usual.

Two or three months ago I got an internship with a professional dog trainer that helps train a lot of the cities K9 unit. One of the first things she taught me was I was over feeding him. All the dogs she trained were only trained with kibble and they only ate when they trained. Which was usually once a day.

It took a few days to get my dog to understand he only ate when we trained but as soon as he figured it out he got way more enthusiastic about training. His focus was better, he picked up on things quicker, and he slimmed down and looks incredible. You still can't see his ribs (Which I'm fine with) but he looks so much healthier since we started this. It's been two and a half, maybe three months, and he's doing great on his new schedule.

I hadn't told my family until recently because I'm planning a trip out of the country and need them to watch him. Ever since they found out about it they won't quit shooting me passive aggressive comments and dirty looks when someone mentions feeding their dogs.

And to top it all off they give him table scraps. ""Only little bits when I give some to the other dogs."" Which is still once every meal if I'm not home to stop them. I've explained a hundred times. He's a three legged dog. He can't gain weight . He needs to stay as slim as possible to keep up his quality of life. I watched her three-legged dog's leg give out and watched him fall over and over as he got older. I don't want that happening to my dog and no matter how many times I explain it they still slip him table scraps.

It drives me absolutely insane."
2upmyn,2,2015-02-03,"The ending of my [23 F] involvement with a [33 M] of 4 months, not doing too well",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2upmyn/the_ending_of_my_23_f_involvement_with_a_33_m_of/,"I apologize in advance for the length of this post, but back story is necessary and I really appreciate your time reading it because I could really use some advice.

A few months ago (late October) while I was doing an internship I got involved with a coworker. He told me he liked me, and the rest is history. We both agreed we didn't want anything serious- I knew I'd be leaving in January and I'd never had a boyfriend before, he had just recently broken up with his long-term 'girlfriend', and he also hooks up with multiple girls (mainly from work) at the same time. I agreed to the arrangement because I just wanted to have fun, but made it clear from the start that I would be different- I didn't want to be treated like ""just another girl,"" I'd call him out on his bullshit, and I didn't do casual sex but everything else was an option. He agreed to my terms, and that's where it started.

Basically, we were the epitome of that ""couple"" who when it was good, it was FRICKING GREAT, but when it was bad, WATCH OUT. Normally, we'd get into a random argument or he'd say something stupid to offend me, I'd get upset, he'd call and sweet talk me, I'd need a day to cool off, he'd ignore me, I'd send him sexy Snapchats and dirty texts to get his attention because I don't like being ignored, we'd talk it out again and he'd say all the right things, and I'd forgive him and take him back. This happened a few times, but when it was good it was just so good I couldn't help it. I'd make excuses for him, I'd defend him when people would talk about him at work (we kept it a secret for the most part), and we'd just repeat the process. One time he did go out of his way to drive back to work and see me and talk it out for like 2 hours after a particularly nasty fight, which basically ended with me begging him to agree to keep hooking up with me until I left a couple of weeks later. After that it was great once again.

Basically, I ended up falling in love with him. I saw we were more than FWB, less than BF/GF. We were pretty much best friends- at least I thought we were. I told him everything, including a really big secret that I'd never told anyone else. He was my first everything. He was so good at making me feel ""different"" and special most of the time and he always talked about how amazing I am and the way he looked at me and the things we did- it was amazing when he wanted it to be. I even ended up giving him my virginity (which was a big deal for me) right before I left because we decided that we'd be friends no matter what and that we'd always be in each other's lives. He talked about coming to see me at school and places he'd take me, he talked about how he wanted to stop hooking up with girls from work, and I really thought he was starting to change.

I got back to school and at first it was fine. We had one tiny little bump but it was worked out quickly. Then, one night we got into a text disagreement about dirty texts/Skype sex that I thought was a joke, he took it too far and got offended, and he said we just shouldn't talk on technology anymore. I thought he'd had a bad day and figured I'd give him time to cool off. He sent me on Snapchat, I replied, no response. I didn't want to be the one to give in anymore because I wanted him to miss me, not my body, so I waited. A couple days later he sent me a Snapchat but I couldn't answer because I had class, I check later and see he had defriended me on everything. I open the Snapchat, it was actually a really sweet song. That night, I found out through some other old coworkers that a girl he used to hook up with (who he knows I'm not a huge fan of) had visited and they spent a lot of time together. I was devastated, because he knows that I wanted to know when he was with another girl in case I called him- I didn't want to look needy or intrude on their time because I know how I'd feel if it happened to me. And he didn't tell me. So I was a wreck and talked to this girl who had reached out to me, and I found out that this girl he hooked up with also called my coworker at 2am to tell her that I'm a manstealing slut/whore/bitch and she hates me. She also told me that I had to be careful because he's a player and this is just what he does, and it wasn't real. I was extremely upset and then I got mad, and ended up having to have a friend come over and keep me company because I was having anxiety attacks.

The next day, he finally texts me and says he heard my friends from work were ""out for blood"" and that I had randomly called a girl from work crying and complaining about him. I told him I didn't complain about him and that I had spoken to the girl (after I made sure she was okay with him knowing we had talked) and I thought we should be adults about it and talk and not let what people say about us impact our opinion's of each other. He didn't seem to be too into it, but he agreed. He called me that night and things did not go well. The second he realized I wasn't going to cry and apologize for things I didn't do, he got nasty. He made it sound like we were never friends, he asked me if I really never thought there were other girls (which is silly, of course I did), he asked me if I ever really thought that I was different, and he called me a liar repeatedly. He talked over me and cut me off, and when I finally got a chance to speak and said I wanted to have my questions answered he said no, I said ""F--- you,"" and he hung up on me. We haven't spoken since.

I'm a wreck. I cry all the time. I'm so angry. I want to slap him, I want to scream, I want to tell him how horrible he is. But I can't. I don't want him to know that I've been thinking about him. Everyone tells me I have to just let it go and move on but I can't. I need closure. I want revenge. I'm mad because I know he's probably moved on with a bunch of other girls and not thinking about me, meanwhile I'm lonely and sexually frustrated and furious with him for treating me like that and for myself for believing him and allowing him to treat me that way. I know parts of it were real- no matter how good of a player he is there were things he couldn't have faked. I just don't know how much he really liked me. I never wanted to change him but I respected that he wanted to change himself, I didn't expect him to marry me, I just thought we'd always be friends (who occasionally had really good sex). But now I don't know where we stand. I want him to remember me, I want him to know he screwed with the wrong girl, but I still love him. I don't want him to win. I had to come home from school for the weekend because I was crying so much and it was breaking my mom's heart- and she doesn't even know I had sex with him, then she'd really flip. I feel like he has so much power over me from so far away, and I can't have any power over him when I'm not with him and tempting him. I don't know what to do. I want to tell him exactly how I feel and how mad I am and how hurt and betrayed I feel, but I don't want him to know how much time I've spent thinking about him. My mom says the best revenge is living well, but I don't think he cares about me at all anymore. My therapist said he's a 13-year old and I shouldn't talk to him. I know he isn't worth it and I deserve better (he's a selfish, egotistical narcissist), I deserve someone who will fight for me for once, and he's even said that- but I cannot accept that it's over and not on my terms. Please help me. Should I call him? Should I wait until my Spring Break when I can maybe try to go see him? Should I ignore him like he ignores me and try to move on- even though that doesn't seem to be working? I just need closure. I need to tell him. I just don't know.

Thank you.

TLDR: Not really in a relationship (about 4 months) but I loved him, ended on a really bad note, and I need closure so I can move on but I don't know how.

2upuhc,1,2015-02-03,"Family wants to buy a house, and essentially have us pay the mortgage.",binyahousing,RealEstate,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/2upuhc/family_wants_to_buy_a_house_and_essentially_have/,"Me and my fiance (and two small children), are in tough spot financially. We are currently renting a small two bedroom house for $600 (this doesn't include any utilities). I am attending school full time, in a rigorous program that warrants a large amount of time spent at school and dedicated time outside of class (on campus ~40 hours a week, with an additional 10-15 hours or more dedicated to homework outside of that). This doesn't leave me a lot of time outside of schooling to hold a steady job so we rely on loans, scholarship, and side jobs/projects for income. Also, not the greatest credit... TLDR: Limited budget, bad credit

My family, friends really that I consider family, know of our current situation and have graciously and generously offered to help us out. What they have proposed it to purchase a home including down payment and have us pay the mortgage on the home. This will save us money on rent and will put us in a situation to have a stable house, closer to university, and closer to potential long term career positions/momentary internships.... TLDR: Family offered to purchase house, have us pay mortgage.

The issue we have run into so far is that since my family member, who extended the offer, is a business owner, if he purchases another home and does not live there, it will be considered an income property and will raise his taxes significantly. Since he owns a fairly large company with several branches, this can be problematic since his yearly income is 100,000-200,000. 

We looked into having the mortgage be put directly into my name, thinking we could just sign it over to me, but it's not quite that simple and I would have to directly qualify for the same mortgage, which I will not be able to do. I plan on taking over the mortgage fully in the next few years once I graduate and build my credit back up some. (will be graduating next year and am almost guaranteed a position at $50,000-70,000 with a good increase within 4 years)

So after all of that info, I am going to leave a few questions and see if anyone here would be able to answer, or lead me in the right direction, have any ideas or any insights to offer. 

- Does anyone know of a way that he may be able to purchase a home, and have us pay the mortgage/taxes on the home, without having it qualify as an income property?

- Is there any way for him to sign the mortgage over to us, without having to fully qualify for the loan? (I can pay for the mortgage monthly, but don't have a steady income or good credit)

- Any other useful or relevant information to offer up?


TLDR: Family offered to buy house and have us pay mortgage. Can't sign over mortgage to me because I won't qualify. Family member doesn't want to have significant raise in taxes due to additional income property.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

I moved from an apartment where I was living alone, and she moved from an apartment where she was living with her boyfriend.

The boyfriend(BF) was not on our new lease as he could not afford the one bedroom that they were living in together, much less this much nicer new apartment. In their previous apartment, RM was paying for all living expenses/rent as BF was unemployed. This caused quite a bit of resentment and they were on the cusp of breaking up. BF currently technically lives with his parents, who live about a mile away.


BF now has a part time job and a 1day/week internship and his and RM relationship has stabilized. This has resulted in him being over EVERY.SINGLE. NIGHT. He is honestly in the apartment more than I am as I work 45-50 hour work weeks and he hangs out after RM leaves for work as well.

The problem is, I really like this guy and RM and I are good friends. RM has discussed having him move in, which I am totally fine with, but he cannot afford the 5-600$/month share of rent. If I didn't like him, I would feel comfortable saying ""he cannot use common spaces without paying rent"" or ""he can only be over 4 nights per week"".

I don't necessarily care that he is here, just that he is not paying his share. He is good about helping out around the house, taking out trash etc., and is respectful. If he cooks he offers me a share. Again, I LIKE this guy and don't want him feeling like he can't come over here or needs to hide from me. I just feel resentful financially as I am very frugal and he and RM eat out 5-6 night, though I believe RM may subsidize him. It may be worth noting that RM, despite making a decent salary, is not very budget minded and lives right at her means (lots of shopping, not much saving). If I mention ways that he COULD afford living here (picking up extra shifts, reducing luxury spending) it of course would not sit well.


He does not store much of his stuff here (he has his xbox here) but he doesn't really need much stuff--he cycles through the same 3 outfits and doesn't seem to go home very much--and he doesn't have a key.
To compromise, I'm thinking it would be fair to ask for:

*300$ rent

*1/3 utilities

For reference, rent is 1700. Utilities about 120/month. BF and RM share the master bedroom with an attached bath. According to the splitwise rent calculator, they should each be paying 525 each.

Ever since I was little, I knew that I wanted to become a programmer when I grew up. I built my first PC in grade school, then during my undergrad I paid for school by building PCs (Hackintoshing was particularly profitable). In school, I dove into my programming classes, did all the internships I could, and now I'm living my dream as a developer. And since this subreddit is the ""PC Master Race,"" I'd think many people here would share similar sentiments. 

... Except that doesn't seem to be the case. From what I've seen, neither are many here at /r/pcmasterrace developers or software engineers nor do they have any intention of entering that type of field. It seems like many people here have yet to even write one line of code. What's even more unsettling is that there seems to be a negative attitude toward developers in general. Developers are often painted as the PCMR's enemy despite the fact that they're the ones who make it all possible! In contrast, many of the people that PCMR idolize have nothing to do with actually creating the software we all use and love. 

That said, I'd like to encourage all of you, especially those who are still in school, to seriously consider learning how to program and maybe even consider majoring in computer science and entering the software field. If you're intimidated and don't know where to begin, here's a little secret: Programming is *easy*! I mean, it can become very difficult, but the fundamentals are something anyone can grasp. I recommend checking out http://codecademy.com and going through their Python course. You can also check out subreddits like /r/programming or /r/learnprogramming for more resources. "

The roommate, who we will call Robin (because I was just watching Robin Hood: Men In Tights this weekend) and I were placed together as roommates our sophomore year of college and ended up getting along pretty well, so we've stuck together since. While we were only cordial and respectful the first two years, we became pretty close and ended up getting an apartment our senior year. Robin started dating Marian his junior year, I started seeing her around and always liked her. Whereas Robin is a bit of an athletic bro-y type with a pre-law focus in Political Science, both Marian and I are more bookish, had the same STEM major, and had some classes together our senior year. 

This probably sounds like this is heading for the Bermuda Love Triangle, so let me assure you first that Marian and I never have had any flirtation going on and that she is super sweet, very cheerful, and not very funny, and I only go for wry, whiskey-drinking, bitter types for some godforsaken reason (though that's a post for another day). 

After we graduated, Robin and I were pleased to discover we were planning to move to the same major US East Coast city and looked for an apartment together. Marian stayed behind because an internship turned into an offer, but a year later (2012) she followed and we switched to a two-bedroom-junior-third-bedroom (ie a 2 bedroom with a tiny, tiny third room we use as a guest room), with Robin and Marian getting the bigger room and us splitting the rent three-ways. 

Sometimes they have couples arguments and they each have started sort of going to me, and I should have stopped this as soon as it began, but to be honest, it was kind of flattering and until now I've been able to just say ""You're a dick, apologize"" to one of them and they've generally agreed. In fact, they both have said they've argued less and less since I've made them see things from each other's POV. So yay for that.

Anyway, this past weekend, Robin and Marian went back to Robin's hometown, which is several hours away by car. They stayed at his parent's house, but he basically has free reign when he's back there. Robin has a bunch of bro-y friends from high school who I genuinely think are both a fucking fantastic time to hang out with and some of the worst, most offensive, least responsible people I've ever met. Marian gets on well with these guys but in small doses, so she rolled her eyes at me a few times before leaving, since we're on the same page when it comes to the high school friends, but it wasn't a big deal.

When they came back on Sunday they were upset. Neither of them seemed in the mood to talk, so I left them alone, and Marian slept in the guest bedroom. Last night, I got the story out of him, and I was so furious, I was planning to tell Marian to move out that night. My buddy said that basically, sometime on Saturday night, he and Marian were discussing leaving and she said she would drive. Marian does not currently have a license, only a permit, so my buddy said he would drive. Marian got really mad, yelled at him in front of their friends, told him he was drunk and slapped him and took the keys from his hand. When he got to the car, she was sitting in the driver's seat. Apparently they argued the whole way home, then went to sleep, and then drove back in the morning in relative silence.

Then tonight, after I'd told Robin to break up with her because she got physical with him and was feeling sick around her, she broke down crying and asked if he spoke to me. I said yes, and she asked if she could tell me her side of the story. I reluctantly said yes.

First thing, she admits to slapping him, but then backs the story up and told me that Robin was wasted when they left. She said that she had been hinting all night at the fact that if he was going to keep drinking, she was fine with it, but she was going to drive, and he seemed to accept this as fact. So she didn't worry when he took a few shots with his buddies or when he grabbed another beer, and he was 6-7 deep when it was time to roll. Except he wouldn't give her the keys. She says she slapped him when he tried to walk past her to the door because she couldn't figure out another way to get the keys from him, as she is around five feet tall and like 100 lbs and he is pretty tall and big. Then she ran to the car and got in so that he couldn't drive and drove them home.

When Chris got home, I told him I spoke to Marian and asked him how much he drank, and he claimed he only had maybe three drinks. He took a shot and had two beers. He pointed out to me that he's never had a DUI and that I've never seen him exhibit bad judgment when drunk. True, but I've never seen Marian exhibit bad judgment much either, and we're coming up on three years of living with all three of us together.

I'm definitely unhappy with how this went down, either way - even if he only had three drinks, he shouldn't be driving if he has a sober driver there to help, and she should never, ever get physical. They're still being cold to one another and I'm trying to let it work itself out, but my name is on the lease and I'd rather not let this situation become a ""please choose me!"" thing if one decides to move out. I also just want to know if there's a way I could potentially help my friends through a difficult time, even if I think one or both of them is being a dick.



---   
**tl;dr**: I don't blame you for this being too long if you skipped to this: roommate and his girlfriend were at a party and something went down. They both say he was drinking some and that he was going to drive home, and they both say that she got physical and grabbed the keys, but each of them make themselves sound less to blame. At best, I want to know what I can do to help the, and at worst, I need to know what I should do in a potential break-up since the apartment is under my name. "
2uqiqy,3,2015-02-04,Stoned in Paradise (don't know how to get out),socalsmoker,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/2uqiqy/stoned_in_paradise_dont_know_how_to_get_out/,"	Long time lurker, first time poster. I'm using a throwaway cause I'm paranoid like that, but have been routinely checking the site out of curiosity for about 3 years. 
	Quick back story. I don't know if this matters or not but here ya go. I was born in the midwest and moved out to California when I was 13. Went from being the popular kid in junior high to not knowing anyone and basically being outcast by all the other students at my school. The next few years consisted of moving from school to school, friend group to friend group and drug to drug. I actually didn't start out smoking weed, instead pursuing pharmaceutical (legal) highs and soon thereafter psychedelics. Eventually, following about 3 years of ""experimenting""- nothing over 4 times (except mushrooms which was like 7 times). My usage of these substances I attribute to just wanting to get away from reality as a young teen. Eventually though I got a little burnt out on everything and resorted to sticking to plain old mary J as my ""replacement"" drug. Sort of like a crutch I used to mentally get over the urge to use other mind alternating substances. 
	Ok, so back to the present. 22, on the verge of my 23rd birthday. Somehow all the effects of my drug escapades I have managed to stay on some kind of track in life that I perceive as going in the ""right direction."" 2 Semesters away from graduating college, Internship with a top company, good relationship with parents (although I still live at home), close the beach, surf, hang out with friends. Yea, Life is good.
	The problem is, I feel like I'm ever able to fully commit to something, as if there's something on the horizon that I am waiting for. I attribute this ""comfortable"" or ""lukewarm"" demeanor towards life to smoking. I look back and the days of my youth and they fade together in a blur. I have never been fond of this particular side effect of weed, however, I found that the solution to deadening the emotion that is there to really kick you ""into gear"" is to just smoke more weed! 
	So now I will explain my thought process as to why I can still smoke weed. Nowadays, I am able to smoke more weed because I got a ""prescription,"" for it. I am able to smoke weed because I know that I will always have the financial support to get more. I can smoke weed because it helps me cover up my insecurities and the nature that I am horribly afraid of revealing if I were to somehow escape this cloud i'm in. I smoke weed because I have trouble sleeping without it (even though I drink a shit ton of caffeine and my sleep schedule is fucked because of it.) And finally, the last reason I can think of is that I can smoke weed because I am doing what I ""need"" to be doing to succeed in life.
	As you have probably noticed none of these are reasons that I should be smoking weed (except maybe #1, but not in my case), yet I keep. fucking. doing it. day after day, year after year. No remorse, no shame in the fact that i'm usually doing it on my parents dime, behind their backs, for more than 5 years now. No lessened pride knowing that weed has dramatically affected my performance in school, or my ability to deepen or even maintain the relationships with the people I love. I should stress the fact that by societies standards I'm doing well, however, smoking weed every day for the past five years, aside from everything else I did to my body, certainly doesn't help the cause. 
 I'm tired and burnt out and ready for change. I feel as though my career and future relationships will suffer if I don't stop. 
	I know there's not a one size fits all answer to my situation, or anyone's situation for that matter. I'm not even sure what I'm asking of you. I guess by posting here I may become more aware of myself and my situation, although any insights or strategies on how to face myself and my addiction would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

2uqprk,2,2015-02-04,Got a job in QA straight out of college almost a year ago. I can't stand it anymore and I don't know what to do.,samuraichikx,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2uqprk/got_a_job_in_qa_straight_out_of_college_almost_a/,"Hello /r/cscareerquestions, I'm in a bit of a conundrum right now and I would very much appreciate some input on it. I have a lot on my mind right now, so this is going to be a bit of a wall of text. I apologize.

I graduated with a BS in Computer Science in March of 2014 from a local ""public ivy"" (For what it's worth). I have been working at my position in Mobile SQA for about 11 months at a large company at its' global headquarters.

I should probably state that my previous experience (aside from my first minimum wage job in college) was primarily in front end web development (HTML, CSS, Javascript) with some back end (Python,Node.js, MySQL) at a small marketing firm, whose owner is a long time family friend whom I used to babysit for. He offered me the job after my sophomore year in college and I kept it for about a year and a half before applying to this job. The reason being was that I felt that I wasn't very useful to the company, as it felt like there simply wasn't much for me to do. I spent most of my working hours reading programming tutorials online for game engines or other languages. I also felt like I wanted a larger company environment (this company was max maybe 15 people), so that I could actually spend lunch with someone instead of eating alone at my desk.

My current job, as I said, is involved in Mobile SQA. Without going into much detail I will say that I work for a large international corporation whose flagship product is nothing close to Mobile. The product I work on primarily involves mobile device cameras. 

The position I originally applied for was ""Associate Quality Assurance Engineer - Mobile Automation"". As my friend at the company was heavily involved in coding an automation practices, I was under the assumption that I would be coding almost 100% of the time. When I started, this was not the case, which arguably should have been my first red flag.

I understand that there needs to be a learning curve, and the new people need to get used to the existing software, but for the first four months I was there I practically did no coding whatsoever. We were tasked with manually testing 70+ Android/iOS devices. I tried as hard as I could to push for Automation. I even spent a little extra time after work some getting some Junit tests set up, because during normal working hours, my boss wouldn't have it. Claiming ""we're too busy"" to implement automation. It's been almost a year and I'm finally able to implement some automation after the department got slammed by the CEO for not having any, but of course it takes a back seat to the manual testing that NEEDS to be done. After a time I was able to convince my boss to let me develop some of our test apps. I originally started with only Android development but was able to quickly transition to be able to do iOS as well. 

For the first I would say 4-5 months after I was hired, it was tolerable my coworkers (for the most part) are friendly and I get along with them well. After that point, though, things started to take a turn. To give you an idea:

1. Micromanagement is a huge problem. I am consistently told the same thing three times by three different people, and I'm too afraid to take a longer bathroom breaks (maybe 10 minutes?) lest I get yelled at by my immediate boss. Our VP is essentially acting like our Product Manager, often throwing out existing requirements for new ones. There is no official time for us to arrive (nothing was told to us) but if you arrive anywhere outside the window of about 9:30, shit hits the fan
1. The management team is completely numbers driven. To a point now where when American developers leave, we're replacing them with outsourced resources, despite numerous times in the past they have shown that they simply cannot deliver a working product. Usually whatever they give us has to be completely rewritten, and as a consequence, we're even further behind

1.  Management has absolutely no idea what realistic expectations are. We shortened our development cycle by about half the time, yet they still put the same number of requirements in product, and then wonder why everyone is behind. 
1. Overtime is an absolute must. Now, I'm not completely naieve. I understand that a product needs to be shipped and if backtracks happen or if something takes longer than you initially anticipated, you may need to work extra. What I can't stand is that they regularly put guilt trips on the ENTIRE staff to work the weekends just to get shit out faster and please the Executives. I would say every week on average  would be 45-50 hours, depending on how close to release we are

I can honestly say that I cannot stand the QA work.  I guess I feel useful, and obviously QA is a very essential part of the development process, but when we need to do a pass of manual regression I feel like I am just wasting my life. I'm not bad at the job, but it's not fulfilling – at all. I feel like I am not using my degree  (90% of the coding I do now is from home on my own projects), and I feel much more enjoyment from fixing bugs than I do finding them. 

Further, I felt like I gave up on my dreams way too quickly. The original reason I wanted to get into Computer Science was to do game development. (Yes, I know). I applied for an internship at a local, well known game studio during my Junior year, and after I was rejected I was too afraid to apply to any of their positions again. I recently became good friends with someone who works there, and they were nice enough to give me an internal recommendation to several positions, all of which I have applied for an am waiting for a response. 

I fully realize that the positions I am applying for are really competitive, but I like to believe I have even a small chance to land an interview. I have made several side projects in my free time and have started to really study interview and language questions so that if something happens, I'm prepared. I also realize the average salary for game development is, on average, lower than industry standard. Where arguably my company pays higher than industry average. But I realized recently ( as sappy as this may sound) that having more money means less to me than coming home fulfilled each day.

Meanwhile, the boss as my old company (Front End Web Dev) recently reached out to me (regarding some paperwork that wasn't taken care of when I left). Because he is a family friend, I let it slip to him that I wasn't very happy with my current job. His response was essentially “When you get tired of QA,  you should get back into Dev and get in touch”.

Unfortunately, the company that I applied to has a notoriously long waiting period between when you apply and if/when they contact you, so If I say yes to this, and if they happen to be interested in me, there's that complication.

I guess I'm just not sure if wanting to leave is me being too greedy, too naieve, or what. I understand there is a certain corporate culture that exists, but is it really THIS bad? 

Should I wait to see if I get a response from company A? Should I ask the development manager if he'd be willing to take on a junior developer? How long can I reasonably wait until I basically get shoe horned into a QA position for the rest of my career? I don't necessarily regret joining this company as I have and continue to learn new things, but not nearly as often as I like, and the main QA work is really beginning to wear on me.

Thank you if you read this far. Sorry for the wall of text and sorry if I seem like I'm being too spoiled or greedy. I would just really appreciate some advice.

TL;DR: Can't stand QA, Company culture is garbage. I want out, but how?

2uqpwk,4,2015-02-04,(23m) I'm going to america to see my gf(23f) who i havn't seen in 3 months. The lady she is staying with doesn't approve of me staying at the house,boobooyum,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2uqpwk/23m_im_going_to_america_to_see_my_gf23f_who_i/,"Ok sorry guys the title is misleading. I couldn't fit the whole story in the comment. It's not too long but i need to fill you all in on some of the details so you get a good perspective.

Basically my gf has been living with this lady (in her 50's) in her house, who owns this manufacturing company. Lets call her Lindy. My gf is interning at this company as an accountant. Lindy is very well off. She is also divorced. 

So basically i booked flights to see my gf about a week ago, and told her 2 days after. I arrive in 3 weeks time. She was excited and all that, but found out once informing lindy about my plans,  that she had already booked tickets for my gf  and her to go to Miami for 9 days. They leave 5 days after I arrive. The pickle here is that she wil get back the day i'm supposed to leave.

They plan to stay at a holiday house that Lindy owns. The son is also going (21/m), and will be meeting up with Lindy's friends whilst there. 

Side story: Initially i was actually going to not tell my gf as a surprise, but i ended up just telling her that i was coming, mainly because reddit convinced me. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2u6rct/m23_is_it_a_bad_idea_to_surprise_my_ld_gf_23f_by/

But before i did tell her, i thought it would be a good idea to contact Lindy via email, in which i told her i was going to come over to surprise gf, and asked her not to tell gf, and to make sure she wouldn't be doing anything on the day of my arrival (i arrive on the saturday). I thought it would be a good idea to give her notice as well.



My initial thought was to pay for tickets to go with them to Miami, paying for my own flights. I suggested this to the gf, and she said she'd talk to Lindy about it.

So a day later, gf tells me that Lindy isn't happy about me coming, and doesn't want me to come to miami. In my gf's words, Lindy said 'what so he's just going to crash here', and things like 'can he just go and do his own thing'. She's also annoyed that I informed them with such short notice.

Gf says that it's because Lindy had plans to do stuff with her. Fair enough imo. The only thing that doesn't add up about that argument is 1. It's not just going to be them two alone. Sure they mite do a few things just with them two, but my bet is the majority of the time they will be chilling with other people as well 2. They have been living with each other for the past 3 months. Like how much bonding time do you really want. Gf rebutall to that is they only really hang out around work and don't get much time with just the two of them. But i mean she goes out to dinner with her most weekends/days and go to the movies sooo many times. most weekends in fact. Sometimes twice on the weekend.

 She was also apparently not happy about my email. I'm not sure what specifically about, but i think it was because it was probably a stupid/irresponsible suggestion.


Now here's what i can't comprehend. 

Lindy knows i am gf's long term bf (5years). She knows I haven't seen her in 3 months. She now knows that I am coming to America. She knows I have offered to pay for flights to come to miami. But..... she's like 'no he can do his own thing while we go to my holiday house for a 9 days'... I just don't get that. Wouldn't any normal person be ore accomadating. I mean I am just flying half way across the globe.


My defense:

I know this whole situation sounds scroungy, with me just being bitter about not being able to stay at someones holiday house. GIVE ME FREE STUFF. I just want to say that I am very aware that this is what it could look like, and so I have even said that i'm willing to pay for all living expenses to Lindy. I've been working full time so i can pay for this holiday, and so i'm going to have a fair bit saved up by the time i get to america. Money isn't an issue for me, i just want to spend time with GF, (if i had to i'd pay for my own place nearby to where they are) and i actually wanted to meet Lindy, whom the love of my life has been living with for all this time.

So the question is, reddit, is it me or is this lady being unreasonably unwelcoming? Factoring everything i have just said. Would you say no if it was you? 

PLEASE: Don't write comments about ideas for changing/cancelling flights. These are options i'm currently thinking about, but i just want to hear opinions about Lindy's reaction.

I will link a previous posting I made three months ago that goes into the problem more, but basically, my husband and I are in a long-distance relationship. He lives in Germany, I in The Netherlands. My mother went through a depressive episode after an accident in the US, and after a threat of suicide, we moved her to Germany (her home country) with the plan of her getting medical and government help to get her back on her feet. We spent a lot of money that we had saved for our wedding on moving her as she refused to leave without a lot of her belongings. We’re talking thousands of dollars spent on shipping. The plan was for her to stay with my husband for a maximum of two months while she gets the help she needs to find her own apartment. After receiving a generous amount of help for an apartment along with free health insurance, she is still living on my husbands couch after 9 months. Every time I try to talk about it with her, she screams, tantrums, curses, sulks and ignores me for weeks on time. If you want to read more on that read this last post. http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2m3wyh/need_help_my_mother_curses_at_me_calls_me_names/

Basically, I will be moving back for an internship in less than 8 weeks. The plan was to live with my husband (naturally). However, my mother is no closer to finding her own place. I am very concerned that by the time I return, she will still be on his couch still not any closer to moving out. She is basically preventing me from moving in with my husband out of pure selfishness and passivity. The apartment is tiny: comfortable for a couple, cramped for a man and his mother-in-law, absolutely catastrophic for a man, his wife and his mother-in-law. I have to contemplate staying with a friend instead, and that is unfair. She is selfish and childish, and it's wearing thin. 

I don’t know how to finish this letter to her to get my point across to her. Any help would be appreciated. (Names and places have been omitted.)


""Dear Mom,

I really want to stress the point that you find your apartment before I move back, which will be in 8 weeks. I'm becoming even more concerned as I'm not hearing from you about the search or viewings of apartments (something we discussed over Christmas). I have only heard of one viewing, which I orchestrated for you, and I didn't even hear about the viewing directly from you but second-hand. I see that you’re not taking the necessary steps to find a place, and it worries me. What makes it even worse, is that any mention of an apartment search is met with a stony silence, sulkiness or tantrum on your part. 

 Your lack of motivation to search for an apartment is forcing me to consider the option of staying with a friend instead of being able to move in with my husband. You have to realize that this is unfair to me and unfair to him. We helped you move to Germany with all of your belongings. You have lived with my husband for an unexpected nine months as we thought you would only need a place to stay for two months, maybe even three. The fact that you have only been to four viewings in that entire nine months is shocking. I am frustrated with your lack of motivation and I feel that because of your passivity and lack of motivation, you are irreparably harming our relationship to each other. ""

All the other guys have been talking to her and she seems nice from what I overhear.  They are all 40+ year old Engineers with families so it's not like they are doing anything but talking to the cute girl at work but it shows she definitely gets a lot of attention.

I am unsure how to approach her.  I feel like after a few months of not doing anything and just buying lunch and going about my day I've made it too apparent that I'm not interested even though I am and am just unsure how to approach.  I think I may have become creepy in her eyes.

I think the interest was there to start but I don't notice it any more.

What should I do?

Extra details that may or may not help.

I swear she looks into my eyes for just a moment too long when checking me out for food.  Maybe it's my imagination because she has big brown eyes that I like a lot.

I walked past her relatively recently to try to slowly work my way out of being a creep.  I just said hi as I walked past her and back to my desk but she didn't say hi back that I could hear.  She saw it was me and looked back to her work quickly.

I like to learn math, make the occasional thing out of C#, make little games with my programmer brother for fun, and make the occasional website. Anyway, I'm not done with my IR degree yet and was wondering if a minor in CS (which I could accomplish with NO DEBT) is enough to get a job?


After I get a job, I would then seek to go back to my current school or an online program and get a B.S. in computer science. Will I need to get a full degree, or do you think I should just go ahead and (take on the debt to) get the full degree? I know I'll need (and want!) one to advance easily in the future.


Weighing the pros and cons or getting a B.S. now, and I don't know what to do. It will take me 3 more years if I tack on a B.S. at my current university which is known (but not famous Stanford/MIT/etc. level) for math/CS, or 1 year online at Oregon State. Either way it will add ~$26,000 of debt (I currently only have $5,500 debt). I just want to make a wise decision with my time/money/etc.

I've read the other questions about a CS minor and it doesn't look too promising. The answers vary wildly, just like they do with autodidacts.

Bonus Question: I could change my degree track from a foreign relations one to foreign trade/business ... would this look better to future employers, in your opinion?

TL;DR: Is a CS minor enough to get a job? Or should I Just go ahead and do the BS now?

THANK YOU!

I've had a technical internship before (actually with the same company, but a different division) but I didn't have to take a programming interview for it.

To sum it up, I haven't studied as much as I should have (I am abroad this semester) and I'm not sure how it's going to go. I know it's not the end of the world if I miserably and embarrassingly fail but that never feels good. I've taken data structures (a year ago) and practiced up to halfway through Stacks and Queues in Cracking the Coding Interview, and if given enough time I can think my way through a programming problem, even if my answer is a bit messy. 

However, this technical interview isn't like most others (rote programming tests), in that you are asked about services like REST, maybe some SQL, and Java nuances. I mainly program in Java, but realistically I Google a lot when I am writing code to remember how to do minuscule things that I forget (things like converting from Object to int, specific functions for Collections, easy things that I take for granted, I don't have a lot remembered).

Since I've never had a tech. interview before I'm not sure what I'm allowed to do as an interviewee. Is it acceptable if I say something along the lines of ""Well Mr. Interviewer, I know I want to append this character to the end of my ArrayList, but I can't remember that silly ol' function, can you help me out?""

Or if I'm asked a question like ""What would final written in front of a method mean in Java"" and don't know the answer can I say ""I really don't know, but can I make an educated guess?""

Thanks for the advice, I really appreciate it, and here's to getting some real interview experience!

I was fortunate to receive internship offers from both Google (Mountain View) and Microsoft.

With Google I would be building a internal web portal. The project itself is not bad, end to end web dev and data visualization. The team also seems pretty cool.

With Microsoft I would be working on something within Office related to the cloud. I would be choosing a project from back end services, front end user experience, data analytics, etc. 

I like the options Microsoft gives (I only have web dev experience), but the team/product itself doesn't seem that exciting. I don't mind doing more web dev either.

Here's how I currently weigh the two (mostly based on what I read/hear, please feel free to correct me):

Microsoft

- better work life balance?
- statistically higher chance of return offer (kind of nice since I dread interviewing)
- variety of projects

Google

- more exciting company and team
- slightly better on my resume?

I've also been told that Microsoft's best days are over, they're going downhill, etc. and Google is a better place to start out after college (the internship obviously gives me a good shot at a full time offer). Is there any basis to this?

I'm looking for any feedback, experience, or other advice that would help me make a decision. I'm a junior so beyond the internship itself, I'm also considering which company I would rather work at full time (assuming I get a return offer). Sorry for the somewhat long post and thanks for reading."
2usb3i,3,2015-02-04,"Company continued to deposit paychecks after termination, requests more money back than what was sent. Help!",romman00,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2usb3i/company_continued_to_deposit_paychecks_after/,"A friend of mine worked at a company as an intern until December 15th, 2014. They accidentally direct deposited 2 additional paychecks, $2250 (net) each: one on December 31, another on January 15. She repeatedly let the company know that she had received accidental additional deposits, and she would like to repay them the money they sent her.

They finally got back to her today and sent an invoice, declaring she owes them $5250. $3000 (gross - FICA taxes) for the first paycheck, and $2250 for the second paycheck. When she asked them why this was the case, they responded with just the following:

&gt; **Gross amount vs. Net amount deposited**
&gt; 
&gt;  Please note that the amounts are calculated over the gross amounts paid and not over the net amounts deposited on your bank account. *The reason is that when the employees select a repayment option through payroll deductions*, the amount to be deducted reduces the taxable earnings so the taxes are balanced during the year that the overpayment occurred.
&gt; 
&gt; For instance, if you decide to pay $500 per paycheck and your semi-monthly gross earnings are for $2,000, the taxes would be calculated only over $1,500 until the debt is repaid in full. In this way your taxes would be settled during 2014.
&gt; 
&gt; The outstanding balance will be reported as income and you will be required to pay taxes over that overpayment. You will be able to recover the tax portion, however, this will tax place on your 2016 tax return.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; **FICA taxes explanation**
&gt; 
&gt; The reason why we are charging the gross amount minus FICA taxes is that when repayment takes place on a subsequent year, the amount to be recovered will be the gross overpayment minus any FICA taxes withheld on the overpaid paycheck(s). This procedure is in accordance with American Payroll Association best practices.
&gt; 
&gt; According to the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) wages are to be taxed in the year the employee has active or constructive use of the funds; therefore, if the employee repays the overpayment in a later year, the amount of the repayment cannot be excluded from the employee’s income for the year in which the overpayment took place (W2 Boxes 1-2; 15-20).
  
I think the company is in error, and she should only owe them $4500. In the first paragraph, they say ""The reason is that when the employees select a repayment option through payroll deductions""; she is not repaying through payroll deductions, but from her bank account.

Is this right? If anyone has any input or needs more details, please let me know! Thanks!"

So I am lucky enough to have been offered the opportunity to spend a year in Minneapolis as a research intern at the University of Minnesota Medical School. I'm super excited about living in a city I've heard such great things about, but I'm definitely looking to adequately prepare myself for the transition.

I am a 22/F medical student (currently 2nd year, this internship will be a ""gap year"" between my 2nd and 3rd years). I was born and raised in New Jersey, and have never lived outside of the state. I visited Minneapolis for the first time this past year, when I attended a conference at UMN in December. 

I will be looking to live in Minneapolis from approximately August 2015 - May 2016. Obviously, moving from NJ to MN is going to be a huge adjustment, so I thought I'd ask you guys for some advice.

1. Not sure as of yet if my internship will be providing me with housing, but if not, where should I be looking at apartments? I am not really into the whole wild college party scene, but I do enjoy going out to bars with a bit more of a chill/dive atmosphere. I also am looking forward to experiencing the queer/alternative Minneapolis scene. I'm not sure how much where I live will influence being able to experience these things, but I'd love to have some proximity to coffee shops/bars/etc, while being close enough to ensure a reasonable commute to the UMN med school. I've never really had the experience of living in a big city where everything is accessible, so I'm looking forward to being able to do so.
2. Speaking of having a car, any recommendations on this? The lease on my current car is up in August, so I am looking to buy a used car to take to Minneapolis with me. I obviously want something that can handle the ice/snow that you guys get. My family friend is recommending a Jeep Cherokee/Toyota Rav4.
3. Clothing! Since I will be here during the winter, I'm already starting to think about what types of outerwear/accessories I should start acquiring. I'm used to/prepared for temperatures in the teens and above, but I am slightly nervous for MN weather. From what I've heard boots-wise, I think I'll be getting a pair of LL Bean boots (feel free to offer other suggestions). For a winter coat, though, I'm still pretty undecided. All of the brands that I know are good (e.g. Canada Goose) are also super-expensive. I am willing to invest a few hundred dollars in a high-quality jacket that I can see lasting many years, but I'm really not sure what brands or styles I should be looking at. Or if there are any suggestions for catching a sale on the more expensive coats, please share!
4. General tips/advice?

Thanks so much in advance for the help!"

Is transferring a possibility, hopefully in first year? If so, how early can I transfer? The co-op program at UW sounds wonderful compared to the PEY at UofT. 

For example, having co-op from UW industry contacts after 1B and then continually throughout my education would be a very enlightening experience as to what real work is like. In comparison, UofT has their co-op at the very end and it's usually just at one location, much less of a chance to try out what I like. 

Also, if I had a good co-op rotation that I really enjoyed during my undergrad, I could tailor my course selection to mirror that career path. I know you can get internships over the summer, but how often does a UofT undergrad get the chance to work at a big company, like many Waterloo students do (or so I've heard)."

Are there any certifications I should go after? I am pretty confident in Excel and the Data Analysis Toolpak, and have a decent understanding of SPSS as well. Is there any other software I should start learning? Are there common starting jobs for people looking to work their way up in the field, or is it simply a ""graduate and get into the field""? I am not averse to taking on internships, but they all seem to be dedicated to current students, which leaves me out.

I was afraid that hiring managers see my psych degree and assume it has no relevance to the field, so I've been including educational experience in data analysis on my resume. Some people tell me that's a terrible idea, other people say it's the best approach for someone in my position. I've tried both ways and it never results in an interview. I have a solid GPA, and a background as a teaching assistant and research assistant, so I am confused about why I am not receiving any call-backs at all.

2uswbk,9,2015-02-04,[For Hire] I can teach you Web Development from scratch at $100/week.,[deleted],forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/2uswbk/for_hire_i_can_teach_you_web_development_from/,"**What I'm offering**

I shall be your personal tutor and mentor over the period of time I teach you. I shall communicate with you using Skype/Hangouts. We shall be using a collaborative code editor and an online whiteboard alongside a voice chat. I shall begin by teaching you the basics of making a static website.

There's an important distinction for potential learners to understand: the difference between a web site and a web application. A web site contains static content that never changes over time (for example, your portfolio). A web application dynamically responds to user input and its content changes accordingly. Examples include services like Facebook, Twitter and so on. I shall initially be teaching you the basics of making a static website using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, which is where everyone starts.

After this, you're given a choice. If you wish to work with CMSes like WordPress, it's useful to know PHP to create custom WordPress themes, and tinker with the backend logic. WordPress is by far the most popular blogging platform, so if that's where you want to go, I shall teach you PHP alongside MySQL.

If you're serious about creating Web Applications from scratch, I highly recommend using the MEAN stack. MEAN stands for MongoDB (the database), Express (a web application framework), Angular (a popular MVC framework) and NodeJS (backend server).

It's alright if these acronyms are going over your head right now; it'll all start to make sense when I start from the absolute beginning.

At this point, I feel like I should make a disclaimer: I am primarily a front-end web developer. I have worked with the full web stack, but architecting web applications on the front end is what I specialize in. **I am not a designer.** I shall teach you the tools to make any sort of website you want, but I am not qualified to teach you the basics of web design. Developers normally work *alongside* designers to recreate exactly what they want (they'd normally send you a PSD mockup), which you shall then be taught to replicate exactly. If you want to learn how to make a web site look pretty, please look elsewhere.

**Codecademy teaches this stuff for free. Why on earth should you pay me?**

That's a very valid question. You can indeed learn everything I am offering to teach for free. However, getting into web development can be overwhelming. You start with a simple HTML/CSS tutorial, you then move on to PHP. Then you read this blog saying that PHP is terrible. Then you'll find another guy recommending Ruby on Rails. When you've hopped on to that bandwagon, you'll find plenty of people recommending NodeJS instead. Then you find that one of the core contributors to Node has jumped ship to the Go programming languuage.

You find some people praising Javascript, and some loathing it. You do not know who to listen to. You follow interesting people on Twitter and read Hacker News everyday, and find so many acronyms thrown about and you have no idea what any of them are talking about. It's all going over your head. It is very easy to give up. I have gotten advice that I now consider bad when I first started out, and I always wished that there was someone to help me out, to guide me, to answer every stupid question I could think of.

Following random tutorials online makes your knowledge fragmented, and will not  give you the confidence of mastery over what you've learned. I intend clearly explaining everything I teach you, after which I give you small exercises to practise. I shall of course answer any questions you have.

We shall negotiate timings based on when both of us are free. I shall take 3 two-hour classes a week, apart from which I shall set weekly homework and shall be available to ask questions at any time. I promise to respond to any emails you may send me within 8 hours of my receiving them.

**My credentials**

What makes me fit to teach this, you ask?

In the past, I have made an HTML5 game using the Phaser framework ([Leaping Cube](http://arunmahadevan.me/leapingcube/)), and a chat bot ([Chat with Amy](http://chatwithamy.github.io/)).
I have interned at a pretty well known startup in my country (I shall PM its name if you’re interested), where I worked on their custom URL shortener, and contributed highly scalable code to it. I have worked with GulpJS, Grunt and Yeoman to automate several tasks. I am reasonably comfortable with MongoDB and Redis, having used both at my internship.
I wrote the URL shortener I mentioned above using NodeJS and Express. Apart from that, I have also used Socket.IO, and am reasonably familiar with concurrent programming using Node.
Other miscellaneous stuff I’ve worked with include: WordPress, Jekyll (the CMS), Bootstrap, Foundation.

I look good enough on paper to at least get an interview from nearly everywhere I send my resume but apparently I'm not good enough for a job.  I'm also in the top 5th of my class (although at a third tier) and have several years of significant legal employment experience.  

Why is it so hard to find part time legal work?  I mean these jobs pay $8-11 an hour which is fast food wages for someone with at least 6 years of high education.

Am I bombing the interviews?  Is it my sopping wet sweaty palms when I shake hands?  I do tend to sometimes trip up on the ""trap"" questions like when they ask a time I disagreed with a superior, what my weaknesses are, what I liked least about a position, etc., but then again not every employer even asked those.   

A few sent rejection letters saying they went with a 3L with more experience, another candidate was hired, or whatever.  One firm rejected me because I was 45 min. away and they sent a letter saying they went with someone who lived closer even though I was asked about it in my interview and they had called me in knowing damn well where I lived and I was asked and told them in the interview that the commute wasn't a problem.

I was an ugly kid. In primary school I was half a foot taller than anyone in my class, skinner than a chicken leg, wore these really thick glasses that practically shrunk my eyes, and worst of all, got some really nasty acne breakouts at age 9. In fucking third grade I was gracefully nicknamed ""Pepperoni"" and ""Rocky Mountain"". I was initially quite miserable since my older sister and all my friends were popular and beautiful. But by middle school, I accepted I was ugly, that was fine, and I will have to focus on bettering things beyond looks. 

---
So I made the best grades, never made below an A on a test. I made sure to be especially nice to everyone and spent hours perfecting my math abilities and join the math team by 7th grade. The month after graduating junior high at age 13, something happened that made my life change. 


---
I was at a shopping mall and was, for lack of a better word, ""discovered"" by a modeling agent. Turns out my awkward tree height and lack of any fat or muscle had a use. But this was the first time in my life I was told I was good looking, and despite my poor self esteem, I persuaded my parents by promising them I will keep my grades and immediately took the contract. My skin eventually cleared after careful monitoring and suddenly I was considered pretty. 

---
Unless you've been on both ends of the spectrum on looks it's hard to tell how drastically looks matter on how you're treated. I didn't tell a soul about modeling but I quickly learned people in my school read magazines and catalogs. People who ignored me were suddenly telling others I was their ""model"" friend. I was never a friend, I was always the ""model"" friend. A group of girls I didn't know that well stole my portfolio out of my backpack (I had a casting immediately after school) to show it to everyone. A guy who was too cool for me in junior high asked me to the school dance, and when I was introduced to his parents they remarked on how their son is taking the model to the dance. 


---
What nobody knew was that I measured myself every night, both with tape and on the scale. When I was 15, If I got to my natural healthy hip size of 36, I literally ate only lettuce, tofu, and carrots for two weeks. My parents didn't notice it, my friends who did dismissed it because ""she's a model, that's what they do."" They didn't know that I didn't book jobs because I ""look too mixed race"", I'm not blonde, one eye is smaller than the other, or my hips were a 35. I didn't mind those too much, casting agents are just doing their job. But suddenly everyone felt entitled to broadcasting their personal opinion on my looks, tell me if I look like I'm gaining or losing, comment on my under eye bags, snigger and call me anorexic or ""wow, your thighs are pretty large for a model."" 

---
So junior year, I decided that nobody seemed to take me seriously anymore and I hated it. Win an academic state championship? Nobody bats an eye. Represent our school in the city council public forum? That's whatever. Because I was born with the bone structure and body type that some all-powerful business executives deemed is fit for mass advertising and so I got published in a national ad campaign? Wow, awesome! Amazing! I went from being known as a smart and talented one to a girl who might be in a Nordstrom catalog. I decided if I went to college instead of New York, maybe I can keep the modeling behind me. 

I overheard some ""friends"" comment that the only reason I got into one of the top universities was because I had the unfair advantage of modeling. Yeah, I was top 2% in the class and a state champion but *modeling*, which I didn't even mention other than a sentence, was what did it. Sure. 

---
Anyway, turns out my modeling overshadowed anything I worked my ass off in college too. I started to doubt my own abilities; nobody seemed to care about the things I worked for but everyone seemed to like me more if I modeled more; that's all people wanted to hear about. I didn't date anyone since I started getting anxious and paranoid. Girlfriends talked about how jealous they were of my unnatural skinny body. 3rd year, I was given a chance to take a semester off and go to Tokyo. I was depressed at this point and obsessed with looking as model-ish as possible. At 5'8"" I was 100 lbs. and booking lots of work for it. I didn't believe I was worth anything more than my looks, so I took it instead of going for an internship. 

---
Tokyo was where I made it very successfully. The market really took to me and I was working left and right. The other models I worked with were either awful English speakers (aka clueless 14 year olds from Eastern Europe) or so absorbed in their own beauty I didn't want to befriend them. My agency began to control a lot of my life. My name didn't ""look"" like me so I had to change it a bit. I had to pretend to be bubblier than I actually am since it suited my look. I started getting lots of social media followers, strangers/clients/agents telling me they loved me and wanted to look like me; friends back home were obsessing over my carefully constructed Facebook life. 


The more successful I got, the less I ate. The more I obsessed over every detail of my face and body. The more I hated my wide hipbones. My chin looked weird. One manager encourage botox to reduce my barely noticeable smile lines. But I got so much praise for being so thin and pretty so I kept at it. 


My breaking point was when a scout came looking for girls for NYC and Paris. He loved my look, said I had so much potential, but didn't want to push me to the big dogs unless I lost another inch or two on my hips. I was already thinner than the average model, but he explained that since my look was ""ethereal"" I also had to be skinner than the other girls. That was when I realized I was done. I needed to find something else that defined me because I was sick of it. I wanted to persuade myself that I was more than my looks, even if I failed to persuade others. 


---
I didn't go to NYC or Paris. I went back home and recruited for a full time job like all hell broke loose. After about 40 applications, 7 interviews, a million panic attacks and tears, and one offer, I felt like my life was finally going to be on the right track. 



My (very few) true friends were happy for me, but everyone else, including my family, commented that I was throwing my life away. Why try going for a corporate office job if I could potentially be a supermodel? I was throwing my looks away, I was betraying my social media followers, I was going for the wrong dream, I was ungrateful to reject an opportunity millions of other girls only dream of. 



---
Yeah, fuck that. If I go through hell to prove I can be better than an underfed walking clothes horse whose success is almost entirely determined by others, then so be it. 


**EDIT**: I was in class all day but am so thankful for the support! This post and your responses were very therapeutic, I did need some assurance I was making the right choice! Here's to the extra inch on the hip! Thanks everyone!"

I'm in my early 20's. I've spent my entire adult life trying to make everything perfect thinking that it will help me feel better. I was always waiting and planning for things to fall into place. And with each thing that did, I did not feel any better. I just searched for the next thing to ""fix"". I've been unemployed for the past two years since graduating from college. I've held ""internships"" which are really volunteering positions that are related to my field. Now I want a real job, my first real job. I've had other jobs before but I've never had to interview for them. But I don't know how to get myself to start applying for jobs. I'm so afraid of interviews and my lack of experience. I don't know how to spin my volunteer experience into something positive. I don't know how to speak to strangers about myself when I don't feel like I have anything to say. I feel like a utter failure while my parents help pay off my student loans and I can barely get out of bed. How do you guys do it? 

I find it so hard to participate in life after finishing school. At least I had somewhere to go when I was in school. I thought that if I got a little break after graduation that I would feel better. But that break just kept going and I found it harder and harder to start participating in life. I spent more time in bed and more time wishing I was dead.

There's that cycle of thinking where the things that might make me better like human interaction and money to fund trips is connected to finding a job. But in order to get a job, I need to get myself together and present myself as someone who isn't having trouble getting out of bed. That is hard because I literally can't bring myself to get out of bed.

I constantly lie about what I do. I briefly did some independent pro bono work and I've been telling anyone who asks me that I do virtual work online. I wish I did that but work is slow so I haven't been able to get any clients. I would really like to start living and stop wasting my time. But I don't know how. Does anyone have any experience with how to get back out there? "
2ut9pk,1,2015-02-04,[Build Help] Need advice on my build. Looking to build my first computer this summer.,scooter1265,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/2ut9pk/build_help_need_advice_on_my_build_looking_to/,"Hi! I'm hoping to get an internship or something similar this summer, so that means I should be able to afford my PC this summer. I'd like to stick to Intel processors, but if there is an AMD chip that is just as good or better, then I'm all for it. I'd like to have 3 TB of storage as well, I have a lot of info that needs stored as well as media and games. 

I'd be primarily using this rig in college, for gaming as well as my main computer, retiring my current laptop to a smaller role. I'd like to be able to play games at a reasonably high level, and I use Solidworks quite a bit as well, so great CAD performance would be necessary as well. I'm going to be running a two monitor setup, so I'm not sure what the best connection would be, and if I could do it on my current setup. Audio doesn't really matter that much, as I'll use a desktop speaker set that plugs into the headphone port.

Here's the build I created, let me know what I can improve upon or if its sufficient enough. I'd like to keep the price between $700-900 net total, including the mail in rebates.

The recruiter had me answer a few short questions (like graduation date, if I had any competing offers, etc), and said she'd respond with an online coding assessment in the next week. But that was over a week ago, and I still haven't received a response. Does this mean they changed their minds and aren't going forward with the assessment, or just forgot? Should I e-mail the recruiter and see what's up?"
2utdie,2,2015-02-04,Fucking frustrated,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2utdie/fucking_frustrated/,"I'm 21 years old. I've been dealing with depression off and on since my early teens. Until recently, I had only very seriously contemplated suicide once, back when I was fourteen, and I spent a night sitting in my bedroom watching music videos on VH1 with a knife to my wrist. Darker songs pushed me closer to doing it, while songs with hopeful messages pulled me back. The song ""Falling Slowly"" from the film *Once* saved my life that night. 

Fast forward a few years. After over a decade of frustration and confusion, at the age of 18, I was officially diagnosed with ADHD. My GPA was already irreversibly fucked, but thanks to a good standardized test score and A LOT of extra curriculars, I got into a decent college. Over the course of my freshman year, my Adderall XR started to really fuck with my head, and I had far more frequent occurrences of depression and thoughts of suicide. I told my PCP about this, and he switched me over to Adderall IR, which I now take three times a day. 

Fast forward 2 years to 2014. To say it was a stressful year would be the understatement of the century. I won't go too much into details, but basically, Spring semester was hellish. My roommate (who I considered to be one of my best friends... we saw each other like brothers) and I brought in a third roommate to help with the cost of rent. The new guy turned my old roommate against me, and our apartment became a complete shit hole. Every night there were strangers smoking weed and wax, dropping acid, and rolling molly. They ate my food (in a time when I basically had to choose whether to pay rent or eat at least two meals a day) and basically made me feel unwelcome in an apartment that I was paying hundreds of dollars a month to live in. I spent most nights that semester sleeping in the basement lounge of my girlfriend's dorm, pretending that I fell asleep while studying so I wouldn't get kicked out into the cold. Later, after he moved to a separate apartment down the hall, new roommate broke into my place and stole a ton of my stuff, then wrote himself a check for $150 with my check book. That whole thing still hasn't been cleared up yet, because the cop that was working on the case retired. 

Over the summer, my girlfriend of nearly two years went off to an internship in a city several hundred miles away. In August, she broke up with me, because she didn't believe in me and she had fallen in love with a guy in her building (who I later found out didn't feel the same way about her). 

Fall semester: At this point in time, my depression has come back in full swing. Thanks to a late night class, I had to come down from Adderall around 2 or 3 in the morning every Monday, which usually led to powerful suicidal thoughts. Over the course of the four months preceding this semester, I had three powerful panic attacks: one because of financial issues, one because a repressed memory of a sexual assault came back to me, and one because my girlfriend broke up with me while I was telling her about said sexual assault. I was a fucking mess. In September, I met a new girl, and she's absolutely wonderful. She almost killed herself in October. She texted me that night, hinting that she was depressed and saying that she knew she wouldn't do anything, but that she was scared, and I barely responded, because I was drunk with my new, current roommates. I feel immensely guilty about this. 

Over the course of fall semester, my already crushing debt got substantially worse. During the first week of school (two weeks after the break up with my old girlfriend) I drank so much I had to be taken to the hospital. My dad was between jobs at the time, so I didn't have any insurance for the hospital bills. Stack that on top of the $650 I owe my old landlord from the druggy apartment, the $200 I owe the power company from the druggy apartment, the $75 I owe Comcast, and the $1600 I owe my current landlord, and you have an incredibly stressful situation. 

When I was home for Christmas break, I saw a doctor at the same practice as my PCP (he was unavailable) and I told her about my depression and panic attacks. She gave me a prescription for Zoloft, which I started on January 2nd. A combination of side effects from both the Zoloft and Adderall, paired with the daily reminder that the Zoloft brings that ""Hey, you're depressed, asshole."" has cause this to be the most dangerous month of my life. I struggle with suicidal thoughts almost every day. 

I'm a Psychology major, and the more that I've learned about ADHD over the past month, the more I've realized how completely fucked my daily thought process is. This newfound self awareness is soul crushing, because I'm just now realizing how often I just don't get shit done. Even when I want to get shit done, I can't. Dr. Russell Barkley refers to this as ""the heart of the ADHD patient"", in that the mind and the will are constantly at odds with each other. It's like half the time, I'm under a spell and I don't even know it. I'm so terrified that I'm going to fuck up *again* and then have nowhere to go in my life. With a psychology degree, I need at least a master's, if not also a doctorate if I want to succeed in the medical world, or even get a decent job. The ADHD medication only does so much. It helps with the focus portion, but does nothing to curb impulse control, so half the time I take my meds to do homework, I end up browsing reddit for hours or reorganizing my iTunes library. 

I just feel so hopeless and broken and scared. Part of me just wants to roll the dice and hope that the Hindus are right and that reincarnation is a thing and that I'll be born with a brain that has proper levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. I mean, fuck, my MBTI personality type is an ENTJ. That's one of the rarest in the world, and is basically the personality of leaders (Julius Caesar was believed to be one). Seriously, go over to /r/entj. Imagine being born with that mindset, and decent intelligence, but a fucking awful case of ADHD-C and depression. It's like a mental ALS, it's fucking torture. I have so much I can give to the world, and my brain can do so much, but it won't fucking let me. I fucking hate myself. I have no real control over myself, let alone my life. Everything's a fucking mess. If you actually read all of this, kudos to you. Thanks for listening to my rant. 

tl;dr: ADHD + Depression + Ambition = hell"
2utdle,0,2015-02-04,Had a great conversation at a career fair. Did well enough in tech interview the next day. Only did mediocre on the next online tech interview. Is sending a short explanatory letter pointless?,richandrare,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2utdle/had_a_great_conversation_at_a_career_fair_did/,"As the title states, I had a great conversation with a company at a career fair on campus. That night I received a invitation to have a technical interview with a software manager the next day. Did well enough, but would not say I aced the interview question. But it was good enough to move on to the next round/phase.

The next phase was an online technical challenge. I felt I really needed to excel here to get invited to come interview onsite. Unfortunately, I only did pretty mediocre.

Quick background: Graduating in spring, but I also currently work full time as a software engineer while in school

So, my question is, is it worth while to send a followup/explanatory letter or is this either completely pointless or even harmful?

In the letter I was thinking of first of explaining that I have never been a great exam taker, and tech interviews are very much in this vain. I have always gotten top marks on all of my programming projects, but exams just take a different mindset. I then wanted to point out that this does not mean that I do not do well under pressure, as at work I can thrives under deadlines when needed to have something implemented in time or when given an ultimatum that performance must improve by next release.

I would then go on to point out the ways that I know I could have improved my technical interview, and also mention that I have completed a similar problem for school, but with a complexity level that is much more involved.

Lastly, I wanted to list some benefits that I think other college grad applications might not have that I do. First, because I have been working full time as an engineer for the past year, I will be coming with much more first hand knowledge of working with large million+ line code bases, where many students only get a brief expose to this in an internship. Second, I wanted to mention that because I graduated a few years ago in an unrelated field and have since returned to school for CS, I belief I have a drive and determination to make up for this lost time, that many students do not. This is the reason that at my current job, I was upgraded from intern to full time, in the middle of my internship, only a few weeks out of training, and also the reason that I have been selected to be part of the team to develop our next generation software (if I stay where I am), while many others will be maintaining our current, soon to be legacy product.

Thoughts?"

So when my FF came in the other day I showed it to him and we were talking about how far Fake ID's have come since he and his buddy were making them in his basement. He commented that it would be totally great if I got a backup form of ID if some bouncer called me out, and I was confused as to how for a min and then he pointed at my employee badge ID, he said we should print one off that has the same birthday as my fake, seeing as he is the owner of the business no one can really get in trouble for it. He said if we do it I just have to buy him a beer.

So is this a pretty good idea? The badges just have a photo, our employee ID #, birthday, and date since employment. The ID also has a hologram and a barcode."
2utn2g,1,2015-02-04,"(CAN) Going to school in the fall, best way to manage my money and prevent high debts?",201229,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2utn2g/can_going_to_school_in_the_fall_best_way_to/,"I live in Ontario and have applied to 4 different universities each totalling between $20 000 - $24 000 a year. (Including res, food, books, tuition). Based on my parent's income I will be able to qualify for OSAP (which is a basically a loan and you get up to 30% off your tuition based on parental income and your financial situation). I have less than $18 000 put away in my RESP which would be enough for about one year. 

I do have a part time job which does pay well but I'm trying to focus on my studies right now so I'm not getting many shifts. I am also on the Ontario Team so saving money in the summer is not much of an option as I'm always training and travelling. I do not go out often or spend much money on food/ clothes. I am trying to save as much as I can because I see the struggle my parents went through financially so I want to prepare myself and pay off my school debts on my own. 
So that leads me to a couple questions:

1. What's the best way to keep my debts to a minimum while at school? (buying books second hand, not going out often etc...)

2. My dream school is about $2 000 a year more than my other options. In the grand scheme of things is that much money significant enough to not go to that school? I have been told by simply going there is likely to help you in the future due to the pride from all the Alumni. (Queen's University) So do the pros out weigh the cons??

3. Is it better to pay off my loans quickly over a short period of time (while living at home for a year or 2 after school)? or over a long period of time and move out and live on my own. 

4. Whats a good place to look for summer internships for engineering in Ontario? I am going into Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering and hoping to mainly focus on building prosthetics and having a lot of real life practice.

5. I have just over $2000 in savings. Should I invest it? Keep it for retirement/ emergency funds? use it to pay off my loan in the future? 

I'd love to hear some personal stories and advice others have told you! "

*****
So, following high school I didn't do *anything*. I didn't go to college, or get a job; I just sat at home and bitched about things. I was kinda an asshole, but it was worse than a normal asshole because I contributed literally nothing to anyone.  
My girlfriend kept kicking me in the pants to get a job, and I wanted one... I just didn't have the self-motivation to get one.  
When she dumped me, I decided to go back to the psychologist I had been seeing off-and-on for a few years to get helping moving on with my life.
  
#####Then things get exciting
*****
I explored a few options for finding a job with her, and eventually my single-mindedness to work with computers brought her to the fact that her organization (a large non-profit in Philly) was looking for some extra hands on a fairly long-term project.  

She got me an interview for an ""*internship*"" so I could have work experience for a resume. The only problem I had was transportation, they said they would try to arrange a *stipend* for bus fare... But then they offered me a contractor position, which I happily took. It would look slightly better on a resume, ***and*** paid a fair amount so I could afford to get to future interviews and such.  
#####The acceleration continued...
*****
Two months into the 90-day ""internship"" they offered me a full-time Help Desk position, which I've been happily rocking since mid-December. I've been reaching out helping not only our employees, but our IT professionals and earned a reputation among *everyone* in the building that I was **the** go-to guy for hard to answer tech questions.  
#####It wasn't over yet
*****
Now, as of this Monday, they have offered to train me for their **Senior Programmer** position, which has been open for 8 months. I don't know what the hell I did to deserve such an awesome workplace that appreciates my quick-learning and willingness to go above and beyond, but it is fucking amazing.
*****
That last part is still sinking in a bit, I can't believe it...  
Although, to be fair the ""Senior"" is kinda just there for kicks, I feel; as there are no other programmers in the IT department here.  
Anyone else have similar experiences where opportunities just kept opening up for you one after the other?"

Hello everyone.

First I want to say thanks to the people that started and maintain this subreddit and I am really thankful I happened to come across it in my search for help on my resume. 

I graduated in 2014 with BS in business with a concentration in finance. While in school, I worked about 30+ hours a week as a server to support myself while living on my own. I did not partake in any school events nor did I spend any time networking. I would not come to realize the gravity of these choices until after graduation. I had this idea that going to school and doing my very best in my courses would guarantee me a job after graduation. I realize now that was not nearly enough.

I came to this country in 1992 from a little town on the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan at the young age of 7 along with my immediate family, which included my parents, 4 brothers, 2 sisters, and 2 nephews whom I see as my brothers. The highest level of education my dad had was high school, while the highest level of education my mother had was middle school. We were very poor growing up but we struggled and endured to make something of ourselves realizing that we were given this once in a lifetime opportunity when we were allowed to move to the United States under refugee status. 

I am proud to say that with the help of this great country, we have 3 doctors in the family, 2 more with biology degrees working towards medicine, 1 training to be a firefighter, and then there is the black sheep of the family, me with a business degree. lol. Thank you America for giving us a life that we could not have dreamed of. To think what would have become of us were we to have been denied our entry visas absolutely terrifies me. 

I wrote that little bit about my background in the hopes that it gives you the reader more info on how best to give me some feedback. I missed out on a lot of what was necessary in school, e.g. internships, networking, social events, because I simply did not know those were things I had to worry about. My parents did not have the knowledge to stress to me the importance of internship experience or the significance of the social networking. The horrible attacks of 9/11 caused my family to become reclusive with regards to meeting other people because we feared for our safety. My mother and sister would be walking in the neighborhood for exercise and cars would drive by while yelling anti-Islamic insults at them. A lot of their fear was also left over from their days in Afghanistan so naturally they prevented us kids from participating in school events which caused us to develop social anxiety.

I graduated in 2012 and continued to work as a server while looking for a more professional position that would utilize my education and degree. In early 2013, I had an interview for a finance position at Intel that I was highly considered, however they gave the position to someone that was older and had relevant finance experience. I felt utterly defeated and this completed crushed my self-confidence with regards to my job search.

After Intel, I continued my job search but almost in a self-defeated manner because I was fearful of being told no again. My girlfriend was given a promotion in Southern California so we moved in July 2013 from Sacramento to Orange County in SoCal. 

Here is where I started to really learn more about myself now that I was no longer under the umbrella that was my family nor the pressure of filling the shoes that my older siblings had left me. I underwent very positive changes in my life after moving down to SoCal. I started to eat healthier, started to exercise daily by running along the beach and P90X3 at home, I started reading for recreation again, but most importantly I started to focus on my career situation. I am also starting to take some Java programming online classes to increase my skill set while also working on my social anxiety by participating in beach cleanup events. To keep myself afloat, I sold most of the electronics I had, which was a decent amount. I buy and resell electronics while continuing my job search. I also help people with their electronics needs, repairing computers, building computers, and other electronic related services. However, I need a stable career where I have ample vertical movement.

I did not think I was going to type all that but I really wanted to give as complete of a picture of who I am as I could over the internet.


TL:DR
28 year old dude with a business degree with no relevant finance experience that would like some help on his resume to have a better chance at scoring an interview. 


Also, what websites or methods do people recommend to get their resume out there?


Thank you to all who took the time to read that and also to everyone that offers advice.

2utsoa,7,2015-02-04,My roommate[20M] wrecked my[20M] car and tried to move out without telling anyone on the day rent was due. Was my response too harsh or justified?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2utsoa/my_roommate20m_wrecked_my20m_car_and_tried_to/,"I am writing this on a throwaway account and using fake names to protect the persons involved identities. Before I get to the ending of this story I must go back to provide a little more context. I will try to stay as neutral as I possibly can so I can get the best advice for my situation.

My roommate nick and I moved to a mountain town on the west coast from the Cleveland area. I was originally from near the town but got a scholarship to go to school in Ohio. The house I lived in was shared by 3 of my friends and I. That is where I met my roommate nick. He was the little brother to one of my older friends in my friend group from school. In all honesty nick is one of the most fun people to hang out and party with. He comes off as a really nice funny guy that is always fun to have around.

Since he was friends with everyone in our regular friend group he started to hang out with us a lot and he started to crash on the couch once in a while and then he started to sleep over more and more to the point where he spent months sleeping on our couch. It was not that much of an inconvenience due to us having a huge house, however he never bought food or offered to pay us some money for utilities. During this time nick did not have a job or an actual place to stay, he was just couch hopping.

Well the school year ended and I was planning on moving in my sister and her boyfriend in Colorado. One of my roomates Ricky from Ohio was planning on coming with me so we found a four person house and signed the lease. However, Ricky had financial troubles and had to bail at the last second. I needed to find another roommate and nick said he didn't have anything going on while his brother went out of the country for an internship. So i figured, ok its better than nothing, I get along with him really well, he says he has some money and that he would get a job. 

We moved to the town and it was really fun, we went hiking and camping a lot. Then the summer ended and I went back to school for engineering and he said he was going to find a job. Well he waited until he was out of money to actually start applying to places for work and i ended up having to pay for his rent, utilities, and food for the month he was looking for a job. 

His brother was going to be back in the states soon, so I decided to ask him what his plans were. I wanted to know if I should start looking for a new roommate or not. His response was that he was loving it out here and that he wanted to go to the same school as me once he could qualify for instate tuition. When Christmas came around his family bought him a plane ticket to go home for the holiday. On the day he was leaving rent was due and after I asked for it he told me he was short but was going to send me money once he got to Ohio.

Nick never texted me or called me about the money even after I asked him about it several times. The next time I talked to him was the night before he was coming back and asked for a ride. After I picked him up I confronted him about it and he said he was sorry he was to busy visiting with family, but he did pay me it the day after he got back.

Finally after all of that back story I can get to the real issue. Last week today my cousin, nick, and I all got dinner at the school. On our way back my cousin had to drive to the parking lot where my car was parked. I did not want to move out of my cousins car so I let nick drive my car home which is not abnormal. We are at a light that is a quarter mile away ending in a tight turn up a hill. My cousin Maggie is in the left lane and nick is in the right. Maggie is a punk and hates to loose so she and nick started to race as soon as the light turned. As we were coming up to the sharp curve my cousin slowed down however nick did not. He started to slide out of control and slammed into the concrete median that is about 8 inches high. The airbag went off and just the way the car hit my whole left wheel was broken off at the axle. 

I was pissed I yelled at him saying things that needed to be said but refrained from insulting him on a personal level. When the cop came and asked who was driving he said I was. As soon as he said that I turned to him and yelled,""are you fucking kidding me, he was driving I am not dealing with this right now."" It turns out he was driving without insurance and the cop decided to let him off by not issuing a ticket since no other cars were involved. Plus I also still covered for him, the cop pulled me aside and asked if he was racing because he got a few calls about that. I told the cop that he was just passing someone and went too fast around the corner.

The next day I get a call from nicks dad just trying to get some information. He also says that he is going to help nick out because he doesn't have a lot of money. We agree that half the blue book value of $1500 was fair for the trouble and  the deductible on the insurance. So later that day I finally see nick and we talk about it and I forgive him for being stupid but it seems like he is trying to make it right. He tells me that since he can't afford this he will have to move back to Ohio at the end of February and work for his dad to pay it off. This sucks he is one of my closest friends but I understand its a bad situation and know he has to do what he has to do.

Monday I am in my physics class and I get a text from nick saying that he doesn't have enough money for  rent and asking if he should just pack up and leave today? I responded telling him absolutely not your already committed to paying rent so you might as well live here for the month instead of couch hopping. He never responded.

I got home to a car I didn't recognize in front of the house. The next thing I see is nicks empty room and him trying to find something in the backyard. I confronted him asking him what the hell he was doing. He responded by saying that he couldn't afford it and that he was doing me a favor anyway by paying for four extra months of rent than he was supposed to. I blew up at him yelling saying how he is full of shit you would tell everyone that you wanted to go to school next fall. He was not giving me any solid argument for why he felt like he shouldn't have to pay rent so I grabbed his custom long board and told him until I get the money this is mine and walked away. Nick hopped the fence and the car sped away.

Fast forward to today around 3 my sister and I are sitting in the living room and nick just walks in and hands me an envelope with $1400 in it, he says its all he has and that he would pay me the rest when he got back to Ohio. $1000 for the car and $400 for the rent and utilities I paid for him in November. He then asked for his long board back and I said that I didn't trust him and I needed some form of collateral until I got the money. Nick said to just keep the board and walked out.

Final notes his dad and step mom gave his older brother a $1000 to pay rent when his girlfriend moved out of his house. His family will also spend several hundred dollars at the bar a few times a week, I was fortunate enough to go there with them a few times. So it wouldn't be an inconvenience to them to loan him $370 for rent one time. I actually hated my car and was thinking that very morning I wish someone would wreck my car so I could get a new one. I paid $5,000 for it but the insurance is going to pay $6,000 so he really did me a favor. I found that out after he texted me in my physics class, so on my way home I was feeling generous and felt like nick was truly sorry so I was going to tell him he only had to pay me for the deductible. 

Am I being to greedy? The insurance is going pay me $1000 more than I paid for a car I ended up hating and I took his custom long board his uncle painted for him. I am never usually like this but I feel like I was really wronged but am I being to unreasonable?

tl;dr: My bum of a roommate wrecked my car racing and tried to move out the day rent was due without telling anyone. Am I being to much of a dick for taking $2000 over what I paid for the car and took his long board as a form of rent/ collateral?"
2utu73,1,2015-02-04,Should I spend another semester in grad school or am I harming my future?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2utu73/should_i_spend_another_semester_in_grad_school_or/,"Hey guys. Bit of a long read because I've been mulling this question over and have no answer yet. I don't really have anyone to talk to who could advice me on such matters so I'm turning to the next best thing.

Bit of background: I'm an international graduate student in the masters program of a top-10 Uni in the US. As of such, getting a job is important when I graduate due to the visa restrictions on me staying in the country unless I'm studying full time or working. 

Although I joined as a masters I've been doing research since my first semester here. I was initially working in deep learning which was of huge interest to me, but I switched to a different field of AI (applications of game theory) since it funded my studies completely (also its very interesting in parts to work on).

I essentially wanted a job in some machine learning role (I'm not being specific because my view of ml is divorced from what is applied in the industry) where I would have challenging problems to work on (I had previously worked in a very well known software giant for a year but I felt quite unfulfilled there), but because of the requirements of my program and the heavy load of research, I've not achieved the level of comfort that I would want in that area. I have taken the graduate machine learning courses, advanced AI courses and courses in pgm etc but I always felt I was somehow just making it through these.

The more i dove into AI, the more I realized my basics in probability and statistics were lacking, that my background wasn't great, and that all the PhD's that I work with are way smarter. 

I basically felt really flawed and that it was next to impossible for me to catch up with a lot of the people here. I'll admit I've spent a lot of my time feverishly spurred by despair and feeling depressed in turn. I know it isn't good to compare, and I usually try and surround myself with people smarter than me so I can learn from them, but I honestly felt I wasn't living upto my expectations. 

Traditionally the masters program is only 2 years long, and nobody stays beyond that. The idea crossed my mind of staying one more semester (where I would only have to take 2 credits, so almost no courses) and spending those 4-5 months strengthening my grasp on the fundamentals required to advance in this field...build my base up from probability and stats, calculus, optimization and machine learning. 

I dont know whether I would still be continuing my research in the extra semester (depends on the funding) so I might have to pay out of my own pocket. Since it's only 3 credits I might be able to bear that burden.

My question was, in your opinion, is this a wise move to make? The kind of roles I'm looking for require a good working knowledge of ML, and I would feel more confident if I had that. However, I've been told things like no one stays for 5 semesters, its a waste of your life since you can study while in a job and that companies wont interview me if I stay for an extra semester. I didn't intern anywhere last summer since I was doing research (although I got two publications that summer so I have something to show for it).

I have interviews lined up with some great companies (albeit not for the roles I might want) and I've been urged to finish things off and just take a job. I'm scared of getting into a job that I might not like and not being able to shift fields once I'm in there. Then again I'm pretty naive about how careers grow, so I can't say that this fear is rational.

Sorry for the long rant, became longer than I meant it to be. If you read till here, thanks."
2utw5x,8,2015-02-04,2 Intern Offers,Quadraphonics,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2utw5x/2_intern_offers/,"Hi I have two intern offers. One at a fairly well known company that may IPO in around 2 years time, or one at a really successful startup that just raised ~10 million in series A funding.

Both companies use interesting software stacks, both seem to have a cool company culture. The compensation is decent for both of them.

There would be many people who could mentor me at the first company, whilst the startup has ~6 devs. I wouldn't say the startup is a tech company, but its edge is definitely due to its tech and you could definitely say its a tech driven company.

I think both companies would be great to work at, but I was having a hard time picking between them."

Looking for experiential anecdotes if possible.

My background: I have had a few interviews for internships a while ago, but most of them went nowhere past the initial interview. I now know a good bit more 1.5 years later down the vine and have more experience. I'm getting more interest and more callbacks and am curious if at this point the HR people will think I'm worth hiring."
2uubqs,1,2015-02-05,Transitioning from an technical degree to a CS Master's?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2uubqs/transitioning_from_an_technical_degree_to_a_cs/,"Hello, 

Right now I'm a junior in an Information Technology at a state university, and while I'm doing well in my major, I've discovered that I don't care for the networking and system administration. I changed my major from accounting to IT a year ago, since it would allow me to graduate on time and I was interested in cyber security. I've have internship experience in cyber security research (mainly cloud computing and data analysis, not too much development) and I've taken several CS courses. I don't think I'd have an issue getting into a Master's program at a decent university, I'd probably just have to spend a year taking Calc I &amp; II and maybe some higher level CS courses before hand, but I've already taken the core CS courses (Data Structures, OOP, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems) so it won't be a massive educational hurdle. I wanted to know if anyone here here has transitioned from a technical undergraduate degree into a Computer Science related Master's  or even second bachelor's degree, and if it was difficult to get jobs/experience afterwards? I feel like I'll be at a massive disadvantage compared to CS grads who've already had at least 3 years of academic or work experience in programming. I'm sure there's people who've transitioned from degrees such as Electrical Engineering or Physics and wound up taking another degree related to CS, but I'd like to hear how people have transitioned."

2uugqb,10,2015-02-05,"Me (22 M) with my ex (21 F) of 2 years and new girl (20 F), What are the rules?",ThrowawayOlympics,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2uugqb/me_22_m_with_my_ex_21_f_of_2_years_and_new_girl/,"So like the title says, my ex and I dated for two years, she dumped me after a mental breakdown around six months ago, but told me she still loved me and wanted me to wait. I said sure because I still love her, and up until now I haven't really had an interest in dating anybody else, but then this happened...


Since then, I haven't heard from her besides few cryptic texts. She ignores all of my attempts to get in contact with her, but she repeatedly asked me to wait for her while she fixed her life so I've been doing my own thing and been focusing on graduating, internships, studying for the GRE, etc. etc. (Basically keeping myself busy so I don't think about it or have time to date anyone else).


Until recently, that had been going pretty well, but a couple weeks ago I met this girl in one of my classes and...she's awesome.
She's gorgeous, smart, extremely driven (She's on her country's national Olympic team, which coincidentally is the same country I'm from). We've begun to hang out literally in all our spare time and sometimes study together and we just click.


My friends love her and all tell me she's into me and I should make a move because she's a perfect match for me, I'm crazy if I blow it with such a amazing catch, they haven't seen me so happy, she's way better than my ex, etc.


I like her, but I still care about my ex. I can't really say I still love my ex because of how she's ignored me and kind of left me hanging for the past six months, and lately I've been thinking about getting out there and dating again in case she's just stringing me along, but I don't know what to do. This is a weird scenario.

Any advice would be appreciated.

2uui4p,27,2015-02-05,"I'm an Indian studying at one of the most hard to get to Institutes in the world, this is Why I wanted to Suicide.",DragonWinx,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2uui4p/im_an_indian_studying_at_one_of_the_most_hard_to/,"Before 10th Class, I was a guy who did not study much. My parents usually didn’t force me to study but I knew they were tense. That changed when I came into my 11th class and then subsequently into my 12th class, by the end of 12th class, I was really good at studies. What’s awesome is I enjoyed studying quite a bit. 12th ended, I had cracked the coveted IIT JEE Examand was now to join the Department of Electrical Engineering at IIT Kharagpur as a fresher. I hoped to change my Department to Computer Science but that thought well … remained one.

My first semester in IIT Kharagpur was extremely uneventful. I hoped to join some society as they call it here. Groups of very talented people running a small scale organisation. These societies varied from Dancing and Music to Entrepreneurship and Robotics. I went to all the Interviews (well, almost all of them), was selected into none. So, as fate had it, I spent my time watching all the English TV Shows and Movies I so wanted to watch. I fell in love with shows like Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, and Suits. I spent hours on hours watching these shows. I had completely forgotten that studying was important. I really got engrossed by the idea of my starting my own startup (still am), so before Durga Puja holidays, I talked about this with my friend Yash Kariwal, and he was very excited after we came back from the Holidays, and this is how I started working on my first start up idea. Anyway, I managed to get a decent SGPA because everything taught in the first semester was very similar to what I had learned during JEE Preparation. I thought Second Semester would be similar and if I studied just a little bit more I would be able to get better than the decent SGPA I had got in the first semester. As it turns out, I was pretty wrong.

The second semester started, and the first month was very happening, with fests and events happening very regularly. It also saw me participating in my 1st Business Plan Competition and losing miserably. The whole month was an enjoyable experience. I was still not a part of any society. During February, AIESEC IIT Kharagpur had their interviews, I went to give the Group Discussions, and was not selected in even the Personal Interviews. I got to know that my room-mate was selected into the organisation after the Personal Interviews. I was furious, I could not understand what was wrong with me, I sent a nice long message to the Talent Management at AIESEC IIT Kharagpur and requested them to take a Personal Interview and see if I am worth their while. Sending them a message was probably one of the best decisions I had taken at IIT Kharagpur. They took a Personal Interview and selected me. Later on I was also selected as an Associate Member at Entrepreneurship Cell, IIT Kharagpur and was to organise my own event, the Entrepreneurship Awareness Drive (EAD).

AIESEC IIT Kharagpur had a Global Entrepreneurship Programme through which I could go to different countries and work on an Entrepreneurial Programme offered by many different Companies and NGOs. I convinced my parents, and everything was set, I was to go to Egypt for a 5 week internship and work on a marketing intern during my summer holidays. Obviously this was my first opportunity to go abroad all alone, be truly independent. Meet amazing new people and have true fun after studying for IIT JEE for so much time.

Amongst all these things, one thing I had completely forgotten about was, you guessed it – Studies. I did not study at all, not one bit. I thought to myself “I was able to get a decent SGPA last semester, how low could I fell this semester?” I barely studied for my exams, 1 day for one exam was my pattern for studies (Pathetic Technique). Results came out when I was in Dehradun doing work for my EAD there. Surprise surprise – I had failed my Mechanics course and had two options. Cancel my trip to Egypt, stay back in Kharagpur for the summer vacations to pass this course or go to Egypt and face a huge host of problems, which also included the possibility of having a year backlog. I could not risk a year back. I had to go back to Kharagpur. Telling my father was the most difficult thing.

I reached Kharagpur, registered for the Summer Quarter, Fortunately for me, Yash was also in Kharagpur and was working for Team KART for some time before going back to his home for vacations. We planned a trip to Kolkata to watch a movie and enjoy a little. We saw the movie and I was going to my Grandparent’s house in Kolkata in a local train when I received a Whatsapp Message, It was a message from the person who was going to pick me up from the airport in Egypt telling me where to find him. The people at Egypt had not told the person who was to pick me up that I would not be coming. I could not think anything, I just was feeling miserable, all that urge to enjoy. Everything bad that had happened with me was coming to my mind. I wanted to jump off the train and just finish things. I had gone from being an average student in Class 10th to the top of the batch in Class 12th. I had gotten an All India Rank 2 in one of the Entrance Examinations. From that to failing in my first year in college.

I didn’t really do anything though, I realised how life is going to drop me down to the deepest ditches and I got to pick myself up and be awesome.

I'll admit I'm a bit of a lurker and all I've ever done is stalked this subreddit for tidbits of advice I could use to help myself out, but this time I've come to you guys for some help/advice.

To give you guys some background about myself, I am a Senior in a highly competitive highschool located in Southern California. I currently live with my parents so I do not pay for living/housing/food expenses aside from when I hang out with my friends (occasionally). I have only ever been interested in/taken the highest level math and science courses offered to me, and have successfully managed to get into a highly prestigious engineering college located in Los Angeles on a full scholarship to study Computer Science (along with many other scholarship offers from local colleges of equivalent caliber). On the other hand, I do plan on paying for Graduate school.

Currently I am working at a local medical distribution company as a data analyst/SEO Specialist at a rate of $20/hour with added bonuses and pay raises that will correspond with my level of dedication. I have been putting in a consistent 40 hours/week and expect to work there until September of this year. I say this because I'm unsure of whether I will stay local for college (pay minimal tuition with help from scholarships) and keep the job, or go to a college in LA on a full scholarship but lose the job. In addition, I will be filling out 1099 tax forms which should help me out a bit.

I have no debt, no prior investments or financial issues of any kind. This is my 4th job that I've held in the past 2 years - my prior employers being Google, Box.com, and MedImpact - companies which I worked for during the summers as an intern. Knowing myself, I have a tendency to spend my money frivolously and generally with little regard for my future; however, since this is my first time being able to earn a large amount for myself with little to no expenditures I'd like to know how I could best save/invest my money so I can get the best return on it in the years to come. Simply put, I'm a ""clean slate"" that's afraid of making a financial mistake I will regret down the line. Any/all help and advice is greatly appreciated!

2uuppf,1,2015-02-05,The company behind Tribes:Ascend and SMITE prove once again how bad of a gaming company they are,[deleted],gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/2uuppf/the_company_behind_tribesascend_and_smite_prove/,"**So Hirez the company behind Tribes:Ascend and SMITE have proved once again how bad they are as a company this time by protecting the most toxic player in their community from getting punished while punishing with a perma-ban another player.**

This is the original post from the guy 

&gt;This post is not a witch hunt. It is meant to highlight possible abuse of power by a Hirez employee and approval of it by the support staff, and hopefully encourage others to actually care about it. I'm also curious if the community thinks this is fair. Also, sorry if the formatting is awful! Please let me know if I can make it easier to read.

&gt;Preface: Decided to solo queue on the new PTS, on which I had previously changed my name to ""DMsFangirl"" as a joke. Ended up in a game with a Hirez employee who happened to be streaming, who accused me of harassing him with my name, and said he was going to personally get me banned. He ended up being the only harasser throughout the next couple matches. The next day I ended up being permanently banned , so my offense was apparently on the level of “death threats, hacking, fradulent purchases, and employee impersonation.” The employee in question has done this to people in the past, and Hirez should not be allowing it.

&gt;Direct Quotes From His Stream:

&gt;""Apparently DMsFangirl is SoupKitchen, cool. That is harassment, and that will get you banned.""
(How is that harassment? So if I see “SoupKitchensFanGirl,” that's considered harassment and is a bannable offense? Would you honestly feel harassed by someone having FanGirl after your ign?)

&gt;""So apparently he's like repeatedly changing his name. Doesn't matter, we have a vod of it. I'll send it to X (support employee's name) after this.""
(I changed my name after a friend told me the employee accused me of harassment, because it was meant as a harmless joke when I played on PTS with my friends, not as a way to “harass” anyone. This is relevant when considering the support team's justification of my ban (below).)

&gt;“Great job SoupKitchen. That's why you did badly in the Combine.”
(He said this after killing me. I didn't want to include any irrelevant bming, but it further shows that his ban request was more a result of his resentment instead of anything bad I had actually done. Also, that's not an okay thing for an employee to say.)

&gt;Support's Justification of my Ban (Response to my email which contained vods and my defense):

&gt;“This was the second time that you have harassed a Hi-Rez Studios employee (In the past, I joined a clan with a [Juice] tag with a fake letter and received a 3-day suspension for match griefing, which was fair). Under normal circumstances, harassing an employee would result in an immediate account ban, but we decided to give you a regular suspension with the assumption that you would stop. Since you did not stop and continued to take actions in game specifically directed at an employee, your account was banned.”
There are huge problems with this justification. The first being that having the name ""DMsFanGirl"" is not an example of harassment in the slightest (see thoughts on first quote). Second, as mentioned after the second quote, I changed my name immediately after the first match, because I was not expecting 1) to be in a match with the employee and 2) anyone to somehow take offense to the name. This is very important, because Support's main defense towards my ban was “continuing to take actions in game specifically directed at an employee,” which was clearly not the case. Lastly, there is a huge inconsistency in their actions here and what is listed in the Suspension/Ban Policy on the Hirez website. If I had known that simply ending up in a game with the employee would result in a permanent ban, I would actively avoid him at all costs. Instead, I was given no warning because of their “assumption,” and was unfairly banned for what was pretty much being in the same game as him (blanketed by his cries of “harassment”). What would be a fair course of action for my “harassment” is a 7-day suspension, as is consistent with their previous actions and policies, and an actual warning (hint: not an assumption) that anything in the future WILL result in a permanent ban, because well, we don't have it written in our policy.

&gt;It is not okay for any employee to freely give out undeserved permanent bans (directly or indirectly) to anyone they don't like, when the ban both completely ignores their written policies, and has no real significant causation behind it. Players should not be permanently banned because an employee doesn't like them. Hirez support staff should also be fair and unbiased in every situation they encounter, and this honestly seems like they just did what the employee wanted, not what was fair. Or do you guys think this is okay?

&gt;Tl;dr: Hirez employee gets me banned for a harmless name because he doesn't like me, then Support defends it and ignores the written suspension/ban policies. Support seems to automatically back the employee and keep the ban, seemingly without even viewing vods and listening to the appeal with an unbiased attitude. Do you think this should be approved of by Support and, and Hirez as a whole?

**And this is the answer of the President of Hirez** 

&gt;Hi all-

&gt;I have spent the morning investigating this issue, getting the perspectives of many different people and looking closely at the facts of the situation.

&gt;Sometimes complex issues do not distill well into internet discussions on Reddit (perhaps an understatement!). But I at least wanted to respond with my immediate thoughts and findings, as well as some clarifications on policy and how bans work.

&gt;I'm not sure it's productive or appropriate to go fully into all of the details of the OP's individual situation. But I will say that after reviewing the facts of the case with our support team, I stand by the ban and feel it was appropriate, if actually late (I probably would have banned the user earlier). In this case, there was a clear established pattern over months of intent to harass and diminish the experience of another player, that spanned well beyond the one final incident and is backed by a variety of chat logs and other evidence.

&gt;IF I apply the broad standard: ""Would I have banned this player if I saw a similar pattern over long periods if they had done something similar to any other player and it had been noticed"" -- my answer is yes.

&gt;That said, I think the thread and the response it has solicited warrants some other points to be made and questions answered.

&gt;CAN STREAMERS AND REGULAR EMPLOYEES BAN PLAYERS?

&gt;No. All players are banned through the support team following our established process. We work very hard to establish a fair standard for banning, regardless of the source of a report. Occasionally we do make mistakes, but there is a review process that is fairly decent at catching those mistakes and we try very hard to improve this process consistently over time.

&gt;Because at the end of the day this is a human endeavor, it is true that employees sometimes can draw attention to an individual player or situation in a way that is outside of the regular processes available to non-employees. But the standard for banning is not higher or lower based on the source of the report. (As perhaps an imperfect analogy--&gt;If I pass a police officer, flick him off, hit the gas and then start driving above the speed limit, I would expect there would be a higher probability of getting caught for speeding than if I were simply driving a little too fast on an empty road at night. But, either way, I am still speeding and the police officer needs to present evidence of the speeding to a judge to prove it. I SHOULD get a ticket in both situations, I just got lucky in the case where I wasn't caught).

&gt;Our goal would be to catch and take action on all bad player behavior. Unfortunately, we do not yet always meet that standard. But when bad behavior is noticed, we do try to apply fair standards around its application. And we are working hard to improve our overall process so we are more consistent in finding the bad players and rooting them out.

&gt;DOES DMBRANDON NEED TO IMPROVE HOW HE INTERACTS WITH THE COMMUNITY?

&gt;Absolutely Yes. The fact that the OP was at fault in this situation, does not mean that DM acted fully appropriately in this situation, or that he does not have areas in which he needs to improve upon.

&gt;It's not productive to go deep into this topic publicly. But DM and I have discussed this in depth. He has agreed to take a variety of actions to help improve his interaction with the community. He is held to no different standard than any other player -- and is not above reproach.

&gt;At the same time, having worked with him closely, I do think he is committed to improving and fully support his efforts to do so.

&gt;DOES HI-REZ NEED TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT OUR PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS AROUND PLAYER TOXICITY AND BANS

&gt;Absolutely Yes. I think there is room for us to improve in this situation.

&gt;Among other actions we are taking internally, I am happy that great community member and captain of Titan eSports, CaptCoach, has agreed to help use his University internship to help us identify and improve areas for improvement in our whole system of player reporting, banning and dealing with player toxicity. We will make sure we are looking hard in the mirror at ourselves to keep our standards high in this area and to constantly improve.

&gt;I think I am out of room! Sorry this translated to so long a note. We will continue to look into how we can get better and thanks for the feedback.&gt;

As you can see the player gets a perma-ban while their Hirez employee which he is considered the most toxic guy in the whole community to the point that he is banned from our reddit gets a free pass for the 1000th time. This is not the first time that DM got into trouble for his insanely toxic behavior yet Hirez, for the shitty company that they are, they protect him cause his channel has the most viewers. 

**TLDR:** Hirez for once again puts money over their community which they will gladly ban while keeping their toxic employee unpunished. Don't ever support such scammy company."
2uusj0,6,2015-02-05,Should I tell my current advisor that his colleague fired me a few years ago?,[deleted],GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/2uusj0/should_i_tell_my_current_advisor_that_his/,"When I had just graduated from undergrad, I got a prestigious paid internship abroad with a big wig in my field. It ended up being a disaster. I worked under his grad student, who had a reputation for being terrible to work with. She was rude and demanding, not to mention sexist (she once said out loud in front of the big wig that women in science should never have kids if they truly cared about science, the big wig himself said nothing in response). Since I was very intimidated, and also a derpy recent graduate, I did not learn the necessary skills and I made mistake after mistake. I was fired after a month of being there. I ended up working with another lab and doing fine, but the experience was very embarrassing for me. 


Fast forward three years later. I got a master's degree, and now am a 1st year PhD student in a new lab. My new advisor is awesome and we have a great working relationship. Here's the thing- he is friends with the big wig that fired me. They went to the same school, although they don't work in the same subfield. My advisor is teaching an undergrad class for which I am the TA, and I feel awkward because in class he talks about the big wig's research frequently, referring to him as ""my friend big wig.""



Should I tell my advisor I was fired a few years ago by his friend? I am worried he may hear it from him, instead of me. Or worse, there will be an awkward encounter when he tries to introduce me and finds out we know each other. 



I haven't told him yet for a couple of reasons: 1) because we are still getting to know each other, and 2) just last semester I had a similarly terrible working experience with a different professor I was TAing for, and long story short I ended up leaving my TA position. The professor is being investigated by the department for making us work 40+ hrs/week among other things. But I worry that if I tell my advisor about being fired 3 years ago, it will be too close to this event, and it will just sound like I am a gamble to work with. 

**tl/dr: I was fired as a paid intern three years ago, now I am in a new lab. My new advisor is friends with the guy that fired me. Should I tell him?**"

2uuum0,9,2015-02-05,I feel like a shell of my former shelf,[deleted],getting_over_it,https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/2uuum0/i_feel_like_a_shell_of_my_former_shelf/,"I never know how to start these things mostly because I'm so fed up of feeling this way I like to try and think I don't than admit it again and again. In the end though, I'm just not myself.

I feel this will be more of me expressing the source of my pain than any specific question but I'll try to keep it short.

- No one ever really liked me. I was bullied in high school, never had a GF, etc...
- I got kicked out of my semi-private high school because I lacked motivation to get better grades and coasted as much as possible. 
- My first GF came at 18 but it didn't last long. She left me soon after because I wasn't the same religion as her father and had no long term place in her life. It hurt but I understand it and based on her actions afterwards that was more of an excuse, it wouldn't have worked out anyway.
- I joined Cegep after high school(In quebec, we have grades 12-13 as cegep/college). When I joined I also got kicked out for grades.
- I had always had minor moments of depression because of the bullying and all that but in 2006-2007 I felt worthless as an individual. I dropped out of school and did not work. I became a cocaine addict for 2 years. During 2007 I had a 1 night stand with a random in something I consider out of the norm for me. She was a lot older than I was and she had been shared with multiple guys that night after me. 
- Mid 2007 I stopped cocaine cold turkey and began talking to a girl who I pretty much felt I had no chance with. We spoke online and had a mutual friend.
- I ended up dating her for a long time. Feb 3rd was the first day we became official, just over 7 years ago. It was weird because when we first started dating I was completely unmotivated and she was working, had classes, worked out. I mean, I looked up to her and she inspired me. It's not that she was doing anything amazing but I started to have thoughts that I could become a father and I had found my wife. I went back to university where for the 3rd time in my life was told I would get kicked out if my GPA did not increase. I decided I couldn't let it happen again so I worked harder and took even more classes resulting in better grades and I eventually completed my engineering degree this past December. I had 4 internship semesters under my belt and the grades to pursue a masters degree so all was going well. I had intended to eventually move in with my GF once I found a full time job this year. It should be noted that she suffered from depression for half of our relationship. As I got better in my life she started to get worse, I don't know why.
- While it seems like everything was now better my world came crashing down a bit. My GF left me in May, citing my lack of adventure and added weight as long term issues I had not addressed. I had been going to work full time and school full time so I was essentially burnt out but I understood why it was important to her and after countless warnings she eventually left me. The part that was difficult is she had told me days after she began 'texting' another guy casually to which I was clearly offended as we had been bestfriends and a couple for 6+ years. To make the story very short, we got back together but later confessed that she had met the guy in person a week before she left me and fooled around with him. She then left me out of guilt and saw him twice more before cutting him off. FYI: We are currently not together. After I heard the news, I couldn't.
- My ex is going through a tough time, cheating and lies aside she had a jaw surgery which has gone bad to her standards and she will have her 3rd surgery to correct the problem this month. It caused her to have a lot of depression, including guilt for what she did with me.

I'm kind of at a point in my life where I want to be better, I've seen a therapist, taken meds and all that but for the last half a year I've suffered from anxiety, depressed and panic attacks. I've lost my motivation really. I had my life figured out and now I'm kind of left with so much confusion, doubt and emotion. Most days, like today, I just shut myself down. I woke up at 3 pm today and went back to bed at 9 pm I think. I've thought of suicide, although I chalk this up to spikes of depression more than a constant desire to die. I've thought of fighting the guy who she cheated with, mostly because I hate what he symbolizes. After years of being bullied heavily, it's hard to feel that as a grown man I have to watch another person come hurt me and walk away unphased. I know it's not his fault and no, I haven't fought him. I'm just being honest and open about how I feel.

It's so difficult for me because I had thought myself to be stronger. I am generally a calm person, I despise fighting verbally or physically but I've become more ticked off out of the blue, more uneasy or an edge if you will. I was never good with presenting in front of coworkers and/or classmates but I overcame that fear throughout my degree. Now I need meds to make it through a phone interview, it's discouraging feeling as if I took 1 step forward, 2 steps back.

I'm not sure what I'm getting at but I guess I needed to let it out. I'm just plain sad. I just want everyone to be happy, including the guy I just said I want to fight. I don't crave a life like this. I just want to be me again but I feel so far away from that.

You have to understand, I don't live in poor conditions, I'm not alone. I have friends, I have money and I have a normal middle class family. In some ways I should just shut my mouth and be a strong person because people in this world have it 100X worse than I do. I know this but somehow it eats up at me anyway, this notion that I always revert back to this depression, if not by my own accord, a higher being makes sure to keep me here.

I just want to be happy, like everyone else but I honestly don't know where to start anymore. Like I said, this post isn't really going anywhere but if I knew where I was going, I probably wouldn't be posting. 

I don't even know what advice to ask for, in reality I hate when people shove ideas down my throat. I guess all I want is someone to just be cool and tell me shit sucks and can relate with me. Can relate with a feeling that your vision of life turns upside down and you're just confused as what to do next. Just give me that and I think I'll cry less.

If you made it up to here, even if you don't post...thanks for reading and I hope you have a great day whoever you are."

2uuxnt,1,2015-02-05,post-college anxiety/depression,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2uuxnt/postcollege_anxietydepression/,"I started writing a post on the depression and anxiety subreddit, but I think all in all it makes sense to write it here. First, I've probably written and deleted this post several times. To be honest, I'm kind of nervous posting. I have used online forums before, but I sometimes feel that my depression/anxiety isn't warranted (even though I have had it all my life-my post-college anxiety/depression is just a different phase that I'm having a harder time handling than my previous episodes of anxiety/depression). Nevertheless, I think it will be good for me to get it off my chest and talk to people who may be going through something similar or who may have overcome it.
This may be a long post, so bear with me if you can.


I graduated last May from what people think is a good major in healthcare. Following my graduation, I applied to maybe 60, 70 jobs. Everyday, I was busting out 7-8 job apps. Heard nothing back. Finally, I realized it was futile and started studying for my board exams, which I'm not sure yet if I passed or not. I'm back to the job search, but I haven't mustered up the energy to apply to jobs the way I was applying before. Everyday, I look at a posting and then spend way too long deciding whether I should apply or not. I'm trying to do some online tutorials/gain skills/use LinkedIn to email people in between, but setting myself a schedule has been hard. I can't fall asleep until 3AM, somedays even later (even though I'm in bed early). I wake up around 11:30AM-12PM everyday. The whole day just seems to go by like that and I feel like I'm not getting anything done. What is worse is, since probably August, I am feeling way too bored to get anything done. I'm losing motivation. I don't have any real goal in mind. I'm trying to apply to alternative positions which I don't know if I will qualify for. I just feel like I never truly enjoyed school nor my major and have no clue what I'm doing in life as I'm struggling to find a job and it's a weird feeling, especially because as a high school student, I've had a very type A like personality. I used to be organized, focused and was really motivated to get into a good college. I didn't have a real idea of what I wanted to study at the time, but I figured I'd figure it out while in college. Moreover, I was looking forward for college to be a place where I can make lifelong friends. I was moving around a lot as a teen and never really made friends in high school. 

But when I came to college, things didn't turn out the way I'd hoped. It took me a while to make friends, and the people I met seemed to value my friendships because I took good notes, did all the homework on time, etc. I got into a good program, but I didn't know if that was truly what I wanted to do with my life, but since it seemed like a great opportunity, it seemed too good to turn down. As I entered my most important years, my field started to have a saturation. I learned this the hard way-because during school, most students are expected to work as interns so that they can get a job upon graduation. I was one of the few students starting to have issues with the job search-despite numerous phone calls, in person meetings, etc. I could not find an internship. I even consulted a speech pathologist and my peers for help, but most people seemed to indicate I was doing the things they were doing and am just meeting up with tough luck. I started googling and found out that my major is going through a lot of difficulties, but it was too late for me at that point to change my mind. Without intern experience in an increasingly saturated job market for my field, I have little to nothing to help me stand out now that I'm looking for my ""real world"" job, even though I did a lot of different leadership activities and creative things as a student-just none were relevant to my major. I had one interview where the guy told me ""you've been more involved than I have ever been in my life, but you don't have intern experience, and that's my biggest concern here"". 

I started to burn out in school due to classmates using me and not finding a job, and ultimately, it's effects are very apparent as I am now looking for a real world job. I just feel exhausted and it's taking a lot to muster up energy to remain organized to find a job. I stay at home most of the day because I don't have friends to hang out with. I spend a lot of time on social media because social media is the only place I feel like I have a ""social life""...and people find me to be funny online. To be honest, my dream would be to do stand-up someday or be a comedy writer as a side-thing, but I have too much social/performance anxiety (I'm pretty socially awkward in person). And with my increasing difficulty in staying motivated, it's becoming harder for me to make good jokes as well, which just ultimately makes me feel like I have no life lol. 

I guess my first priority is to get motivated and find a job, but it's been tough. With little to no connections &amp; uncertainty of what will actually work for me, I'm feeling increasingly directionless. Simultaneously, I feel guilty for posting about this. Because I did finish college, I have a degree and I should be excited and grateful. But the reality is, I didn't actually enjoy school, socially nor academically. I also have a lot of personal issues at home: family illnesses and financial issues, that is becoming taxing on me. Without a close friend to really talk about this, it's been tough. Every person in my household also has anxiety/depression that makes it hard for me to articulate and feel valid for my anxiety/depression. I'm hoping somebody here could hear me out: if you're going through something similar or especially if you have overcome, please feel free to reply or privately message me. I want to program my mind to feel at least more motivated and organized than I am right now.

2uv4wz,7,2015-02-05,First year scheduling - advice,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2uv4wz/first_year_scheduling_advice/,"I'm a first year in audit with no audit intern experience. I work at a ""national"".





When I started in November I was told that I would be in a certain specialization and only work in that specialization because its so different than other things. The group is pretty small and I have only met people within our group because I never work with other people. I literally know no one when I'm at the office.




Last week I was told they finished my next client early so I would not be working on it and now I am unassigned for this week and next week during busy season.





A few days later I received an email from scheduling telling me that there will be a lot of shifting in my specialization's scheduling and that my schedule will appear very ""open"" but not to worry and that it will fill up again.


She did not specify if I would still be working in that group or not.
All of the clients I have in that specialization are off my schedule. I am left with one tech (end of April) &amp; one FS client (in 2 weeks) that were on from before but the specialization one's are still gone.


Yesterday she added me to a two day long consulting thing (not even in audit) and I have pretty much just a ton of data entry work for the rest of the week. She also added me to a retail client so for the entire month I won't be in the industry I'm supposed to be in and learning in.


I wouldn't mind but I have these concerns:

1. Have I been kicked out of my industry and no one will ever tell me? If so, what did I do wrong? I thought I was getting along well with the socialble people and doing my job well for a 1st year.

I was only on one busy season client (3 weeks) in that industry so far and I thought I was liked and keeping up with the other first year &amp; interns. The last week on that client the senior became kind of a dick but he was like that towards everyone on the team not just me. The other first year was anti social and seemed like he was learning less/retaining less and doing less in the client file than me.

2. What if I'm expected to work in this industry during next busy season but I won't have gotten enough knowledge and experience during this first busy season because of scheduling on a mishmash of clients and will perform worse than my peers?


3. I want to know if I was taken off of all of my specialization's clients because no one wants to work with me or because they really are shifting a few things around.


I'm not sure if I should contact scheduling, perhaps a senior from my prior engagement, or my career advisor. I don't want to seem difficult or fussy but I don't want to get lost in the machine and have poor experience and performance later on due to this.


Thanks!"

I would appreciate any advice or insight you could give.  I just turned 23, he's about to turn 25, and we've been together almost 2 years. 

I live with my boyfriend (""Dan""). He's a great, great guy. I love him a lot and he's a really decent person.  my problem is my level of stress due to being a sole provider. 

Let me give some background. 

We are both exmormons living in utah. It's a tough place to live, given our situation.  I was going to BYU up until about a year ago, but was seriously struggling emotionally due to all the hiding that comes with being an exmormon there.  My boyfriend was going ot a nearby school.  We moved in together about a year ago and got our own place in June of 2014.  To pay for our own place, I decided to get a full time job and quit BYU.  

I told Dan that he could focus on finishing up school and I will work to take care of most of our expenses. While in school, Dan worked a part time job (~15-20 hrs/week) making minimum wage on campus. He would help out with expenses when we can, but I was making about 75-80% of our total income.  I was very lucky to land a job in early July 2014 that pays me over $17/hr, which is a lot given that I don't have a degree.  About half my take home each month goes to our bills. 

Dan completed his degree in December 2014. His chosen field does not yield many opportunities, especially in Utah (he wants to be involved in political campaigns, especially environmentalist stuff).  We both have agreed to leave Utah for a new state this upcoming summer.  

I don't know if I can make it, though.  I am so stressed out at my job. It's a great job and a good environment and I am lucky to have it.  But the long hours, the nature of the job, and (mainly) knowing that our lives depend on me working this job makes me so god damn depressed.  I work 8-5 monday-friday and I am not handling it well. I have gotten more and more stressed, more depressed as time goes on.  I hate feeling like I have no choice but to work. Dan has told me so many times he feels terrible that he's not bringing home a lot of money right now.  

He landed a paid internship at his college about a month ago, but his boss/old teacher only got the paperwork signed this week, so he may not even get paid for all the work he's done for the past several weeks! since his graduation, our lives have depended strictly on me. The internship should be a good opportunity, since it's in his chosen field and will help his resume. It's supposed to be $10/hr, 28 hrs/week.  But even then, almost all our money will be coming from me.  

He has told me that he will take care of me. When we move, it will be my turn to finish up school and he says he will support me through it as I have supported him.  I know he absolutely means it, but is it even a feasible idea? I don't know if he can do it due to the nature of his field and it drives me absolutely insanely depressed to think that this is my life and I am stuck in it.  

What makes it even worse is that my depression is causing me to be less frugal than usual, so I am not even saving money like I should be.   Logically, I know I should just fight it out and remain at this job until we move in summer.  But emotionally, I don't know if I can handle it and it kills me to think that, despite all his love and good intentions, Dan can't take care of me because I definitely need a break.

Help, please. 

**TL;DR** I feel like I am drowning at my job, but I am supporting myself and my boyfriend.  He says there's a light at the end of the tunnel, but I don't see it.  I don't know what to do and my emotional state is getting worse and worse. Sometimes I feel ok, but more and more often I am frantically depressed."

2uwezp,1,2015-02-05,Masters in Computer Science,TheMokaPot,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2uwezp/masters_in_computer_science/,"I'm currently a graduating senior at a ""well known"" university (top 30). My university has a 1~2 year Master's program.

I don't plan on going into research but having started the major in my Junior year, I feel like I don't have enough knowledge of computer science or any internships to prove useful (or desirable). I've taken OS, Compilers, Networking, etc, but not security or distributed computing and what not.

To be honest, I also want to stay in college for another year or two. The environment, community, and just the atmosphere is awesome here and I don't know if it's replicated anywhere else in the professional world. 

Should I go ahead and aim for this MS or go into the industry? How important is a master's degree in the industry? How many doors or what kind of doors will it open?"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How did you meet MatPat? and How did you convinced him to put Crossover in his channel?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cobmxzc?context=5)|I've known Matt since he uploaded the FIRST EPISODE OF GAME THEORY on ScrewAttack.com!  I was an intern at the time and was in charge of promoting community content, but I immediately fell in love with Game Theory and promoted it every time Matt uploaded an episode.
 |Every time I promoted it, I sent him an email and we got talking.  Matt has claimed to me that if I had not given Game Theory that initial audience and push that it might not be the success it is today, but I completely disagree.  I think the show is great enough that it would have gotten huge sometime or another.
 |So when Matt did his video game crossover episode of the show, I was inspired to make as many connections as I could.  This lead to the creation of my crossover database and is what inspired me to make Crossover in the first place.  I whipped up the first episode and showed it to Matt and he DEMANDED that I make it part of the Game Theorists.  The rest is history!
[I didn't know you knew Matt for so long, in that case,  I guess that means it wasn't so hard to get him to do the nintendo-verse crossover.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cobnl5b?context=5)|It wasn't hard in the slightest!  People assume that the video was the best in the series because Matt wrote it, but in fact, Kenny and I wrote that one hundred percent!
[Ever though about doing another episode with him, or being in an episode of Game Theory? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cobo5u0?context=5)|Matt and I are currently in talks about bringing me on for an episode of Game Theory, but who knows when and if that will ever happen, haha!  Matt is the busiest person I know!
[Which characters do you mean in each smash bros game? What specifically do you like about them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cock908?context=5)|N64: Samus.  She just feels the most... my style out of all of the characters in the original.
 |Melee: Fox.  Come on.  No items, Fox only, Final Destination?  I practically invited that crap!  Pure speed, hitting your opponents before they can hit you!
 |Brawl: Zelda/Shiek.  These two have INSANE versatility!  if I need to be speedy, there's Sheik, but if I am dealing with someone with a lot of projectiles, Zelda is the best way to reflect, fight from a distance, and quickly get away from close combat.
 |Wii U/3DS.  LITTLE MAC!  This guy is a POWERHOUSE!  He's strong, quick, and has tight control!  Sure, he's defenseless in the air and has no recovery, but if you can dodge/counter enough attacks, there won't be any trouble at all!
[Bunch of random questions, some might have been asked: what are your top 5 video games of all time? what do you currently game on? Have you ever tried gaming while blindfolded? What is your favorite genre of games? what is your favorite movie? And finally would you rather fight one left shark sized duck or 100 duck sized left sharks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cobsqyf?context=5)|I actually don't have a favorite game or a top five.  I like so many games and I think so many are equally good that I can't narrow it down.
 |I am currently on multiple games.  I am playing Phoenix Wright: Trials and Tribulations, Papers Please, EarthBound, and Papers Please.  I kind of bounce between them all at the same time.
 |I have tried gaming while blindfolded!  My friend tried navigating me in Super Mario Bros, but that... did not work out too well.
 |My favorite genre is platforming games.  I think the require the most skill to play.
 |My favorite movie is The Fifth Element.
 |That last one is a variation on an old classic!  I think I'd fight a shark sized duck!
[What do you think about gamergate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/coc8rl6?context=5)|Are people still discussing GamerGate?  I thought that finally quieted down.  I supported what GamerGate was initially about, getting corruption out of ""game journalism"".  However, what it turned into is just plain embarrassing.
[Can you add subtitles, like the non, shit ones youtube does?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/coc8rl6?context=5)|As for subtitles, yes I can.  I am starting to upload my scripts for any videos that have them and converting them into subtitles, but for my more improved stuff, I do not.  It's a PAIN IN THE ASS to transcribe every word that I say so I just don't do it.
[How do you plan to keep things going as you get older?  Do you plan to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cod496o?context=5)|Most of my colleges refuse to believe me when I say this, but I do not think that YouTube can be a life long career.
[(also curious as I've been meaning to make some Let's Plays to showcase some games I like that not many may have heard of, and am curious as to the lifetime of a youtuber career\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cod496o?context=5)|For me.  I am keeping a close eye on the skills that I have been building through my job.  I know the ins and outs of social media, dealing with the public is something I do every day, I have to network CONSTANTLY, and I have charisma.  Those are all skills that can not be taught and are extremely valuable in the job market.
[Who are your influences? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/coc5bb9?context=5)|Too many to list!  What sets me apart from many other professional YouTubers is that I watch A LOT of YouTube.  Most people I know in the industry only watch a few people if any.
 |I keep up with over a hundred channels and I try to take inspiration from all of them.  If I see them do something that I like and that I think would mesh well with my style, I find a way to put my own spin on it.
[Is there a game that you just can't get enough off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/coc6pq1?context=5)|I can NOT get enough Animal Crossing.  The zen feeling that it gives me is soothing and relaxing.
[Also, in your opinion, best game out there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/coc6pq1?context=5)|As for what I think is the best game out there.  It might seem weird, but Shovel Knight.  I literally can not think of a single thing that can be improved on in that game.  The only thing that could make it better is being able to play as the other knights, but look at that!  It's going to be free DLC!
[1\) can you discuss the deal you have with youtube? i.e. what you get for views/likes/comments/ads/subscribers?  2\) are there any alternative ways you can get your content/subscriber base monetized that we don't really know about (i guess besides ads and direct compensation by youtube\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cobn2mq?context=5)|1) I have no exact numbers for my work on Game Theory, but on my main channel, I get roughly a million views a month, THOUSANDS of likes and comments, the occasional ad, and almost seventy thousand subscribers.  2) Without going directly through YouTube and AdSense, you need to partner with a network in order to monetize your videos.
[3\) what would you like to see happen to the infrastructure/market of video streaming?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cobn2mq?context=5)|3) I would love video streaming and content to be taken WAY more seriously.  Right now, it is viewed as ""not real entertainment"", but in time, I think we'll see most companies spending their advertising budget on web content over traditional media.
[How are you compensated by youtube? by # of views, likes, subs, or a combination of all? and what is the rate? I'm sorry if it looks like i'm trying to get sinsitive info out of you but I need these values for my analysis.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cobnl74?context=5)|It's really complicated to be honest.  It's a complex algorithm based on people seeing the ads, how long they watch it, if people click on them, if they skip them, etc.
 |There really isn't a set rate considering that it's always in flux.  For example, rates more than double as it gets close to the holidays and companies are spending more money on advertisement.  Here in January, the rates are pitiful since everyone spent their advertising budgets during the holidays. :/
[If I remember correctly you've also been pursuing a career in voice over work.  If you could be cast as ANY character to provide the voice of who would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cobnehi?context=5)|Yeah, at one point I seriously wanted to be a professional voice over artist, but that's a LOT harder than it looks.  I auditioned for the role of Brief in ""Panty and Stocking"", but I obviously did not get the roll.
[Has that 6 changed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cobnehi?context=5)|If I could voice any character though, I think that I be able to deliver a fine Tim Drake Robin!
[ what do you think of boats?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cobnehi?context=5)|As for trains, I sill have fond memories from when I was a kid, but I am not as smitten as I once was.  As for boats, they're alright.  They rock a little too much for my taste though. :/
[What are your thoughts on the Oculus Rift and is it a step in the right direction for the future of video games ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cobncde?context=5)|I actually have not experienced the Oculus Rift, but many of my friends and colleagues have!  Based on what I have heard from them, it's not quite the future of gaming, but I could totally see it getting there one day.
 |The biggest thing is that you can't physically move around in a 3D environment.  I think that the Oculus and other VR headsets will be the future of porn before they're the future of gaming. :P.
[Can you talk about your outlook? Would it be unreasonable for you to expect to earn 100k+ from your videos at some point?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/coc6vir?context=5)|I think it is possible for me to make six figures, but I am not expecting it at all.  The fact that I am able to make the substantial living that I currently have is more than enough for me.  I don't want to be rich.  I just want to do what I love for a living and make people smile along the way.
[Do you think youtube monetizes better relative to Twitch (or in the long term, do recorded/edited/produced videos monetize better than streaming?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/coc6vir?context=5)|Unfortunately, I do not have much experience with Twitch so I can't discuss comparisons between it and YouTube from a financial perspective. :/
[Can you create the weirdest crossover within 5 turns?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cocnr8c?context=5)|Love Plus to Scribblenauts through Scribblenauts to Zelda through Scribblenauts Unlimited to Soul Calibur through Soul Calibur II to Assassin's Creed through Soul Calibur V to Beyond Good and Evil through Academy of Champions: Soccer.
 |If you had given me the full six, I can get from Love Plus all the way to Brutal Legend for maximum weirdness. ;P.
[Hey Drake! What was your favorite video that you created? Which was the most fun to work on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/coby19v?context=5)|That would be my theory of [the Nintendo Universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kRY1RzwBtE) guest starring MatPat.  Not only did I have the most fun researching and scripting it, but I got to make it with two of my best friends!
 |I just wish that I could re-do it now.  I think I have gotten much better at editing since then.

We have a pool of floating linked clones for student use that uses Persona. Lately, a few of them have been reporting to me that when they try to open Chrome, it refuses to run. One of the interns discovered that the Chrome process is running in Task Manager at login, but if the process is ended, Chrome will start just fine. If possible, we don't want to inconvenience our students by making them go through this step every time they log in. I've Googled, but haven't found any solutions that seem like they would work for an entire pool of linked clones, just short term or single desktop fixes. Does anyone have experience with this sort of thing? Is there something I can do on the base image to fix the problem with a new snapshot and recompose operation?"
2uwoeg,1,2015-02-05,I have an automated skype interview with a top software programming company -- I have some questions.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2uwoeg/i_have_an_automated_skype_interview_with_a_top/,"Hello /r/CsCareerQuestions,

I am 2nd year CS student and have applied for a 12 month placement with a world-class software design company's London office, I have passed the original CV and online test stages and have now been accepted for the next stage; an online webcam interview which requires me to answer a series of pre-recorded questions with my webcam active while being recorded, the 'interview' will then be sent to the company and assessed. 

As the interview is with a robot instead of a real person, I can start the interview at any given time -- but I wanted to research these types of interviews a bit beforehand, and I have some questions such as:

* What sort of questions should I expect to be asked? 
* What sort of technical questions are likely to be asked? 
* Are there any 'buzzwords' or pre-prepared statements I should throw in for extra brownie points?
* For behavior-based questions, what sort of traits do these sort of companies like to see in potential interns?
* For technical questions, how should I react if I don't know the answer? 

I think I would be less nervous if there interview were with a real person, I feel like it's going to be awkward trying to answer pre-recorded questions while starring into a webcam.

Thank you! "

Again. You should say no, but you know you can't, even if you wanted to. It just feels too amazing, even if you hate yourself afterwards.

let's rewind a little bit. You were living the perfect life, or so you thought. Married, Kids, good job it couldn't have gotten better, but.. at the same time, maybe the last few months or so thigns started happening, the sex is uneventful, if happening at all, but still life was good. But then a wrench got thrown into the mixture. 

that wrench would be me. the saucy little minx (who has her own issues at home) who has turned your life around to be amazing, but at the same time, far from. 

The next few questions are, who are we? Am i the student in your class? the shy girl who seems invisible? or the popular out going girl? perhaps the principal and the goth/rebel girl?

perhaps you're my coach. Perhaps you're the town sherrif and I'm the daughter of someone influential/rich in town, or the town drunk's daughter? 

Maybe you're the mayor having an affair with an intern? Perhaps the neighbor who succumbed to the wily temptress nextdoor. Or the boss's daughter you could loose your job for. 

Those are just some of my basic ideas, if you have any that you find fun, or would like to suggest, let me know I'm open to any ideas :P

I'm open to all sorts of kinks/fetishes, likes and so on, im just not that overly into bdsm, i dont mind it minorly. I do enjoy my character ending up pregnant though, ive got a bit of a cum fetish :P

I have been invited to take an internship assessment test that could match me with a potential internship opportunity, specifically application development, at a well-known IT corporation.

2ux5u3,2,2015-02-05,Should I quit my job if I'm unhappy even though I'm a new hire and about to start a new project?,sup_mane,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2ux5u3/should_i_quit_my_job_if_im_unhappy_even_though_im/,"Hey guys, gonna go ahead and apologize for the length, there's just a lot of details. So I'm 22, graduated last year from a great university and started work in August for a big consulting company. It's a great job considering I'm fresh out of college and I can work from home, so I'm currently living with my parents outside the city away from friends but saving money. It's a good thing I have going, but the truth is I'm sort of unhappy. I'm basically a data analyst/entry-level consultant for this company and I'm starting to realize I don't like the technical side that much, and it's getting very technical so I'm struggling to perform well. Also I have no social life because my friends live far away, and I never interact with co-workers in-person. I really want to move out west, get a different job that's more collaborative for a company with more culture, and basically start new (been wanting to live on the west coast for a long time). But I'm only 6 months into this job, and they are currently training me for 2 projects -- one was unexpectedly postponed until July but I've already been trained some and they want to finish it next week, and the other project is for me to work on until July. Both trainings are extensive and have steep learning curves. I haven't talked to my manager in 3 months. I guess he's really busy and I'm just a new hire, I don't know. 

I know it's irresponsible to: 1) Quit a job before completing 1-2 years minimum at a company. 2) Quit during/right after training or mid-project. and 3) Quit without having another job lined up. But right now, I kind of want to do all three. I think I'll be unhappy all year if I wait to finish the projects. But I also don't know exactly what career I want to pursue, just something that's more collaborative, meaningful, and where I don't have to stare at a computer screen by myself most of the day. Should I start applying for jobs now even though if I'm fortunate enough to get an offer, I'll already be in the middle of a project?

Also as a side-note, I'm in a long distance relationship that is very serious and it's getting to the point where we can hardly stand being away from each other. She just finished an internship so now would be a good time for her to move, which she wants to in order to be with me. 

So... What do you guys think? I figured you fine fellows might be able to help me get my mind straight, and I value everyone's input. Thank you all for reading this.

TL;DR Got a good job, but unhappy. Want to quit but recently hired and training for year's worth of projects. Also lonely, living with parents in the suburbs."
2ux5uh,25,2015-02-05,Reflection - be genuine and have fun,giffengoods,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2ux5uh/reflection_be_genuine_and_have_fun/,"I am going to start this post by stating that women have a threshold for looks. Once you meet those standards, it comes down to an X factor.

Let me retrogress a moment. I am a 20 year old college student. One of my best friends is 6'1"", ~8% body fat, chiseled face, jacked, stylish, rich, a natural leader and a good guy (far from an asshole). You would think that a guy like him would be dripping in bitches, but he's not. His game is terrible. He gets asked out by girls, but usually the girls that ask him out, aren't that attractive. He has an advantage in that he rarely gets rejected for dates with attractive girls though. However, his relationship don't last long, the max he's dated a girl for is a month. A lot of girls usually give him only one date, and turn him down after. You would think that with aesthetics like that you can't fuck it up, but he manages to do it.

The other day I read Archwinger's post on Always hiding your effort and this morning I read Don't forget to have fun and it really made me realize how I am no longer having fun on dates, and that's why my game has been really shitty lately. Girls are leaving dates early on me and nexting me faster than the drop of a hat.

Me and the friend I mentions are hard working guys. At the gym, were the type of guys that bust out that extra rep, sprint the extra mile, stay up all night to overachieve in our classes. I was wondering how guys like us are doing so bad with girls. Why are we not giving women tingles?

If I hang out with a girl and I felt that she was awkward, or I didn't think she was attractive, she can spam my phone all she wants, I'm not even going to bother responding. I don't respond because I am not interested, and I am so indifferent about her that I feel that just responding to her is a waste of my time and a chore. And, she never crosses my mind again. I am sure that that is how I am making women feel. They don't give two shits about me.

There is nothing wrong with the women, it's all fault. One thing I have been doing is exaggerating the domination archtype that exists in the PUA community. I am acting like a robot. On dates, I categorize what a girl says as a shit test, and without even thinking, I say a witty, clever canned response; I have memorized a kino escalation guide for how to escalate to a kiss; And, I am always telling her where were going, and I don't really give them an option for what to do or where to eat during the dates, I control everything. Here is why I think that is wrong, a man shouldn't control every aspect on the date. I was on a date with a girl that wasn't really trying to hold up conversation or talking much. I style kept trying to get her to open up and lead a conversation. I should have just taken the hint, and ended it early. She wasn't talking because she wasn't interested. If a girl is attracted to you, she will make sure you know, and she will do everything in her powers to have a conversation with you, even if its about the stupidest shit ever. Also, you should let a women decided on where and when to go for dates. They usually give me options, and I like doing different things, and it makes them more invested in the date because it was their idea.

Like Archwinger says, in one of his post, you want to work hard, but at the same time pretend that everything comes to you easily. No girl wants to date a try-hard. The best way to do that is by having fun, genuinely having fun, and making it seem like you don't try hard at all.

On the other hand, my friends that aren't as good looking, try-hards, or stylish, they are getting laid more than I. These guys don't know anything about PUA. They don't even do any kino. The things that differ from me and some of those friends is that they are 100% genuine. Being genuine and outcome independent (Some of them are the types of guys that waited a year before having sex with their girlfriend). Those guys go on dates because they genuinely like talking to people. Those guys don't even go for kisses on the dates. Usually what happens is that the girls invite them over after the second date, and the rest is history.

I took one of my friends to a political event last week. He's the type of guy who likes going out to events to talk to people - he really likes talking to people. He met a famous local politician and the politician personally offered him an internship. Other people going up to the politician were asking the politician for the internship and kissing up to him. My friend didn't even know about the internship. He only went up to him to talk about politics and get a picture.

My call to actions is that being genuine (outcome independent) and going on dates just because you like going out and having fun (not coming off as a try hard), will get you further.

2ux7ep,4,2015-02-05,The eternal (5 year) struggle: GPA vs. Self,Ad_Astra5,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2ux7ep/the_eternal_5_year_struggle_gpa_vs_self/,"Hey everyone.  This is my first post on this sub, and I'm looking forward to meeting/chatting with many of you!  I'm a 5th year MechE student at a University in PA, expecting to graduate in June.  I'll keep it short and to the point, since I'm more interested in hearing other people's stories than recounting my own!

One thing I've learned about myself in the last 5 years is that I do so much better under ""real-life"" circumstances than I do reading out of a textbook and taking exams.  I've had three excellent internship experiences, two of which included the potential for a full-time offer, and one of which I ended up taking (to begin after graduation).  I loved all three of them, and I performed well - taking my relatively basic knowledge of theory and applying it to my much more proficient abilities when it comes to hands-on projects.  I'm going to be a ""real"" engineer in a few short months, and I'll be heading straight for an entry-level position at what may very well be my dream company.

I should feel good about that.  Some days, I feel *great* about that.  But every time I leave my internship to come back to school, I feel as though I'm performing at a level below where I want to be when it comes to textbook theory.  The fixation on grades and GPA chips away at my confidence as each week goes by.  Sometimes I feel as though maybe I don't deserve this chance.  Maybe someone else could do it better, and I'll just disappoint people when I get there.  Maybe I'll be a *bad* engineer.  After all, how could a good engineer get *this* on a test?  Most of the time I study hard (and I'd be the first to tell you if I didn't), but sometimes I just can't get it in time for the midterms or the final.

Maybe today's just one of those bad days, and maybe I'll be overthinking this until the day I graduate.  But I suppose what I want the most is to hear from other people on this sub.  Have you ever felt similarly?  Do you work better in school or ""on the job?""  How do you stay focused and confident when it seems like it's not going your way?

Cheers, all.  Looking forward to hearing from you!"

It's a 2011 model(silver case) and still functions. However, the delete, zero and forward slash keys no longer work, which can make it a bitch to use. Those symbols have to be copied and pasted in. The CD drive doesn't work either. Because it has water damage (actually soy sauce...) the Mac store wants to charge an absurd amount to fix it. I bet a third-party repair company could at least fix the CD drive, though.

I was thinking $200 was fair, but wanted feedback. And let me reiterate that despite how janky it may be, the computer works. I made it through 3 months as an editorial intern writing articles on it every week.

My manager from last year offered me the chance to intern again with them this summer due to some people leaving (they were downsizing before and weren't going to hire an intern).  They pay is good.

I think long and short term I will be better off diversifying my skills and going somewhere else as I did not learn as much as I wanted to last summer (there was not always enough work to go around.  I had many small projects instead of one big one, and now the most experience people have left).

I feel crazy, but I think I am going to decline the offer and head to the career fair next week.  I am just a little nervous because if I go hunting for a summer internship now my chances of getting a good one are lower since I'm so late in the game.  

Also, I need to start looking for full-time jobs around this time or pretty soon...

2uxmhe,2,2015-02-05,My (21F) sister (30F) thinks I should drop everything for our sick mother (54).,lovelyanabiosis,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2uxmhe/my_21f_sister_30f_thinks_i_should_drop_everything/,"My mom was recently diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer. She will be undergoing chemo and having a mastectomy soon. I have already made plans to quit the full-time job I was offered for after graduation in my chosen career field to move back in with my parents so I will be available to help take care of my mother. I have also made steps to apply for (and hopefully be accepted to) a 2 year vet tech program in a city close to our hometown.

However, I recently decided to try and apply for a summer internship at the Memphis Zoo for reproductive physiology research. This is something that I have wanted to do for a long time. When I told my sister, instead of being supportive, she was livid. She thinks I should move in immediately after graduation. When I told her it wasn't fair for her to expect me to pass up a good opportunity in my field, she told me ""life isn't fair"". She tells me that I always ""do whatever I want to do"" and that she didn't really care to talk to me further about her issue with me doing the internship. 

My issues with the situation: It's my life - am I not entitled to do what I want to do? I can't put my life on hold indefinitely while my mother is sick. It is a 12 week program, not a year! Also, my sister lives 15 minutes away and is 10 years older than me: she has had time to establish a career and a family of her own. I understand that she has different responsibilities than I do, but she is not alone in supporting our mom. My dad is home most of the time, and all of my mom's family lives within 30 minutes and are willing and able to help. Why am I expected to quit my job and uproot my life, and she isn't?

I feel as if my sister is accusing me of being selfish and acting as if I don't care about our mom. I don't know what to do, but my feelings are hurt and I haven't stopped crying since Monday. When I told my parents about what I wanted to do with the internship, they were supportive as they always are, and I feel if I have their blessing then I should also have my sister's? I don't want this to be something that is held over my head forever: ""While you were playing with the animals, I was taking care of our mom!"". She already uses the fact that she is close to home and able to go to dr's appointments and dote on our mom against me. 

So, opinions? Advice? Am I totally in the wrong?

This past semester I've earned nothing but A's in all of my classes, while still maintaining my course load as far as honors/AP's. I have also been involved with extra curriculars such as Girls Scouts, Varsity Tennis/Lacrosse and numerous lengthy internships in addition to having a job all 4 years. I was rejected from University of Oregon this past week and I'm scared WSU will give me the same decision, although I seem to match well with the school my confidence level is pretty low right now after the UO rejection.

2uxqy1,10,2015-02-05,Does anyone else have on and off depression?,depression_cycles,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2uxqy1/does_anyone_else_have_on_and_off_depression/,"Hi everyone, this subreddit has been a great support for me. Normally I just lurk but it's always nice to see others are struggling with the same thing. But lately, something has been bugging me. 

I have been seeing a counselor for depression symptoms that have been going on for a while now. Normally it's stuff like lack of joy, suicidal ideations, etc. She seems to think I'm depressed and has referred me to a psychiatrist who I will be seeing in two weeks. 

I'm not sure what it is, but normally, I feel depressed. But then, suddenly, as if a switch was flicked, I feel upbeat and normal. It's almost like the haze I have been living in was removed all at once. Life becomes beautiful and worth living. I feel capable and confident, what used to scare me doesn't scare me anymore, I don't feel the need to write in my journal as much, stuff like that. 

Typically when I'm depressed I feel like a complete failure who can't do anything and who can only think about ways to kill himself. I remember writing in my journal just this Monday how much I wanted to die and how much life sucks, how I'm not cut out to do anything with my life and how terrible I am and how much I hate myself. I remember writing it, and it was such an intense experience, and going back to read it is honestly disquieting. I can't read more than a few sentences before I close my journal. 

My mood changed almost immediately after my therapy appointment on Tuesday. I remember walking out and just looking around. Today, I was shocked by how beautiful everything is. I feel good to be alive and feel like I could conquer the world, or at least, be prepared for whatever the world has to throw at me. I eat normal amounts and feel rested on eight hours of sleep, instead of eating way more than I should and needing 10 to 12 hours a night. I remember being excited to wake up today because I was going to get my resume in order so I can apply for internships. I ended up calling everyone back home, making plans to go out to eat, stuff like that. Basically, it's like I'm me again, and it's scary to think about how two or three days ago I wanted nothing but to die, and how rational I thought it was. 

But what is bugging me is the nagging feeling that this is a temporary feeling that will go away. I am trying to take advantage of it, to be as productive as possible. But I also get kind of frustrated, because I wonder to myself, why can't I feel like this all the time? Why do I feel like I need to kill myself? There is no reason for me to feel any different than the way I feel now. These moments of lucidity are great, but at the same time, frustrating... I try to enjoy them, but whenever I think about my depression, it feels like I'm on a rollercoaster. I can't control when I'm depressed and when I'm happy. I know in a few weeks, or maybe even days, I'll be depressed again, and it's scary. I shared this cyclical behavior with my therapist when I first saw her, but she didn't seem to be too concerned about it. 

Is anyone else going through stuff like this? How do you handle it?"
2uxqyq,14,2015-02-05,I am joining the navy next week. All my friends think I am happy with this decision; I am pretending.,fillet0fish,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/2uxqyq/i_am_joining_the_navy_next_week_all_my_friends/,"A little background, I am 25 years old as of last Jan. I have graduated from college with a bachelor in applied math and Computer Science. Towards the tail end of my college life, I quietly slipped into depression and cut off all social ties I had built during this time. I tried applying for jobs, got into some sketchy contracting things and left in a few months. I was so soured by that experience i didn't not even want to put it on my resume. 

With a lack of real relevant job experience or relevant internships, I quietly slipped back into depression. I stopped trying because I could no longer stand rejection, I applied to starbucks on a whim. Got accepted and ending up working there for a year and a half. Everytime a friend or a friendly customer would ask how the job search was going, I would lie. I had stopped looking and my ambition had ran dry. I woke up at 2am, went to work and busted my ass and went home to sleep and game. I was happy with that life and ... that scared me. It scared me thinking that I could live this kind of life without any growth or development. It was a mindless life of habit and routine and yet... it was still infinitely better than that life of depression I had come from.

So this is how today came to be. The navy was supposed to be a deadline, if I didn't get my life in order to find a real job in that amount of time between my departure date, then this was my punishment. Well the deadline has come and my punishment awaits. On one of my tabs, sits a grad school application never completed. All the relevant information was filled out except the personal statement. I broke down, just thinking about the past, my regrets and all that wasted time made me queasy. 

My recruiter asked me if I was ready for the navy. I smiled and told her, ""as ready as I'll ever be."" Later in the day, I went to the bathroom and threw up from the stress. Yeah, as ready as I'll ever be.

Edit: No throwaway because this is probably the last time I'll be using Reddit."

* Location: Toronto (Preferred)
* Position: Software Developer
* Salary: 80k CAD
* Signing Bonus: $15k in first year (lump sum after first month), $10k second year (monthly payments)
* Full relocation benefits
* Full health benefits
* 3 weeks PTO
* Stock options that vest over a period of five years (don't know if I'll be there that long)

**Second offer: Company B**

They contacted me through LinkedIn and flew me out for a few days to do interviews, with no expense spared for myself and other candidates.

* Location: Seattle
* Position: Project Manager (slightly preferred)
* Salary: 105k USD
* Signing Bonus: $15k in first year (lump sum after first month)
* Full relocation benefits
* Full health benefits
* 3 weeks PTO
* Stock options that vest over a period of five years, about 10% more than Company A
* A ""likely"" 10% bonus

Now, I know I won't go work for Company B, since they don't have a Toronto office and my wife is tied there for the next few years due to schooling. I've done some research and found that the same position that I'm being offered for Company A has a minimum starting salary of $83k. So far all communication has been through email. 

What steps do I take to negotiate my compensation up with Company A? I plan on calling over the phone rather than trying to negotiate over email, but I have no idea where to go from there.

**UPDATE**

I just took the offer from Company A. It's really good for the Toronto area."

We both have a lot of things in common (engineering majors, same music genre, movie types, football, etc). She was taking a year off from college but unfortunately she had to move back to Oregon last week because she received an internship that required her to be enrolled in college. Since we've only been dating 2 months, i thought it would be too soon to ask for a committed relationship.
Anyways, its been 2 weeks but we still keep in touch and text every now and then. She keeps me updated with snapchat multiple times throughout the day. I don't know if she likes me back as much as I do, but she has kissed me many times and gave me my first kiss. With Valentines Day coming up I was wondering if I should do anything for her. I do not have the money to fly over there for the weekend especially with my class load.

I was first thinking of asking her if she would like to be my Valentine. I don't know if I should call her or text her that though considering we haven't talked over phone since she left I'm leaning towards the latter. If she says yes, I was planning on asking her roommate if she can give me her mailing address so I could surprise her with some flowers.

Would that be a good plan? She is going to a concert with some of her friends on Valentines day so we wouldn't be able to talk or do something special that night unfortunately. 

Thanks for all the help guys!

I'm not even sure that things are the way I see them. (There is no incest in this story outside of my feelings. I'm just doing this to vent and this is probably the best subreddit to post this considering its my sister I'm talking about. Prepare for wall of text)

My sisters birthday was a few days ago and it honestly slipped my mind that it was even her birthday. She just turned 24, older than me by 3 years. 

I joined the military right out of high school, she was still in college many states away at the time, so I never really saw her much from my Sophomore through Senior years in high school, and less so after I left. Around that time is what concluded a really difficult time in our family life. For the last few years before I left home, my dad had been cheating on my mom and that really drove my sister away. She had her own little world at her school with all her friends and basically what to me looked like the perfect college experience. The few times she would come home, due to the fighting and my moms depression from her marriage falling apart, my sister was really detached from everyone, preferring to just hang out in her room or go out with her old friends.
 
She and I couldn't be more different. Sometimes I wonder how we can even be related, and even more so have grown up in the same house. It's not that we didn't get along growing up, we just never had anything in common. We never hung out, unless forced to go somewhere together by our parents, or family situations, which didn't happen much in my last few years at home, the few times she was there. Since she was so detached, she never really showed any interest in me or what I wanted to do in my life or who I wanted to be. We never talked, like at all. For years I didn't even know who she was as a person. 

Around my senior year in high school, my dad got his shit together, and really started working hard to fix his relationship with my mom, and my sister and I. I saw the change in him, but my sister being thousands of miles away and her detached relation to the family didn't see the change. She thought nothing was different and kept living in her own little world.

I left for boot camp about 6 months after I graduated, so I spent the summer home just preparing mentally and working out. My sis never came home that summer, instead preferring to do an internship with some company in another state, just as far away as she went to school. Around the holidays, mom did tell me during phone call while in boot camp that she had changed, started coming back to the family, and really accepting our dad back. This is around the time where I guess I decided to maintain the detached relationship between my sister and I.  I thought that this is how it's always been, there's no changing it now. It's engrained in my psyche. That's what I thought at least. 

I never saw anything bad in her though. Quite the opposite, actually. I always thought, and still do, that she's going to make some lucky bastard really happy, for the rest of his life, if he's smart. I guess at a young age I fell in love with her, but have only recently come to recognize it. The lack of any sort of sibling relationship between us the last few years really repressed any feelings toward her that I didn't even realize they were there until recently. She's the sort of woman that I can go on a deployment for close to a year and not have to worry about our home and our life together because, in a weird way, I trust her completely and with out question. There is literally no one else on the planet I can say that about. And I barely even know her honestly. 

When I got through boot camp and school to learn my job was the same as her graduation from college, so rarely enough, we were back home at the same time together. It had felt like years since I'd seen her. She just seemed so happy for me and she was so sweet to me in a sisterly way I never thought I'd experience from her. I didn't know how to react so I just shut down I guess that's my defense mechanism to situations I don't know how to deal with. 

We always have this air of awkwardness when ever we talk. At least from me, recently. I think it developed from when our parents world force us to do things together that neither of us wanted to do. It's hard to describe, we just have this awkward way of conversing like we're young teenagers and our parents are listening in just to make sure we're getting along. Our conversations start off with her being bubbly and happy to talk to me but I ruin it because I don't know how to not converse with her how we alway have. And I don't think I want to change it either. 

The main problem though is that I'm completely afraid of falling in love with her. There is no doubt in my mind that it will happen to me. It's already has. And I am also positive that a relationship like that with her simply cannot happen. And I think that's the reason I've been so distant from her these last few years, especially since she's been going out there to try to talk to me and become closer. I can't handle loving her that way and knowing that she'll never feel the same way. And at this point I know that all I'm doing is hurting her. I don't know how to tell her that I can't be her best friend and brother because it won't stop there for me. It slipped my mind to call her on her birthday, and she just sent me an angry text cause I forgot. I don't want to hurt her, but no matter what I do, I can't see any way I can have a healthy relationship with her. 

TL;DR sister wants to be close siblings, I'm in love with her, can't happen."

2uyvxm,7,2015-02-06,Is my degree even worth finishing?,donjulioanejo,Biochemistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biochemistry/comments/2uyvxm/is_my_degree_even_worth_finishing/,"I know this might get me crucified here, but, I wanted your opinion guys :)

tl;dr: I have a nearly complete degree in molecular biology &amp; biochemistry.  Originally went into psychology (I'm a moron), then realized a) psych is useless for making a living, and b) I liked neuroscience aspects, and thought to do medicine.  I could probably get in to med school in the US (not in Canada where I'm at), but with how much it'll cost, I'll never be able to pay it off even on a doctor's salary.

On the other hand, I've been dealt a really good hand in IT.  Started off doing part-time work at an information security firm.  Picked up some good experience in networking and a few certs along the way (CCNA + MCSA in Server 2012 if anyone cares; can also get RHCSA next time I drive over to Seattle).  Starting a job as a network administrator next week, and steamrolling everything so far.

While my salary is on the lower range right now, it's more from the location I live in than anything else.  I realistically don't see myself being able to make a living doing biochemistry - virtually everyone I know from school that hasn't gone to med/pharmacy is either doing masters, minimum-wage ""internships"" in hopes of landing an FT position, or most commonly, retail and Starbucks.  Only two people doing their grad school I realistically see as having a career in biochem, and they're 10 times more motivated and have better work ethic than me.

In IT, no-one gives a damn about your degree.  Hell, I'd have $60k less in loans and be making $30k/year more if I went straight into IT than university.  My CCNA basically landed me my current job, MCSA the job I'm about to start.

Should I even bother saving up money, quitting a job a year from now and trying to finish my degree?  Sorry if it sounds like a rant, but I'm incredibly frustrated with our higher education system."

Looking for a year placement internship; got an offer from a fairly large engine testing company yesterday, they want an answer by Tuesday night.
Problem is; I've now got a interview on Tuesday with a larger, closer company which seems more suited to what I want to do, I also have a phone interview with Bentley on Monday and an assessment centre for the company I really, really want to work for on the 26th.

Dont get me wrong, the placement I've been offered looks really good; hands-on, able to network with engineers from large OEMs and the guys there seem a great bunch with a low staff turnover.

However, I cant help feeling I may regret taking it later on when im looking for graduate (chassis dynamics) jobs, which I will get experience of at the other companies.

I also dont want to regret not taking it, screwing up the other interviews and ending up somewhere I don't want to be.

First world problems and all that, I just wanted to vent/ask for opinions."

""You don't shit where you eat"" is a phrase that gets tossed around frequently, and is excellent advice for all of us. Something I've found since my RP journey is the more you change your life for the better, the more others will notice. Specifically, the people you work with, more specifically the women you work with. I've started eating better and lifting and  started a little real estate business on the side and sure enough, I've caught the attention of a young intern at my office.

She's 20, beautiful and educated. She's weasled her way into my life and we have good chemistry. I've probably payed her too much attention and now I'm starting to catch the oneitis. Mistakes have been made. We attended the company christmas party together (a formal setting) she's been over to my place on a couple of occasions to ""watch Netflix"" but I never escalated. I'm terrified of this girl because we work together and I think my mind put up some LMR. If that makes sense.

I know she has other men (orbiters) in her life, she's in a sorority, she identifies as a feminist, she has daddy issues, she smokes, we work together.

My mind understands why I should keep my distance from this woman. I have other women in my life, though I haven't slept with them yet. I'm just fighting it pretty hard.

Have any of you guys experienced something like this? What helps you kill these feelings?"

I currently got into Virginia Tech, as a transfer student, and I will be enrolling in Fall 2015. As listed above, I am an Environmental Science major (Water Science and Water Quality concentration), with possibly a minor in Green Engineering. However, I feel a bit of discouragement because I am going to be staying an extra year at the University, as a Super Senior, because I previously attended James Madison University for a completely different major. I just wanted to get someone's opinion on the different clubs and research opportunities that I can look forward to at Tech. Also, since I don't have a ton of experience in the Environmental Field, I'm having a bit of trouble finding appropriate internships for the Summer 2014 season. I guess my question is, what are some great unpaid internships, especially in the D.C. area?

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and hopefully someone helps!

NASA has several centers that offer internships - locations include Maryland, Florida, California, and Texas.  I think a few centers will also pay for housing if you go out of state (but don't hold me to that).

The link to create an account and look at opportunities is here: https://intern.nasa.gov/ossi/web/public/main/.

There are a lot of really great internships in just about every field - engineering and science obviously, but also computer science, business, education, journalism, etc.  They are all paid internships and usually start the first week of June and end the first week of August.  

I encourage you all to apply.  It is extremely selective (at least at the center I interned with), but if you have good grades and want an interesting internship this summer, it doesn't hurt to try.

Just thought I'd share because I had an absolutely amazing internship and would love to see some more Pitt people involved with NASA :)

2v0eqi,1,2015-02-06,I need references for my dream job: is it inappropriate to ask my current temp job manager?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2v0eqi/i_need_references_for_my_dream_job_is_it/,"So I am moving forward in the hiring process with my dream job, and I need a background check and 5 references, 2 of which have to be former managers.

Here is the problem. I'm a recent grad, and I don't have extensive work history. I worked on campus at a dining hall, so all those managers have since either rotated out or don't remember me 2 years later. 

I worked as an intern at a start-up, and my boss there will absolutely be a reference for me. He is awesome.

I worked at a non-profit for 6 months, and my direct manager at the time no longer works there. My indirect manager works there still, but it was 1.5 years ago and she may not remember me well enough to do a reference. She is a maybe-reference.

My current job is a temp job. I work a few weeks here and there, whenever there is work to be done. One of my managers when I first started is a cool guy who seems to have recognized my value, as he pulled me in on a few bigger projects though I was new. He has since moved up in the organization and is an indirict manager. 

Would it be inappropriate to reach out to him via email and ask if he would reference me for a new job? It seems bad to ask a current employer for a reference, but at the same time the people at this place are aware it's an in-between job and have a lot of turnover with employees, and many employees have second or third jobs. They seem opposed to getting called for references, and say we shouldn't list their number for a reference at the orientation thing before each project, but would it be ok to email just this one man and ask him about doing an email reference for me?"

However none of them resulted in moving forward; I always apparently fail the phone screen. Two of them had coding problems which I thought I solved, and I even talked through the problems and probed the interviewer about time/space requirements, etc. But even when I thought I solved the problem perfectly, the company mysteriously dropped all contact with me. Other interviews have been mostly behavioral with some technical questions (one was an abstract thinking problem and another guy asked me some general questions about Java). All of them either drop contact or send generic rejection emails. At this point I'm probably not going to get an internship (even though I'm a junior) and I'll probably be unemployed for the rest of my life.

I shall be your personal tutor and mentor over the period of time I teach you. I shall communicate with you using Skype/Hangouts. We shall be using a collaborative code editor and an online whiteboard alongside a voice chat. I shall begin by teaching you the basics of making a static website.

There's an important distinction for potential learners to understand: the difference between a web site and a web application. A web site contains static content that never changes over time (for example, your portfolio). A web application dynamically responds to user input and its content changes accordingly. Examples include services like Facebook, Twitter and so on. I shall initially be teaching you the basics of making a static website using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, which is where everyone starts.

After this, you're given a choice. If you wish to work with CMSes like WordPress, it's useful to know PHP to create custom WordPress themes, and tinker with the backend logic. WordPress is by far the most popular blogging platform, so if that's where you want to go, I shall teach you PHP alongside MySQL.

If you're serious about creating Web Applications from scratch, I highly recommend using the MEAN stack. MEAN stands for MongoDB (the database), Express (a web application framework), Angular (a popular MVC framework) and NodeJS (backend server).

It's alright if these acronyms are going over your head right now; it'll all start to make sense when I start from the absolute beginning.

At this point, I feel like I should make a disclaimer: I am primarily a front-end web developer. I have worked with the full web stack, but architecting web applications on the front end is what I specialize in. **I am not a designer.** I shall teach you the tools to make any sort of website you want, but I am not qualified to teach you the basics of web design. Developers normally work *alongside* designers to recreate exactly what they want (they'd normally send you a PSD mockup), which you shall then be taught to replicate exactly. If you want to learn how to make a web site look pretty, please look elsewhere.

**Codecademy teaches this stuff for free. Why on earth should you pay me?**

That's a very valid question. You can indeed learn everything I am offering to teach for free. However, getting into web development can be overwhelming. You start with a simple HTML/CSS tutorial, you then move on to PHP. Then you read this blog saying that PHP is terrible. Then you'll find another guy recommending Ruby on Rails. When you've hopped on to that bandwagon, you'll find plenty of people recommending NodeJS instead. Then you find that one of the core contributors to Node has jumped ship to the Go programming languuage.

You find some people praising Javascript, and some loathing it. You do not know who to listen to. You follow interesting people on Twitter and read Hacker News everyday, and find so many acronyms thrown about and you have no idea what any of them are talking about. It's all going over your head. It is very easy to give up. I have gotten advice that I now consider bad when I first started out, and I always wished that there was someone to help me out, to guide me, to answer every stupid question I could think of.

Following random tutorials online makes your knowledge fragmented, and will not  give you the confidence of mastery over what you've learned. I intend clearly explaining everything I teach you, after which I give you small exercises to practise. I shall of course answer any questions you have.

We shall negotiate timings based on when both of us are free. I shall take 3 two-hour classes a week, apart from which I shall set weekly homework and shall be available to ask questions at any time. I promise to respond to any emails you may send me within 8 hours of my receiving them.

What makes me fit to teach this, you ask?

In the past, I have made an HTML5 game using the Phaser framework ([Leaping Cube](http://arunmahadevan.me/leapingcube/)), and a chat bot ([Chat with Amy](http://chatwithamy.github.io/)).
I have interned at a pretty well known startup in my country (I shall PM its name if you’re interested), where I worked on their custom URL shortener, and contributed highly scalable code to it. I have worked with GulpJS, Grunt and Yeoman to automate several tasks. I am reasonably comfortable with MongoDB and Redis, having used both at my internship.
I wrote the URL shortener I mentioned above using NodeJS and Express. Apart from that, I have also used Socket.IO, and am reasonably familiar with concurrent programming using Node.

Under the burn of fifteen studio lights, Anderson smiled when he should smile and frowned when he should frown. He rattled off the C-stories (“…a little girl and her pet kangaroo…), powered through the B-stories (“…local politicians say the tax hike won’t affect small businesses…) and channeled every ghost of news anchors past he could for the hard hitting A-stories (“Terrorists in Syria have demanded the return of four captured insurgents…). 

He pinched his nose and lips at the last, placing his large hands on the desk in front of him in what he hoped would be a gesture of humanity and sincerity (“These are difficult times for us all…and our prayers go to their families…”).

Wrap story, brief banter, sign off, cue music, dim lights, hold. 

The director signaled him from behind the cameras and he found his breath coming back to him, his friendly but homely co-anchor beside him erupting into an explosion of chit-chatter. As the lights died the studio came to life around him, the drones rushing out to wipe down the desk and trade notes. Cameramen stretched, producers checked their cell phones and when he looked again at the director he shot him a thumbs up. Life as usual. He adjusted his suit, stood up tall and strode over from the desk into the prep area of the soundstage. 

“Great job, Bill.” The director called. There was that thumb again. 

“Keep it up, we’re back on in three.” He cleared his throat and sucked in his chest then, “Hear that everybody?! We’re back on in three hours! Get your shit together!” 

Anderson smiled and looked round at the bustling faces. They smiled when they noticed his eye contact, but not before. Not even his co-anchor, the always bubbly Melissa, who was still at their news desk and from the looks of it had caught a gaggle of sound techs in conversation. Anderson could almost hear her twang as she smacked her lips up and down at them, their eyes darting left and right for an escape. A chuckle escaped his lips. 

One in response sounded out next to him.

The first thing he noticed about her was her hair: it was red as a rose and thin, but the healthy variety. Down from there, his eyes took in her face, the way her body curved in with her little hips, her long legs standing in that must-be-practiced half bent stance of the eternally cocky, and of course how what looked like a more than an ample chest was being pulled down by a tight tee shirt promoting some Rock’n’Roll band or another.

“Can I help you with something, Mr. Anderson?” His eyes shot up to hers. She was grinning right at him. He gave her a slow smile back and said nothing, grabbing a Styrofoam cup off the table and pouring himself a coffee. He poured slow, taking another moment to take in the sight of her again: it did not disappoint. Her skin was fair and her face unpocked with acne scars or the tell-tale too much make-up he knew to be an indicator of disappointment ahead. Her thin red lips set themselves into grin and the whites of her teeth became exposed, “Mr. Anderson?”

“I was just trying to figure out which department you are,” He answered without hesitation, “Electric?” 
She took a step back, her face scrunched up, but then looked down at the heavy industrial tape and thermal insulation gloves on her hands, “Clever.”

“Just experienced.”

“Right.” She rested a hand on the table and managed to shift into an even cockier posture, “I’m a gaffer, specifically.” 

Anderson nodded and took a sip of his coffee, the ring on his finger rising up into her eye-line. He knew a lot of jokes about gaffers, the lighting wizards of the entertainment industry and he half got the feeling she was waiting for one. So he just smiled and nodded. Her eyes darted towards his ring for just a moment and her face set, her jaw clenching and her brows moving just a little closer. 

“Every time you look good behind that desk you have me to thank.” She leaned in closer, and Anderson realized she was pushing those tits he had noticed straining under her band shirt up and out, subtly angling her body so they stared him down like a second pair of eyes, “Not much I can do when you’re in front of it though.”

“You think I could look better then?”

“Oh no,” Her eyes went wide like a Japanese schoolgirls, but Anderson noted there wasn’t a trace of fear in them, “I think you look very good for a man your age.”

Anderson’s laugh was short and hoarse, “A man my age, huh? If there’s anything I know about a girl your age it’s that nobody looks better than a man my age.” He took another sip and didn’t drop eye contact. Her eyes trailed up and down his body and he knew full well she was impressed. He had kept to a strict weightlifting schedule for twenty years and it damn well showed. 

He found his body inching over the table, his spine straightening to give himself maximum height, and in the tiniest corner of her mouth her teeth bit down on her lips. “Luckily for me, that’s a sentiment my wife shares.”

The lip bite became a full fledged chomp. She too straightened up and backed away from the table, trailing her fingers on the wood as she did so, “Lucky woman. I’m sure there’s more than one intern around here who would like to trade places with her.” A beat, “Like Gareth. Or maybe Mark.”

Anderson ignored the jab and tried to surprise with a move from left field, coming round the table and striding past her. She didn’t flinch, not losing an inch of frame. Instead she shifted a little to her side and made sure her hand brushed his, those manicured red nails sending a shiver down his spine.

“Oh, I’m sorry Mr. Anderson.” Her voice went an octave higher, 

“Didn’t see you coming.” Her fingers trailed back down his arm again, “Didn’t see a thing.” Just one finger now, down his fingers, arcing down like it was going to go further. She slowed down, and in her deep green eyes he saw a fire that matched her hair. Her finger dropped at last, she bit back another smile and turned away.

He would be lying if he didn’t admit to watching her leave, his eyes on her ass like he knew she knew they would be. When the sounds of the world came back to him there was a single bead of sweat on his brow, and a tightening in his pants.

Adults of reddit please help,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2v0teb/personal_what_should_i_do_with_my_life_adults_of/,"Hello adults of reddit I'm 16 and currently having some conflicts over what I wanna do with my life. Im a junior in highschool currently in AP Physics , Pre-Calc, AP US history, and yada yada blah blah but thats not the point. I've always told myself Im going to do something I love with my life so I can make a living and enjoy what I do. I've always loved computers building my own a few years back always researching them and reading up on the lastest developments so The idea of a Computer Engineer came to me. It sounded awesome I would get to design computer parts maybe work for a big company and have a role in the tech industry. A few other aspects I'd like to have would be a social environment because I love talking to people and do consider myself confident and love making speeches and presentations in front of my classes of school. The problem is in my current physics class im struggling and were at the basic level and I feel if I'm unable to do this now my work in the future will always be confusing me. I did an internship at an accounting firm in NYC and had a great time. I always thought accountants were just on there computers working mindlessly but the environment I came to find was a much more social and interactive experience filled with meetings, working with clients end etc. I did very much enjoy that field and I have no clue what to do. I'm currently in between do i continue to struggle into my senior year with more advanced physics and computer science classes or do I take the business route and do something else I enjoy? After looking at multiple college curriculum it looks like the only physics class seem to be a General Physics I and II. My current grades in physics are the low eighties and Pre-Calc is low 90's high 80's. (I've always enjoyed math btw) My mom told me I should work on wall street and sell stocks lols. I really like talking to people like If there were such a job that you get to market and be like the presenter for new technology and explain it to be people that be awesome :D"

Today, the department head talked to me about his ""concerns"" that I am uncomfortable, and I may sometimes have to do things that are outside of my job like working with this manager.

I said no, I specifically said I did not even want him to find out that I said anything, and now you want me to confront him? The department head said he cannot have a conversation with him about it that is not specific. He will want to know who is accusing him of these things.

The department head did not outright say it, but he implied that he cannot be fired for this in the future if I do not do something about it now that is specific and lets him know that I am the one who said something about it.

I said NO. He said since he knows that I am uncomfortable, he has a moral and ethical responsibility to do something about it. He is trying to see if someone in a nearby office has heard him saying things to me, so that he can approach the topic from the angle that someone overheard him making comments about my appearance. I said fine. I don't think that will lead anywhere, as the woman near us likes the manager in question and I am relatively new. 

This is where we left off. He was going to try that approach first. When that inevitably fails, I am at a loss for what to do. I absolutely do not want to confront him. That is insane. This manager does all kinds of awful things, I think they should focus on punishing him for the things that are within the scope of his job. He is completely awful at it. They are trying to get me to report him for sexual harassment when I said I do not want to. I do not want to martyr myself. This is the position that I am in early next week if his plans fails, which it will. 

My current idea for handling the situation is to say that I was mistaken, and that I rescind my comment about being uncomfortable. Being told how beautiful I am and how I look nice in those pants is much better than confronting someone about it.  I would rather the situation disappear. I did not even want to bring it up.

I'm a medical student from Germany. Right now I'm in my 5th year of studies and in only about 1,5 years I will start to look out for a job.

I love interacting with people and most of the time I'm a happy, smiling and open person, and I get a lot of positive feedback from patients. But sometimes I feel very insecure because of my future, I don't know how I should manage doing all these phone calls and presenting patients to collegues... there are times where I even feel depressed because I feel that my stutter makes it so hard for me to follow my dreams. I'm even afraid that my habit to avoid certain words and questions will make me a bad doctor.
So, I'm really grateful for any kind of advice, especially from another doctor who is struggling with stuttering. How are you dealing with it in your daily working routine? How about the phone calls? Are your collegues and your bosses supportive and sympathetic? 
Also, I'm very open to any other comments :). If you have any questions for me, about my studies and my past, don't hesitate to ask. "

So our location is in San Diego and we have several other locations throughout California.  In one of the other locations, Pleasanton, there are three displays spread throughout the office.  Each display shows different things depending on the department it's in.  What they want me to do is figure out a system where we can manage the displays in Pleasanton from here in our San Diego office.  The only thing I have thought of so far is some sort of remote software, but I feel that there may be better options that I am not aware of.  They want the system to be centralized and automated.  I am sure you guys are knowledgeable in things like this, so do you guys have any advice?

Thanks!"
2v1r0l,6,2015-02-06,I [20 M] cheated on my girlfriend [20 F] of 5 years by drunkenly making out with a girl my roommate was interested in.,ThisTooWontPass,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2v1r0l/i_20_m_cheated_on_my_girlfriend_20_f_of_5_years/,"I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for 5 years. This is pretty significant because we are both 20, we are each other's first significant relationship.

Last semester I was in a class with my roommate, a good friend who is single and has been looking for a relationship for awhile. We discover across from us in this class a very cute girl. Fast forward and my roommate and this girl have been talking for awhile they have gone to dinner and small dates but nothing beyond talking. 

I always thought this girl was cute and started to form a crush on her. This semester this girl and I have an internship and a very difficult class together that requires us to spend a lot of time together.

 My interest in her grows, we become really good friends. She is pretty, fun, and spontaneous. We are going out to lunch and spending a lot of time together because of our internship. We were becoming really good friends. Its been awhile since I connected so much with a person.

Last Thursday we were coming back from our intense night class and we decide to get some food. To save some money we decide to get things to cook dinner. We head back to her place to cook. She makes me drinks. I happily drink them. After a few I am quite drunk [I'm a bit of a light-weight]. There has been flirting from both of us. She has to help me to the couch. Its too late and I am too drunk for the bus.

 She puts me on the couch and gets water for me. My arm is still around her from when she helped me over.
My head is screaming at me. ""Don't do anything. You have been so happy recently, your life has been going so well.""
I slump my head onto her chest. My hand then ends up on her chest. We make-out for about 10 seconds. We break apart after we realize what we just did. ""Oh Fuck"" She goes up stairs to her bed. I stay on the couch.

The next morning I get to my dorm. My two roommates and my friend are waiting for me. They are so upset at me for staying the night. I panic and tell them nothing happened. There is a heated shouting match with roommate2 [the one that wasnt seeing the girl] over how i could have possibly spent the night at her place knowing that roommate1 liked her.

I swore to them that nothing happened. My girlfriend comes over. I explain to her that I was drunk and spent the night. She is okay with that. I swore to her nothing happened. She then goes and tries to calm my roommates that what I did wasn't that bad. She then talks to her roommates and they confirm that it isn't a huge huge deal.

About two days pass. I cant handle it anymore. I'm out to dinner with my girlfriend and I tell her everything. I had to stop on the way home to sob into the steering wheel. She was still in the car at the time and was comforting me and trying to calm me down.

I then had to face my roommates and confess that I lied to them.
I never thought I would be this kind of person. I never wanted this to happen. My roommates are avoiding me. I'm avoiding them. My girlfriend wasn't talking to me. Just last night (five days after telling her the truth) we meet to talk. She is very upset as she should be. She tells me if I want to stay with her I need to stop talking to the girl. Only spend the time with her that I need to. She also said that we need to take a break (without seeing other people) for an undetermined amount of time so she can calm down.

I don't have many friends especially now after hurting them like I did.  My family has their own issues and  aren't very helpful. I don't really have anyone to go to. It's so hard because this girl and I have become such good friends, its been a very long time since i've had a friend like her. Now I cant talk to her outside of school and work. 

 Everything was going so well until I did this. Now I have no one and will forever be known by this terrible mistake. I still have to live with my roommates, I already signed a lease with them for next year. I still have to go to my internship and class with this girl.

Also, It may not seem like a big deal to most people that we only made out. However, my relationship is a little strange in that my girlfriend and I have never had sex. We've done things but we never went all the way. She has never been comfortable with it and its her choice so I've respected it.

This has always been a bit of an issue with our relationship. Now, after all I did, I know the last thing I should be thinking about is sex. But, I dont think I'm going to be having some anytime soon and I just dont know. I dont know if this is a sign that our relationship is not going to work. Or is this girl just a lust and not love deal. Or am I just holding onto my girlfriend because she is all I know. I dont want to lose her over some big big mistake. I don't want to take the chance of making the wrong decision. 

-----------------------------------------------------------
**TLDR**: I cheated on my girlfriend of five years by drunkenly making out with a girl my roommate has been dating. Now I don't know what to do or how I feel.

We love each other. We were making future plans together. 

The problem was that he fell much faster and harder than I had. He loves me in this crazy, unconditional way that I thought only existed in movies. I love him, like I have loved the two other men that I have loved. I was growing to love him more and willing to give myself time to get used to him and the relationship and to fall deeper in love.

Then I moved several states away for an internship that I had been planning since before he and I met. We decided to try long distance. It worked for a month. He woke up at 4am to talk to me because I had to wake up early for work and there was a time difference. I stayed up late to watch netflix with him while video chatting. 

But I am having a hard time in this new city. I felt the itch to start dating simply to meet new people here and get to know the place that I am living until May (at least). Being separate from him was very hard. I was lonely.

I broke up with him for a combination of all of these reasons. I felt that after 5 months when he loved me so completely that I should have had stronger feelings than I did. I know 5 months is no time at all but because I moved, I needed to make the decision sooner because I was unhappy in a LDR and lonely in my new city. I thought that he could find someone who loves like he loves.

It's only been a week and I promised myself that the break up would last at least until the end of the internship. If it was meant to be, a few months is nothing. But I am weak, so then that promise became until I dated someone new. I've been looking on OkCupid and my itch to date here is pretty much gone. We have talked a few times since the break up and I know that he still loves me. I know I love him and miss him terribly. I also know that I am lonely here. 

I just want some opinions. What do you guys think? Did I make the right choice? Have you been in a similar situation? What did you do? Do you regret it?

TL;DR I broke up with my long distance boyfriend and now I'm worried that I ruined something awesome."

We also seemed compatible in a million ways: could talk for hours, had similar ambitions, and the sex was of course amazing. Also - drumroll - we both have herpes, and I think we were both stoked to not have to settle for someone we weren't passionate about. 

We had a tumultuous several months, with both of us experiencing major life events. We both felt like we were getting really close and he started bringing up living together and marriage. We were by no means perfect during this time. He actually took huge steps to conquer his jealousy and we even tried introducing other men to the relationship - he did still always want to be right, though.

I was probably the worse partner overall. I have always had anger issues with my various partners, and for whatever reason I became suicidal off and on. He called me out on the anger issues and lovingly helped me through the suicidal thoughts. 

Three weeks ago, he left for an internship across the country. We were totally committed to sticking it out - the plan was for him to be gone for several months. We immediately ran into a problem with frequency of talking on the phone. A couple evenings in, I told him that I had a work meeting that would get me out too late to talk, considering the time difference. I also told him that I would be having dinner with my ex boyfriend the next night and thus not available to talk much. Looking back on it this was bad, but at the time it seemed reasonable. 

Quick side note on the ex: We've been good friends since we broke up and it's totally platonic. We barely fucked at all for the last year of our relationship. My boyfriend had nothing to worry about there. He never liked it very much, but he allowed it. 

So we got into a big fight. I immediately canceled the dinner and we talked the next night, but the damage was done. He was upset that I had considered not talking to him two nights in a row, I was angry because I felt he was being controlling.  The next night, I texted my boyfriend that I wouldn't be available until about 10:30 his time due to an errand. It was a Friday and he planned to stay home, but I thought that would be early enough. His response was somewhat irritated and I started getting mad at him for being controlling. He LOST IT on me, berated me six ways to Sunday. We fought for hours.

Eventually we established a rule that we would talk Monday Wednesday and Thursday, from 7 to 8. Those weren't supposed to be the only times, but they were set and couldn't be changed without prior permission. 

The next week dragged on. I noticed that he transitioned into being much less loving and much more irritable on the phone with me. He had a lot of stressors in his life - and on top, he was quitting weed, which he was legit addicted to and has had serious problems quitting before. For my part, I realized that I had let all my friendships lapse. I was lonely and really depressed. 

Last Sunday, we had another blowout fight. I had hung out the previous day with some female friends and gone on a hike with my ex, and I was finally not feeling depressed. I realized that our super-long (like a couple hours) nightly conversations were actually getting me down. He called me and I asked that we start sticking to just 7 to 8 on weeknights. He was furious - he said there was no way he would have a ""7 hour a week"" relationship with me, particularly if I was spending so much time with my ex. He then told me he was no longer comfortable with me talking with my ex. After several minutes, he told me to ""shut the fuck up"" and I hung up on him. 

I then tried emailing him in the least blaming way I could, reiterating how much I loved him. I told him that my main issue at this point was actually his anger and irritability. He didn't respond well or really address that. At around midnight, he sent me something to proofread. He got testy because it took me too long and I didn't catch all the errors. I called him out over text and he called and started yelling about how selfish I was to bring up my problems with his anger at that moment. 

I was very hurt after that. We talked for the next few nights with a degree of edginess and irritability from both sides. I didn't bring my stuff up again, but I was constantly thinking about it. 

Last night - Thursday - I called him at 5:40 and he texted me back that he was at happy hour and would call soon. I assumed that he would at least call by 7, the agreed time, but he did not. He finally called at about 8:10 and said that he was still at the bar and not ready to leave. I got steaming mad then. I told him we would talk tomorrow and got off the phone. 

Let me be clear - I normally wouldn't care much if my partner stayed at the bar late and didn't call until after expected. However, in my mind, he had flagrantly broken a rule that he had laid down for me to follow - talking at 7 and getting permission ahead of time for anything else. 

We had it out when he got home and he insisted that he hadn't broken the rule, told me I was in the wrong, etc. I told him that I just wanted an apology from him for breaking his own rule. Then the final straw happened - over the phone, he again told me to ""shut the fuck up."" He said it almost conversationally.

I lost it. I broke up with him on the spot. He told me that I couldn't take it back, that I had broken up with him once before and this was it. I stuck with it. He told me that I didn't deserve him and that in his view, he treats me really well. 

This morning he texted me again to tell me he thought I was crazy. I told him that the ""shut the fuck up"" had really done it in, and he told me that I shouldn't interrupt if I didn't want to hear it.

After some consideration, I texted back a non-angry message saying that I felt he had lost respect and empathy for me over the past couple weeks, and that he almost seemed likea stranger. I told him that I could not make a commitment with someone who gets mean when times are tough and who also won't acknowledge any fault. He didn't respond. 

I started really thinking about how the weed withdrawals might be affecting him more than I had realized. He has stuck with me through some vicious tempers, and I wanted to give him the same. I texted again at around noon telling him the above, but added that I need at minimum for him to acknowledge that he has a problem and then start trying really hard to treat me with empathy and respect. I added that I still love him. He didn't respond. 

All right Reddit, it looks like this one is over. I think we both thought for a time that we would spend our lives together, and I'm really sad. However, I know there are lessons I can take away from this. The problem is that I'm too deep in it and can't tell what all of those lessons are.

Please advise? I really want to learn from this one. 

------------------------------------

** TLDR:
Recently went long distance after about a year, it broke down within three weeks with fighting. My anger issues, depression and hatred of being controlled on the one side. His own temper plus marijuana withdrawals and fear that I didn't care about the relationship on the other side. He set a rule on when we had to talk after disagreements on frequency, then broke it. I broke up with him when he told me to ""shut the fuck up"" and am wondering where this all went to hell. **"

I would like to start a career in programming and development, but I don't know how to start from here.

2v2f9b,2,2015-02-07,20 year old looking to make his first investments on his own,notjoseph,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2v2f9b/20_year_old_looking_to_make_his_first_investments/,"I've been reading as many articles on here and the internet as possible to help me get started with investing for real. I've also been making sure to talk to successful investors I know personally. All in all, though, I have essentially zero experience here.

Here's my financial situation--I have:

-a $40k trust invested in diversified index funds that I legally have control over (though I choose to act as if it doesn't exist and let my father manage it). Barring a major life emergency, I plan to use this as a seed for a retirement account.

-a stock valued around $10k--all in Disney--that my mother legally controls through vanguard (not sure if it is in my name or not--I assume not). Once I have the logistics figured out, my mother has agreed to transfer ownership to me.

-an emergency fund/savings account (that I add to each month) sitting in a Chase ""college savings"" account that would last me 3-5 months at just under $7k, though I would feel more comfortable if I could invest this in some account that I could easily liquidate so that the money is not just stagnating.

-a $1500 savings account with Chase that is solely meant to be invested. I call this my ""play money"": Money that I want to use to gain more experience investing that I am comfortable losing.

I am a second year electrical engineering student in the silicon valley going for my BSEE with a definite plan to get my master's and possible plan for a Ph.D. I am fortunate enough to have my tuition completely paid for as well as having zero debts. I live in an apartment by myself. Each month my father gives me a $3500 allowance to cover my expenses including rent, groceries, car maintenance, incidentals, etc. I privately tutor students a few times a week at $40-$50/ hour, which brings in around $520 each month. Assuming I don't massively screw up, I have a guaranteed internship with NASA for at least four years that does not pay, though there is the possibility that I will be paid for a certain fraction of the year--dollar amounts have not been discussed yet.

--My rent is $2307/month, and I have four months left on my lease.

--Utilities: Between $40-$100/month

--About three times a year I spend between $300-$500 on textbooks for school.

--Cable and Internet: about $70/month

--Phone: Between $80-$100/month

--I tend to save anywhere from $300-$700/month

From what I've read online and what others have told me, I think I want to open an account with vanguard, though I cannot convince myself I know enough yet about investing or vanguard to do so without accidentally getting myself in some sort of unsavory situation. My goal is to learn about various types of investments while having some stable, long term investments for the future. More specifically, I am curious as to what would be best for each account/trust/stock I mentioned above. When my financial situation is slightly more stable I would also like to set aside a sum of ""play money"" to make a risky ""silicon valley"" investment (and I would greatly it if someone with more experience and wisdom could give me some more mature insight as to how good/bad of an idea this is).

Any advice at all is appreciated. Please let me know if there is any more information that I have left out!

2v2sag,1,2015-02-07,Maximize job search results?,DarkDubzs,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2v2sag/maximize_job_search_results/,"So I've gotten serious about beginning my career in IT. I've never had a job dealing with computers or anything with IT, but everyone has to start somewhere. I'm 18, and in college getting a BS in Business Administration with a focus in Computer Information Systems. I would prefer to take a Networking route, but for now, I'll take any job in IT just to get started. I know that a help desk job is common to start in, but that can be pretty broad I've discovered. I am up for any field in IT to start off, whether it be repairing computers, user support, junior systems admin, entry network tech, entry developing even, etc. It would have to be part time M-Sat after 4pm because that's when I get out of my classes during the week... is that a reasonable working time? Like can I work from 4 to 8 in this field? 

Anyways, I've tried many different search terms on Indeed and Craigslist. Stuff like ""help desk, junior systems, networking, network, network tech, systems admin, computer, computer support, end user support, user support, it support, it tech, etc."" with different variations of adding in entry, part, and part time. So far, I haven't found much around. They all either want years of experience, experience with stuff I don't know like programs and techniques and stuff, are full time, too far away, or don't work with my available hours. It's really frustrating to say the least. There must be something I'm missing or doing wrong. Are there any better sites to look on or search terms, or even tips to help with searching? Is there somewhere to look specifically for entry level jobs in this field? I know I should get an internship to start off just to get experience, but I really need income right now and I would rather begin my career path as well.  
Any help, tips, advice, or recommendations?"
2v2w0k,1,2015-02-07,I [19F] don't know where my relationship with my boyfriend [25M] is going.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2v2w0k/i_19f_dont_know_where_my_relationship_with_my/,"I started dating my boyfriend almost three years ago (since **Summer 2012**). We were both doing summer research at his college in Boston. We met one night when he was out walking his dog, and at first it had just been casual hook-ups. Within a week or so, we had gone on our first date. It turned out great, and we got along very well. Then the summer ended, and we parted ways. He stayed in Boston, while I went home to New York. We decided not to continue the ""relationship"" beyond that summer.


After a few weeks of being apart, we finally contacted each other saying that we had still been thinking of the other, so we decided to give it another shot. He came down for a visit, and then we decided that we wanted to try long-distance. The first 8 months went amazingly. We would talk for hours on end on the phone. I would frequently take weekend trips up to Boston to visit him, and likewise. 


Then he started growing distanced. In the past, we would frequently speak/text several times during the day. But now, he wasn't responding to my texts/calls anymore...sometimes for days, and once even a week. I felt extremely neglected.

I confronted him and asked what was going on. He explained that his occasional drug use had become a heroin addiction to the point that he was no longer attending his classes and was in debt trying to feed his disease.

He ended up being unable to deal with his addiction alone, so he went home and went into rehab. We still stayed together. From what I know, after the rehab program, he was clean.

During this period of neglect by my boyfriend, I started to reconnect with an old male high school friend. I had known that this friend in the past had had a crush on me, but that was so long ago that I didn't think he still had any lingering feelings. I had let my boyfriend know that this friend and I had starting talking again, but my boyfriend said he trusted my judgement so he wasn't worried. This friend and I had arranged a day to get dinner to catch up, and on that day, I checked with my boyfriend one last time to see if he was okay with it; this was another day that my boyfriend decided to take a day to himself and not answer any texts/calls, so I carried on with my plans. 

One thing led to another, and the friend and I ended up getting drunk and I ended up giving him head. Immediately afterwards, I came out of the brown/black-out, and I realized my horrible mistake. I started crying instantaneously, right in front of this friend, and I started frantically calling and texting my boyfriend to tell him my mistake. Sure thing, my boyfriend is nowhere to be found.

I finally get ahold of my boyfriend the next morning, and I tell him the entire story. He breaks up with me immediately to which I beg for his forgiveness. If I remember correctly, we spent a few days apart before he took me back; I don't know if he forgave me yet at that point. 

After we got back together, I went abroad for the summer to teach children English in Taiwan. As expected, communication between my boyfriend and me became sparse, although not hostile nor uneasy in any way. That summer also marked the end of our first year together (**Summer 2013**).

Right after I came back, I went to school. My boyfriend and I had originally made plans for him to join me at college for his Masters, so that we could finally end the long-distance relationship and be near each other. The day before registration for classes closed, he tells me that it isn't happening. Together, we decided that it just wasn't realistic to do long-distance for who-knows-how-long until we could finally be together, so we broke it off (**September 2013**).

That semester, I lived my life pretty recklessly, in terms of my social life. I had surrounded myself with people who partied and drank every weekend, and I had taken on those habits as well. As you've read, in the past, alcohol and I don't mix well, meaning I usually tended to find myself with a guy when drunk. It was always safe, consensual sex. But every time I got drunk, I would always call my then ex-boyfriend to tell him that I still loved him. I know how wrong and messed up that is -- to get someone's hopes up like that when we were supposed to be broken up and moving on, but that was truly how I felt. 

Those six months of reckless behavior really messed with my then ex-boyfriend's mind. He hadn't used drugs again, from what I had known, but was instead trying to get fit and just become better in general to win me back. And it worked. We got back together in** January of 2014**.

After a rather unfortunate turn of events, he was forced to go back on painkillers because of a car accident. This thus led to him becoming addicted to those painkillers, but I tried to be supportive of him. That **summer (2014)**, I took an internship in the city nearby his family home where he was staying. We spent almost every day together. He seemed to be doing great.

But then one day I caught him sniffing heroin. Immediately, I declared a breakup. We had talked about it in the past and had agreed that if he ever did heroin again that I would leave him. He then begged me to stay with him. I just couldn't do it. I couldn't leave. I loved him too much, and although I of course didn't want to see him doing drugs, I wanted to help him rather than just leave.

Long story, short, he overdosed a **few months ago**, but lived. This tore me up because I was there when he overdosed, and the image haunts me. I couldn't get out of bed for days. Immediately after his overdose, he went into inpatient rehab, so I knew he was being taken care of and was safe. Afterwards, he continued onto outpatient therapy, which is great! From what I know, he's still going strong, but recently he's been starting to do the whole neglect thing again...and he hasn't shown much initiative in terms of getting a job or keeping up with his classes.

I have an internship secured for this summer in a state nowhere near him, so we've made plans for him to come with me. We've also already made plans for him to join me at school again. I signed a lease on a house for us...but is this relationship worth pushing through? So many elements of our relationship rely on him, but I don't know if it's going to happen realistically. Yes, I love him and I care immensely for him, but given his past and current actions, should I trust that he'll pull through and that we'll actually end up together?

---   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend of almost three years (with a small gap) is a recovering heroin addict, and we've had our fair share of problems in the past. We still love each other and care about each other, but should we continue this or would it be healthier for both of us to part ways?

**Edit:** I get it. The age-gap is weird. We considered it too before we started dating, and that's why we were reluctant to do it from the start. Can you really not see past that?"
2v35th,3,2015-02-07,"I don't know which choice to make (Career) and either choice results in radically different outcomes, in different countries.",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2v35th/i_dont_know_which_choice_to_make_career_and/,"So, just as a little backgroud: I used to be depressed and didn't know how to live. I lived with my parents and didn't work. I got out of it by getting a job at a retailer, and getting a motorcycle. I decided I wanted to travel and took a solo trip to Europe, backpacked for 6 months. It was fantastic.  I'm 26 years old.   

Just as I was about to come home again I landed a job at an SAP consulting company as an Intern in Germany. A year of interning (It's been 6 months) and after that they will take me on as an apprentice and pay for my school (2 years), I'd also get a company car for travelling around. It's not well paid, but it's not starvation if I'm frugal. An apartment with a roommate would be half my monthly wage, but food here is cheaper.  If they take me on after my internship, I think they will, the potential is there to learn a lot and come out with a well paying job at the end. There's even the opportunity for travel as they have clients in England, Brazil, USA, and a couple others.   

Here's my problem: I'll always be a Canadian. I miss home. I miss the people, the atmosphere, I miss my family. I don't want to leave my sister as the only one to care for my parents as they get older. Germany is great for a lot of reasons, but the bureaucracy is insane and the people are a lot more closed off. Its harder to meet people, and when you throw the language difficulties in... I spend my week at work, my evenings at the gym, and my weekends struggling to maintain my sanity. The nearest large German cities are Karlsruhe and Freiburg. They're alright. 

So I've applied for the Canadian Navy. I'd get to live where my friends and family are, (West coast) and since i'm applying for a trade I'd also learn a lot in the IT field. (Communications, IT, on ships and land). The starting wage is livable and now that my expectations are more normal and I no longer think that I am a special snowflake, more than enough for me. I'd probably be happy, but housing on the west coast is a lot more expensive.

So on the one hand, I want to have adventures and see the world. The Navy would be great training and experience in a field that is growing. (IT). I'd get to not sit on my ass for 8 hours a day and actually do things. 

On the other, the career opportunity that I have here is pretty great as well. Good benefits, good vacation time, the ability to go to fantastic places just a stone throws away. (In comparison to Canada, anyway). The training and school would be hard in a second language but doable. I don't actually know if 'SAP Consultant' is good to have on a resume. 

TL;DR:  Career in Germany, or Career in Canadian Navy. Bundeswehr is not an option, the choice here is between countries, and I don't like the longer contracts and lower wage in the German military. 

Any advice at all on any of this would be so, so great.

2v3ahq,7,2015-02-07,Regular Show - The Death of Rigby,[deleted],creepypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2v3ahq/regular_show_the_death_of_rigby/,"I just want to start off by saying if you want an answer at the end, prepare to be disappointed. There just isn't one. 

I'm an intern at Cartoon Network Studios for a year in 2010 for my degree in animation. Although, it wasn't paid of course...most interships weren't...but it did have some perks beyond education. To adults it might not seem like a big one, but most kids will go crazy for it at the same time. 
Now, since I worked directly with the editors and animators, I got to view the new episodes days before they aired. I'll get right to it without giving too many unnecessary details. They had made the Regular Show episodes and the entie staff was somewhat sapped of creativity so it took them longer to start up the season. But the delay lasted longer for more upsetting reasons. There was a problem with the series 1 premiere that set everyone and everything back for several months.
 
Me and two other interns were in the editing room along with the lead animators and sound editors for the final cut. We received the copy that was supposed to be ""The Power"" and gathered around the screen to watch. Now, given that it isn't final yet animators often put up a mock title card, sort of an inside joke for us, with phony, often times lewd titles, such as ""The Green Blob."" instead of, ""Rigby's Body."" When Rigby ate too much junk food, and lost his body. Nothing particularly funny but work related chuckles. So when we saw the title card ""The Death of Rigby"" we didn't think it more than a morbid joke. 

Me and one of the interns did a small throat laugh at it. 

The shot goes outside with Mordecai's house with Mordecai's friends. Benson says that they have a lot of work to do. Pops and Skips will clean the garage, Muscle Man, and Hi-Five Ghost will clean the attic, and Mordecai and Rigby will give Benson a Grilled Cheese Deluxe, since it's not even lunch yet. He told everyone to get to work. Mordecai said to Rigby, ""Let's go to Cheezers for a Grilled Cheese Deluxe."" Rigby said OK, then, they both went into the cart. 

The scene flipped to Mordecai and Rigby in line inside the Cheezer's resturaunt. Rigby said, ""I want a Grilled Cheese Deluxe, please,"" to the cashier. ""One Grilled Cheese Deluxe, coming up,"" said the cashier. For about 1 minute, the cashier handed them the Grilled Cheese Deluxe that Rigby ordered and said, ""Here you go."" ""Oh, yes!"" Rigby said, excitedly. They both went out of the resturaunt, went into the cart, and stopped. Mordecai said to Rigby, ""Want to do extreme cartin'?"" 

""Extreme cartin'!"" Rigby said to Mordecai. Then, they both do the ""Whoooooooa!"" catchphrase. The scene flipped to Mordecai and Rigby doing cool tricks with the cart. After this, they went to the house. They went upstairs to Benson's room, and opened Benson's door. Benson looked at them. The Grilled Cheese Deluxe bag was burned! Mordecai and Rigby handed Benson the bag, and he said, ""What the-?"" What happened to my sandwich!?"" Rigby said, ""This isn't a sandwich."" 

Benson yelled, ""Go give me another Grilled Cheese Deluxe!"" Rigby said with a mean look on his face, ""No."" Benson's mad face was zoomed in. Then, he yelled and grabbed a hyper-realistic chainsaw. When he grabbed the chainsaw and started yelling, the camera started shaking. Rigby gasped when he looked up at the chainsaw, then the scene shot outside with Mordecai's window. The chainsaw pointed at Rigby, and Rigby screamed. Then, hyper-realistic blood came onto Mordecai's window. One intern just vomited on the floor.  ""Go give me another Grilled Cheese Deluxe!"" Benson yelled again. 

""No!"" Rigby replied, painfully. Benson said, ""I will tear you lint from lint!"" ""That's-that's what I thought,"" Rigby replied. The scene went back inside the house. The walls and floor were covered in blood, including Rigby. Then, Mordecai ran over to Rigby and said. ""Oh no! Rigby! Please don't be dead."" He hugged Rigby, and started crying. Then the static was playing. 

Then, the scene cuts to Mordecai, sitting on the couch, alone, looking very lonely and sad. The camera focused on him. There was no sound in the background. For about 20 seconds, he started to cry. 

He didn't want to play any videogames. He always played videogames with Rigby. He just went upstairs, crying, brushed his teeth, and went to bed. He still cries, until he went to bed. When he went to bed, he stopped crying. 

Then, the next morning, he got out of bed, walked downstairs,  went outside, and drove to the cemetery. After this, he walked around the cemetery. There were a lot of tombstones there. Mordecai went to the end of the cemetery, and stopped. There it was, a tombstone that said, ""Rigby."" on it. ""Rigby, I'll never see you again,"" Mordecai said, sadly. He cried violently, and got down on his knees by the tombstone. Then, the scene cut to black with music playing. The music was playing, ""Creepy Music Box."" Then, the credits played with the, ""Creepy Music Box"" song. That was the end of the episode. 

Just then, the creator of the show, JG Quintel, went into the editing room, looking so furious. He wanted to know what was going on. One of the interns zoomed out of the room at this point, and left me behind. I watched the episode twice with JG Quintel. After we watched the episode twice, JG Quintel wanted to know who made it. Well, the only theory we could think of was the file was edited by someone in the chain from the drawing studio to here. 

The CTO was called in to analyze when it happened. The analysis of the file did show it was edited over by new material. However, the timestamp of it was a mere 24 seconds before we began viewing it. All equipment involved was examined for foreign software and hardware as well as glitches, as if the time stamp may have glitched and showed the wrong time, but everything checked out fine. We don't know what happened and to this day nobody does. 

If you guys recognize the episode, let me know.

I tend to love big and love hard, which is probably my greatest downfall in a relationship. When I find someone I like, I really go after them :)

Kinda hoping to go on a date and take it from there if anyone is interested. Heck, or we could just cuddle and watch a movie in my room, take your pick. Your pic gets mine, but I just gotta shave first xD 

On another note, I'd be happy enough with a FWB if no one is really into the dating game here. Don't know how people normally are on this subreddit. "
2v3rka,1,2015-02-07,Can you help me figure out this complicated situation?,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/2v3rka/can_you_help_me_figure_out_this_complicated/,"Hello,

I have a complicated situation at my hands, and I'm asking reddit users for a little help because I can't figure it out by myself. I started a new internship and went on a date with one of the other interns. We hit it off basically. It went smooth, we ended up holding hands, sharing secrets, drinking beer and just enjoying each other's company. He kept gazing in my eyes and I gazed into his. It was like, ya know the perfect fucking scenario. At one point we even did the how to fall in love experiment... that article in the NY times, questions that are proven to make you fall in love with someone you're attracted to, and he ended up recording the conversation. All of that sounds wonderful, right?

Then of course something has to ruin the vibe, and that something is my attitude. He tried to kiss me in this bar, and I backed away. Laughing in his face kind of, but only because I was nervous and didn't want that setting to be our first kiss. It was obvious that he was offended and asked me to get an uber and then I went home, and things have been weird ever since.

Weird in the way that I can't read him or what he wants from me. I get mixed signals all of the time. I see him at work and one minute he's trying to hang out with me, and the next he's just ignoring me. A whole group of interns went out to happy hour a few weeks ago, and we all got really drunk. I tried to express my interest to him again, but he told me straight up that he thinks I have a bad attitude, that I bring the whole group down &amp; that I should try to spend more time with myself to not have this made-up contrarian personality that I possess. Sounds kind of harsh, right? Well after the said all of those things he continued to hang out with me and introduce me to his friends. This is why I am getting so many fucking mixed signals from him. Then the next week rolls around and we always sit across from each other at lunch and attend intern seminars, and he always seems to be close to me. The only thing is he doesn't text me to hang out. 

So what do I do? How do I tell him that I like him and how do I know if he likes me? "
2v3t2j,320,2015-02-07,"19, obsessed with escorts and masturbation",WholeNewMan,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2v3t2j/19_obsessed_with_escorts_and_masturbation/,"Hello Everybody,

I just recently got the courage to start NoFap and I thought I'd share my story in hopes of getting advice. I'm aware that I've done some terrible things in the past but I'd like to change. I don't want to be a loser any more.

I have been masturbating obsessively since I was 12. At first, it was just pictures of women in celebrity magazines. I'd get all excited seeing a beach model in a tiny bikini. It slowly turned into videos of women dominating men, mainly foot worship and face sitting etc.

My social life began to deteriorate as I would rush back home from school, sit in my basement, and watch videos of femdom porn for hours on end. My masturbation sessions lasted 4+ hours, with a constant erection. I would ejaculate 5+ times a day.

I continued masturbating to these videos throughout high school. Then when I turned 18, I started seeing escorts. And it wasn't for normal sex either. My first encounter with an escort involved me watching her have sex with her boyfriend (pimp) whilst she dominated and humiliated me. She spat on me, called me all sorts of names and even made me eat her boyfriends cum. As if that wasn't enough, she urinated on my face and told me to swallow. All because I asked her to.

After the session, I felt so degraded and I thought I would never see an escort ever again. Not to mention it cost me upwards of $400 for only 20 minutes. Although, I paid for an hour, she kicked me out after only 20 minutes. I felt like utter shit. On my way home, I just wanted to get hit by a big truck and end my misery. 

Unfortunately, that was only the start. I have seen 30+ escorts for similar scenarios. I feel humiliated, ugly and depressed. It's not that I particularly enjoy these fetishes. I just feel as if I'm too ugly and fucked up in the head to enjoy a normal relationship. It doesn't help that I've never had a girlfriend.

I've spent over $10,000 on escorts in the last year. It wouldn't be bad if I had a well paying job. But the truth is, I'm a university student and have taken out extensive loans to pay for my addiction. I'm in debt with the wrong people and am afraid I'm going to get fucked over if I don't stop and pay them back.

To add to all this shit, I've been struggling with a drug addiction. I can't tell you how I terrified I am. I've borrowed money from the wrong people. Big fucking guys with guns. I owe them a shit load and am constantly avoiding them as I don't have the money to pay them. I've blown it all on escorts. Fucking pathetic. 

I'm the lowliest scum to ever walk this earth. I want to change, I really do. I just don't know what to do. I'm trapped in this vicious cycle and feel so lonely. Recently, I tried going on no fap but only lasted 3 days. That's fucking pathetic. I'm trying again and am on my second day but I keep edging. It's either I hold up and my balls hurt for hours. Or I end up shooting a load.

I don't even know why I wrote this shit. No one probably cares. There are much bigger problems in this world and here I am crying about this shit. Sorry. Have a nice day and good luck with you're no fap journey.

EDIT: Thank you all for the support. I honestly thought I would get ridiculed and am surprised at the kind words you all have offered. I'm thinking of giving my university's counselling services a try. Hopefully they can help me out.

As for those who think I am making this up. I really really wish I was. Unfortunately, I'm stuck in this shit hole.

And as for the loan sharks problem. I apologize if I exaggerated the situation. It's just that I receive a lot of threats from these guys but I think I have it under control. I'm currently working and have already made a few payments. Like I said below, they are the same ethnicity as me and are therefore more lenient and patient with me. 

Besides, I have only borrowed $2000-3000 worth of drugs from them and should be able to pay them back within a few months with the money I earn from my internship. Assuming I don't do any more drugs. 

My real problem is the escorts. And fapping is a huge part of it.

2v46f3,1,2015-02-07,How I bought a $2624 MacBook Pro for $1850 ($774 savings),hutacars,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/2v46f3/how_i_bought_a_2624_macbook_pro_for_1850_774/,"Disclaimer: note the title doesn't end with ""...and how you can too!"" This is simply an explanation of the techniques I used to save almost 30% on a fairly major purchase. Some may work for you, some may not. Take away what you will.

It was the summer of 2012. I had a summer internship in New York though I lived in Virginia at the time. I had a MacBook Pro that was 6 years old and really showing its age, so it was time to look for a replacement. Apple had recently released the retina MacBook Pros, the first generation of the product, and I decided this was the machine I wanted. Problem was they started at $2199, and for that you only got 8 GB RAM-- since it was non-upgradeable, I wanted 16 GB, which was another $200. I later decided to bump the processor from 2.3 GHz to 2.6 for another $100. I don't recall what sales tax in NYC was at the time, but it was higher than Virginia's which was 5%, so it would only make sense to buy back in VA after the internship ended. After all was said and done, a typical Virginia consumer would have gone to Apple.com and paid ($2199+200+100)*1.05 = $2623.95 for the configuration I wanted. Except I didn't want to spend that kind of money.

Since this was the first generation of the product, there were none available used (at reasonable prices), so that was out of the question. Since I wanted a custom configuration, waiting for a sale on Amazon was also out of the question-- I would need to buy directly from Apple. So I hatched a plan.

As a student, I was eligible for a student discount. This amounted to $200 off the computer itself, $20 off the RAM upgrade, and $10 off the processor upgrade. This would get the price down to $2382.45 after tax. Woohoo!

But wait a minute: why pay tax? Apple does business in all 50 states, so I would be charged wherever I bought it. But not all states charge sales tax. Delaware is one such exception, and I would be passing through on my route back to VA. I looked it up and sure enough, there was exactly one Apple Store in Delaware, right off I-95 too! How convenient. Price is now $2269.

But there is one more thing. One thing the NYC Craigslist has an abundance of is gift cards. For some reason, they're harder to come across on the Washington DC Craigslist, so I took full advantage. I bought three Apple Store gift cards with the following balances/prices paid/percentages saved:

* $342.38 for $300 (12.38%)

* $1727 for $1450 (16.04%)

* $500 for $400 (20%)

By buying these cards I saved $419.38, but the more important number is the percentage amount saved. If I can get a $1000 card for $900, that's great, but it's not as good as getting a $100 card for $85 (10% vs 15%). Most people try to sell their cards for 5-10% off, so you have to work to find deals like I did, but it's very, very worth it. I now had $2569.38 worth of cards, but I only needed $2269 and I only spent $2150! Even if I threw away the remaining balance after buying the computer I would still come out ahead. But obviously I wouldn't do that. The computer was now $1849.62.

It was at this point I hit a snag. Apple had only recently introduced the option to have a custom configuration shipped to a store, and since they were still dealing with a large volume of rMBP orders, they hadn't yet brought that option to the product line. Late August I went home, and the option still hadn't arrived, so I went home empty handed. The option finally appeared a few weeks later... about two weeks before the September 21 launch of the iPhone 5. Perfect! I was going to buy an iPhone 5 anyways, so driving to Delaware to save $113.45 laptop tax + $32.45 iPhone tax wasn't so bad. I placed my order, then on midnight of Sep 21 I drove to Delaware, waited in line, and got my prizes. I went with a friend who was also buying an iPhone, so not only was the line waiting more fun, but we split the gas.

And that is how I saved $774.33 on a MacBook Pro."
2v4bu2,0,2015-02-07,Need some Calgarian help in choosing an area to live in.,mcrackin,Calgary,https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/2v4bu2/need_some_calgarian_help_in_choosing_an_area_to/,"I'll be moving to Calgary at the end of May and need some help in determining which areas I should consider living in as I don't know the city as well as someone who's lived there a long time.

Has there been any rental market corrections with the fall in the price of oil when considering vacancy rates and cost?

Some background...I did an internship there last summer and lived in Mission and walked to work downtown which is going to be my base for judging everything else. It took me about 30-40 minutes to walk to work every morning and I would like to continue to not have to drive to work and pay for parking. The place I was renting was a 2 bedroom split with a roommate, was furnished, modern, and paid $2400/2.

For May, I'm looking for a place I can call home for 3-5 years, so I'm going to be a little more picky. I'd like to spend anywhere from $1000-$1500/month, non-furnished and have it *less* walking time than my previous place to downtown. 20-25 minutes. I'd consider this time around riding a bike to work if it meant more bang for my buck, but in that case I'd want to get to work by bike in less than 20 minutes because I'd have to change at work.

My job is decent so I'd like to have a pretty decent place that's not over 30 years old and was previously flooded.

Simple searching on kijiji or rentfaster yield pretty good results - but in terms of riding a bike to work I'm just not sure what areas have the best ""paths"" to get downtown so that is the area I'd appreciate most help.

Thanks everyone in advance!

2v4cg7,3,2015-02-07,[Field Attempt]Pick up fuck up,might-Throwaway,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/2v4cg7/field_attemptpick_up_fuck_up/,"Hi Seddit, I've been lurking around for a while but after tonight, I really need some advice. 
Background: I'm ethnically Chinese, from South East Asia. 5'9"", fairly athletic, fairly good looking(I think), I've had girls tell me I'm cute and that I don't look purely Asian.
Anyway, I'm 19. I was stuck in boarding school for the past few years and I've only had one girlfriend, which was a long distance relationship so nothing really happened. (3rd base meh.) 
I discovered Seddit the past few months and I've been reading a lot of material linked here (manson's models, menprovement podcast) etc.

I am currently in Beijing , China for an internship until college starts. It's great to have the autonomy of living alone in a big city.

I went out with a buddy of mine, let's call him Calvin to the bar district. Now we arrive at a bar, picked up drinks, then I see a Chinese girl sitting alone at a table. She looks older than me, but attractive enough I approached her and asked if I could sit down. We hit it off right away, let's call her Sarah. 

From experience, older girls tend to 'kid zone' me when I tell them my age (Awww you haven't even gotten into college, you're so young) So I tend to lie about my age. I said I was 22. her English was alright and she asked where I'm from Etc anyway, before long i have established rapport. I got physical right away, touching her hand etc, pulling her in by pretending I couldn't hear her (loud music at bar). Her boobs grazed my arm more than a few times and I'm sure she noticed.

 Then her friend, let's call her Lisa, returned to the table. Calvin, being the awesome wingman, came right in. We introduced each other, and I isolated her while Calvin talked to the friend. I asked if she danced, and we went on the dance floor and she was dancing extremely suggestively, facing me. I grab her hands, waist, etc. 
But I'm a pussy Seddit. I didn't capitalize this opportunity. I was Summoning the courage to go for the kiss, dancing for about 10 minutes, singing, then suddenly her male colleague shows up. She excuses herself, then her and her friends crowd around this colleague, whose a middle aged Chinese guy with fraying hair in an expensive suit. 

I felt let down. But immediately moved to the next table where two chicks (a normal looking blonde and her friend) were sitting. Again I intro myself, made small talk about work etc and was having great fun. I noticed Sarah watching me from the corner of her eye. I ignored her, and continued flirting with them. When I went back to my table, Sarah was chatting with Calvin. She asked where I've been, and I introduced her to the blonde and friend. She talked for a while, then we chatted. I could tell that she's jealous because she became way more assertive, she tugged at my scarf, played with my hair then led me off to dance. 

Now this is where it all went downhill Seddit. 
I was primed for the kiss. Avicii's you make me was playing. I had my hands around her waist I caught her eye, wanted to lean it.
Suddenly , a hand caught Sarah's arm and twirled her around and I was introduced to Sarah's 'best friend since middle school'. I tried to join the conversation but Sarah told me to wait for her at the table because she has some catching up to do.

I return to the table. Calvin was chatting with Lisa. I saw a dude lets call him Ryan, sitting alone at a table, and went to talk to him. He is tall, white, the kind of bespectacled nerdy professional in his late 20s, from the US on an assignment to Beijing. We talked about stuff and I found him friendly enough that I invited him to join the table since he was alone. But it turns out, the blond and her friend had left. Ryan joined the table and immediately, Sarah sat next to him. She started being extremely flirtatious, even putting her hands on him etc. I got quite jealous, and tried to join the conversation. She seemed to enjoy being fought over by two guys. Then another song played, I used that as an excuse and brought her back to the dance floor.

She seemed reluctant. Once the song started she told me, and I quote :""I want you to dance with me like a man"" I was caught flat footed. After awkwardly trying to deflect the question, I leaned in and kissed her. On the lips. She pulls away immediately and told me I was too young, not her type etc. I couldn't control my emotions and insulted her on her age. (She's three years older than I'm pretending to be- 25) Needless to say it didn't end well. She went right back to the table, pulled Ryan to the dance floor and wrapped her arms around the neck. I went back to the table, and tried to carry on. But I felt horrible and the night was ruined. So I made an excuse and left. Calvin later told me that Lisa told him, that Sarah liked older men, around their thirties.

I know most of you guys are going to tell me that I'm young, and to keep trying. But I can't shake the feeling I cock blocked myself asking Ryan to the table. What the fuck was I thinking? Fucking hell Seddit. I keep thinking I couldve sealed the deal if I escalated faster, if I didn't fucking hesitate when going for the kiss. And why the fuck invite a lone white guy to the table? I'm not racist. But in the seduction arena, white men have an unfair advantage. (If you disagree check your privilege Cyka blyat) . Do you think I should lie about my age (25+?) and job too? (I hear Chinese girls care a lot about socio-economic backgrounds)

I would love any advice and would like to apologize in advance for the spelling, prose and formatting. I'm drunk and typing this on my phone. Just need to get this off my chest. Thanks bros of Seddit 

Edit: Spelling. Also, playing What Sarah Said on loop"

How likely is it that I will have to take a drug test?

How long should I not smoke for my system to be clean? What other things can I do to make sure that I pass? Any other input you might have would also be appreciated.

I'm a 20 year old male, 150lbs, about 6ft, and I don't exercise. I just started smoking this semester, so for about 3 weeks. I usually only smoke once a day so I can get to sleep but sometimes I'll smoke 2 or 3 times (usually on weekends) just because I can. The main reason I smoke is so I can sleep so the longer I can get away with smoking, the longer I can actually sleep, not miss class and other important stuff like that. Thanks Ents!"

2v4tei,31,2015-02-07,I just realized this is my mom...,Lulamay16,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2v4tei/i_just_realized_this_is_my_mom/,"Hi, I just needed to share/vent/talk
I saw a link to this in another subreddit and I just realized that this is my mother... I'm 17 and still living with her for a little while longer. Here goes...
So our biggest contention is chores. She likes to make me do several hours of it daily, like more than any of my friends do, cleaning up after our entire 5-person family. These are inconveniencing requests, like ""empty and load the dishwasher before you go to school""... I wake up at 5:30, and I would have to wake up at 5 to do that. I get about 3 hours of sleep because of trying to balance 5 APs with her chores at night and in the morning. I do it anyway a lot of days, and get to either miss breakfast, not shower, or lose sleep. Then she turns around and makes stuff up- ""you did nothing all week, you can't go out with your boyfriend""... Several hours of chores a day, how do you even deny it. My boyfriend is getting ticked at this... we are in a long-term, stable happy relationship, but I can't expect him to stay with me when we see each other (total) for about 45 affection-free minutes a day during lunch break at school. 
Speaking of her ticking off my boyfriend, she is late to EVERYTHING. she has kept him waiting at a train station for an hour and 30 because she had to look GOOD to pull up, let me out, and drive off. She doesn't have time for 30 minutes a week of driving for me to get to orchestra rehearsal, and her bitching and moaning before finally driving me there has made me late so often that I'm going to get kicked out soon. This is an amazing national orchestra- people will drive from 2 hours away to practice if they get in. I worked my ass off for that audition, and she does this? She got me kicked out of my studio group too, and wasn't willing to give up 15 minutes a week of her life to drive me to lessons anymore, so now my music is going down the drain. Any time I get mad, she calls me crazy, implies all sorts of things. I've been eating really disorderedly (starving, throwing up, etc) for the better part of a year now since she started buying me XL clothes, and acting all disapproving every time I try to get food. She made me wait so long to wear makeup, and basically calls me slutty every time I get dressed up to go out anywhere. I'm trying so hard to convince myself that I'm not a huge crazy bitch, but it's hard, because she pushes it off on me all the time, and my dad always takes her side. She put me in therapy with a social worked and convinced her I was a total nutcase because I started cutting thanks to mommy and her stress. Then I moved to a psychiatrist because the social worker was about ready to institutionalize me, and I got to make a good first impression before my mom got her, so the psychiatrist was on my side, and my mom still managed to almost get me on heavy anti-psychotics (mind you, this was for depression, mild self-harm, insomnia, and abusing cough syrup) and get me put away. The psychiatrist told her to loosen up on her parenting style, and all of a sudden I no longer had to go to therapy. She guilt-trips me daily about taking so many APs and ""taking up all her time""... is it my fault for wanting to better myself? She's always making these sideways digs and off-hand slights, one time she threw something in the sink while I was doing dishes and got me soaking wet with nasty oily water, then refused to let me change because ""she didn't do it and I did it to myself being immature""... So I got to stand there being grossed out and freezing. She's anti-vaxxer, and luckily where I live this hasn't precluded me from school, but I get the flu annually and it's terrible. My 10 year old brother is her perfect angel, got ""brain damage"" from ""aluminum"" in the vaccines, and he concusses himself all the time, so of course you know he can grab my ass without any problem, but if I slap his hand away I don't leave the house for a week. She always says I stay in my room too much but I can't stand to be around her. I have foggy memories of when she said I was wetting my pants, but I wasn't, and she got me basically molested by a 70-year old male doctor while holding me down while I screamed my head off.... She also broke my thumb by hitting it when I was ""making her late"" to my sister's school's holiday show, and she forced me to come with a broken thumb and cried through the whole show. She made me lie to my teacher when I went back to school, and the nurse in the ER said I probably deserved it. I was being bullied in the 6th grade because I was a white girl in a ghetto school, all the other (12-year old holy shit) girls were sexually active, and they managed to convince me that I was a lesbian because I wasn't, they broke my glasses and my ankle and my will to live, then when I finally got it sorted out and got them to stop and begged her not to prosecute them, she did anyway, and it got so bad I tried to put a pen into my neck in the bathroom during math class. She stresses me out so much... I started drinking and abusing benadryl pretty heavily when I was about 14 because of the stress she was putting me under, and she did the lecture thing where she will sit me down and bitch at me and humiliate me for hours on every possible subject, and she did it for 2 months, every night. I almost killed myself so many nights afterwards... She made me take my door off, I couldn't be home alone, I had to strip naked in front of her to check for cuts, she stole all the passwords for all my accounts so that I effectively couldn't share with anyone the hell I was going through at home. this year, I opened up to someone, and they went to my school's counselors, because apparently vague thoughts of suicide is no different than holding a gun to your head, and the counselors told her everything even about my sexually abusive ex-boyfriend from 9th grade. she ransacked my room and didn't leave me alone for weeks. I'm losing it, I can't take her shit anymore... Nothing is ever good enough for her, not my clothes, not how I dress, I have a fucking 4.4 GPA and it's not enough. She tries to guilt me out of any happiness I find, and if I call her out on anything it can never be her fault. She's incapable of apology. I've never opened up to anyone about this, they won't believe me because she's such a high-class socialite and all that shit, and I'm the math and computers loving female that wears all black and looks tired. I mean, which one would YOU respect? I'm so humiliated, every time I think about half the shit she's told our family friends about I want to claw my skin off. I really wanted a summer internship at the NSA for cryptography, but then I realized that I had no chance because there wasn't a single family friend that they could interview for clearance that didn't think I was some creepy basement-dwelling psycho. Also, I haven't shared this because people would think I'm lying-- how does all this shit happen to a 17-year old, they must be a lying attention whore, seriously? I'm sorry. thank you if you read this. I'm really sorry for taking up your time if you did. That was hard to write."
2v4xl0,2,2015-02-07,"Anhedonia, lack of common sense, loss of self etc; I did this all to myself and deserve to die",LifeLine12345,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2v4xl0/anhedonia_lack_of_common_sense_loss_of_self_etc_i/,"Posting on a throwaway.

My life has been a series of ""one step forward, two steps backward"" on one long continuous downward spiral starting from college. Codependency from high school led to being pushed into college I felt intensely alienated from (mostly Greek-heavy party school, lack of diversity) but was paralyzed with indecision on transferring or dropping out.

Intense suicidal ideation and depression/anxiety led to extreme procrastination and avoidance issues, leading to my college transcript being fucked with I's turning to F's (for fucking electives) by the time I got my degree. Random studying abroad and internships without a coherent plan for what I would do for a job after college. Met with therapists on and off-campus, knew I had issues with codependency with my family, but still ended up relapsing after time. Had irrational codependent beliefs that I needed to kill myself for my parents to realize my mental issues and to compromise on my choice of major by the time I walked for graduation, so I basically wasted my time and stunted myself emotionally by beating myself up the whole time. Still had opportunities to fix my grades but fucked it up as well.

Moved out of my parents' place and was financially independent with a call center job for a year but relapsed on financial help due to pressure from my roommates after my car broke down completely which turned into moving back in.

Had a great two-year relationship after college but I fucked that up as well. Then I felt it was the right time to head off to Taiwan to pursue English teaching after I genuinely believed I had a handle on my anxiety issues after success weaning off Prozac (instead of, y'know, examining myself for what went wrong). This in spite of doing online interning with copywriting and looking at local ad agencies to get into. Went abroad, fucked up during the training process, had a 3-day anxious breakdown in a hostel that left me with anhedonia (vs depression) that has stayed with me since.

A lot of my personal identity was based on my visual thinking and creative spirit (which I didn't make much practical use of anyways) which has been basically erased from this anhedonia I'm still suffering from. Working with a new therapist is just retreading old ground, got admitted to a psych ward for 2 weeks for the first time after suicide note/self-harm/trying to OD on pills. My memory, which wasn't great before, is awful now and everything from cigarettes to medication to feeling hungry/full are messed up from what I'm sure was brain damage from chronic anxiety. I overeat and have issues with self-grooming where I had no issue before. I can't clear my mind with meditation anymore and don't even have an ""inner critic"" anymore - just physical stress that shows itself in shaking hands, twitching temple/eye, whole body stress, etc.

So, here I am now: A codependent, senseless, hopeless, anxiety-ridden, worthless human being who is smart and self-aware enough to realize these things but lacks the emotional self-control to persistently do something about it during a critical phase in my life. I did excellently in high school, but I let codependency and passivity and self-destructiveness ruin myself to the point of robbing myself of my previous (overly-extreme) ambition and happiness and passion in exchange for emotional stuntedness and lost opportunities socially and academically. I've always had so much more empathy and care for other people than I've ever given myself.

I don't see any hope now. I've lost spirituality and faith in myself and my optimism, the latter of which I see now as a shield for avoidance and procrastination. I can barely support myself, let alone thrive with life. How can I navigate my own life as an adult if I keep fucking up on my own accord?

I know suicide is traumatic for family and random people to witness; I hate myself for being selfish and self-centered to do this to others but still feeling the need to die anyways. Regrets of personal hopes and dreams I neglected out of lack of self-confidence and passivity to pursue from high school and a past rooted in codependency, financial and emotional manipulation still haunt me now. It seems like I can only come up with the best decision for myself long after the boat sailed.

tl;dr I am trapped in this senseless, emotional-wrecking ball of a body and I need out. And it's all my fault."

My name is Catherine, but you may call me Miss Catherine. :)

I'm on the lookout for a writing partner I click with and can develop a good chemistry with. The more the merrier I always say. :)

I apologize for the length of this post, but I'm hoping it'll garner some great responses.

I'm very eager to turn you into the pretty girl maybe you wished you were or didn't know you could be. I love forced feminization. French maids. Turning boys into office girls. Domestic servitude. I have a smoking fetish, enjoy and love power exchange. High heels, skirt suits, Strap-on play, etc etc.

I usually play a dominant female character. I have a very big sensual side to my personality. I do enjoy discipline and domestic and corporal punishment, but this usually to correct the behavior of the character who is the submissive in the story we're telling. I'm not into creating pain (real or imaginary) without a purpose. 

I will be as committed to a story as you are. If you show great dedication and effort, I will return the favor and we'll have a great time. All I ask is for open communication.

Good dialog, realistic dialog is very important. I like a slow burn with plenty of character development. I like realistic scenarios taking place in the real world as well.

Writing in 1st person is preferable. I like long form stories over the course of chat sessions over IM. YIM is preferable. Sex is important to the story, but the sex scenes should be earned. Good dialog, realistic dialog is very important. I like a slow burn with plenty of character development. I like realistic scenarios taking place in the real world as well. 

I have a couple prompts on hand and I will share them with you.

***

**Prompts**

1. **The Auction**: *You've been unemployed for the last six months and the bills are really starting to pile up. You notice an ad in the newspaper that states a privately owned staffing company is looking to fill spots fast. Job duties will require long hours, cooking, cleaning and some manual labor and possible overnight stays, but that is at the discretion of the employer. Payment and rewards are negotiable. You decide to call the number to set up an interview, but little did you know what you were about to enter into.*

2. **The Lady &amp; Her Maid:** *You've had a crush on me since our college days together, but you never acted on it, and were too embarrassed to after I walked in on you wearing a pair of panties and enjoying yourself. I never brought it up, and never used it to humiliate or blackmail. To you, it was in the past and you were eternally grateful to me. We've fallen out of touch for a few years, but after a messy divorce you return to the city a bit broken, with damaged confidence and a depleted bank account. It's a good thing Miss Catherine knows how to make things all better.*

3. **Miss CEO:** *Years ago you hired me for an internship out of college, but it was just because you thought I was some silly blonde who would be painting her nails as she took phone calls. You even talked behind my back, and even though you were married, you'd brag to your buddies about what a hot lay I probably was. ""She's never going to go anywhere,"" you said. You thought you were untouchable as you were the best sales manager the company had going. But then the economy tanked, and so did your marriage, you put on weight, started cutting corners at work, and suddenly you were a shell of your former self and out of a job. Then, one day, you we happen to run into each other and suddenly you have a very important favor to ask.*

4. **A Romance Like No Other:** *We've been longtime co-workers. You've had a crush on me since we started on-boarding together at our company, but I've always politely thwarted your advances and keep things work appropriate. You tried dating other girls, but it was hard when your desire for me was always there in the back of your head. We had great conversations and even though our aspirations were different, we enjoyed sharing our dreams for the future. However, you just couldn't figure out how to crack my code. You tried to be more stereotypical alpha male -- that didn't work. You tried to impress me with the things you could afford -- that didn't work. Finally, during a company Xmas party, you get a little tipsy and ask what it is you need to do to win favor with me. I smile politely. Then I ask if opening that door is really something you want to do.*

***

**Serious inquiries only please.** Not looking for a one shot. I want to build characters and write an enjoyable story. Please be willing to IM. Also, be a *good* writer.

{*Remember, if you're a sub you want to make sure that your dominant is enjoying herself as well.*}

**NOT into scat/blood/torture/bondage/or anything with bestiality or incest.**

I look forward to hearing from you!

Miss Catherine"
2v5l0f,2,2015-02-07,Youtube Issue I cannot seem to fix...,goldswimmerbj,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/2v5l0f/youtube_issue_i_cannot_seem_to_fix/,"Hello TechSupport peoples, today I come with an issue that I have been unable to fix for several months now.

I am very tech savvy (In fact I like to spend time here helping people and intern in my schools IT department)

However, I just cannot seem to fix one issue. I have a very high end desktop, running an i7 4790k at 4.9Ghz, 16gb Ram, an SSD, several HDDs, a Swiftech H220x cooler and enough fans that even under full load air coming out of the system still feels cool.

Now onto my issue:

No matter what I do 4k video on YouTube ALWAYS lags. It reports 24fps yet I can plainly see that it is dropping down to around 10 (with noticeable stutter) This also happens on my brothers build with an intel Xeon 1340V3.

I cannot for the life of me figure out whats going on. Ive tried forcing my GPU into a higher power state, Ive tried enabling HW acceleration in my browser, Ive tried everything I can ans it still has this issue. My Internet Should be able to handle the stream too (Its a wired 120mbps (15MB/s) and 25mbps upload).

Does anyone here have any ideas?"
2v5nvh,69,2015-02-07,"It's okay for now, I have a workaround!",[deleted],talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2v5nvh/its_okay_for_now_i_have_a_workaround/,"Hi, TFTS! I haven't posted in a while so I figured that I would share a story with you that took place last week. I am a Service Desk turned Desktop Support ""intern"" (I've been working here for quite a while) at a very large multi-line-of-business corporation on the west coast. This is a tale about a user and his adventures with Adobe Acrobat. 

One day, I was assigned a ticket to help a user at one of our other close-by office locations with a problem in Acrobat. The ticket didn't say very much, other than the fact that it froze because of some unstated reason and that he had to restart his computer to get back to work. Now, I know that he didn't *HAVE* to do that, he just didn't know how to kill a task using Task Manager.

So, I call him up and remote in to see what is going on. He attempts to duplicate the issue:

&gt; User: ""So now, I click ""export"" on $other_web_app and it opens this dialogue box that asks me to save or open in Acrobat. So I open it, try to print, and- there!""

Acrobat froze when he clicked the print button. Hmmm. He was opening a generated document that came from another web application, so maybe that application was the problem - or did Acrobat need a reinstallation? I had a few starting points and said that I would call him back ASAP after I killed the task for him.

What ensued was a week-long process of struggling to get ahold of him despite his voicemails that the issue was still unresolved, uninstalling and reinstalling the custom software for the web app that allowed it to generate documents, repairing and reinstalling Acrobat, to no avail.

Now, he also mentioned at one point that he had found a workaround for the issue, and it never dawned on me to ask what it was. But, I quickly found out when I physically went to his desk after trying all this time to fix it remotely.

I hadn't paid too much attention (my personal mistake) to what he believed was the correct way of going about this process of his, nor did I know exactly what this process' purpose was. It turns out, he was not printing these PDF files, but he was *printing generated PDF files - to PDF - to store them on a shared drive.* His workaround - you guessed it - was to just click ""save"" on the dialogue box, like anyone should be doing.

I also found out that he kept many, many text files and virtual sticky notes (thanks, Windows 7) saved to his desktop, as well as the entirety of his personal documents. His My Documents folder, backed up to the network, had 0 files in it. His profile on the local machine was 2.21 gigs, the largest that I had seen on anyone's machine.

I told him that the combination of his huge, huge accumulation of files as well as his back-asswards process is probably causing the problem. Of course, he refused to believe me and told me that his process requires less clicks than just saving the file. ^wut

So, I cleared his profile after having him move **everything** to his My Documents folder, and lo-and-behold, his PC is faster than ever. He continues to print PDFs to PDF, refusing to connect the dots between his process and the lack of logic behind it."
2v5sxn,1,2015-02-07,Graduated. Now what?,aguyonline,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2v5sxn/graduated_now_what/,"I graduated in May 2014 with a degree in computer science, and I am still looking for a job. I’m looking for advice and some help because I feel like I’m doing everything wrong.

It took me way more than 4 years to finish my degree. In my opinion, I think I’m pretty close to the bottom of the barrel for a coder. I didn’t do exceedingly well in my computer science classes. There’s several I had to retake because I failed the first go around (or even the second go around for some classes). Some of it was because of depression, but I don’t really like blaming that, and it really doesn’t make sense to. Because of my low skills and talent, I’ve had only one internship, and that was from 5 years ago. I likely only got it because of a friend that was already working there. I really have nothing on my resume related to programming besides that one internship and my degree.

When I was a bright-eyed freshman, I always wanted to be part of a startup, start a startup, end up at those behemoths like Google, Amazon, Apple, or Microsoft, or go into game development. Those dreams are pretty much all but dead. For a while, I thought I could work somewhere and then move on to my dreams, but I haven’t even gotten to the first step of getting a job.

I am also unfortunately picky about jobs. I live in the DC beltway, so everything around here is some lame government or government contractor job. I shouldn’t say lame. I’ve applied to some. But my issue is, a lot of these employers don’t actually tell you what they’re working on and only say they’ll provide you a clearance if necessary. I can get excited about working on something cool like a satellite for NASA, but I am not thrilled about something like crunching numbers for the Census Bureau, for example. I’ve talked to some of these companies, and they’re either mum about their future projects or talk about projects I’m not interested in. So, because of that, I’ve been dodging government jobs and this area in general. I am looking for private sector work, so many jobs I apply for are out of state. I apply, but I’m getting no leads. Now, this could be just par for the course, if location is pretty important, but I’m not sure.

The one thing I might have going for me is that I did well on group projects in my computer science classes. I usually took the leadership role and did everything but code for these projects and aced them every time. I guess ideally it would be nice to be a project manager, but I think those kinds of jobs are reserved for more seasoned employees.

So what am I doing wrong? Or am I just a bad programmer and getting what I deserve? I may sound brash and naive, so you can hit me as hard as you want with reality. The patient will take his medicine. With my skills or lack thereof, is there a kind of job I should be applying for? I’ve been applying for testing and QA positions lately, and even had an interview that went well for one. But is there anything else I should be looking at?"

&lt;BOOTING PILOT CONSCIOUSNESS&gt;
	
&lt;CPT MORGAN ONLINE&gt;



	
Morgan awoke with a rush of information being input and processed in the massive body that she was currently inhabiting. Visual, EM, touch, sound, internal diagnostics all screaming inside her mind, the Chicxulub trying to make sense of what was going on and provide its Pilot with the information needed to fight effectively. 
	
After quickly reviewing the less than satisfactory status of her body, she turned her sense outward. There were a lot of small aliens near her feet, doing god knows what. She noticed in the logs that there had been enough power sent through the primitive wiring they had so generously shoved into the gaping hole in her side.
	
*So they were trying to activate me? Now that's a good idea...* she thought to herself. With barely a thought, she drew on the power that had been stored in the battery system to feed energy to SH-GEN3.
	
As the field of quantum wrongness spread across her, cutting the supports that had been holding her up previously, she snarled in pain. The electrical system was damaged worse than the reports had indicated. 
	
As she refocused on the lifeforms beneath her, her entire sensor suite did its best to tell her everything there was to know about them. They were all uncatalogued, expected of life that had come about far after she had gone into stasis, as well as being in another galaxy entirely.
	
Most importantly, however, there was no sign of the FILTH she had been sent here to eradicate. It seemed that they were successful in their mission.
	
She kneeled down to get closer to the lifeforms that were pointing their primitive energy weapons at her. Did they really think they would have an affect on her?
	
“What are you, and why have you experimented on me?” She declared.

While everyone around him seemed to have emotions ranging from pants-shittingly terrified to nervous, Xi was happy. Things had gone even better than expected, apparently the pilot had survived after all.
	
“We thought you were dead. There were no life signs. By the way, impressive of you to raid our computer system so quickly, given that you're speaking Common.” Xi spoke, his augmentations turning the clicking of his mandibles into the language that he was biologically incapable of speaking. 
	
The Thing regarded them for a moment, all six eyes, forward facing, scanning over them, before it straightened its back and stood. One of its massive arms reached around to the back of its skull, and seemed to grasp something. Even from the distance they were at they could hear something internal moving around inside the Thing, parts repositioning and changing to accommodate some form of movement.
	
It brought its hand back around, and they all could see that it held something in its palm. As It kneeled and lower the hand close to the ground, all present realized that it the pilot of the Thing. The same long limbed body structure, four limbs, bipedal, and wearing aesthetically similar armor. Xi noted that they couldn't see the beings face, or determine its gender, given that it was wearing a complete mask and helmet.
	
Anyi and his security teams were nervously keeping a constant bead on the pilot, while most of the scientists, the ones who weren't handpicked by Xi anyways, were simultaneously panicking and recording everything. The ones he had handpicked were just recording and wondering if they could run faster than their interns.
	
The Pilot hopped from the palm of the Thing's hand, to the tops of its finger, and then jumped down to the ground. The closed-face helmet, the same white as the armor of the Thing, but lacking the burn marks and battle damage, split into several pieces and floating via impossible precise gravity manipulations into the neck of the Pilot. It, unlike the Thing, had only two eyes, but had a similar facial structure. Distinctly different from its chariot, the Pilot had long, almost gold colored, strands of fur on its head, tied into a knot that flowed down its spinal region. It eyed the security team with some suspicion, the sides of its mouth pulling up in a smirk that revealed long, sharp, teeth as it watched one of the newer members who was loosing his cool at what was going on. It lazily turned to regard Xi.
	
“You are forgiven. But you should be aware that there are likely others who will not be as friendly when they are awoken,” Voiced the Pilot, with an alien accent, different to any Xi had heard before. *I wonder,* thought Xi *if it uploaded the language to its mind? It doesn't to be a translator doing that. Impressive, if that is the case.*

“Oh god oh god oh god we're going to die,” muttered Hem, trying to drag as much air as he could into his lungs with gulping breaths.
	
“Shutup, we'll be fine. We're gonna make bank off this recording!” responded Vin happily with his eye pressed to screen to make sure he was getting all that he could of what was going on.
	
“What is wrong with you! What part of *ancient super-robot* being activated not [200 feet] away aren't you getting?! Havent you ever seen *Glorfax the Destroyer*?
	
“That's a movie. Just because you were high out of your mind doesn't make that real, dumbass. That can't happen in real life.”
	
“No but the giant robot and the weird alien pilot makes it real! It's happening! I know how this is gonna end! Who's crazy now, huh, Sylus?!
	
“Don't bring her into this...” mutter Vin “But you do have a point. There's not much happening now, but we should probably get out of here before someone notices us. Namely Anyi.”
	
“Oh god, why did I follow you, I don't want to get killed by Anyi.”
	
“So he's scarier than the robot now, Hem?”
	
“He's always scarier”

They stood overlooking the sea of sapients, moving in currents, all of them focused on their own thoughts and priorities. If they had looked up, they would have thought the two figures on the catwalk above were simply two vagrants, mercenaries, or other such sorts and ignored them completely. They would be wrong. Only one of them was.
	
The other was just as morally corrupt, but held a much higher position, at least in the eyes of the general populace. He stood straight, the stance of one who was used to high society, but dressed in the garb of one who would never dream, nor want, to step foot in a place like where he was from. 
	
“So,” drawled out the first of them, leaning with his forearms on the railing, tapping the metal catwalk's floor with his boot. “they've activated one. Got the pilot out too, apparently”
	
“Aye, they've turned it on. Most complete one yet,” crisply responded the Second.
	
“I assume you want me to test the waters a bit, see what it's capable of?”
	
“Yes, I can't have a direct trace. You can. The Committee would very much appreciate all the data we can get. You'll be getting the first half of your payment now”
	
The First's implants activated, telling him the payment had arrived, being routed through god knows how many false bank accounts, before being sent through his false accounts. He grinned happily, withdrawing a Cliv stick and lighting it. He took a drag, let it out, and turned to the Second.
	
“Consider it done, old man,” said the First cheekily. Though the effect was mostly lost, considering that the Second was gone without a trace. The First chuckled drily, getting up and stretching, and then walking off, whistling as he went. He had work to do.

2v62yr,5,2015-02-08,Upass hassle,[deleted],rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/2v62yr/upass_hassle/,"My upasss has been restricted. I am told that I will not be able to pick up my upass during the start of the semester for every semester until 2015.

In spring 2014, I started my internship (which means I am a full time student), so I got my upass.

In order to get a upass one has to opt in for it at the registration office.

I did phone registration office to opt in for the upass. At the same time I was registered into two spring courses as well. I was told by the registration office person that I do not need to opt in as I was already showing up as a full time student. But I told that person that I plan to drop one of the course and that is why I want to opt in. She told me that she will opt me in for the upass then.

On the same day, one of my friend was in university to pick up his upass, so I phoned him to ask him to pay for my upass and get one for me as well.
So my friend paid for my upass at the upass office and got a upass for me.

I dropped one the two courses that I was registered into on the same day.

I think the person who I talked to over the phone at registration office forgot to opt me in for the upass. I think that is the reason why upass office has put a restriction on my upass. In their mind, I tried to scam them by getting upass as a full time student and then dropping the course.
Since I am on internship, I am considered a full time student regardless of the number of courses I am enrolled into. So I never tried to scam anyone.

Back in 2012, my first ever spring semester in university, I was enrolled in two courses for each semester, and then I got my upass and then ended up dropping one course from each semester. That was an honest mistake, I did not know at that time. But I did pay for whatever fee I was charged for getting a upass as a part time student. That was all cleared up. There was no restriction placed on my upass for any semester since I paid the required fee for upass.

I think upass office thinks that I tried to scam them this time when all along I was a full time student. Since I (mistakenly) did it before, upass office thinks I deliberately tried to do it again.

Please go through all the records, the day and the time I phoned in at registration office and the time my friend paid for the upass (there must be a transaction record at the upass office and time of my call at registration office).

I just want the restriction to be taken off from my upass, so I can pick up upass on regular time from now on.

My question is, why am I being penalized for this? I did not do anything wrong, nor did I intend to. Every time I go to upass office they do not want to even talk about the issue. Their arrogance on this matter is unbearable.

Registration office says that I was never charged for upass on fees in spring and summer. If my friend paid for my upass at the upass office, do you get charged for upass in the tuition fee again?

There could be two reasons for this restriction:

1) Fee not being charged for upass in spring and summer school fee

- since my friend paid for the upass at the upass office, I was not charged again for the upass in the tuition fees. Transaction record at the upass office should clarify this. I think my friend paid with his debit card, I can ask him to produce his bank statement as well.

2) Upass office thinks I tried to scam them

-I never tried to scam the upass office as I was a full time all along regardless of the number of courses I was enrolled in, because I was on internship. On top of that, I called in at the registration office the same day (before asking my friend to pick up the upass) to opt in for the upass. I think mistake happened at the registration office as the person saw that I was enrolled in two courses, so she forgot to opt me in, even though I told her that I was dropping one of the course.

Regardless of the confusion, why am I being penalized when I was a full time student all along?

I am currently a 2nd year undergraduate student in college. I want to become a software engineer ultimately, but I am just looking for an internship for now. However, I am unlcear about what exact skills I should actually learn. 

I've learned up to classes and objects in c++ and am taking a data structures now. I've taught myself up Java up to classes and objects as well because Java is demanding.  Now I'm quickly learning the python syntax since most jobs want  knowledge of a scripting language. But I'm not sure where to go next. I've thought about contributing on open source projects on gitHub, but I am unfamiliar with all technologies i see there.

The projects/assignments I do in college seem really simple (Such as payroll programs). But when I read forums in the internet, people talk about terms I never hear of in college.

Should I go for SQL database programming? Or learn GUI? It'd be great if you guys could guide me on what kind of skills I should target for now.

CS and Finance major here - I formerly have been involved with an unsuccessful tech startup, then did quant finance internship, followed by one in i-banking at a well-known firm.

I realized finance was not a path I wished to pursue and discovered the career path of a PM, which highly appealed to me due to how it combined my passions for business and tech.

I still have two years till graduation, which would mean the summer after this one is the one that matters, and I'd be shooting for the premiere PM internships that I struck out on this year (Google, Twitter, Microsoft, etc.)

Which would set me best up for that considering my background, and the role/type of company the choices are from?

* Product Management Intern for an unknown tech startup
* Product Manager Intern for a well-known tech company, but has been a sinking ship since its heydays pre-2008
* Business Analyst for one of the popular major tech companies

I know that at least in finance, we're told to take the internship that has the same title as what you wish to do.  However, I read that in tech, a lot of PMs come from being a business analyst.  With that in mind, I'm just unsure how much the company name and reputation has to do with recruiting in CS.  Would love if I could get some advice.

2v6vt5,1,2015-02-08,Tired of being a misinterpreted college student.,missharington,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2v6vt5/tired_of_being_a_misinterpreted_college_student/,"Hello, Reddit.

As I'm typing this, I'm trying to prevent myself from bursting into tears. I just got off from our dinning table because my mother brought up a sensitive topic that breaks me every time I hear it. So yeah, I am skipping dinner tonight (no, I don't have an eating disorder so it's not a thing to worry about). I don't even know where to start my story but to go right into it, **it's about my current struggle as an irregular college student and at the same time, being a disappointment to my parents**.

If you don't know what ""irregular students"" mean in my term, it refers to a student who'll be delayed from his/her usual graduating year either because they've stopped for a semester or a whole academic year, transferred to another school, or like me, had failing grades (I also transferred to a different uni by the way).

**Here's how college ruined (and is still probably ruining) me:**

I started college in the year 2011 (was 17 that time). My parents and a friend of my mom persuaded me to take up Pharmacy in another city that was a three-hour bus ride away from my hometown. It was okay with me since I loved Chemistry and Biology. I have a passion in art but I didn't see myself being in art/design school in some way...I felt like it would intimidate me too much since I know a lot of people who are better than me. At my age, I felt bad that I didn't have a clear decision of what major should I take. I didn't have time to think thoroughly during my high school days when I was pretty much doing well and was busy - I was the editor-in-chief of our publication and had won 3rd place in a national graphic design competition. So yep, I guess I was one of those who peaked in high school and came crashing in college. Very cliche and tragic.

Surprisingly, I got through my freshmen year - two regular semesters and one summer semester. I noticed our course outline and schedule was way more complicated than the other health science courses. I was in school for 12 hours a day and I even had half-day classes on Saturday. It was so toxic for me, but I got through with grades that aren't excellent but were enough to let me pass.

The start of my sophomore year (2012) was where all the shit started to happen. Our student and course department started to disgust me. It wasn't even finals yet the academic stress was so overwhelming, it made me sick in the head and heart. Our course department wasn't fair to their students. They prioritized the ""smarter"" ones by giving them pleasing schedules, better professors and lab facilities, and internship programs to top pharmacy companies in our country. 

The rest of us who weren't in that block got horrible scheds, were assigned in community pharmacies that wouldn't let us be involved with what's in our internship manuals, and profs who taught us poorly. A part of my thoughts say that we somehow deserved it for not reaching their standards. The unfair part was we were paying the same amount of tuition. Did I mention we have minor subjects who are as demanding as our majors? It was fucking ridiculous.

Cheating was also prevalent in our department. I had bad grades but I take pride to admit that I've never done any form of cheating since college. I believe we should avoid it as much as possible. What? You're going to bring that hell of a habit till you take the boards? Till you become a professional? Cheating will help you pass but not learn. I abhorred it all. There were rumors circulating that half of the Dean's List block got their way in through it. It was gross. It wasn't fair.

Most of my classmates were selfish. I never encountered a week or two wherein I didn't end up doing a group project on my own because my groupmates would claim they ""have no idea how to do them"" and would rather study for a quiz or an exam - all they wanted to help was themselves. Cooperation was alien to them. I feared that if I didn't do anything, we'd all fail. So in my grade-conscious and selfless mind, I decided to do the heavy lifting for those people - from lab experiments to pointless minor projects. This attitude of mine fucked up my time management. I had no time to study. I skipped classes to do schoolwork for a more important class. I had no time for myself. My grades went from B's (rarely get A's) to F's in an instant.

A moment came when so much resent, anger, and stress gathered inside me that I started not giving a damn anymore. I cut class and even skipped whole days of school sometimes. I wanted to separate myself from that bullshit. If I was present, I'd come late and isolate myself from everyone. One of my profs warned me that I'd fail if I kept up with my absenteeism and even recommended me to a counselor. 

That didn't go well. I explained my side to the counselor why I was skipping class in the first place (I'm saving my classmates' butt, you dummy!). I expected to be dealt with fairness and somehow help me clear my mind to be motivated again but it felt like dealing with the horrible principal at the movie, Matilda. Is there a wrong side to being selfless and kind to other people? I was definitely on that side if there is. (Somehow, I'd wish that I heard The Hound's quote in Game of Thrones WAY before college that my kindness will get me killed someday - because it totally did...figuratively speaking)

One night, I got a call from my parents saying they would visit me and have lunch on the next day. I was so excited. I thought I could really use a time to be with them...I asked why they were visiting and told me it was for a ""business trip"". In my naive mind, I didn't question them...but it was strange somehow. I know we don't own any business, big or small...Damn it, we're just middle class. The next day when I was about to leave school for lunch, I got a call from them and told me they were inside the school waiting for me. I went to them and asked ""how come you guys are here? I thought you had a business trip?"". They said it was over. We went to a mall and had a nice buffet lunch. Right in the middle, my mom spills the beans that they were called by the school to notify them about my clean attendance sheet and crushing grades. I. Was. Speechless. I felt like I wanted to burst like a volcano or a bubble. I wanted to disappear in front of them in an instant or I might cry. The timing was so wrong to me. I was shut silent. I can't believe they acted so NORMAL and then started lecturing me in front of many people like I was a toddler who did something horrible. It was so embarrassing. My throat and chest hurt because I was preventing myself from crying. I wish...I WISHED THEY JUST TOLD ME THE TRUTH RIGHT AHEAD. I felt like I've been LIED to. I thought if they did, it could've saved me, you know? I could've dealt with that internal meltdown earlier and prepared myself for it. Instead, they go behind my back. 

I knew I had no right to be mad at them. They're paying for my tuition. But I was inside my mind. My parents would be the last people on Earth that I'd expect to flip me over...I never knew they had that side to them. It took me two years after that incident to realise and accept that my parents are human beings...and no human being is perfect.

Instead of feeling encouraged after that lunch, I spiraled even lower to being a shitty student and daughter. With my savings, I paid for sessions with a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I felt like I had ""bulimic tendencies"" wherein there were times that I ate too little and then too much to drown my insecurities and self-hate...but I didn't purge them out which explains my dramatic weight gain but I'm sure I've always been a stress eater. Aside from that, I felt...suicidal. I never attempted to actually kill myself but I didn't remember a day after that lunch with my parents not planning how to end it all. It relieved me...thinking about dying, how I should die. I felt like I had no reason to live - I was useless. I felt like I had no way out of it. College felt like a big black hole ready to swallow me whole and throw me to oblivion.

What has kept me going is my ability (like usually depressed people do) to mask all the sickness inside me. I attempted to improve my attendance. I hang out with my close friends. I still saved my classmates' butts. I bottle up emotions very well only to have nights where I'd cry alone in my dorm and drink myself to sleep. I was abusing alcohol (never tried drugs) at the age of 18. My diagnosis didn't come up with prescriptions right ahead but if it did...man, I bet I wouldn't be here to share my story.

Fast forward - I freaking failed Pharmacy. When I saw my finals report card, man, did my world felt crumbling. I saved my meltdown at home with my mom who ""comforted"" me that time. Seriously, I was expecting to be disowned and thrown out of my home...I mean, duh...I'm Asian? (To be honest I really do suck at being Asian...I haven't even solved any single Sudoku puzzle - even the easiest ones - EVER)

My parents supported my decision to just go to our local university and shift to studying Biology for my pre-med. It was tough to say goodbye to my closest friends in my previous school. I'm beyond happy that we're still friends even if we're far away and I'm so proud of them because they'll be graduating this year - FYI, they weren't the selfish ones I'm referring to.

Transferring to a university made it sound like I was getting a better privilege but no - I wasn't. Our curriculum in biology wasn't justifiable with the tuition. I know, I know...it's always up to the student - to me - to improve myself. But I can't handle the thought that my parents are paying money to an education that's not even worth it. Somehow, I feel like the school was only up for having a ""university"" attached to its name but that's a different story.

There were profs at my new school who labelled students like me as ""garbage"" - like we're just a failed piece of trash from another school that gets thrown into schools...Little did they know about my entrance test results. 

I want to move on. Even after two years it still hurts whenever I recall those days and the people who mislabel students like me. Whenever we have visitors or attend events with my parents, they can't help but share how their daughter failed her first course in college and brag about my brother who's a full-time scholar at another university. I am proud of my brother though and I hope he never goes through the same stuff I've been through and still is.

Since I come from a conservative, middle class family, I am not even certain if I'll have the chance to go to medicine after college. I realised I really wanted to be a doctor after my setback. I realised I had another passion - to save lives (literally or not). My parents can only afford one university in our country when it comes to medicine and if I don't get accepted there, I'm done. I have no idea where to go. 

These days, I'm trying my best to increase my savings by accepting art commissions but it can only do so little. If only I could save enough to let me run away and get a job of my own in another city where no one knows me, I would. 

Sometimes, I wish I had another life...like I was a completely different person from who I am now. I envy people who never had trouble pursuing their passion while not worrying about financial security and people who come from a wealthy family that they can afford to pay for a few more years of college because they screwed up. 

**HECK, I wish people would get the idea of what college is actually like** - I've never seen a movie/series/advert that does that. Don't you think it'll be a nice indie film or something? But it would probably just bore people. All I see in the screens is that college is supposed to be all fun with frat parties and shit and you never see students studying their brains out for that finals, students who are suicidal because they're bombarded with other deeper, painful issues aside from getting laid or getting drugs (Well, there's a Bollywood movie I've seen that came close to that which was Three Idiots).

**I'm sick of being misinterpreted by people who DON'T know the story behind why I'm a *failure*.** I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way.

These days, I desperately seek a fast ""recovery"". I think I'll never be wholeheartedly happy unless I'm out of my university...I really have no idea if I'd feel that at all. Sometimes, I even doubt my decisions to be a doctor. Maybe it's just my pride. At 20, it's horrible to be this indecisive. 

The only thing I greatly regret up to this day is that I let myself be a victim of my own shitty thoughts. I could've made different decisions yet I chose to be a shitty person. I want to blame other people but it's mostly all because of me.

That terrible dinner conversation is why I'm having flashbacks again. My parents are the last people I'd want to disappoint but like everyone who only sees me as an* irregular student*, think that I ended up in my situation because I didn't prioritize my studies, that I was dumb and useless. The fact that it was because I had concern for other people to not fail is something they wouldn't believe in. During those days, I thought, it's better that I fail than all of us at once. It's better to let one pair of parents down than six or ten or forty five...I wouldn't call myself a hero for I've appeared to throw shade at them in my post. You see, contradictory to my desire to help people, I have a bad habit of holding grudges at those who hurt me.

I've used bad moments in my life as motivation before but my major setback is just so immense for me that I don't know if I could turn it the whole way around.

I've been wanting to let my story out since 2012...But I've never found anybody to share it with aside from you guys on this sub...The anonymity of this site does it for me.

Normally, I wouldn't expect people to read long posts like this but if you're the ones who do, I'm more than grateful that you're willing to know a significant part of my life.

Before i started studying i never wrote a single line of code. 


I just was interested in it and wanted to lern it. So now, i have a solid knowledge of java i would say. Know a little bit of C++. Know a little bit of Swift.


If i'm finished, i don't know if i wann go into pure coding. I'm rather interested into something like HCI/Usability. 



Coming back to my question:


I just feel like i know a few things about programming, but don't know if that's enough when i start an internship or job.


Did you have the same fears? How did it turn out? I just don't know where i'm standing ability-wise."

At first it seemed like a pretty simple set-up, generic data indexing and encrypted user information storage through a central online list.  That would all be well and good for me and the other three million users buying Swiffers except that the application is built on an OpenSSL format.  That’s right, the platform made vulnerable by that little bug named Heartbleed everyone freaked out about 6 months ago.  Basically all the information someone has input to a user account through the app is now essentially open to any hacker who knows how to get to it.  Since the older versions are still in use, and it’s likely the in house developers were failed interns at start-ups, I’m not surprised that they never patched this up.  With only basic encryption for user info, everyone who has used the app is at risk even if they have never made a purchase.

This particular debate has been ongoing with myself for weeks and is really tearing me apart - I am unsure what to do!

Some background first:

I'm a student studying Software Engineering at a college in Toronto, Ontario. It is a two-year program and I am currently in my last term. Right now, I am looking at going to a different University in order to complete my undergrad in Computer Science. I am 21. For me, it is important to try to finish in a timely manner - in 2018.

I have two clear choices - York University (Lassonde School of Engineering) or University of Toronto. Before you scream and shout UofT, hold up!

I will not be awarded transfer credit in terms of Computer Science courses which I am completely cool with. I will be behind a little bit but again, it is not too much of an issue. However, there are opportunities that exist at both universities and ultimately they revolve around when I would graduate. Again, it is imperative that I try to graduate in April 2018. I would prefer not to graduate in the summer (or fall) as then job positions would already be filled by new grads. Let us assume 2019 is not an option, for many reasons I do not wish to discuss.

 York University
* Brand new Engineering school known as Lassonde School of Engineering. Lots of funding and investment. Faculty looks solid.
* Co-op program available.
* Computer Science curriculum looks theoretical, rigorous and thorough.
* While CS has been at York since forever, Lassonde is still fairly new and does not have the reputation (nor alumni) in the tech industry yet.
* Ability to start this Summer, which will allow me to catch up faster and not be dragged behind by first year courses (since I can take Calculus 1/2, Computer Science 1/2 in the Summer).
* Ability to specialize in AI, Computer Networks, etc.
* Graduate in April 2018

University of Toronto
* Solid faculty and reputation.
* Top-notch Computer Science program. Rigorous, theoretical and thorough. One of the best in the world, as you may know.
* Alumni in top tech companies.
* I will only be able to do one internship since I will be busy taking courses in the summer in effort to catch up.
* I have to start in the Fall term.
* Can still graduate in April 2018 provided I complete a generous number of credits during the summer terms, with one summer to be used as an internship. (Remember, I do not want to be delayed a semester. If I am, I may as well be delayed the year, but this is not an option).


I am confident about both schools and my ability to do well. But ultimately, work experience for me is equally important. If I go to York, I feel I will be able to spend my summers working, whilst if I go to University of Toronto, I will spend a lot more time on my academics.

Not to mention the fact a lot of great companies/organizations love to hire from UofT. It is almost a dream for me to work for those companies. I am convinced that I may be able to land those jobs just as well with York as my choice, but I feel UofT would certainly give me a one-up.

I realize most people may suggest to ""do"" the extra year but the cold, hard truth for myself is that I need to get going. I am not getting any younger and I am certainly not rich enough to continue to afford paying for school!

Would love to hear any advice, thoughts, opinions. Please. :(

Thanks.

I graduated back in 2012. Since then I've worked at 2 web development companies doing PM/QA, and taught ESL abroad for 1 year. I've decided to go back to school to get a BS in CS, and my schedule is shaping up to look something like this...

**Summer 2015:**

* Engineering Calc 1
* Engineering Calc 2
* Intro to CompSci 1

**Fall 2015:**

* Intro to CompSci 2
* Discrete Structures
* Digital Systems
* One calc-based probability or stats course (either probability theory or intro to probability. MTH411 and STA301, respectively.)

**Spring 2016:**

* Data Structures (CSE250)
* Real-Time &amp; Embedded Operating Systems (one of the few classes higher than CSE250 that doesn't list CSE250 as a pre-req)
* Computer Organization (one of the few classes higher than CSE250 that doesn't list CSE250 as a pre-req)

**Remaining, can be taken over Summer2016/Fall2016/Spring2017 with CSE250 satisfied:**

* Intro to Programming Languages
* Intro to Algorithm Analysis &amp; Design
* Intro to the Theory of Computation
* Intro to Operating Systems
* Software Engineering
* One A.I. related CS course
* One 400-level CSE course from any area

By the looks of it, I should be able to finish the entire curriculum within 2 years, 2.5 if I want to take more classes. The classes listed above are all that's necessary to fulfill the degree requirements.

I really want to try and land an internship at a big 4 company during 1 or 2 of my summers (my ""pie in the sky"" goal is Google, but I'm also interested in applying to other options). Regarding this, I have **a few questions...**

1. During my first summer, would I most likely not be qualified/prepared to apply for an internship given the classes I will have taken? I know internships generally work around the definition of whether someone is a freshman, sophomore, junior, etc. Since the standard definition won't apply to my scenario, where would I roughly stand at the beginning of summer 2016? Would I be potentially eligible to apply to an internship?

2. If question 1 is a no-go, then the next internship opportunity would be summer 2017, no? At this point, I would basically be close to graduation. Would this mean that I would not be eligible for an internship opportunity during that summer, or would it hurt my chances? Interested to know how this works.

Any other feedback/opinions would be greatly appreciated. Extremely excited to start!"

&amp;nbsp;


Originally premed, I realized that healthcare was not for me. Programming has since become the home I've been looking for. I have basic syntax knowledge in Python, C++, and Javascript (taking a C++ course at my cc, and Python and Javascript through codecademy)

 *  By the end of the week I plan to create a site to be used as a personal portfolio. Though it will be mostly empty since I have no projects.

 * Then I want to create a chrome extension that synchronizes your dropbox with drive

 * From there I want to create a computer application that acts similar to the extension but interacts in the background and offline. Something that can take an article offline and upload it to a blog as soon as an internet

 * Afterwards there are other project ideas I have wanted to work on:
    1. Machine learning software with ScyPy
    2. C++ text adventure
    3. Integrating more frontend development to my personal portfolio
    4. a reddit bot

&amp;nbsp;

My goal is to finish the extension by June so that I can apply to the dropbox internship. In all honesty though I have no idea what really goes into building the extension. I do plan to find resources on making an actual chrome extension, but I don't know how to make it interact with drive or dropbox. My hope is that once finished with the extension I can more smoothly move on to the computer program.   


&amp;nbsp;

**Concerns**

  Am I skipping steps before working on this project? Since diving into programming I have never had so much passion and drive to really devote time to my work so I am hoping this can help overcome my lack of knowledge or experience. 
I want dropbox to see that even though I'm a dropout (no pun intended), I have the work ethic of Rock Lee and deserve a chance just as much as the next guy. But even more so **I want to prove to myself** that I'm in it for the long run. I want to see myself working my hardest to accomplish a goal I made for myself. So even if I don't finish it in time, I'd be happy with any finished product.

&amp;nbsp;


**What do you think? What topics or guides should I look into so that I can create my program. Is my first goal too high, should I do something small just so I can add it to my portfolio?**

[4th year Chem Eng. student],due22,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/2v935n/i_have_royally_messed_up_in_university_how_do_i/,"So I have completed my 3 years in university. It has been an absolute struggle on my end. I started university at the age of 17. I was not ready for university but still got accepted and started. I was also going through some heavy depression during these years in university. I lived in a dysfunctional family which didn't help either. Due to these unfortunate circumstances, I wasn't able to cope with the added pressure of university. 

All my years in university, I have managed to scrape my way through these courses. I also have ADD and I am unable to focus in class, in the library or anywhere. I try to but I just can't. My added severe depression and no support from no one also added to my miseries. 

My first year CGPA was : 1.3/4
In second year I was placed under academic probation due to low CGPA. I fought it out and tried very hard in that semester and did well. I increased my CGPA: 2/4 in one semester. 

I started recovering from depression but I was still struggling to focus on studies. I had increased my CGPA: 2.32/4 by my 3rd year.

However, I was hit by serious issues in life and a shoulder disability which caused me to slip up again. I literally studied for courses, all 4 months of material just 1 day before my exam. Like I would not know what a PFD was 1 day before the exam. I didn't attend no class, skipped quizzies/assignments. I wasn't able to cope with life at those times and just didn't even have any fear anymore.

I somehow scraped through all 3rd year courses by just studying for it on the last day and would end up with a C grade for most courses. Was lucky to get an A- for 2 of them somehow...

End of 3rd year CGPA: 2.12/4

I was sick of school and the city I lived in. So optimistically I started applying for internships knowing my CGPA was garbage. I managed to land an interview somehow with the HR and few days later with the managers. I shortly got an internship offer from this Oil and gas company for about an year and a half! The thing was that I never attached my transcript and just uploaded my CV and cover letter. 

I am working as an junior reservoir engineer right now for the past half a year. I wasn't in any internship program though and that came up from HR. But I told the head manager of our unit and he said I don't care and I want you to stay. He said you are performing well over expectations.


So, after all these twist and turns I am gaining valuable experience here which is good. I feel better in a different city, new people, new life in general. And most importantly a second chance that I was granted.

But after my internship. I have 1 more year in school to go. And I will most likely be graduating with a very poor CGPA. Almost embarrassing really. I won't have any chance if they actually ask for my cgpa. I'm really worried on this part.

The thing is I know myself and my capabilities. I know I could achieve good marks if I really try but my mental obstacles in the form of depression and ADD have stooped me from achieving this. i am doing well at this entry level engineering job and my work colleagues are impressed and expect me to do great things. I feel like a different person at work but then my past really hits me hard. Like I'm deceiving these people. 

Where can I go from here? How can I mitigate my early year losses and achieve success from here on out?

Thanks for reading! "

Does anyone else get really torn up after eating? I've noticed this for a while, but I've never been able to pin point why it does this. It doesn't matter the size of the meal, but even during the meal I'll stop because I feel it coming on. 

It's fairly strong. Kind of just start to drift away a bit while it's kicking into gear and I have to shake myself back. I guess I become spacey. 

The funny thing is after all these years of school I was sure that working would cause me a lot of stress, however with this new semester I am interning somewhere with four other classes. 

I'm most at ease when I'm at my internship working, and it isn't a very pleasant place to be all the time. 

Either way I hope you all are doing well, and good luck with whatever you're facing at the given moment. "
2v94bp,8,2015-02-08,"My [21M] mom [38F] got remarried, and I feel like I’ve been cut out of my own family.",extra6543,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2v94bp/my_21m_mom_38f_got_remarried_and_i_feel_like_ive/,"My mom had me when she was 17. My dad’s a cool guy, but he wasn’t really that into being a dad if that makes sense. My mom raised me on her own with occasional weekend visits for most of my childhood, but then my parents started “dating” and got married when I was 12. I was sort of ambivalent about it. 

They had my sister a year later (when I was 13), and my brother was born when I was 14. Then, shortly after my brother was born, my dad cheated on my mom and they got a divorce. I still saw him for a bit, but then he moved away and kind of just dropped out of our lives. Which sucks. 

Shortly after he moved away, my mom decided to move us as well so that we could all have a clean start. I was a little asshole about the whole thing, I didn’t like moving and I hadn’t really adjusted to sharing my mom with these two toddlers. I wasn’t exactly a model student, but she didn’t really have a lot of energy to do much about my behavior because she was basically putting 95% of her parenting energy into my siblings, though in hindsight that’s totally understandable because obviously toddlers are going to take a lot of attention. But she was pretty inattentive the whole time I was in high school, and it definitely created a rift between us. I feel guilty in hindsight, I’m just trying to explain how it was at the time. 

Then when I was 18, my mom met this guy. They became serious around the time I moved 1500 miles away for college so I didn’t really know him that well at all. She tells me they’re getting married and they’re moving to be closer to his family. The move actually meant that they were only about 500 miles away from where I was going to school so it’s not like she just abandoned me but I did feel like I was suddenly homeless. They live in a 3bd house, so I share a bedroom with my little brother. But really it's his bedroom with an extra bed, some stuff of mine in the back of the closet, and a mostly empty dresser. There's no sign that someone over 10 sleeps there, which is fair because I'm away at college most of the time anyway.

He has this really big extended family, and they’ve kind of absorbed my mom and my two siblings (now 8 and 7). I remember my mom telling me that she was overwhelmed by his family in the beginning, but now she’s pretty much totally at ease and my siblings are just treated like the rest of the cousins. My stepdad refers to my siblings as his kids, they call him dad, and people regularly assume that they’re his bio children. You would never guess that they aren't just a cute little family of 4. And now my mom’s pregnant with another boy, and they’re so excited. 

And I just feel so removed and weird around them, my siblings were so young when I left for college that I feel like I barely know them now. It’s like spending time with relatives. And my mom tries to be like “it’s your home too” but then she’ll get upset at me for being stubborn and not just instantly acclimating to their lives. And to be honest, I try not to be an asshole or rude about it, I'm pretty much on my best behavior the whole time. But it's not home, and I've kind of spent as little time as possible there over the last few years (i.e., trips with friends, summer internships in my college's city, etc.)

My mom feels like this different person completely, she’s a lot more domestic-y now and has totally lost interest in certain hobbies while suddenly developing an interest in others. When I was younger, she was kind of irreverent and funny and kind of misanthropic. And now she’s like this stereotypical suburban mom and is BFFs with his sisters/SILs and random other suburban moms. Like I was sitting there and one of my step-aunts was completely unironically talking about how much she loved her minivan. And I looked at my mom to kind of share a joke with her because my mom used to kind of make fun of those kind of moms. But my mom was just nodded and then started talking about how important cupholders are. 

She wants me to just spend more time there, but the thing is that it doesn’t feel like home and I don’t have any friends or anyone to talk to there. So I go to their house and I’m just in the house with two elementary-schoolers that are more popular than I am. They like me but they have their own friends and I’m not that much of a novelty anymore. 

And now my mom is pregnant and wants me to be there for the shower and to come when the baby is actually born and I will but to be honest, I'm not enthusiastic. I just feel like I don’t belong. 

My stepdad is nice to me but again it's like he's my uncle or something. He slipped up in front of me and said something about ""two boys"" (this baby will actually be the third boy) and immediately corrected himself but I think he just doesn't think of me as one of his kids or as part of his family. Which isn't his fault, I guess. But it is what it is.

**TL;DR: My mom remarried and she, my stepdad, and my siblings have kind of formed a new family. I feel like I have no family and no actual home.**"

(NSFW, Equine TF, M2F, Breed, Preg, light D/s)",silkroadbrian,TransformationRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransformationRP/comments/2v96jh/rplog_the_temple_of_epona_pt_1_nsfw_equine_tf_m2f/,"**I have permission from my RP partner (aka Assistant) to post this.  This was done in the span of about a week.  Like what you see?  Check my Pt 2 post**

**Professor :**

The legends were true.

The Temple really did exist, just like my arcane books and rumors said it would. The only real ""proof"", if you could call it that is a horses' head etched in an irregular, but smooth amber-like gem. Carbon dating places it at the time that the temple would have been an integral part of tribal life....but that was tens of thousands of years ago. I've grown quite fond of it and wear it around my neck - a good luck charm.  Half a dozen wrong turns in the dense, South American forest combined with a slip on a tree root has done more for anthropology than the last Two Thousand years of state-funded research. We stumble out into the clearing and just....stare.

The temple ruins look exactly like the old drawings I've kept in my long years of study. With a gentle fist-bump to you- my trusted intern we move from the green forest to the dusty promenade that leads to the Temple steps. The stone is red-caked and crumbling slowly but the main structure seems intact. As we move closer, we can see glyphs...Strange markings....

You bite your lip, sensing my thoughts as we look at the etchings that mark the post and lintel of a large, sealed door. Unusual creatures are seen in relief against the red soil and underlying stone. Human creatures....yet not completely human. All of them naked. One (obviously) male statue has the physique of a weightlifter...yet his head is that of a horse.

""Looks to be a draft male horse...man...with a tail, too! Some sort of hybrid? Doctor does this con-"", you ask with a mix of breathless wonder and naivety...almost transfixed by the strange creatures.

""Yes, it does concur. Here..."", I say, looking feverishly through my backpack...eventually finding a stained, old parchment portraying a crudely-drawn horse-man and horse-woman...their bodies in some sort of sensual embrace.

""Horse-people!"" The words would have sounded incredulous a moment ago...but now as they escape your lips, it seems perfectly plausible...even normal. I nod in approval and praise of the eager intern.

""Yes. Apparently this tribe all worshipped the Goddess Epona. I suppose this is her Avatar...."", I gesture with a finger for emphasis ""Maybe her guardians...or the priests, perhaps. The tribe was so remote and ancient that we know little else...other than this stone I wear has a connection to this place.""

We stand there, gob-smacked in reverent silence for a few moments - just taking the whole tableau in. The figures in stone look almost lifelike...and very detailed. No two are alike...though the types of equine hybridism varies from glyph to glyph.

As I approach the door, I notice there's no latch or keyhole. Instinctively, you press your hands against a stone pillar and a soft click causes a slowly-depressing recess to appear in the column. A woosh of dust and musty air fills our nostrils as the door begins to unseal - triggered by your ingenuity...or was it something else?

The stone begins to rise, revealing a darkened passage...until the door freezes, unable to move higher...but high enough for us to stoop down to enter.  We look into the darkness...then to each other with a knowing smile that this is the adventure we've been waiting for.

""To Epona!"", we cry - our voices booming off of the inner walls as we delve inwards...

**Assistant:**

It had been a few good minutes since we stepped foot into the temple. The stone corridor was quite dark, our solitary light only illuminating the few feet in front of us. Normally I would be a bit more apprehensive, but I felt safe around you; a smart, trustworthy man I've been with for quite some time. Brushing off any feelings of doubt, I steady my nerves and push on, lagging only a few inches behind you. 

""These markings... even I'm having a hard time believing this"" you mutter, comparing the faint glyphs to the crude images in your book. With a grin, you turn back to face me. ""I believe we've really struck gold here! Well, figuratively speaking, of course. "" A true archaeologist such as yourself would never be associated with the petty thieves that were always drawn in by the field.

""I sure hope so,"" comes my reply. ""Although given your track record, I've certainly got my hopes up!"" Your knack for discovery was quite a topic in the community, although most just passed it off as plain luck. With a chuckle I brush my hair back, glancing around in wonder at the images of the horse-like people on the stony walls. I had never even considered something like this could have been possible, but it seemed like the proof was right here in front of us.

""Really, you flatter me too much."" You roll your eyes and brush your fingers against your pendant, lingering on it for a moment. You could barely contain your excitement; this was what you had been waiting for. If you really did find proof of this race and the goddess they worshiped, you would finally get the praise you rightfully deserved. Colleagues would stop teasing you, you would be featured in articles, and maybe... maybe even have a book written about this! You were as giddy as a young school girl, but fortunately for you, you could compose yourself well. Not wanting to waste any more time, you picked up your pace.

As we excitedly carried on your way, I reached down into my holster to retrieve my sidearm. Normally I wasn't much of an expert with firearms, but I always carried one just in case; I'd seen the movies. Swinging out the cylinder, I dumped the two spent casings out into my hand; there had been an 'incident' with a less-than-friendly crocodile earlier in the day. However, satisfied that we were out of danger, at least for a while, I opened my satchel and shoved the gun inside. In its place, I brought out a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. The telltale *clink* of the lighter caught your attention. 

""Oh come now, this is hardly the time. I would wait until after we're finished here,"" you scolded. Despite being arguably your best companion, I was not without my habits. 

""Aah, I suppose you have a point. Sorry, Doctor."" I stuff the pack into my pocket, and close the lighter, the faint glow disappearing as it went out. Or so I thought. Looking up, I noticed what seemed to be another faint light at the end of the corridor. ""...hey, Doc-?""

""Yes, I see it."" Despite being distant, the light was quite pretty in comparison to the dark corridor, and it seemed to draw your full attention. With a smile, you grabbed my shoulder and hurried on your way, the two of us eager to find out what lay ahead. 

**Professor:**

The crunching sound of loamy earth soon gave way to the hard clomp of our work boots on smooth stone blocks as we traveled closer to the source of the light.  The temple hallway was more easily lit with each step, becoming slowly brighter as the end of the hall became closer.  

""Its as if we we're supposed to be here...."", I say, breathless with wonder.  A feeling of certainty washes over me which I just dismiss as accomplishment.  The hall soon gave way to a round, perfectly oval room, much larger and spacious than the cramped hall we just emerged from.   Two braziers were lit which were enough to bring us through the entrance but now as we enter the temple center itself something unusual happens. The dimly lit room seems to pulse with an energy that at first is hard to isolate.

Light in the large room waxes brighter...then dims as if awakening from a deep slumber.  Instinctively, I touch the talisman around my neck...giving it a squeeze as if unconsciously instructed...or instinct.  ""Ouch!  Hot!"" my hand tries to let go but it won't for a long moment.

Grimacing, I finally peel my hand away...the largest rune of the talisman burned slightly into my palm...an imperfect brand of a horseshoe but very visible.  The lights respond to the incident as if something were triggered.  One by one the room becomes brighter as a circle of torches begin to light - seemingly on their own in response to the welcome .  The room is soon bright enough to make our eyes hurt until the light adjusts.

The room is larger than we first thought....the glyphs carved in sections of the room seem to be growing lewder and more obscene.  Horsemen and horsewomen in various sexual acts..the males with large, animal endowments...the flare and medial rings of their stallion phallus looking eerily accurate and almost

""Alive?"" you ask...your attention brought to the unusually arousing images.  The room in the hot is becoming unbearably hot all of a sudden....maybe the torch heat?  I begin to mop up sweat on my brow, loosening the collar in my soaked shirt.

""It seems that way...this must have been place for the fertility rite...all thats missing is the statue of....

""Sir!"" you say, gesturing to something behind me...your jaw slack

In the center of the room stands a bronze goddess...half amazonian woman...half draft horse...and all nude.
Her features are greek, cornfed and deliciously attractive.  He'd seen art work of crudely drawn depictions with a horses neck and DD cup tits...but resembled nothing compared to the real article.  This female is flawlessly depicted...her proud chin lifted up, mane almost fluttering in a breeze...muscles toned in her arms and sculpted legs....her nipples pointed as if locked in a freezer.  Her cornfed belly slopes down to a hint of her equine sex and thick, thumb sized clit.  Even her buttocks are deliciously framed, like twin hemispheres of a bubble...her body the ultimate depiction of fertility.

My eyes go wide as dinner plates, sharing your expression.

""Great Epona...."" my knees buckle, moving to the ground and bowing low...reverently...almost unworthy to even look upon such a beautiful creature.  She looks alive....and yet...almost frozen in place, her arm outstretched - as if wanting something...needing it....

**Assistant:**

Not only following your lead, but also as if willed to, I drop to my knees and bow the to goddess. Never in my dreams would I have imagined myself being this close to such a majestic creature. My mouth hangs open, but no sound will come, despite my will to say something. ""Sir, I-"" 

With a swift gesture you hush me, still focusing on the outstretched arm of the statue. It seemed like she was beckoning to us, asking us for something. Sweating, you adjust your shirt collar, your fingers brushing against the talisman, but no pain comes this time. You look down at it, and then back up at the statue... something clicks in your mind. ""Is this what..."" Your words drift away as you momentarily lose yourself in thought. 

My gaze drifts upwards along the body of the statue; the sight of all of her features arousing me. Sweating profusely, I remove my headband, using it to wipe my forehead. Noticing a tight feeling in my pants, I glance down to see my erection growing. Normally I would have been quite embarrassed, being so visibly horny in front of someone such as yourself, but here it felt right. It was as if I was... proud of it? Looking over at you, my eyes drift down to your crotch, and sure enough, it seemed you shared the same feelings. Did the statue really have such a great effect? ...no, it wasn't just the statue. It was the whole room itself.

The pleasurable sensation in your pants brought you back to reality, the bronze statue still standing before you. Trying to ignore the lustful feelings, you turn to face me, an idea forming in your head. ""I... think I should try to give it my talisman... seems this room has a tendency to respond to it."" 

With an uncertain nod, I look at the hand of the statue. ""Just... be careful, will you?"" The heat in the room bears down on us, only intensifying my arousal and sense of curiosity. Putting my hand on your shoulder, I steady myself slightly behind you as the two of us inch closer to the statue. 

Taking a deep breath, you pull the talisman from your neck, and gently wrap it around your fingers. It almost fits perfectly above the horseshoe mark it left imprinted on your palm. Looking up at the statue's head, you gradually bring your hand to meet hers. And when your fingers meet, to our surprise, the talisman begins to faintly glow, as does the statue itself. 

**Professor:**

A sudden, pleasant tingle envelops your senses and of mine.  Our mortal bodies become temporarily frozen...erections straining against their tented prisons as our spirits become tied and blessed by the divine.  The talisman glows brighter than the braziers now, blinding our sight...yet our glazed eyes neither comprehend nor care.

The thrumming feeling in our bodies increases...wind from unseen doors blows over our faces and clothes.  You can feel the coolness of your chest, beads of sweat standing out as the breeze passes over your pores....your nipples singing with tightness and sensitivity.  A foreign scent wafts over our noses...animal and strong yet seeming more familiar as each moment passes.  Your nostrils flare, trying to take in the strange, cloying smell.  Instinctively, your upper lip tries to extend and flip - obeying the equine instincts that you never knew you had...yet always possessed.  It smells good....male...safe...protected....and virile.  A throb in your aching shaft signals your need...yet the equipment is wrong...it works through your mind, stunned and confused at first.  In my flaring nose, I smell need as well...the craving to breed...my tongue starting to thicken in my mouth...the tightness in my pants starting to snake down my leg in an obscene bulge that only porn stars could imagine.

The deliciously indulgent moment is interrupted by a warm, honeyed feminine voice that tickles both of our minds yet makes no sound in the large room.

~/~ Blessings to you, seekers of my spirit. ~/~ .  

In our minds eye we see the true embodiment of Epona.  Her wide child-birthing hips come into view as she steps forth...breasts and belly jiggling slightly as she reveals herself to her tributers...which is what our trespassing yet well meaning human bodies must be to her.  Yet, she is wise and her eyes are kind as she views us with a patient, knowing smile.

""Great Epona, I....we....haf...haf..."" I try to enunciate but its harder now.  My voice sounds deeper and mumbled with the thickness of my growing tongue as if it was too big for my mouth.  The remark is cut off by a ticklsh buzz we can both feel and makes us shiver in place.

~/~Silly foal....I know all about your human knowledge and of your intern...but what do you truly know of me? ~/~

Images flow through our minds...the span of prehistory when the temple was freshly dedicated.  You and I can almost smell the fresh grass coming from the fields, the free flowing wine...the month-long orgy of decadence in honor of the goddess in the hopes of receiving her blessings for fruitful loins and crops.  Large rutting bodies...the smell of sex...its almost too much for our poor human bodies to take in as both of our shafts begin to leak copiously, wetting our clothing shamelessly.  Thousands of years later we see the conquering hordes of gold-hungry white humans sack, rape and pillage, leaving no trace of the peaceful people...only the scribbles in my book, a few scrolls and this talisman.   We both feel a tinge of sadness and loss momentarily...empathizing with the goddess.

~/~The talisman chose you...chose to be found *by* you.  Only my will to live has kept this temple alive for so long. My blessed herd has long died out...only your domesticated cousins remain.  But now, with new vessels, I can now reclaim this plane for good and you both shall be its start.  ~/~  

Epona's tail flicks mischeviously, her lustrous, immaculately groomed, muscular thighs flex almost cutely with her remark

**Assistant:**

With a wave of her slender hand, a tingling feel of immense, yet pleasurable heat comes across both of our bodies, causing us to gasp. Your growing tongue flops out of your mouth as the sensation in your pants becomes unbearable, the fabric soaking and stained with the juices from your growing shaft. Quickly, you bring your hands to your obscene bulge and begin rubbing it through your pants, enjoying how fantastic it feels. With a deep moan, you shudder in enjoyment. 

With a needy whine, my hands shoot to my chest, groping at my breast. A feeling of absolute, intense arousal passes through my entire upper body, eliciting a very feminine sound from me. It almost feels as if my entire chest is on fire, but that only increases how horny I am. Throwing my satchel off, I gritting my teeth and brush my fingers against my nipples, as they seem to start increasing in size. 

With a satisfied, yet warm and kind smile, Epona's avatar fades from view. Intent on watching us, she speaks in a soft voice. 

~/~ Enjoy your changes, my lovely foals. Soon you will be creatures of utmost majesty. I eagerly await the results. ~/~

While furiously rubbing at your leaking girth, your arms begin to grow in size, new muscle wreaking havoc on your shirt sleeves, as the fabric begins to rip and tear. As you stroke, your hands begins to grow, becoming meatier, your fingers thick, in order to give you hands more suitable for pleasuring a large, growing penis such as your own. The straps of your pack tear, falling to the ground with a *flump* and a ruffle of pages, your books and scrolls spilling on the stone floor next to you. Your current trance-like state has you too horny to care, filling you with thoughts of pure sex and breeding. With a low nicker, you can only revel in the changes.

Moaning in pure ecstasy, my chest begins to spill out, the once slightly flabby pectorals rounding and puffing out. The collar of my shirt begins to strain, unable to handle the new growth on my chest. The feeling of my growing chest hampered by my tight shirt feels so fantastic, as I cry out in joy. In a matter of seconds, the buttons fly off, allowing my new, growing breasts to start filling it out. All of these sensations are only serving to remind me just how horny I am, and my hand goes 
down my pants to grasp at my cock. As I begin to rub, I can't help but think it feels... wrong. Something in my mind tells me that the feeling of a penis between my legs is unfitting. Ignoring it and continuing to masturbate, visions of well-endowed horse men fill my mind, similar to those depicted in the glyphs. Normally I considered myself a very straight man, but I was drooling as I imagined large shafts rutting me from both front and rear, handsome studs filling me with thick, fertile seed. 

You reached down and unbutton your pants, your immense cock flopping out from your underwear. Free from its fabric prison, it begins to change further; the previous fleshy tone soon begins to darken, taking on a gray color. Stroking wildly, the mushroom-like head begins to flatten, dripping pre-cum in a large puddle as the sensation feels incredible. You let out a sound that is fairly equine, the feeling of your changing cock driving you mad. Your testicles begin to sag as they grow, filling with seed fit for birthing a creature as perfect as the goddess herself. Turning a shade of grey, your balls droop as they grow heavier, soon to be fit for mating. 

**Professor:**

The cooling wind subsides as Epona watches from a distance at our mutual transformations into perfect embodiments of her spirit.
Your head begins to misshapen...bones cracking and flattening as your canines flatten...the jaw lengthening with strange, vaccuous noises which don't appear to be unpleasant.  In fact, each new change just seems to make your belly hitch, the soft middle pushing out slightly and jiggling with a feminine softness.  Your sinuses push out as well, making your nostrils widen and snuffle the air...soon your lungs are filled to capacity as your chest widens, ribcage thickening and expanding to make way for your larger animal lungs and heart....which races a mile a minute from the intense pleasure you're receiving.  Your ears lenghten, swiveling as they catch the sounds of your bones and joints snapping and popping inside your growing frame.  Tan fur moves over your elongated head, a long blaze of white down your nose, ending in velvety white, fine fur lining your smecking, rubbery equine lips.  A golden shock of mane begins to sprout down your exposed neck and shoulders traveling down to halfway down your thickening spine and looking incredibly soft and lustrous.

I hear your feminine moans of ecstacy as you cup a growing breast with one larger hand...feathers of white horsehair pushing out from your wrists as your bare arms begin to sprout a velveteen pelt of tan, becoming slightly darker as it travels up your toning arms.  I feel a growing lustful urge as you lewdly grope yourself shamelessly before me.  My own sexual need seems to multiply not at just the delicious sensations of my own beastial, virile changes...but the stunning gorgeousness of your own equine and feminine becoming.  I watch with growing arousal as you stroke yourself over your shorts furiously with your growing, free hand...a whinny of frustration coming from your stretching neck.  Bones and joints begin popping and reforming in your hips with a feeling of pleasurable pressure as your pelvis adjusts to bear foals giving your waist a delicious hourglass look.  Muscle and sinew build in your thighs, revealing tan fur as the seams in your shorts begin to split.  With a loud RIP, your shorts and underwear split at the crotch harmlessly as your unchanged shaft and balls are finally freed, giving your hand full contact with the twitching rod.   My hand travels over my stallion endowment as if it were the most natural thing in the world...panting with approval at our inhuman lusts and changes.  A thick doughy medial ring surrounds the middle of the shaft as I pump mindlessly...aching to fill something other than my large hand.  

Our new eyes meet for the first time...and we just *know*. I'd known you were mildly attracted to me in my classes perhaps because I was an older authority figure or the shared desire for our hunt for this temple...but a self absorbed life of study has little room for noticing others.  But now the scent of your need is deep...and I am the one...the chosen one to fill it.   It makes perfect sense now as your male trappings begin to melt away.  ""Epona is fertile, as you must be.  Praise to the goddess and her great kindness"", I nicker to you in thought....sharing your connection as the goddess shares with us.  I sense your readiness as you bob your head strongly...your mind lost in growing bliss...but no climax.   It used to be easy for you to come...almost too easily.  You'd even wake with strange thoughts of horsemen in your dreams...cock already wet with your emissions as it stained the sheets....but now nothing seems to sate the straining inches of human meat you try so hard to bring to release.

My herd like instinct begins to whinny in anticipation and confusion...the muscles in my horsemeat flexing involuntarily, slapping the hard phallus against my chest in annoyance.  Then clarity comes from sudden inspiration as your hand instinctively dips down to your full scrotum...a gasp of pleasure escaping your equine lips as a thin liquid weeps from the seam between your balls.  Gentle examination causes the seam to begin to split open...elicting another trickle of thick fluid.  As your fingers rub and pry the gash open, a satisfied nicker of pleasure rumbles in your chest...causing your breasts to surge...the titflesh pushing into your free hand...the nipples as thick as your thumbs.  Each passing moment of self teasing causes the seam to open wider, revealing a dark pink feminine sex.  The vaginal entrance inside you starting to yawn open slightly, responding to the stimulus and flood of hormones.  Either your mindless pleasure causes you to forget or you simply wish the change further as your once proud scrotum begins to drain of their livegiving sperm...dribbling the last of your swimmers from your purpled cock in a watery discharge - yet the abscense of release drives your fingers onward...focusing completely on the opening gash now.  Amazed, your breast fondling mitt moves down over the slope of your changing sex - watching with a combination of lust and wonder as the scrotal skin begins to turn inwards on itself...testes drawing up inside your body to form fallopian tubes.  Even your male shaft begins to wither...the crown becoming blunter, urethral slit closing for good as your penis is sculpted into a perfect, equine clitoris...fat and juicy, as thick as your nipples and throbbing as if it had its own brain and body.  The whole tableau is amazing and arousing to witness...even your newly forming vaginal lips try to wink and flex as your pussy slowly is created.

**Assistant** 

Witnessing the birth of my new sex seems to further your own changes. As you drool at the sight of me rubbing my new clitoris, a coating of thick, silver fur begins to grow up your arms, spots of darker grey dotting your wrists and large hands. As the fur grows down your chest, your shoulders broaden, filling out and tearing your shirt in two. New equine blood flows through your muscular arms, giving you a sense of sexual pride. ""Epona deserves a champion to carry forth her new legacy..."" You thought to yourself, grinning in pleasure as your teeth grow wider and flatter, filling your mouth as your jaw begins to reshape with a crack. Normally, a feeling such as this would be painful, but to you it was absolutely erotic, your new equine cock dribbling all over your chest. Your nostrils, already flared, continue growing, turning into what equates to small nasal caverns, moving to the sides of your face as your new horse-like muzzle sets in. With a huff, you breathe in, taking in the scent of my new liquids pooling below my changing body. The silver fur shoots up your neck and covers your face, small lines of grey growing in under your eyes. Your hair begins thickening and increasing in length, turning to a shiny, jet black color as it covers your forehead. Your new mane tingles as it grows down your neck, draping itself all along your upper back and shoulders. Your ears perk up and flatten, growing more triangular in their shape as they move up your head, allowing you to hear every bit of our changes. 

As I rub at my new sex, everything seems perfect. I don't even think twice about the loss of my penis, only pure joy as I feel if I'm getting close to fulfilling my destiny; becoming a fertile creature worthy of bearing Epona's image and children. As I stand there, my rump begins to perk up, the cheeks rounding out into more of a shapely, muscular bubble butt. The sensations of my new rear end growing in elicits a low whinny from my equine lips, as I finger my new dripping pussy furiously, hoping to gain some release. Opening my eyes, I catch a glimpse of your enlarged equipment, leaking copious amounts of fluid all over your chest and the floor. Instantly I can't help but think of having you rut me and my new vagina, filling my childbearing sex with your potent, magnificent seed. I could not lie to myself and say I didn't have my eyes on you for quite some time, and now it seems I'll finally have my chance. Nothing seems better to me at the moment than the thought of having us breed, my bringing your new foals into the world. My mind is on fire as I am lost in my sexual fantasy.

As you continue to rub at your impressive member, your chest begins to define itself more, pectoral muscles filling in and protruding out, your bones reshaping and allowing more room for your larger organs. You begin to draw in longer, heavier breaths as more air fills your growing lungs. With a huff, you exhale from your now large nostrils, the sound loud and very audible, only serving to further your arousal. Your stomach begins to change, the slight gut beginning to spread out more evenly, your new abs growing out to accentuate your new nature as a dominant breeder. As the silver fur grows down your now sizable chest, a thicker dusting of the dark grey fur moves down and grows around your testicles, adding a very sexy treasure trail up your stomach to your chest. As your legs grow in size, with defined muscle toning  up your thighs and calves, your work boots and socks being to give way, your growing feet proving to be too much for them. With a groan, you flex the changing muscles in your feet, causing your boots to burst open, your socks not fairing too well. 

Glancing at each other, we knowingly smile. The thought of becoming selfless tributes for the great Epona, to help restore her race to its former glory only furthers our intense sense of arousal and pleasure. Our bodies convulsing, and growing, with the two of us moaning and nickering in delight, we know this was always our true purpose. Slowly, but surely, I move my legs in an effort to approach you, the two of us eager to explore our changes together."

Specifically, I think my processor (i7-5930k) is going to be held back by my graphics card (GTX 970 4gb) and memory (4x4gb).  

I'm not *trying* to knock down the cost, just wondering if there's dead space in the build.  Although saving a few bucks would mean I can splurge on monitors etc, but I also would also like to not have to worry about being outdated for a decent while.

2v9epe,2,2015-02-08,Trying to apply for a summer ME Internship. Help appreciated!,Stahe,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/2v9epe/trying_to_apply_for_a_summer_me_internship_help/,"Hi /r/resumes,

As the title states, I am trying to get a summer internship with a research company. The internship itself is 12 weeks in which there will be multiple projects to work on related to the Mechanical Engineering field.

They are looking for students who are team players, can do problem-solving, and have interest in technology. More specifically, they are looking for students who can help design and analyze mechanical systems as well as conduct studies and test new/modified designs.

Now a little about myself: 

I am currently a sophomore enrolled in a Mechanical Engineering program at a state university. I've held a few jobs before(Math tutor and After school leader), but I have not had a chance to work as an intern in my career field yet. 
I have taken a few university classes that are relevant to the field(such as programming and product design/modeling).

I've been working part-time and going to school at the same time in order to pay for expenses(rent, car insurance, food, etc). I should mention that working part-time ~18 hours a week last semester had a slightly negative influence on my GPA. It was 3.3, but dropped quite a bit last semester due to my work schedule. 

As for my resume, I'm looking for any constructive criticism this reddit can provide.

I've never had my resume reviewed before; I've mostly revised it myself with some tips from internet articles. However, this is the first opportunity I've had to enter my desired field, so I want to improve my chances of success as much as possible.

Any kind of help would be appreciated! 

Thank you to anyone and everyone who takes their time to read this.

2v9fny,18,2015-02-08,Lost my confidence as a programmer for not landing a job after interning at a company three times,throwaway6y9,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2v9fny/lost_my_confidence_as_a_programmer_for_not/,"...and I need help gaining my confidence back! 
Long story short(or at least, I'll try to make it short.) I recently graduated with a BS in CS from a city school in nyc. I landed a pretty good internship at a prominent financial bank as an application developer during my sophomore year of college(back then I was getting my AS in CS in a community college because it's half the tuition price) and had been interning with this firm for two years (a total of 3 internships.) Last Summer was my last internship there and seeing how I got called back three times to the company I was confident I'd be offered a full-time offer there... NOPE! They didn't even call me to give me a ""no"" for an answer and still left me on the limbo after I called the recruiters.

I know this is probably very normal in today's competitive industry but this stripped me from my confidence as a programmer. I'm even afraid of looking at code now because I'm always doubting myself. Every time I open my IDE to work on my personal projects my chest becomes heavy as I keep remembering not getting into that firm. My friend suggested we worked on a project together and he's done so much to help me and try to motivate me to keep working and practicing my programming but it has gotten to the point that I sometimes avoid him so that I don't have to talk about the project. 

I used to love programming, went to hackathons, worked on personal projects, worked on a website, and was so eager to learn to use all the new technologies out there... but now it is hard for me to even open IntelliJ. I do still love programming, I love the feeling you get from a completed project, the clean code practices, getting the users feedback, etc... I take pride on having production code running in that firm, working successfully with users(known to be hard to work with!), and being able to build a huge network of people from Ivy League schools and managers there but this bad experience is like a wall in front that's stopping me from getting ready to apply for a job at other places.

This is probably a very petty issue but I'm turning to reddit for help as my last resort :( I don't want to give up/screw up the career that I worked so hard for. Any advice on how to get over my depressing self and focus on my career from now on?

EDIT: I would like to thank everyone's time and thoughts on my issue and for sharing your personal stories with me! I know I should man up and face this head on, and that it's not that big of a deal... this really helps me getting over this and be able to turn on a new leaf :) I will call my direct manager and ask her for any suggestions she has and if I can use her as a good reference for the future.

I wake up, my body imploring to sleep some more, but I manage to get myself up and take a shower. Make myself a smoothie with bananas, strawberries and spinach cause my mom wants me to be healthy and drink almond milk instead of cow milk. Manage to get on time to my 8am class and try to not sleep while the professor reminds us that the job fair is tomorrow and gives us some pro tips before talking about today's topic.

Oh shit! The job fair is tomorrow! I gotta iron my good shirt and take the fuzz out of my dressing pants. The university wants me to get an internship or else my chances of getting a full-time position is slim. It's all about the experience, man. It's my last chance to do so since I graduate in a year. The stakes are high. After my classes I receive a text from my mom asking if I am doing fine and if I have studied enough. I say that I am ok and how I felt about a quiz that I probably failed. She text-lectures me about how education is important and how she wants me to have good grades to impress the recruiters tomorrow. K.

My girlfriend calls afterwards. She wants me to come over the night and hope that I can stay the night. I have Homework due tomorrow, but I think I can squeeze some time and see her. I cannot stay the night though. She gets kinda upset. She wants me to spend time with her and berates at me about how I'm spending less time with her. You're right, baby. I'm sorry. She asks about my plans on Sunday. I know what she wants. She wants me to go to church with her early in the morning. Ugh... I say yes and ask her if she wants to go to my church Saturday evening. She says yes immediately. She always wanted to go to my church even though she's weirded out by the priests. Why can't there be no woman priests?!? she would ask me later. She tells me that she wants to go somewhere fancy this valentine's. """"Surprise me"". 

""Hey m8, u have answer to #7b?"". Sure man I got you. ""Thanks buddy"". No probs... uh... I forgot your name, but it doesn't matter. You probably don't know mine either. 

Wants, wants, wants, wants. Do this. Prepare for your future. There's no stopping now. The classes get worse, bro, just so you know. Dress sharp. Fill out this application, and meanwhile, I will put your resume in this pile of resumes. You might get an interview. Maybe not. 

I go to bed and I am tired. I cannot sleep for some reason. All these expectations and responsibilities overwhelm me. I feel like quitting. I feel my head spinning. I feel sadness inside me. A downward spiral. A shed a tear before finally falling asleep. 

I wake up the next morning. A little bit later than usual for my 9am class. My roommate had used the blender the night before, but washed it. I make myself another smoothie. I get ready and out with heaviness in my heart as a cold wind wakes me up completely. I feel warmth though. It's one of those weird days there the sun shines with full force, but the wind is chilly.

I smile. I think of how lucky I am. I live better than most people in the world. I am studying in my major which one of the top ten programs in the US, and I am liking it a lot no matter how difficult it gets. Because of this, I can get a well paid starting salary once I graduate, and be debt free in a couple of years. My mom texts me. ""You can do this son. I love you (:"". I love you too mom :). The professor is not so daunting and boring today. He even cracks a couple jokes. My friends call me after my class. They wanna go drink and rant about how dumb their classes are. They have been missing my jokes and funny accent. I make an effort and get my hw done so my Friday becomes free. It feels good to be wanted. I get tipsy and have a great time with friends.

I walk to my gf's apartment which is not too far. I see her eyes and all my problems disappear. She looks like she was pissed earlier, but she's happy to see me. She kisses me with passion and tells me that she loves me. She apologizes for being a overreacting and possessive gf. I hug her. It's ok baby. She has an insane ability to know my feelings and completely understands me when I talk about my feelings to her. I get to pick what we watch today. I wanna show her the insane world of Breaking Bad. She likes the pilot and wants more. We start watching another episode. She looks at me with fire in her eyes. We undress and make fireworks. She comes, and we cuddle. My heart feels happy now and my thoughts are not dark anymore. I have found a silver lining. I am not sad anymore. At least for today. 

I still get dark feelings when I pass time in my room alone, but I know that it gets better. "

I applied for a certain engineering firm about two weeks ago for an 8-12 week internship in a desalination plant in Dubai. I got a call today from a representative from that company and here were the questions I was asked and my answers from what I remember:

1) What would you like your training to be focused on? 
Answer: I'm a chemical engineering major so I would like my training to be engineering related. I want to be involved in the ''inner workings of the process'' (no idea why I said this :S)

2) Would you be interested in working in Europe and South America? 
Answer: Yes, I'd be interested in working anywhere (I thought I should have told him that I have a Lebanese passport so getting a working visa in some countries might not be easy.)

3) Would you be interested in a longer six month internship? 
Answer: No, it needs to be in the summer. (Should have reminded him that I am an undergrad and my department requires me to do my internship in the summer).

Basically, I am tempted to email or call them back to try to inform them of the things I said between parenthesis but my friends have discouraged from doing that.

The person calling me had an Australian accent and the call kinda took me by surprise since I didn't expect them to call after 2 weeks. How did I do overall?"
2vam2l,1,2015-02-09,FAQ for matching in General Surgery,[deleted],medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/2vam2l/faq_for_matching_in_general_surgery/,"I got asked to answer some questions about matching in General Surgery.  I recruited our residency director to give me a hand with them.  Here are the questions and answers.  I had to paste in hyperlinks so they are spelled out.  Let me know if there are any other questions and we will try and answer them.  



1.  What can I do during my preclinical years to get exposure to general surgery?
Join (or start) a Surgery Interest Group. (https://www.facs.org/education/resources/medical-students/sig)

2.  What is a good Step 1 score I should aim for in order to be competitive? Do I need to score higher to go to an academic program?
If you want to look at the data yourself, it is freely available from The MATCH. (http://www.nrmp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Charting-Outcomes-2014-Final.pdf
In general, 240 and up is a really good score, and 220 and up is a pretty good score. There are people who do and don’t match at either end of the spectrum, though.
Academic programs vary in what they want; some want to train more academic surgeons, and others want to train surgeons for their area. Scores need to be higher for very competitive programs, whether they are academic or community. I certainly wouldn’t say that just because you have a score of X you can get into a community program but not an academic program.
The bigger difference in getting into an academic program than Step 1 score is research, publication and presentation experience.


3.  What things should I be doing during third year to prepare myself for residency applications?
Start with So You Want to Be a Surgeon
(https://www.facs.org/education/resources/residency-search)
You should be maximally engaged with your team, reading for each case, and letting it be known that you are interested and want to participate. Get to know at least a couple of faculty well enough that they will right you a letter.

4.  Is there a particular way I should schedule my fourth year?
You need to get three letters of recommendation. So, if you don’t have any from third year, you’ll need to do at least a couple of sub-internships. You should do those first, so that you can complete your application.

Try and get an AI on the Chariman’s service is possible.  You will want a letter from them and it is a good way to get to know them.

One of the most important things you can do is have your application complete on the very first day it can be submitted. That is something you can control, and programs immediately start to offer interviews, which are largely first-come-first-served.

5.  Are away rotations required, encouraged, or not useful at all?
For general surgery, they generally are not required, as they seem to be in orthopedic surgery, for example. The biggest reason is to get to know faculty at a particular place that you want to go, especially if you are far from there and your school doesn’t have a history of sending residents to that institution. 

6.  How much research do I need to match into general surgery? Does any research count, or does it need to be specifically related to surgery?
There’s not a specific amount. The most important thing is to be able to describe what you did when you write your application and do interviews. Research in other fields counts, especially if you can explain why you did what you did and what was interesting to you about it.  We want to see that you can complete a project and see it through to publication.  It does not have to be in a surgical field.  

7.  Do I need a LOR from the department chair? What if I never got to work with him/her?
Depends on the program, but mostly yes. Regardless of whether you have worked with him/her, you should schedule a meeting (bring your CV) to discuss and request your letter. As you would guess, if they don’t know you well, it may not be your most personal letter, but it allows programs to judge you a little bit in relationship to other applicants they have seen over time and versus other applicants from your institution. For example, if I get 20 applicants from the same institution, the letters from the chair may help me figure out which are the best applicants.

8.  How many programs should I apply to?
Charting Outcomes in the Match (same link as above) will show you the likelihood of matching as a product of the number of applications. Generally, 35 programs is the answer for well-qualified applicants. There has been a fear-based increase in the number of programs to which students apply, but The Match is not actually more competitive (as feared), so hopefully the number of applications will return to a more sane number.

9.  I’ve seen that some programs are 7 years long with 2 years of research built in. If I want to go into academics, do I need to go to one of these programs?
Depends on what you want to do. If you want to do basic science research when you finish, then, yes, you will need training in that, probably from doing 2 years in a lab. If you want to do clinical research, then you will need to have sufficient training in that. You might be able to get that during residency (or might have it from before), but 1-2 years will probably help. Of course, 1-2 years spent doing something you hate and will never do again isn’t really worth your time. So, you should look for a program that offers what you want and sends people into the career you envision for yourself. And you should know what will happen if you change your mind; will you still have to do 2 years, could it be an MBA or MPH instead of 2 years in basic science lab? Etc.

A fellowship can substitute in some degree to these two years of research.  Also, if you are trying to get into a competitive fellowship, like pediatric surgery, you will be doing two years of research in pediatric surgery.  

10.  I applied to general surgery and didn’t match. What are my options now?
1)	You will need to do a lot of “soul searching” and personal reflection to decide how to proceed. Talk to your mentors as well as the surgery leaders in your institution. Sometimes there are other options and hard-to-hear thoughts about your application that you need to know.
2)	Find a spot through SOAP. Tough, but your best bet.
3)	Find a preliminary position through SOAP. This gets you a job as a surgery intern, but doesn’t guarantee anything beyond that. A couple have groups have written about the outcomes of this. Our outcomes are similar. (Pezzi, C. M., Leibrandt, T. J., Augustine, R. T., Nakao, S., Borman, K. R., Dent, T. L., &amp; Kukora, J. S. (2011). Nondesignated preliminary residents in general surgery: 25-year outcomes. Am J Surg, 202(2), 233-236. doi: 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2010.06.033)
4)	Delay graduation. This lets you enter the match the next year as a “current US graduate”. On the other hand, you will be reapplying in less than 6 months, so if you are really going to do something like research or another degree (expensive) to make yourself a better applicant, you have to start right away.
5)	Take the year to do something else. It would have to be something pretty great to make you a better candidate a year after you graduate.
6)	Find a different career path through SOAP or otherwise. That same data from The MATCH will show you that there are sometimes unfilled positions (family practice is the classic example) that you could get into this way. Getting back into surgery afterward is very, very difficult.

2.  What is a good Step 1 score I should aim for in order to be competitive? Do I need to score higher to go to an academic program?
If you want to look at the data yourself, it is freely available from The MATCH. (http://www.nrmp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Charting-Outcomes-2014-Final.pdf)
In general, 240 and up is a really good score, and 220 and up is a pretty good score. There are people who do and don’t match at either end of the spectrum, though.
Academic programs vary in what they want; some want to train more academic surgeons, and others want to train surgeons for their area. Scores need to be higher for very competitive programs, whether they are academic or community. I certainly wouldn’t say that just because you have a score of X you can get into a community program but not an academic program.
The bigger difference in getting into an academic program than Step 1 score is research, publication and presentation experience.


3.  What things should I be doing during third year to prepare myself for residency applications?
Start with So You Want to Be a Surgeon
(https://www.facs.org/education/resources/residency-search)
You should be maximally engaged with your team, reading for each case, and letting it be known that you are interested and want to participate. Get to know at least a couple of faculty well enough that they will right you a letter.

4.  Is there a particular way I should schedule my fourth year?
You need to get three letters of recommendation. So, if you don’t have any from third year, you’ll need to do at least a couple of sub-internships. You should do those first, so that you can complete your application.  Try and get an AI on the Chariman’s service is possible.  You will want a letter from them and it is a good way to get to know them.  One of the most important things you can do is have your application complete on the very first day it can be submitted. That is something you can control, and programs immediately start to offer interviews, which are largely first-come-first-served.

5.  Are away rotations required, encouraged, or not useful at all?
For general surgery, they generally are not required, as they seem to be in orthopedic surgery, for example. The biggest reason is to get to know faculty at a particular place that you want to go, especially if you are far from there and your school doesn’t have a history of sending residents to that institution. 

6.  How much research do I need to match into general surgery? Does any research count, or does it need to be specifically related to surgery?
There’s not a specific amount. The most important thing is to be able to describe what you did when you write your application and do interviews. Research in other fields counts, especially if you can explain why you did what you did and what was interesting to you about it.  We want to see that you can complete a project and see it through to publication.  It does not have to be in a surgical field.  

7.  Do I need a LOR from the department chair? What if I never got to work with him/her?
Depends on the program, but mostly yes. Regardless of whether you have worked with him/her, you should schedule a meeting (bring your CV) to discuss and request your letter. As you would guess, if they don’t know you well, it may not be your most personal letter, but it allows programs to judge you a little bit in relationship to other applicants they have seen over time and versus other applicants from your institution. For example, if I get 20 applicants from the same institution, the letters from the chair may help me figure out which are the best applicants.

8.  How many programs should I apply to?
Charting Outcomes in the Match (same link as above) will show you the likelihood of matching as a product of the number of applications. Generally, 35 programs is the answer for well-qualified applicants. There has been a fear-based increase in the number of programs to which students apply, but The Match is not actually more competitive (as feared), so hopefully the number of applications will return to a more sane number.

9.  I’ve seen that some programs are 7 years long with 2 years of research built in. If I want to go into academics, do I need to go to one of these programs?
Depends on what you want to do. If you want to do basic science research when you finish, then, yes, you will need training in that, probably from doing 2 years in a lab. If you want to do clinical research, then you will need to have sufficient training in that. You might be able to get that during residency (or might have it from before), but 1-2 years will probably help. Of course, 1-2 years spent doing something you hate and will never do again isn’t really worth your time. So, you should look for a program that offers what you want and sends people into the career you envision for yourself. And you should know what will happen if you change your mind; will you still have to do 2 years, could it be an MBA or MPH instead of 2 years in basic science lab? Etc.  A fellowship can substitute in some degree to these two years of research.  Also, if you are trying to get into a competitive fellowship, like pediatric surgery, you will be doing two years of research in pediatric surgery.  

10.  I applied to general surgery and didn’t match. What are my options now?
1)	You will need to do a lot of “soul searching” and personal reflection to decide how to proceed. Talk to your mentors as well as the surgery leaders in your institution. Sometimes there are other options and hard-to-hear thoughts about your application that you need to know.
2)	Find a spot through SOAP. Tough, but your best bet.
3)	Find a preliminary position through SOAP. This gets you a job as a surgery intern, but doesn’t guarantee anything beyond that. A couple have groups have written about the outcomes of this. Our outcomes are similar. (Pezzi, C. M., Leibrandt, T. J., Augustine, R. T., Nakao, S., Borman, K. R., Dent, T. L., &amp; Kukora, J. S. (2011). Nondesignated preliminary residents in general surgery: 25-year outcomes. Am J Surg, 202(2), 233-236. doi: 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2010.06.033)
4)	Delay graduation. This lets you enter the match the next year as a “current US graduate”. On the other hand, you will be reapplying in less than 6 months, so if you are really going to do something like research or another degree (expensive) to make yourself a better applicant, you have to start right away.
5)	Take the year to do something else. It would have to be something pretty great to make you a better candidate a year after you graduate.
6)	Find a different career path through SOAP or otherwise. That same data from The MATCH will show you that there are sometimes unfilled positions (family practice is the classic example) that you could get into this way. Getting back into surgery afterward is very, very difficult.

Here is a link to similar information from the American College of Surgeons that includes FAQs like these, a timeline and descriptions of residency. (https://www.facs.org/education/resources/medical-students/information)

&amp;nbsp;


Originally premed, I realized that healthcare was not for me. Programming has since become the home I've been looking for. I have basic syntax knowledge in Python, C++, and Javascript (taking a C++ course at my cc, and Python and Javascript through codecademy)

 *  By the end of the week I plan to create a site to be used as a personal portfolio. Though it will be mostly empty since I have no projects.

 * Then I want to create a chrome extension that synchronizes your dropbox with drive

 * From there I want to create a computer application that acts similar to the extension but interacts in the background and offline. Something that can take an article offline and upload it to a blog as soon as an internet

 * Afterwards there are other project ideas I have wanted to work on:
    1. Machine learning software with ScyPy
    2. Java RPG
    3. Integrating more frontend development to my personal portfolio
    4. Search Engine
    5. Physics Engine

&amp;nbsp;

My goal is to finish the extension by June so that I can apply to the dropbox internship. In all honesty though I have no idea what really goes into building the extension. I do plan to find resources on making an actual chrome extension, but I don't know how to make it interact with drive or dropbox. My hope is that once finished with the extension I can more smoothly move on to the computer program.   


&amp;nbsp;

**Concerns**

  Am I skipping steps before working on this project? Since diving into programming I have never had so much passion and drive to really devote time to my work so I am hoping this can help overcome my lack of knowledge or experience. 
I want dropbox to see that even though I'm a dropout (no pun intended), I have the work ethic of Rock Lee and deserve a chance just as much as the next guy. But even more so **I want to prove to myself** that I'm in it for the long run. I want to see myself working my hardest to accomplish a goal I made for myself. So even if I don't finish it in time, I'd be happy with any finished product.

&amp;nbsp;


**What do you think? What topics or guides should I look into so that I can create my program. Is my first goal too high, should I do something small just so I can add it to my portfolio?**


Thank you, for any advice you can give :)

I went through http://codingforinterviews.com/internships and found many companies but a lot of them are in US and after having browsed through internship listings they are mostly in US. As far as I know, one needs sponsorship for visa or already have a right to work in US in order to even apply and be considered.

I am from Europe, UK to be exact, and there must be people who are not from US and hence may know companies that are looking for interns in Europe or even sponsor visas for international students. I will continue looking but just posted here so that someone might point me to some companies they found in Europe."

I just returned to school for a Master's at an excellent university for CS, but I am worried that me being a little older (28) with work experience in a completely unrelated field might be hurting my chances. We get companies big and small coming virtually every day (mostly 2x a day) to recruit, but I've been hit by quite a few rejections for internships, and I'm getting a little nervous for summer. Has anyone been in this position? Any advice for how to position myself, how to approach companies, and what to put on or leave out of a resume?

Thanks!

2vb3kw,8,2015-02-09,Questions regarding the ethicality of interviewing at Amazon after accepting an offer for a summer internship,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2vb3kw/questions_regarding_the_ethicality_of/,"I have already accepted an offer to intern at a medium sized tech company as a Software Engineer this summer. I will be working on a really cool project in my opinion and I've only heard good things about the company, so I am very excited for my internship, or I was until I received an email from Amazon offering for me to begin the interview process with them. I've never had the chance to interview for the big 5 before, so I don't want to pass up the chance. I will be completing my coding assessment today, assuming I make the decision to go for Amazon. I have heard bad things about working at Amazon, but I would enjoy living in Seattle over summer, and the experience would I believe help me find jobs at other big companies in the future. 

Now, to the main questions. Is it unethical for me to interview for Amazon as a summer intern after I have already accepted an offer for this summer? Would interning at Amazon look better to potential employers than a regular internship at a medium sized company that most people have never heard of? What would you do if you were in my position?"
2vb4j2,29,2015-02-09,I can't tell if my SO's mother is an Nmum - intentional abuse or is she just too stupid to know any better? [advice appreciated and a bit of a rant],witchypoo97,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2vb4j2/i_cant_tell_if_my_sos_mother_is_an_nmum/,"Hello, RBN! I just stumbled across this subreddit and I would like your help. 


TL:DR: After reading a lot of user's stories, I feel like my partner's mother is a very typical Nmum. However, she is one of the single most dim-witted people I have ever met, she honestly seems way too stupid to think of calculated, narcissistic abuse plans. Is she a Narc, a paranoid idiot, or both? 


Either way, I'm here for advice on how to help my SO out of this environment, and also to complain a bit.


I have been with my SO for almost 3 years now, and we have been good friends for even longer. High school sweethearts and everything - we only graduated last year, as a matter of fact. From the very first moment my SO opened up to me about his mother I KNEW something wasn't right. 


First off, she appears to like me well enough. I mean, we get along decently - I am a very nonconfrontational person and try to be as nice as I possibly can to this woman, because while I hate her, I do feel like she is seriously mentally ill. She hasn't tried to tear her son and I's relationship apart like I've read is typical behaviour in Narcs, and behaves almost normally with me. She allows me to sleep over all the time and everything! Which is why I'm still not totally convinced she is an Nmum. But, she's pretty fucking close.


She is insane. Completely nuts. **He has no minute of privacy in this house.** She is in his room 24/7, standing over his shoulder, reading what's on his computer screen, standing in the corner or lying on the bed, babbling nonsense just to make him pay attention to her. She does the same when I'm in the house - she doesn't leave us alone for more than an hour, at most. When she first discovered we were dating, she bought him condoms within the week (we were 14), which is pretty cool by me, but then SHE PROCEEDED TO CONSTANTLY CHECK THE PACKAGE TO SEE IF ANY WERE MISSING. She constantly goes through his belongings and has an obsession with moving items around the house that aren't hers. Paperwork goes missing, only to be found days later under a stack of garbage on the other side of the house (Nmum is a bit of a hoarder). Clothes disappear from the floor and sit in the bottom of the laundry basket for a week, and when asked where they are she screams at my SO that she doesn't know and she didn't touch them. It's common for me to walk into his bedroom while staying the night and find my shoes straightened up, my bag moved, all the sheets stripped from the bed and in the laundry basket. She has a weird habit of doing this every morning after I've slept over........


She also has a very strange, warped version of munchausen by proxy. SO has serious chronic health problems - he has adolescent arthritis in his feet and knees, causing him almost constant pain if he isn't wearing his shoes with specialised insets. Here's the thing about those insets - it took him a year of begging and dozens of medical professionals urging to get them. **She has the most INFURIATING habit of taking him to dozens of doctors when something is wrong, and then not listening to any of them and blaming the illness on himself.** He drinks too much tea, he doesn't go outside enough, it's his acne medication. On top of his foot and joint problems he is also severly underweight (BMI of 18, yo) and suffers from severe depression and anxiety. Again, this is always something stupid's fault. She liked to blame his tea the most and now refuses to buy any and will throw out a box if one's managed to sneak by undetected. It doesn't make any sense medically, but I'm willing to believe it's because tea is his only real vice and the only thing that calms him down enough in this house to be able to deal with this bullshit. She just can't let him have that. She also keeps taking him to therapists for his depression and anxiety, but refuses to let him have medication - she's convinced that he'll somehow develop a crippling addiction to the pills and just fucking randomly die, or something. It's probably one of the stupider things I've ever seen her do. 


**But the confusing part is that sometimes, I honestly think she is too stupid to understand what she is doing. She is quite old, they had my SO later in life, and she appears to be suffering from mild dementia - it runs in her family but she refuses to get checked out.** She constantly forgets everything that has been said to her or what she's doing. She can't understand when my SO wants to be left alone. She has no concept of how anything, including human relationships, works. She just seems like a lonely old woman who desperately doesn't want her child to leave her, and by being like this just pushes him further away. I never know whether to truly hate her or just feel sorry for her. But there is no way to excuse how she treats her son.

**My partner is going absolutely insane in these living conditions.** Over the last few months, without school to take a break to, his anxiety has skyrocketed. He has panic attacks at least once a day. He feels like he is constantly being watched, like he's never safe, like nothing he owns can escape being touched and examined by her. He is so afraid of waking up to her standing in the corner watching him sleep that he barely gets enough sleep most nights. And she actually DOES DO THAT. SHE'S DONE IT MANY TIMES. One time recently he was dozing off in the afternoon during a shitty tv marathon, and I made the mistake of watching him, aww-ing at over how adorable he was. He felt my eyes on him and jumped up screaming bloody murder, thinking I was his mother. This life he's being forced to live is fucking hell, and I can't watch this happen anymore.


Nmum refuses to take him to get a driver's licence. They live in a rural area on the other side of town, a 45 minute walk up a hill with no sidewalk to the nearest shops - as I mentioned before, he has horrible arthritis in his legs. This walk is impossible for him to do regularly - so walking to his job every day is not an option. Because of this, he is unemployed. 


Another problem is his depression and anxiety. His social anxiety is crippling - I don't think he could hold down a job even if he could get there in the first place due to this. He has lost motivation to get a job and save up to move out. The one point of hope he has is by hopefully getting a good internship via his university - he's studying IT and may be able to start earning money in as little as 6 months. But again, he is extremely anxious about this and is even having second thoughts about attending uni. Some days I feel like he's completely given up trying to get away from her, and it's devastating.


Also thought I should mention his father is around, but is of absolutely no help. He works long hours and when he is home, prefers to be outside gardening. He rarely speaks to his son and doesn't ""believe"" in medical care (I know). He thinks antidepressants and anxiety meds are a scam.


I don't know how to help him. If my family could afford it, he would be living with us by now, but we just can't. I don't even know if I'm in the right place. I just really needed to vent about this horrible, toxic person.


EDIT: He is an only child and their ""miracle baby"" they had after decades of trying, if that helps. Still can't comprehend as to how someone could want a child that badly, and then go and treat them like this."
2vbbra,11,2015-02-09,"Graduated last spring, still job hunting.",here4pr0n,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2vbbra/graduated_last_spring_still_job_hunting/,"So I need some advice...

I graduated last May and am still looking to start my career. It took me 6 years to graduate, so I feel a little tepid. Not a very good GPA. I also had trouble securing internships. I had one in fact a couple of years ago. I live in an area where all I'm finding are web development jobs and nothing that requires Java or C, my main languages from school. Never did web development in school. Started doing Codecademy to rectify that (very easy stuff, but I really feel like I'm learning!). I started a little late applying to schools, so I've applied to around 40 jobs at this point and had 5 interviews. Zero offers.

So these are my questions:

1. Is this normal? More than half a year and about 40 applications later I get a 10% response rate? And no job on top of that.
2. What could I put in my portfolio? I don't want to put in my school projects, since our academic honor policy was pretty hardcore. And my side projects are kind of silly things in Java Swing. Are there any other code hosting sites like GitHub I could use? Assuming Codecademy works out well, I think I'll build a website.
3. Is it harder to get jobs that require relocation? Most of the places I applied to aren't even acknowledging my existence, so I'm wondering if I just suck or if it's because of distance.
4. Since I am now seriously considering web development, is there anything else I could do besides Codecademy to improve in that area? I think it makes sense to build a website to demonstrate what I learned, but is there anything more I could do? Codecademy also feels kind of simple in ways. That or it's because of my CS background that I felt good about it.
5. Related to web development... Back end vs front end? I get front end is user facing and back end is the processing in the background. Codecademy seems to be front end focused on the most part. I think my Java and C skills would translate well into back end. What should I do improve or specialize in that?
6. Speaking of specialization, how do I answer that question in interviews? I don't feel like I specialized in anything. I am just a Java and C coder (and hopefully soon a competent HTML/CSS/JavaScript one too). I mean, I'm interested in things like mobile development, messing around with a Kinect, security, etc. A lot of things in computer science sound great! But, I haven't learned any of it, so I'm not sure interest alone can carry me. For example, after Codecademy and if I have the time, I think I'd try out some Android or iOS development. But I think it would take at least creating my first app before I claim I can specialize in it. Is that making sense?
7. Project management or producer roles. Are those feasible as an entry level and what would I need to show? On my resume, I put down to semester-long projects I did for classes which I chose to be the leader. If there's one thing I liked more than coding for CS classes, it was managing projects. I just felt like I had a knack for it. I wasn't the strongest coder, but I could sure manage others and talk to customers.

Bonus: What's it take to get Google to not reject your application the moment you send it? I mean this to be funny but also kind of curious. I applied to one of their general software engineer postings and a university graduate posting. For each of them, about 30 minutes after my submission, I get a rejection! If I had to guess, I'd say it's my lack of having a portfolio or GitHub that they can see. I'm not really aiming for Google. It was a more ""why the hell not"" kind of application. :D

I also feel out of place as a programmer. Maybe its the stigma of graduating late or just negative vibes and thoughts that are eating at me. For example, I come in here and almost all of the upvoted threads are about people that are ace students getting an internship in their freshman year or getting into Google or Microsoft as their first job. I know my place. I'm no where near any of that caliber. But, it also kind of eats at my self-esteem. Do lower tier people like me exist? It just feels like everybody here is securing their job before graduating or mere weeks afterwards. Everybody seems to be achieving and overachieving, and it just feels lonely at the bottom. :/

EDIT: Keep seeing typos I'm fixing. Don't mind me."
2vbflq,4,2015-02-09,Don't Know What to Do ...,[deleted],rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/2vbflq/dont_know_what_to_do/,"I'm 23, graduated last June and have been unemployed since. 

I got a 2:1 degree in international relations and politics from a sub par university. I have very little job experience, and no obvious specialties. Yeah sure, I can use word, Excel and PowerPoint. But who the fuck can't nowadays? 

I hated my degree - I hated the subject, I hated the lectures and I hated spending hours on a computer. My final year is a blur of waking up with tears in my eyes at 5AM, biking up to university and spending the rest of the day switching between Facebook, some clickbait bullshit and horribly written academic nonsense. I hated everything about it and got severely depressed. The only thing I looked forward to was that spliff at the end of the day, and guitar. I channeled all of my passions into my guitar, but I still suck. 

I never found a girlfriend. At first I was meeting new girls on a daily basis, but for some reason nothing worked out. Then I started retreating - I found everything so hard. I'd smoke weed almost daily just to make myself feel OK. 

University started with a bang - I was young, confident and ready to take on the world! By the end I was a mess; severely depressed, constantly regretting my past and shut away from my friends, smoking a spliff and wanking in the dark.

""Do what you love,"" they said, ""and you'll find a career that's right for you"". They were wrong. I desperately applied for internships to get some experience, but they all rejected me.  

Luckily my Mum knew a guy that worked in Brussels. Awesome. So I went off there to get some work experience with a company. I hated it. *If this is the reality of working in politics then I'm not going to work in politics*, I thought. Ten hours a day on a computer writing bullshit reports that help companies push more laws through the EU that benefit them and hurt every body else? FUCK THAT. 

So I decided to be a gardener. Why not? I've got a bit of experience, I love working outside and I enjoy learning new practical skills (for some reason I'd rather be able to lay turf than  create a complicated spreadsheet).

Well, the reality is nothing like I'd imagined. Winter, fuck. I'd done two weeks in September and it was pretty cold then. But God damn I wasn't prepared for how cold it would be in December, January and February. So I stopped. I couldn't do it - I was getting paid pittance, waking up and getting to the car was nearly impossible and the stifling social environment at the company was killing me. 

So fuck, I hate gardening too? Jesus. I hate gardening, pub work, factory work, research work, admin and construction. 

WHAT ELSE IS THERE?!

I've just been browsing the web, searching for jobs I think I could do (HINT: there aren't many). I apply for at least one a day, and probably hear back from about one a month. I've failed at every interview I've had, I don't even want that fucking job anyway.

I know I've got severe depression, but the doctor just passed me on to some bull shit CBT clinic. I can't roll with that mumbo jumbo.  So what now? Keep smoking weed to a self-destructive level, keep living with my parents, slowly lose more of my friends, slip further and further from the dream of meeting a girl?!

I feel so trapped, so humiliated, so weak. But what else can I do? I work a few weeks and then I get crippling depression. Wearing a suit makes me feel dirty and forcing myself outside in the cold is just impossible. 

But you know what? I still spend all my time on a computer. I still read political articles and have fantasies of working for a research company. I don't know why - I've tried it, I hate it and I can't face my life revolving around it. 

So, fuck .. Fuck reddit, what do I do .."

[I'd love to know how you wrapped your head around working with larger scale budgets. Did you go straight into a role where you were throwing around millions, or did you work your way up to it? What was your background? What was the trajectory that got you to these moments? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2v9du5/iama_former_brand_manager_that_purchased_a_web/cofqcav?context=5)|Love this question. I remember the first time I paid an invoice that was $13 million dollars... my mind was blown. Later on, I didn't even register the amounts and just wanted to get it done (when paying invoices).
 |I guess for me it came down to quickly understanding the context. I worked on the whole P&amp;L (profit and loss statement) so I knew exactly how much money was coming in revenue and how much was being spent on every single thing (cost of goods, delivery to market, wages, etc.). When I knew the entire budget, that gave it a good amount of context. Knowing the total marketing budget... basically how much we had to play around with, was super helpful for providing a context as well.
 |There were a few other helpful things. One was there were strict rules for amounts on who could give the final approval. For spends up to a certain amount I didn't need to even tell anyone, for spends to a larger amount my manager had to sign off, even larger his manager, etc. There are some amounts so large only the PepsiCo CEO can sign off on them.
 |Probably the one other helpful thing was knowing what amounts they actually cared about. Just because I couldn't sign off on a certain amount didn't mean they actually cared about it. I quickly learned when bringing up a spend to them whether or not they were paying attention and caring, and if so how much they cared, and that was pretty helpful.
 |In my first role I was working with budgets of just a couple million, then I worked with one of about $5 million, and then I actually took over the budgeting planning and process for all of Quaker marketing for a single year, which had a budget more than 50 times the previous amounts. So I guess I did work up to it, although I don't know that that was necessary... it was likely just more coincidental.
 |I was a Government major w/ honors at Dartmouth and had interned in Homeland Security for a US Congressman. I had also won a major national award, a national competition, and had some very unique leadership/public speaking experience. At that point I was selected as the first PepsiCo undergraduate intern in brand management. I was then offered a full-time position, accepted it, and worked my way up while there.

Do you hand over a check and they hand over a piece of paper with the password on it?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2v9du5/iama_former_brand_manager_that_purchased_a_web/cofnvlq?context=5)|Well it was a corporate purchase. I believe we decided to purchase it during our budgeting process anyway (although I'm not certain about that, don't really remember), so the money was just built into the budget from the get go if I'm correct.
 |There are professional companies that just do this. So I asked our digital buyer (an agency that we employed) if they knew any of them, and they had one that another client had worked with before and recommended.
 |I reached out to them and hired them. They provided an estimate for what we'd acquire the URL for, and they also recommended an initial bid. One of their selling points is that they help keep the buyer anonymous, although they also told me I'd made my first mistake by going to the URL from the workplace... the site could track my IP, see that people from Quaker's offices were going to it, and possibly jack up the price knowing who the purchaser is.
 |So the negotiation was pretty simple. We made an initial offer, they countered, etc. I would hear from the company I hired once every couple days with the latest offer. We acquired it in about two weeks over maybe 4 or 5 rounds of offers, with each side conceding on the price a bit each round. (Although we didn't just 'meet in the middle', $1M was their lowest price, and they were sticking to it.) We would include reasons why we felt the website wasn't as valuable as they were pricing it at during each offer, and they'd include reasons why it was super valuable with each of their counters.
 |The transfer was pretty simple I believe, although I wasn't actually involved in that, I just told IT and our web agency to handle it. I assume we had our own domain host and just had them transfer the URL to our account there.
 |**TL;DR:** You go back and forth on offers until you match, giving reasons for the URL's value each time. Web guys take care of the transfer details.
[What's it like to create brands that are attributed to endorsing unhealthy food/beverages? Do you have guilt or does the salary justify...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2v9du5/iama_former_brand_manager_that_purchased_a_web/cofvwjr?context=5)|Well I worked on the whole gamut of things.
 |Oats are among the healthiest grains, while whole-grain oatmeal in particular has some additional health benefits v. what many people are consuming as well. Health and wellness was important to people there.
 |Of course Aunt Jemima falls on the other side of the spectrum.
 |Ultimately, I feel the majority of the responsibility lies with the consumer, as they're free to not purchase those products.
 |That said, awareness of health and wellness issues is relatively new within food and beverage, and most of these products were made at a time that these issues were far off the radar. I think it's unreasonable to expect companies to discontinue products just because they're not extremely good for you. Instead, I think the best move is to help make these products have improved health profiles, even if they're never going to be the very best choices. PepsiCo has done, and continues to do, a whole lot toward that goal.
 |And finally, I think it's important that these companies use their expertise to innovate in the healthy products space. There's been some of that at PepsiCo with their various juices and low/0 calories beverage offerings (the ones with limited artificial sweetener). They've also gotten into the dairy space, and maybe even produce (not totally sure). That said, they definitely could do more. In my opinion they, and all the companies like them, should do more.
[ congrats. What word/s did you use to convince the co founder? Being a long time friend would of been hard to convice him to take a step of faith? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2v9du5/iama_former_brand_manager_that_purchased_a_web/cofm9d5?context=5)|Thanks! I didn't expect to get any questions about ItsPlatonic since I didn't really mention it, but thanks.
 |To be honest, it happened over months of time. A lot of it was proving to him that the market existed and that people wanted it. For a long time he was very interested but not willing to quit his job and make the leap.
 |The final straw was me just looking him in the eye and telling him I needed him, and that he needed to do it. I just sat him down and said something like, ""It's time. We've always wanted to start a company, I have everything ready for us to hit the ground running (already had designed the whole site, bought the URL, etc.), and you'll regret it if you don't join me. Quit your job, the time is now and I don't want to find another cofounder.""
[Between Pepsi and Aumt Jemima, that's a lot of high fructose corn syrup being used in your products. What do you think of the use of corn syrup in place of sugar, and what do think about the affects of sugar (and corn syrups\) on health and weight in humans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2v9du5/iama_former_brand_manager_that_purchased_a_web/cofn273?context=5)|You know, I'm really not an expert on it. At the time (5 years ago) I remember hearing something about high fructose corn syrup really not actually being a health issue, and I have no idea how true that was. I just haven't looked into it and removing it from the product was never really considered while I was in that role.
 |EDIT: I do think it's worth researching though, and an important topic (anything that affects our health in mass-produced foods, I don't know enough about HFCS to say for sure if it is in this category or not). At the time I was in charge of Aunt Jemima, it wasn't nearly as on-the-radar as it is today. I was also working on some other potential health-related formula improvements that unfortunately didn't come to fruition.
[What was the best part of all your work what did enjoy and what sucked?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2v9du5/iama_former_brand_manager_that_purchased_a_web/cofmnmp?context=5)|**There were two things I loved about my time at PepsiCo:**
 |1: The people. I made such good friends there and had so much fun spending time with a number of them. I really miss them.
 |2: The power. It was really amazing to have so much control and ability to change/influence things. Really felt like I had a very important role to play.
 |**What sucked:**
 |1: I ultimately left the company because I wasn't delivered promised promotions.
 |2: There was a lot of turnover at the top while I was there... Quaker (my division) went through 4 presidents in just 2.5 years at one point. That meant lots of abandoned projects and changing priorities.
[What are your thoughts on the syrup itself? Can you still eat the products? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2v9du5/iama_former_brand_manager_that_purchased_a_web/cofp1xw?context=5)|Sure! I still can, although I don't eat Aunt Jemima (or pancakes/syrup at all) for health reasons. I do sometimes eat the other products that I worked on, especially oatmeal, or Aunt Jemima's corn bread (so good!).
 |I liked the syrup. Personally, it was my second favorite of all of them (and yes, I have tried every syrup known to mankind), but one of its biggest competitors is the one I grew up with and like most. Unfortunately, on the rare occasion I do eat pancakes, everyone assumes I want and will only eat Aunt Jemima and so they go out and buy it for me. I'm cursed to never enjoy my favorite syrup again!
[It's Log Cabin, isn't it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2v9du5/iama_former_brand_manager_that_purchased_a_web/cofz6h7?context=5)|Maybe :)
[It's Mrs Butterworth, isn't it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2v9du5/iama_former_brand_manager_that_purchased_a_web/cofytff?context=5)|Sorry, /u/wang2chung wins this round.
[What does a $1 million deal look like on the backend? In other words, is it just a bunch of people in suits signing papers, or was there literally a mil in a brief case slid across a conference table. ( I know that the brief case is highly unlikely, but one could only hope\) Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2v9du5/iama_former_brand_manager_that_purchased_a_web/cofp450?context=5)|I really wish it could have been the briefcase. I actually used to ask my finance team for permission to do things like that all the time. They got pretty sick of it.
 |Well there was never any meetings at all about this... in our world it wasn't that big of deal, and I paid invoices many, many times that size for other things. Once we reached an agreement, I paid the invoice using our internal software that I paid all other invoices with, and that was that. The software prints and mails a check that goes to them.
 |I'm sure I signed something, but I don't really remember that. The company we used to negotiate for it probably provided their stock contract for us and both parties were likely fine with it.
[How do you feel about 14 characters being worth that much? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2v9du5/iama_former_brand_manager_that_purchased_a_web/cofmi7l?context=5)|I assume you're referring to/including the www.?
 |How much advertising Quaker does and continues to do. More advertising means more people going to the URL. - Whether or not URLs and .coms remain as they are today. I could see services that allow you to customize URLs becoming popular, or .com becoming even with other website endings sometime in the future.
[Why spend all that money to purchase Quaker.com when QuakerOats.com works just fine? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2v9du5/iama_former_brand_manager_that_purchased_a_web/cofnkkh?context=5)|It's not an easy decision.
 |One of the biggest reasons is it is more memorable and likely for someone to type in him or herself.

2vbqlb,2,2015-02-09,"Getting worried about post-graduation situations, any tips?",zeldaahn2,pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/2vbqlb/getting_worried_about_postgraduation_situations/,"I'm a current P4 who is about to graduate in less than 3 months.. (May of 2015) from UIC and I am beginning to worry about not having a job or anything lined up prior to graduation. 

I only applied to like 3-4 total fellowship/residencies and thankfully I have had one residency interview and one fellowship interview early this month and I am not sure if I will land these residency/fellowship or not.

As I have lurked in this subreddit, I followed the advice for looking for jobs as early as possible but, none to this day I have been just plainly receiving rejection letters.

I tried as a student to find position as a pharmacy intern in major chains during my school year but, I ended up not being able to find a position because they were looking for full time employees, not a student. 

I thought I would be able to sign with Walgreens as I was talking with the district manager, but recently the district manager changed and I do not know where my application now stands or any sort. 

As for what I want to do after graduation, I actually liked all aspect of pharmacy. I enjoyed hospital staff pharmacy and the retail staff pharmacy as well. I am currently rotating on my community APPE module and I enjoy counseling patient and really getting used to handling insurance issues and enjoy making those ""late to refill or new to therapy calls."" 

Other classmates of my school have mostly already signed up with their current employee of CVS/Walgreens and I beginning to worry that I may just end up not be able to find a position. 

To be frank, I do not mind really moving and to be frank I do not really see myself staying in the Chicago area as I know markets are extremely saturated here. I have been applying far and far places but I am just tired of not hearing back and just receiving the rejection letter due to them needing someone now.

Any advice or tips or similar stories would be welcome to calm my nerves. I do want to ask if it gets any better after graduation with an active license? or with licensure, should I try to get 2-3 different state licensures to increase my chance of employment?

Thank you in advance,"

I'm dying to know if I will be competitive for the health sector of the PC.  Let me give you my main details:
Applied for PC in 2013 interviewed and was nominated to leave June 2014 for health services but withdrew my application after major family tragedies.
Re applied for PC on Nov. 27th for Dominican Republic health sector as my first choice, then peru, then anywhere I am needed but in the health sector.  Currently hold a BA in Biology w/ 3.14 gpa
I got the confirmation email that I was being considered for the DR.
I studied abroad in Costa Rica for 3.5 months, have taken through intermediate spanish, lived with a host family.
Health skills:
Did an HIV/AIDs outreach and prevention internship my senior year of college specifically for the Peace Corps.  This included making educational material and distributing it to at risk populations.  
Then I worked in an assisted living facility where I got to do daily wound care and first aid, distributed medication, am CPR certified and have worked with hospice patients.  

My questions:
Am I competitive for peace corps given these qualifications? 
 I know that the DR is probably a competitive place so I'm wondering if I should have applied for maybe a less competitive country?
UNDER THE NEW SYSTEM: Has the PC stuck to its interviewing timeframe, when and how were you contacted about an interview, was there anyone who was contacted closer to their 'know by date' or are interviews conducted closer to the application time?
(in this case, my app deadline was Jan. 15 Know by is March 15)
Please Please Please let me know, this is my DREAM!!!"
2vbv2x,7,2015-02-09,Question on data internships,SamCuse,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/2vbv2x/question_on_data_internships/,"Hello! I'm currently enrolled in a Masters program focusing on Information Management and Data Science. I'm by no means an expert, but do feel comfortable with R and Python, as well as data analysis. I'm required to do an internship as part of the degree, however I work full time and also have a family with a young daughter. This means I can't apply for an internship that would require a move. I'd love to be able to find an internship that offers remote work, though understand there can be challenges associated with that. I live in Syracuse, NY where there aren't a ton of opportunities, though I am looking. Just wondering if there were any recommendations on the remote-work front.

Thanks!"

I'm majoring in EE at a state school (the only decent engineering school in state, but still not top tier), have a 3.89 GPA, a few decent Android projects (nothing extremely complex though. got a few thousand downloads each).

I completely suck at coding on paper, and if presented with paper, will always choke. I think this is why I fucked up at Microsoft, don't know about the other ones (Dropbox, Quora, Google, Greylock, Infusion, Citrix, IBM, Cisco, Garmin, Sensus, Square).

I know these internships are fairly competitive (especially for big4/SV/redmond) but it's getting me really worried that going to a T3 university (you probably have never heard of it if you're outside my state) is going to completely fuck me and I'm really heavily considering on transferring to a better school for CS in state just because it has a better reputation (CS is way better there, not so much here). 

To be clear I only got an interview at MS...

My family isn't exceedingly wealthy, but we live a fairly reasonable life with all the opportunities I could possibly want and or need to adequately prepare myself for the future. The issue I face, as many others do, is the lack of a college fund. As far as I can see, everything after graduating high-school is going to have be by my own volition. Currently, I'm a junior with decent grades and a strong interest in programming/computer science with decent experience from internships and self-study. The question I'm asking is would it be preferable to attempt to hone in on a skill over the next year and a half and pursue a job in that field immediately after high-school; or would it be better to attend some 25k a year U.C. and enter the workforce after that with some ridiculous amount of student debt along with a degree.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Can you describe your first day out?  What you did. What you saw. What amazed you if anything. The fears you felt if any. How your family has accepted you or not.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cofvln3?context=5)|I ate breakfast with some friends, Went home, got my hair done, met with my family, went shopping, went out to dinner, met with a girl, smashed, went to bed. I saw all new technology, that was what stood out the most. iPhones, My brother showed me his iPhone 6 plus and I remember being blown away. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to adjust to society. My family has always been very supportive of me no matter what I did or do so they were very accepting.
[Also, leading up to your incarceration, did you commonly commit crimes or was it a one time thing.  And a follow up to this: after being out, have you found yourself in situations where you considered committing a crime that would land you back in prison?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cofvln3?context=5)|I committed crimes but not never arrested really. I was almost charged with assault and battery at 12 years old and that was my biggest thing, I smoked weed, drank alcohol, lean and vandalized stuff but never got in trouble for any of it. Yeah, there's been a few times I've wanted to smack a person or two around but nothing else.
[If you were never arrested then why were you in maximum security for 10 years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog085g?context=5)|Well for starters I had two violent crimes and a few issues while I was in jail awaiting trial.
[While inside, how did you pass the time? Was it more of a group environment or more solitary?  Did you have to do anything illegal while inside just to survive? Or was it not that violent?  Edit: spelling.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cofvel0?context=5)|I got my masters degree which is something I've always wanted to do since I dropped out of school when I was 16. I was in general population which is basically the complete opposite of solitary confinement. Nothing incredibly legal, I tossed hands a few times and made a weapon for self defense purposes. No, it's very violent. I was 2 days into my sentence and someone was stabbed to death in their cell which happened to be right across the tier from mine.
[Your responses really bum me out.  It seems like you have zero remorse.  You just wish you hadn't got caught and gone to prison.  I guess my question, after reading your responses, is what are you going to do to make sure you don't end up back in prison?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cogaxan?context=5)|No, I think I deserved to get caught, I got lucky serving ten years, I honestly believe I should still be in prison. I just don't have any remorse for the person that lost his life that day. I mean would you rather I lie and say it really has me shaken up and I can't sleep? The fact of the matter is I took a life and it didn't effect me, I can't change that, That's just how my brain responded.
[But didn't you say that you wouldn't toss hands because he would have shot you then, and you would have been 6ft under?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cogdv6c?context=5)|Well we are pretending I can see back and time, He didn't have a gun on him so I would have no issue boxing with him.
[If you don't mind my asking, what did it feel like to take a life..?  Did you simply act on impulse, or was it planned?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog0157?context=5)|I didn't plan on taking a life, it was purely impulse. I was a hot headed teen who heard someone talking bad about a dumb girlfriend and I, I just mean't to shoot at him to show I wasn't someone to be fucked with, I hit an artery in his leg and he bled out before police could arrive. Truthfully, taking a life didn't bother me, I was in a really dark place.
[It didn't? Since that is past tense I'm curious how you feel about it now? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog5ge7?context=5)|If I could go back in time I wouldn't have shot at him but I don't feel any guilt.
[Can you explain the actual crime? Do you feel guilty etc? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cofzxl8?context=5)|I was a hot headed teen who heard someone talking bad about a dumb girlfriend and I, I just mean't to shoot at him to show I wasn't someone to be fucked with, I hit an artery in his leg and he bled out before police could arrive. I honestly don't feel guilty which I know is really fucked up but it is what it is.
[What you did was intentionally hurt someone, no less with a potentially deadly weapon.  If a similar situation came up, do you think that you would do the same thing again? Hurt someone for talking shit but make sure it is not too serious/fatal maybe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog3ujx?context=5)|I do, You can't talk crazy and expect to get away with it. If I said ""Your mom is a whore"" would you not fight about that?
[You are very lucky that you had a good lawyer so you only got 10 years, but what's going on mentally?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog3ujx?context=5)|No I wouldn't but only because I'm not trying to go back to prison.  I had 10 years to let it sink in, it didn't so i guess not.
[Is it the trauma of what happened making your brain not embrace what you've done? Or do you just not care about other people in general?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog3ujx?context=5)|I care about other people more than the average person, this guy wasn't a good guy, he beat his mom and girlfriend and sold drugs to kids, I just don't care about his life.
[Have you been to therapists to understand why you don't feel guilty?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog2g0d?context=5)|No I haven't, I don't want to disturb anything and become guilty truthfully.
[How old were you when this happened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog8o14?context=5)|I was 18-19 years old.
[What gun did you have access to? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog8o14?context=5)|I bought a mac 10 from my friends older brother.
[Would you mind sharing proof that you are who you say you are? If you're not comfortable, then that's okay.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog2vhp?context=5)|I don't really know how to prove anything without including my name.
[What's the difference between you and I, exactly? Being able to think pragmatically?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog9fui?context=5)|Exactly it, You use your head, I use my hands.
[You said elsewhere in this thread that everyone carries guns in your area. How can you justify being so confrontational when everyone around you is able -- and probably willing -- to kill you? How can you put so much on the line because someone was calling you names?  If you can't take a little shit talking without losing your mind, what can you take?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cogbybk?context=5)|It's not about not being able to take it, you can say anything to me and it's not going to bother me, What bothers me is when someone says something to me thinking they can say it and have no repercussions. And guess what, Nobody looks at me the wrong way now let alone say something foul.
[It's one thing to be a dumb kid who doesn't know any better (not that that's particularly understandable, but it's less baffling, I suppose\), but to actually lose as much as you have and still think that your thought process is worth defending? I mean, come on man. Have you learned nothing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cogbybk?context=5)|My dad used to say ""I'm not the strongest man in the world, I never claimed to be but I fear none and respect all, If you disrespect it, then I'm going to die about it"" and I've always lived by that, Respect me and I'll respect you, if you don't respect me then I'm not going to respect you. It's that simple.
[I support this... I've been lucky enough to never have police involved when ive done things like this but I wouldn't be able to go to sleep at night knowing I didn't stand up for myself or someone I cared about when some asshole thinks he can just say whatever he wants.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cogc0hh?context=5)|That's my point. I'm not going to ask him to stop, actions speak loader than words. It's the same thing with school yard bullies, you can beg and plead all you want for them to stop and they won't, but the minute you lay one of them out you never hear a word again.
[I've heard coffee is the most precious commodity in maximum security prison. Is this true? How did you adjust to having friends of a different race and then have to flip like a light switch and back your own only your race during a fight or altercation.  Did you get moved to maximum security because you were seeking education? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog3h61?context=5)|I wouldn't say precious, it's highly sought out but anybody can get their hands on it if they have money. I didn't really have any friends outside of my race, I was cool with people but not friends for that very reason, It's not good for anyone if we get buddy buddy and then something happens on the yard and we have to fight, stab or kill each other. No, I was in a maximum security institution because both my convictions are violent.
[From never seeing an iPhone to being on Reddit doing an AMA. Hmm ...](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog31vr?context=5)|Hmm is right, I surprised as well. I bought a iPhone, xbox, and laptop my second day out, I googled something like pertaining to a resent event (I don't remember what it was) and found this site, started exploring and have been on this site pretty much every other day for about 3 months now.
[You murdered someone and only spent 10 years on prison?  Do you think that's a fair trade?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog9574?context=5)|Of course not, I should be serving a life sentence but the prosecution wants convictions so they offered me a plea deal. If I plead guilty to assault in the first degree and 1st degree manslaughter I only get 10 years.

It's not just rapists though it's pretty much any offense involving women or children, If you murder a child you are on the same level as a pedophile or rapist.

I am applying for a summer internship at a Financial firm because of a connection I have there. 

My problem is that I have no competent resume. My connection told me not to worry that much about having experience. He said that they don't expect sophomores in University to have that much experience.

I do:

 -Get decent grades(3.5GPA)(Neat course load)

 -Succeed in talking to professional people(They seem to like me and claim I make a good impression on them.)

 -Have a summer's worth of experience working at a convenience store. My co-workers and employers both seemed to have a very good experience with me.

 -I have fluff skills(Excel, Google services, learning quickly, working with others, being reliable etc.)  and some community service etc.

I was wondering how much I should put on my resume. My job experience is pathetic.

I apologize if I came across as full of myself or if I offended anyone with my ignorance. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

He has just received a W2 summarizing his earnings and the tax that they deducted at source.  He paid about $1,700 in US taxes and given that this was his only income he should be entitled to get all of it back.

My question concerns what he needs to do with respect to filing a tax return and his potential refund.

(1)  Does he simply file his Canadian tax return and include the W2 information?  Will CRA refund the tax collected due to our tax treaty with the US?

(2)  Or does he have to file an American tax return in order to get the refund, and then file a Canadian tax return as per usual?

I have looked online but have been unable to find an answer.  I would appreciate any help that the Reddit community can provide.

I searched old threads and everyone seems to think the tech industry is fruitful, but I sent out like 8 or 9 apps this weekend and the flood of rejection letters is starting already. Should I be doing more than just submitting my resume and cover letter on their online application?

I've also always wanted to work at a bar as a bar back or bartender, but I have no experience and I understand that's the only way to get hired.

Should I be as worried as I am about how to pay rent?

P.S. Please don't just suggest ""dude live in superior/gunbarrel/longmont it's way cheaper"". I understand this, but as a recent college grad, I am much more attracted to living within Boulder and benefiting directly from the community, rather than needing to drive 10 mins to get anywhere interesting.

I know ideally I should stay longer, but I'm already on the bad side with my manager (i can include details, but I don't think it'll really matter). I don't think she really likes me, and her emails to me have been a little on the hostile side lately. I don't feel welcome, and don't really see potential for me in the future. I also don't think the company culture is for me.

So with this being said, I've already thought about quitting. My plan is to continue with my current job while job searching. I'm probably going to look for opportunities maybe in the end of Feb or in March. If I stayed only for a few months, should I even mention it in my resume? My current company is definitely more noticeable than the internships I had. I think. So I'm leaning towards including it in my resume in hopes of better opportunities.

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? Quitting a job early into it?"

Any personal experience/ input on ROI of a top MBA is appreciated.

My main question for people against MBA right out of undergrad: if MBA is good for 5 years down the road, wouldn't it be even better to get it early? (larger starting salary, increased promotability and credibility)


I am a college senior with 2 years of internship experience thinking about applying to Harvard 2+2, Yale Silver Scholar, and similar top ranked MBA programs that accept college seniors. 

The reasons why I want a MBA now (or in 2 years - early acceptance) from top school:

1. I have an engineering background and would like to work on the financial and strategy side of a corporation (can be banking, consulting, or other)

2. I would like to learn some accounting / finance basics and have a top MBA on my resume (alumni + reputation)

3. The industries that I am interested in are very male oriented (old boy's club culture) a MBA from a top school will help me stand out of the crowd in a large corporation or get my foot in the door for banking/consulting positions. All the people (unfortunately all men) that I know who are on a fast track to middle/upper management mentioned ""some mentor in a position of power"" who took interest in them very early on in their career. 

i.e., I want to be taken seriously as early on in my career as possible and it can be challenging sometimes as I am female. 

4. In the long run, I would like to run a company/financial side of a company

5. People usually apply after 2 years of work experience with little to no internship experiences. I already had 2 years of work experience (my internships were longer than 4 months)


About me:
1. I have no student debt from undergrad as I worked 2 jobs during school + well paid internships.
2. Always knew that I wanted an MBA and it's just a question of when to get it.

I currently live in Eastern Illinois but am open to relocating. My eldest child will start school in a couple years so my wife and I figured this would be the perfect time to look at going somewhere different.  

Here is a quick list of areas/technologies in which I am experienced:

- Policy writing

I do some light programming, mainly creating watchdogs or extracting from databases to flat files.

I am familiar with common best practices like parameterizing your SQL.  

While I've been in Team Lead roles, continuing that is not a requirement for me. I am perfectly fine with being a strictly technical resource.  

Also, if I can't grow a beard and work for you, I don't want to work for you. I have been forcibly beardless for four years now. If I am going to change jobs I am going to get my beard back in doing so."

Currently, we are casual friends and still getting to know each other. I've given her a few compliments/hints here and there but don't think they were that suggestive of me being romantically interested - told her that I loved talking to her, and she said the same thing back for example. However, there's a few things I need some advice about.

1. She's in a long distance relationship. I have no idea how close they are and don't know whether or not to bring it up. With Valentines Day coming up, I'm sure she must feel a bit lonely?

2. Two of my other coworkers are also interested in her. If I were in her position, I think personal space would be much appreciated.       

3. Age difference. I believe our age difference is not a big deal at all, but not sure what her opinion is.

4. She is looking for an internship and will be leaving the job soon, so I might not have that much time left.  


With these things considered, all I really want is for her to be happy. I don't want to create any unnecessary pressure or stress for her. Right now, I think my plan is to become better friends with her and ask to hang out casually. What are your opinions? "

I'm currently doing something that some people may consider immoral. Stringing along one company in order to use them as leverage to bargain for a higher salary for the job I really want. 

I've been at a company A as an intern, on and off for about a year. It's in an exciting new field, network security penetration testing. They are willing to teach me 100% about networks, plus finding and exploiting vulnerabilities. The atmosphere is great, and I really enjoy the work there.

However, I am also aware that the starting salary for an associate is pretty low for the industry. About 50K. When I make the transition from intern to full time, I want a backup offer to use as a bargaining chip. In a perfect world, I'd like to start at a number closer to 70K - 90K. I have 5 years of internship experience, good grades, and I come off well in interviews, not to sound too full of myself. It's never been hard for me to find job offers. I graduate next quarter in CS. My interest is primarily in network security, even tho I'm a programmer currently.

Well known entertainment company B has been interested in me for quite some time. I interviewed for an internship position about nine months ago, and although I didn't get it (A friend of mine got the offer, a returning student who had much more applicable experience. No worries, I still had company A.) The person who interviewed me kept in touch, however, and I visited the offices a few times and discussed security stuff. I believe the fact that it was the person in charge pinging me, rather than the reverse, was a really good sign. Now, he has referred me to a full time position, with the expectation that I will apply, and asked me to meet with the VP and him for an interview. 

Company B would probably have a starting salary of 75K, which might sound great, but, I cannot realistically take the position because I have a significant other who wants me to move in after college, and they live 200 miles away. I haven't asked, but it doesn't look as though remote work is possible, especially not for newbies like me.

Should I apply for the offered position at company B, and meet with the VP without any intention to accept? Or will they be insulted and trash my reputation? Has anyone else been able to use offers to gain a more advantageous salary offer? I definitely want a real offer to bargain with at my current job.

2vdh5u,9,2015-02-09,TIFU by accidentally picking up a guy,inspiredman,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2vdh5u/tifu_by_accidentally_picking_up_a_guy/,"It is around this week that this incident happened two years ago, so I thought I'd share with you all!

When I first moved back to the city of my college days, most of my friends were already gone or in relationships. I had one Russian friend that was still in school and wanted to hang out with me.

My Russian friend and I would hang out almost every day, so we became very close bros. He was very supportive of my goals and we had a lot to talk about. That being said, we were very different. While he worked out all the time and valued being a ""man,"" I spent my spare time reading books and encouraging him to explore the city with me. Our values often clashed, but we both encouraged the other to explore new things and re-think our paradigms about life and people.

One of the things that we both agreed on was that we needed to branch out and meet new people. However, the problem was that my Russian friend was the stereotypical American image of a Russian. He said what was on his mind (with his thick Sochi Russian accent). He never cared if his words hurt people's feelings. He was also extremely loud and obnoxious around people that he didn't like. He really had to know you for him to open up and show his cool side. This characteristic of his meant that he was not the best person to make good impressions on strangers.
On the flipside, there was me. Talking to everyone and seeming like I was way too nice. So I made sure to do most of the talking if we did meet someone cool that could become our fourth member (Russian guy had one other friend who'd sometimes hang out with us).

So one day, we were out shooting a video. After we finished, we ended up stopping by a Cosi's near campus to get some dinner. The staff at the Cosi's and I really hit it off, and we were all laughing and talking about funny stuff while I was ordering. I realized that they could become some of our new friends. So I exchanged numbers with them after telling them that I was looking for more people to hang out with our little group.
When we were leaving the Cosi's, I saw another worker sitting outside, taking a smoke. I don't think he was inside when I was bonding with the other staff members, but since the interaction with the other Cosi's staff went so well, I decided to exchange contact with him too. Another new friend, right? So I went up to him with my Russian friend and told him the same thing that I told the other workers in the restaurant.

So he gave me his number and I texted him mine.

When we walked off, my Russian friend uttered to me one of his trademark utterances.

""You know that guy is gay, right?"" he said. ""He thinks you're hitting on him.""

I assumed my Russian guy was just being mean to a guy like he usually is with most people. He, being Russian, thinks of most effeminate guys are ""gay."" The guy he was calling gay was kind of a skateboarder-looking dude, so he wasn't a big, bulky Russian-looking person.

""I don't think so,"" I told him. ""And even if he were gay, so what? I made it clear to him that we were just looking for more people to chill with.""

So all the other workers at Cosi's got back to me immediately with standard texts like, ""Nice to meet you! Let's definitely chill sometime."" But this worker outside didn't text me his number immediately.

Two days later, when I was at my internship, I finally get a text from him.

""What do you want to do with your life?"" the text asks. At this point, I get a little suspicious. After all, whenever a guy gets a girl's number, he's always waiting two days before texting her. Being a guy, I've never been on the receiving end. Maybe I'm just overthinking and being biased by my Russian friend's words, I thought to myself.

So I tell him about my internship and my long term goals to make the world a better place.

A few hours later, he texts me back.

""Chica please!"" he wrote flirtatiously. ""You can't make the world a better place by working at [the tv station I was at] ;) but I share your goals. I want to go into education.""

So I kind of laugh at this text, and I realize that my Russian friend was right. This guy, because he wasn't in the restaurant when I connected with the other Cosi workers, did get the wrong impression. This type of ""neg"" that he was doing is standard texting banter from a guy.

When I got home and told my Russian friend about this text, he just laughed for two minutes straight. Now, two years later, he still cracks up at this incident.

""That guy called you 'Chica,'"" my Russian friend always reminds me. ""He probably thought you were going to be on the bottom. You need to work out with me, dude! That'll stop these incidents.""

So as much as I wanted my Russian friend to be more politically correct with what he says, this incident that happened two years ago is always justification for him to continue his crazy Russian-talking.

TLDR: was trying to make new friends, but one of the guys texted me something flirtatious because he thought that I was gay."

This is nothing new, happens a couple times a year.  I'm so fucking sick and tired of it, though.

I've been depressed since I was 9.  I'm now 20.  Just when I think maybe it's situational and it goes away for good, it comes riiiight back.  I cannot afford meds, and am afraid of being dependent on them. 

My childhood was complete and utter shit.  Basically an only child (sister is almost 20 years older than me).  Grew up in a bad neighborhood and didn't fit in because I acted ""white.""  Mom single parent, came home from work and yelled every single day.  Beat me up sometimes, but it was mostly yelling.  Since middle school, our relationship has been rocky and shitty because of several circumstances that I don't want to go into detail about.

I now go to college in a different state (specifically because I wanted to get away from her and my home town.)  Lived with my sister until mom moved down here (my sister has a family, and so basically I was to live with my mom upon her coming down here because there was no room for me with my sister, and I'd kinda be intruding on her new life/family.)

Freshman and Sophomore year of college, I hated.  I hated my college, a small, expensive private liberal arts school with a lot of rich, snobby white kids and this whole ""if you don't get drunk on tuesdays or aren't a part of greek life, you suck"" mentality.  I drink and eat cannabis edibles on occasion, but these kids were just all day, err day turnt up.  Actually studying was like a joke to a lot of them.  Almost all the friends I made transferred out because they either hated it or couldn't afford it, so I set to hanging out with people who's company I didn't really enjoy or have anything in common with, or people I loved that were graduating seniors.  On top of that, I wasn't the most outgoing person due to social anxiety and a fear of vulnerability/getting close to others (both are pretty much nullified now, whoo hoo!)

Eventually, I transferred to another college, and I'm spending the first semester as a commuter at a school that I like a lot better.  A population of about 10,000 and a diverse student body.  And its really cheap, so you have the older people switching careers, the younger, poorer people of all racial backgrounds trying to make a life for themselves....and then the really obnoxious black kids who think it's the 13th grade, which reminds me of the people in my hometown who used to bully me for ""tryna be white.""  

My problem is that I'm living with my mother, in two-bedroom apartment, and I feel like I'm reliving my childhood all the way to the end of high school again.  She's trying to pretend that none of the things that happened in the past happened and is trying to be buddy-buddy, which makes me uncomfortable, which then makes her mad.  When she gets mad I remember who she was, and assume her niceness is a fake trick.  I don't really talk unless spoken to because I just can't imagine a normal, healthy mother-daughter relationship with someone like her.  Living with her is taking a toll on my mental health.

In the dorms, I was so happy and free.  Here, it feels so constricting.  I had a large refund check from my students loans, so I just got a car.  And I should be happy.  But I'm still broke.  I'm sleeping on a blow-up mattress in her ""office"", the 2nd bedroom.  My clothes are kept in two suitcases, and my shirts hung in the closet.  Thankfully, we have separate bathrooms.  

I'm a STEM major as well, which is already pretty darn stressful.  Already, I have had certain people try my intelligence based on the fact that I am black and female.  No, I'm not making assumptions.  I may get a job soon at a hospital, which I am eternally grateful for.  However, being a full-time student, doing part-time work, living with someone I resent, and having more and more expenses (car insurance, health and dental, gas, phone bill) pile up is making me feel like a crazy person.  And I'm getting fat.  I used to be hot (didn't really get hot and confident until college) and thin, and now I'm getting fat and it's driving me up a wall.  My cheekbones are gone and I have a baby face again.  I have love handles.  I have never had love handles before.  When I eat, even if its healthy, I want to throw up. When I look at myself in the mirror, I want to just die.  In public, I pretend to still be confident and comfortable in my skin, but since gaining weight that is not the case.  I used to work out a lot but stopped during my semester off.  I've been trying to work the treadmill back into my increasingly busy schedule.  Call me vain if you want to.  I have no problem with overweight people and don't judge people based on physical appearances, but their actions and behavior.  However, I, personally, am not comfortable being overweight and find myself disgusted at my naked body now.

I want to get an apartment/roommate soon.  Apartments in my state are CHEAP (we'd pay 200 each at least and 400 at most) but I'm afraid my job, IF I get it (about $288 per week, slightly above min wage) won't be enough, and I'll be forced to continue living with her (living on campus is reserved for freshmen and heavily competitive) or taking out more in student loans to get a refund check to survive off of.  I'm sick of being poor.  I'm sick of my living conditions.  I'm sick of being around my mother.  If this is what my life is going to be like up until the end of grad school, then I don't want to live.

I see old my friends from the private college living completely different lifestyles.  Going out to bars and concerts and lavish vacations, and completely free of struggle, and it just makes me feel like a piece of shit.  

For once in my life, I just want to not have to worry about anything.  I don't want anything handed to me, and I have no qualms against working hard in school and in the workforce, as I've done it already and continue to do it, but sometimes I just want to fucking be a 20 year old. What's the point of working and going to school for the rest of my life if I can't take a breather or reap the benefits?  I should be done with grad school in the next 4 -5 years...but by then I'll have a career and no free time.  

I can't drop out and quit my dreams, because all I have waiting for me is the projects.  I can't just magically shit out money or a good, nearby support system of friends.  My immediate family is nonexistent. Lately, I've been feeling like my only option is to kill myself.  Whenever something good happens to me, twice as many bad things happen.  Life doesn't owe me shit, but holy shit this is just a miserable life.  

After my teenage emo, woe as me phase in middle school, I started having a different outlook:  Think positive, work hard, and good things will happen.  And they have.  But it just seems like more bullshit keeps coming.  And usually, when the bullshit comes, I work my way around it.  I'll have my private mental breakdown, plan out my suicide, change my mind and then ignore my suicidal feelings, tell myself to buck up and make a plan from step a to z, and then follow through.  

This time is different.  No mental breakdown, no crying.  Just calm realization. I just really want to walk to my sister's house, take my bro-in-law's gun, and shoot myself in the mouth.  I'm having a hard time seeing hope.  I can't see a plan to follow.  Work part-time, study full-time, exercise 3-4 times a week, pay the rent, car, groceries, etc, intern for my grad school prereqs, have time for my hobbies, make real, long-lasting relationships, avoid my mom's bullshit, AND keep a sane head? Please give me the answer to HOW, least I end up the butt of one of Louis CK's jokes.

As I've gotten older and matured, I try really hard to keep the glass half-full.  I really do, and it usually works.  But there are moments when I just want to stop breathing.  This is one of those moments.  And these moments only seem to get worse when I'm on my period (TMI, sorry).  The days leading up to my period are the worst, because I just become a crazy person.  I can't see any good in the world or in myself anymore.  And I wish I could blame it on my hormones and the fact that my vagina is being an asshole right now, but I know deep down its me.  Usually, I get over it and keep a smile on my face.  But this is the most overwhelmed I've felt in my life, even looking back at my childhood. 
How do I stay positive all the time and not lose hope? I'm so fucking sick of this.

I feel like I'm going to end up like my mom: bitter, negative, unhealthy lifestyle, let go of personal hygeine and upkeep, a constantly complaining victim that's always financially struggling in a miserable career, no close friends or SOs.  I don't want that life.  I would rather kill myself then end up like that. And I'm afraid that no matter how hard I try to actively avoid that path, I will end up like her, and it scares me.  

I just really need someone to talk to.  Someone who has been in my shoes, and made it out alive and okay.  I just want to keep my head up and live a good life.  That's all I fucking want, without the mind-numbing self-doubt every other week.

I won't kill myself tonight.  I'll do my homework, and then turn my brain off and lie in bed til I fall asleep to Bob's Burgers or Hemlock Grove or something.  But at this point, there's no telling what I'll do to myself.  I feel like a zombie, so fucking stressed, but so fucking calm.  I know the storm's coming, because it always does.  I'll try and keep it at bay, but I just really need someone to talk to.  

I'm sick of writing and ripping up tear-stained suicide notes."
2vdo14,1,2015-02-09,Should I accept this IT internship?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2vdo14/should_i_accept_this_it_internship/,"I, as a current sophomore, finally received an offer for an IT internship in a large insurance company, but what I really want to get to in the future is low level systems (Think C++ and FPGAs) in a high frequency trading firm. It seems like although there are elements of working with these systems, I'm afraid that most of the work will involve managing these systems instead of actually practicing coding skills to excel in interviews at those firms in the future, which is important since I need to excel at those interviews to get into those firms.

I know that there's value in working in the real world and everything associated with that, but will it help me on my journey towards becoming an engineer at an HFT firm, or more urgently, landing an internship at one next year? It's important to note that I have another conditional offer that is a CS internship at a government agency, but the nature of the security clearance processing still leaves uncertainty on whether I'll really get it or not. I have to respond to this offer by this Friday, so some insight would be nice. Thanks all very much!

P.S. If anybody is so inclined, I'll PM you the info about the position and the company. Again, thanks."
2vdpet,2,2015-02-09,Inappropriate to contact hiring manager on Facebook?,soccerperson,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2vdpet/inappropriate_to_contact_hiring_manager_on/,"*not hiring manager but rather director of marketing lol

I'll bullet this to make it easier to read:

• Want to intern for MLS soccer club

• Found Director of Marketing on LinkedIn - She looks rather young, definitely under 30

• Can't contact on LinkedIn unless I connect first (I don't know her personally)

• Found her on Facebook

• We both have skiing/snowboarding photos - of course I would never mention this to her in message, but I would figure she'd notice this fact, and I know having similar interests with people in her position could potentially go a long way


So...

• Should I contact her through Facebook (first apologizing if it may come off as informal) and ask if there are any sort of upcoming internship opportunities? Would this be too creeper-status or would it be seen as taking initiative in finding her and looking for work?

• Or connect on LinkedIn (hoping she accepts) and contact her through that?"

 F*** Facebook! It always reminds me of how terrible my life is. Ever since I graduated form HS a year and half ago, I haven't accomplished anything. I went around in circles trying to figure out my life.. spent a year in retail job I despised, and now I'm in college still at it. I see all those relationship status updates from friends, people posting pics of their SO's, dogs, cats, kids, backpacking trips and so on... Every one is moving on from thier lives. It's like every body got horses and ponies and moved away.. while I just got a rocking horse that just goes back and forth. It's giving me the illusion that I'm moving when I am still where I am at. Ever since I moved from a small town to the city,  I haven't been able to maintain an old friendship, or make a new one. 




I wish I can delete my facebook... but idiotically it's connected to so many things, class groups, orientation group, updates from clubs and even interesting people I follow.. Even Netflix login is through facebook,  and I get the unwanted perk of getting news about all those people with amazing lives and engagements and internships and shit. Nothing have pulled me down as much this crap does. 


Now peace.."

I’m sad that all the good memories I had with you are tarnished. I’m sad when I think about that sunny fall morning we drove to Ohio on a whim to go to the zoo. I’m sad when I think about the time we watched that incredible sunset and that time that we ate fried Oreos for breakfast. I’m sad when I think about all the times you made me belly laugh. There were a lot of those times.
 
I am still so angry. I’m angry that I let you control my life and my choices and the way I felt about myself for as long as I did. I’m angry that you cut me down until I didn’t remember who I was. I’m angry that you would get physical with me when you didn’t get your way. I’m angry that you hit me. I’m angry that you showed up at my doorstep when I moved to a new city, I’m angry that you stole my keys and took my clothing, and I’m angry that you sort of got away with it. 

I am still so hurt, that you wanted to hurt me as badly as you did. And that you went through with it. 

I am so proud of myself for huddling in the bathroom and making that whispered call to the police, hiding as you banged on my door. I am so proud of myself for not taking it anymore. I am proud that I saw myself as someone who deserved better and who could have a life much more full and brilliant without you working me like your own marionette. 

I am so happy that I took control. I am so happy that I started getting in shape and taking care of myself. I am so happy that I read books for fun now, and I bought a plane ticket to Europe, and I landed a great internship that makes me excited to go to work every day. I am so happy that I have friends, more friends than I’ve ever had, who love me and understand me and will stick up for me in a heartbeat, and who will be silly with me, and who even make me belly laugh. 

I wish you the best. You’re not a bad person. But I am infinitely better off without you.

2vdwql,8,2015-02-09,"Washington, DC Metro Red Line, June 2012",CaptainFalco311,MissedConnections,https://www.reddit.com/r/MissedConnections/comments/2vdwql/washington_dc_metro_red_line_june_2012/,"Friday, June 29th, 2012. Washington, DC. I was only 16, but I was on the way home from the internship I had at the Department of Energy at the time. The summer heat and humidity had crawled underground into the Metro system, and it felt as if it was hotter in a dark, underground station than it was outside in the sweltering sun.

It was rush hour, and those who have taken Metro during rush hour know that if you expect to find a good seat--or any seat for that matter--you're better off waiting until at least 6 or so. I had boarded that Red Line train to Shady Grove at Metro Center, surrounded by people twice my age, some more. But I knew that the odds of me being the only teenage federal intern in the entire DMV were slim, and that there had to be at least one other person out there who could sympathize with my uniqueness. And when the train reached Dupont Circle, I found her.

At least, I think it was Dupont Circle. It was almost three years ago, and while some details have gotten fuzzier, there is one image that will never leave my mind for the rest of my life: her starry brown eyes that drove into me with the power of a jackhammer. She stepped onto the train on the door opposite of where I was standing, and as soon as I saw her eyes, I was mystified. 

The music that I was listening to dulled to an inconspicuous hum. I was getting nervous. I fidgeted around with myself a little bit, playing with my sunglasses, playing with my headphones, loosening my tie, rolling up my sleeves, yet as awkward as I looked, we just stared into each other's eyes, silently. Yet in that silence were so many words. She was expressionless, and so was I. But we were just confounded by each other, getting high off of our youthful innocence that, while being masked by my shirt-and-tie and her little black dress, was so blatantly obvious. Her brown hair, parted to the side, sagged while we were both lost in each other. 

We didn't say a word.

The train reached a stop--I want to say Grosvenor-Strathmore--and like an abrupt alarm waking you up from a dream, she snapped out of it and got off of the train. By the time I had snapped out of it, it was too late for me to get off of the train and try and talk to her. I continued on to Twinbrook, and I got off myself, silently lost on my way home from there.

For weeks, I would intentionally wake up earlier and get off at Dupont Circle. I would sit and watch the trains go by one after the other while waiting. I never said a word. I had some close calls, but none were her. And although I knew instantly that she was the most beautifully dazzling woman I had ever met in my life, I forced myself to let it go. I could sit and wait at Dupont Circle for as long as I wanted to, but the chances of me seeing her again were slim to none. I had to move on. I tried, even though the thought of her passes my mind at least once a day.

I was wearing a white dress shirt that day, with Wayfarer-esque sunglasses and these big, ugly white and grey plastic Sony headphones. I'm 5'6"", and you were 5'0"" at the *very* least. You were wearing a v-cut little black dress with your brown hair, in a ponytail parted to your left.

Valentine's Day is coming up. If you're out there, let me know. I want to take you to lunch or dinner or a movie or, hell, even coffee. I want to meet you, once and for all. "
2vdxhx,16,2015-02-10,"""You Do NOT Want To Mess With Me""...",jake429,TalesFromTheTheatre,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheTheatre/comments/2vdxhx/you_do_not_want_to_mess_with_me/,"Usually I lurk around on the /r/talesfromretail sub, but I started looking around here... and I love you guys.

As a quick preface, I work retail, am a culinary school student, and worked game days at a NFL stadium. And, since I wasn't crazy enough, took a part-time gig as a cook in a small pizza chain a large Midwestern movie theatre company was expanding. Pay is what you would expect from a movie theater (read: horrible), but I really enjoyed my job and the people I got to know there. 

Well, that and the fact that if a pizza crust would break, I would show off my culinary skills to the concession guys. You would not imagine how many high school kids hated tomatoes until I made them a pizza Margherita (not on the menu, of course)

This may give the chain away, but Tuesdays and Saturdays were our biggest sales days of the week. Tuesdays are big because they offer discounted admission, and Saturdays, because, well... It's Saturday. This happened on a busy Tuesday night. I was slinging pizzas and fixing beer taps (we sold beer and wine, too; I got a $5 tip for pouring a ""perfect"" tap for a Chicago customer), when we got into the mid-show slump. Sometime between 7:30 and 9PM there's a slump when all the screens are showing films and no one is in the lobby getting popcorn or pizzas, and we end up popping fresh corn and cleaning our pizza-making line. I was standing by my register when a guy (NC for Nut Case) comes over to me, and the exchange went something like this:

Me: Can I help you, sir?

NC: You were talking shit about my daughter. How dare you.

(NOPE. Me and one of the ushers were talking about gas mileage in cars and hybrid usage, no female talk of any kind)

I was a bit flabbergasted...

ME: Um, I'm sorry, sir?

NC: You know DAMN well what I'm talking about. You two were over here talking shit about my daughter, and I don't like it. AT ALL. You don't want to mess with me. I am not a nice man to deal with.

ME: Um, I believe you were mistaken, sir, we were not saying anything of the kind.

NC: DON'T FUCK WITH ME. I HEARD YOU.

ME: (By this time reason and logic have fled the coop, I need to call in the Marines). I'm sorry to hear that, sir. Let me call over my assistant manager.

NC: Yeah. Bring him over. He probably was talking shit about her too.

Now, before I took the theater job, I worked retail at a big box store, and have graduated from the Retail 101 course ""How To Deal With Bat-Shit Crazy Customers"". The first rule is to take small steps backward to make sure you are (at least) outside fist-throwing range. Second, take a quick whiff of the air to see how loaded/high/stoned this guy is (I've never toked or touched marijuana before, but after working concessions at my theatre, I can smell a high 17-year old a lobby away). The guy didn't smell like weed or alcohol, so now I'm thinking he got a few pills mixed up in the morning. Therefore, I grab my trusty walkie-talkie and ask my awesome Star Wars-tie wearing Assistant Manager (ASM) to come over. Not only is this guy a cool nerd in his 40's, he's got a Masters Degree in counselling and conflict resolution. Win.


ASM: Whassup?

ME: This gentleman would like to--

NC: These guys-- All you-- People here were talking shit about my daughter. How dare you. Everyone here-- uh-- these guys (gestures at me and the usher) were calling her fat and being disrespectful and talking shit about her and, and, her dress was ugly...

ASM: Hmm. Is that so? Were you here when they said those things?

NC: NO! I WAS NOT!! (Calms down) I was not. But my daughter was, and I believe everything my little girl says...

ASM: Well, sir, I was near here for the past 30 minutes and I didn't hear anything wrong... What were you guys talking about?

ME: We were just talking about cars and hybrid cars. Nothing else. Could it have been that someone in the lobby was saying something, sir?

NC: I'm telling you f**kers it was YOU!

ASM: Sir, I don't appreciate the kind of language you are using. I need you to please calm down, or I'll have to ask you to leave.

NC: Da f**k I will! I'm just telling you this: you do not want to deal with me; I am not a nice man to deal with.

And with that, he takes his beer belly and Grateful Dead T-shirt and heads into the theatre showing Annabelle.
We all look at each other with ""%)*&amp;$*???"" on our faces.

ASM: Well, I'm keeping an eye on him.

ME: Yeah: sneak in there and see if he actually has a daughter...


To make a long ending short, we know when the showing ends for each feature. Me and the usher decided that him not seeing our faces was the best solution to the problem, so we sat in the hallway behind the concession stand for a few minutes until the ASM gave the all clear. He and two other lobby ushers stayed out in the lobby to make sure he left without causing a ruckus (which he did), and that he left with his ""daughter"", which he also did. Never said another word to anyone in the theatre.


Sorta let-down ending, I know, but they (evidently) have had to deal with much worse before I was hired, so this must've been par for the crazy course for the month.
I've since quit the theater, because my schooling has gotten more involved and I've had to take on an internship at said NFL stadium, but I still occasionally go back to say hi and get a free bag of popcorn."

   ""That's it, I fucking quit!"" Ninja Steve ripped his ninja balaclava from his head.  
   ""What?"" Ninja Paul exclaimed. ""What are you talking about? You can't quit being a ninja! What are you going to tell Sensei?""  
   ""I don't care. What do my years of training mean when this guy can see through walls!""  
   ""See through walls? That's not possible!""  
   ""It is! He knew I was there!"" Ninja Steve threw the balaclava on the floor in anger. ""Let's just face it, we're no match for those types!""  
   ""What types?"" Ninja Paul leaned in close, dropping his voice to a whisper. ""Was it a samurai?""  
   ""Worse, far worse.""  
   ""How? What could possibly be--""  
   ""Computers! How do you fight a 9th dan software engineer!?""  
Ninja Paul's face went white, shivering at the thought. ""You were sent to kill...a software engineer?""  
   ""I didn't know it at first. They told me he was just an intern. I've killed hundreds of interns, and never left so much as a fleck of blood on a keyboard. But...my god, Ninja Paul, he could _see through walls!_""  
   ""But you made it out alive.""  
   ""Barely. He was hiding in a datacenter, and nearly trapped me in the halon fire suppression system.""  
   ""My god..."" Ninja Paul stared at Ninja Steve gravely. ""There truly is no honor among software engineers. Death by suffocation?""  
   ""I thought if I could cut him off from his computer, he would be helpless. But he was prepared...how do you cut the wires on a wireless keyboard?"" Ninja Steve buried his face in his hands.  
   ""OK, so you can't take this guy on alone. But that's no reason to give up. You're a ninja, Ninja Steve! You just need to regroup."" Ninja Paul picked up Ninja Steve's balaclava and put it in his hand. ""Come on, buddy, mask up. You've got a software engineer to kill...""  
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
Back in the datacenter, the software engineer leaned back in his rolling chair, observing the conversation on his computer screen.
   ""Heh heh,"" laughed the software engineer, pulling his headphones off. He closed the video camera feed, chuckling to himself and reaching for his bag of Doritos. ""Keep trying, Ninja Steve. You'll never outsmart my C++...""  
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
But elsewhere, the software engineer was himself being surveilled. A shadowy figure observed the monitor in silence, while his lackey glanced uneasily between him and the monitor.  
   ""Sir, forgive me, but...I don't think Ninja Steve has what it takes to kill the software engineer.""  
   ""It is no matter. It was never our intention for Ninja Steve to succeed.""  
   ""Then...why?""  
   ""He is simply the distraction."" The shadowy figure leaned forward, his nerdy, spectacled face being illuminated by the monitor. He turned to the lackey, a devious grin growing on his face. ""Soon, we shall strike, and the world shall know that _computer science_ is the one true field!"" He cackled loudly, and a thunderclap in the distance underscored the line.

2ve0oq,5,2015-02-10,I am slowly losing my sanity.,random573,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2ve0oq/i_am_slowly_losing_my_sanity/,"edit: wow that is long, you have no obligation to read that lol

Well here goes..

I graduated last year with a math degree, econ degree, physics minor. Graduated with a 3.9 gpa, all A's in all of my degrees, 169 credit units when i only needed 128 to graduate. Junior year I made $20k investing in/trading bitcoins, Senior year I made $60k+. I taught myself a lot of finance while learning to invest.. index funds, p2p loans, I have been very successful investing over the last 5-10 years now, starting with less than $10.

Then i graduated college with no debt (math scholarship), started to apply to jobs. As an introvert people always told me that I do not say much, but what I say is usually important. I am also very honest. Anyway, almost none of the businesses I apply to even get back to me. If I do get an interview I have absolutely no idea how to BS the answers. I cannot look someone in the face and tell them ""5-10 years from now my goal is to be sitting in this office making a fortune for you"" I have many passions, interests, I really do not know what I want to be doing in 5 years. That being said, if I say ""I can learn how to do X,"" or ""I will do Y"" I really mean that I will do it. I have a tendency of trying to be the best at whatever I do so if I have any doubt at whether or not I can be quite literally one of the best in the world at something I will come off as sounding unsure. So I never actually get offered a decent job. I did a temp job for 2 weeks because my parents said I should take it - then they offered me a full time job. However the only thing that job entailed was filing papers. I figured that since I had a financial cushion and did very well in school I could afford to take longer to find something better than filing papers. A couple months later I got an internship, but this did not lead anywhere. I also found out I am incredibly bad at office small talk, chit-chat, etc. - i may have a nervous breakdown in that environment. The internship ended like 1 month ago.

Now many of my friends told me I should take some of my bitcoin profits and travel the world for a year (I would try to do it as cheaply as possible so like $15k). This is the thing I would like to do the most and it would make me much better at socializing, but oh no, it's never that easy. My social anxiety has become much worse and my self esteem has fallen incredibly low that I have given up even discussing this with anyone. My parents, neighbors, extended family are starting to think there is something wrong with me; i honestly feel like they are starting to write me off as a ""free-loader"" since I do not have a job and still live at home. The 80 year old version of my self says to travel the world now while I can, but I just can't -- it is the same feeling all over again that I have every time I meet a girl I want to ask out but do not. It just makes me progressively more and more frustrated and destroys my self esteem even more every time I think about it. And of course my parents say ""well maybe when you get a job and are very successful a girl will let you take them on a date"". The only thing I can do in both scenarios is to stop pressuring myself so much.. which then just makes me look lazy.

And if I do not have the confidence to just say screw it I am going to travel for a little bit so that I am not permanently stuck with the emotional maturity of a 16 year old, I start planning on how to move out. Given the option between paying $1000 per month in paying rent and just buying a small apartment for $75k in cash, I would pick the latter. I would buy it on the premise that I would rent it out in the future if I did have to move for a future job. But I know it is stupid to tie all your money up in one asset like I would be doing, so I would try to get a loan for most of it and keep the rest invested (can I use other assets as collateral for a loan while I am not making much money?). But then I am told... if you want to make money in real estate i need to buy a duplex or fourplex. (which are much more expensive than $75k).The point wasn't solely for me to make money in real estate! It was so that I could move out and possibly make a little bit in real estate after I move out, without spending all my income on rent! But I know I wont move out because I can't live up the ideal of buying a duplex right now and my anxiety keeps me second guessing myself.

Now I am just all around confused, people look at me like I am crazy when I tell them I make some money trading bitcoins, my self esteem is progressively falling (probably some depression), i feel like my family is giving up on me, my ""dreams"" that are actually in reach are fading, and all of my resumes go unanswered.  I feel like I tied my self esteem up with getting good grades in school, and now I have lost that.

TLDR: I am losing my sanity and social anxiety does not make it any easier. Neither does over thinking every possible situation constantly day in and day out. I flip between feeling like I have done very well thus far and have a good future to feeling like an utter worthless failure, sometimes multiple times a day.

2ve4g8,1,2015-02-10,Summer Internship at ENP?,[deleted],chiangmai,https://www.reddit.com/r/chiangmai/comments/2ve4g8/summer_internship_at_enp/,"Hello!

I am considering doing a summer internship with Elephant Nature Park.

Anyone have any opinions as to why I should or should not?

I am born and raised in the United States and have not had many abroad experiences. I prefer rural areas over urban but love to travel everywhere.

The trip would be dependent upon a scholarship.

Any opinions?

If I come, anyone want to be my best friend?

Thanks in advance!"
2ve6ru,5,2015-02-10,"I've switched majors from English (3 classes away from AA) to ASW by 5/2017, BSW by 2020. Am I making the right choice?",geekerjoy1,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/2ve6ru/ive_switched_majors_from_english_3_classes_away/,"I'm mid 40's, recovering my life after a heckuva wrong turn (decided to do missionary work at age 20, found out at age 44 the ""charity projects"" I'd fundraised for were all fictitious), going back to college, plan to graduate at 52 with a BSW in 2020, and my kids'll be old enough to be home without me then, so I can find a job.  

In 1987, out of high school, I went to business school and certified as a travel agent, went to work for Amex.

Then at 20, I made that mistake I mentioned up there, and more than 2 decades later, and with 2 kids, I'm trying to get my degree finished off.

Travel agents are virtually obsolete nowadays, and the English major I was working off and on at since '94 (the requirements of the ""missionary"" work necessitated moving around so much.) just needs about 3 classes for the AA to be done with, then transfer to a 4-yr Uni for the BA.  Total time needed for the BA: probably graduate around 2018, 2019 and still need to wait a couple of years until my kids are legal to be at home without me and then I can look for a job.

I do NOT want to be a teacher, and there really isn't much of an interesting job market for English majors just starting at the bottom (secretarial, perhaps?) for a 50 year old.  But I like the classes for that major. Fun stuff.

Not sure I'd be able to find a job where I can sit around and read and write fiction and they pay me a living wage.

So I started taking a look at other majors, did some career assessments and it seemed like Social Work might be a good fit.

I like helping people (but I am so DONE with going the religious route there, go figure!), I had a rough childhood and have experienced social workers from the other side of the desk. I really like helping people, especially getting them back on their feet after some wrong turns (sound familiar?)

And social work seems to not be in danger of becoming obsolete: estimated 46% of current social workers are set to retire in the next 5-7 years, and social work is about to experience industry job growth - the government is expected to expand current aid resources to include more social workers' services.  Social workers are moving beyond the stereotypical government office: they're in hospitals, senior homes, schools, community liaisons, family therapists, etc.

Seems that at 52, when my kid situation allows for me to get a job, and I'll be newly graduated, that it might not be unreasonable to expect that it won't be too hard to find a job.  One that I can at worst tolerate, at best enjoy.

My GPA is 3.85 - Mostly A's, a couple B's.  Only history and math classes (ugh!) left for the general ed requirements, and at least the course descriptions for the ASW level of classes for Social Work seem pretty interesting. I've taken Cultural Anthropology, Cultural Geography, Sociology, Psychology classes and liked/am liking them.

I'm feeling daunted by the 95 internship hours I'll have to do next year in addition to the courses. 

**Have any of you been working/juggling motherhood while getting your BSW or ASW degrees? What was your experience like? Did you feel it was worth all the juggling stress when you graduated and got your first job?**

I'm also just a bit scared about the upper level courses.  They'll be much harder, and I'm worrying that it'll be stuff that's so out-of-my-depth for me that I'll make a mess of it and this will all have been a big, stressed, $$-wasted Wrong-Turn-2.0.

(The reason why it's going to take me so long to graduate is that I have to work around my kids' school schedule. Even with the afterschool care or teeny bit of summer camp at the Y that we can afford, to give me a little more schedule options, some of the ASW courses are so wonkily scheduled! Only 1 out of the next 6 semesters has a full course load. And I'm trying to juggle motherhood of twins (they're 7 now), one of whom needs therapy for ADHD and other things, and the classes.  Which is why I'm wondering if I'm making the right choice here. I think I am, but I just wanted to run it all by you here and see what you think.)

**TL;DR: Am I nuts for not taking the easy but mostly unemployable English major, and instead going for the BSW with job growth and better chance of a job that would be fulfilling, even though I'd be starting work at age 52?**

(Oh, and the advising office at my CC are useless. I've tried to ask for advice a few times there and all they could do was repeat rote phrases at me that had nothing to do with what I'd asked them about.)

Any advice, helpful hints, suggestions are appreciated, thanks! :D

**2/13 UPDATE:** Thank you all for your very helpful advice. I decided to switch back to the AA in English and this time visited the Counseling office (instead of the virtually useless Advising office) and the Counselor was SO helpful! She looked over my transcript and said that actually, to finish off the AA in English, I just needed 4 General Ed. classes and one English class, and coincidentally - that would ALSO finish off an AA in Liberal Arts and I'd have done a double major! She said that would look really good on my resume, so she submitted the paperwork for that :D

She also sat through the panic attack that was triggered by the thought of having to do an algebra course for the gen. ed. bits, and agreed that yes, probably something a bit easier was appropriate, so she also submitted her recommendation that I be allowed to take one of the easier maths, and she said the professor for that one was specifically hired because she had experience helping people who struggled greatly with math.

So if all goes well, I'll graduate with 2 AA degrees in June 2016!  

Thank you again, everyone! I really appreciate the help! &lt;3

I'm studying computer science but don't want to be a programmer.

Many people are impressed with how dedicated I am in terms of learning skills and dealing with responsibilities, but I still get rejections after rejections.

It's hard to find a job, I know, but seeing classmates getting fancy programming jobs where the companies shower them with money and babysit them from 9-5 is just so hard to look at right now. I don't browse Facebook or socialize with people in the computer department anymore. I just get more depressed.

I don't have big ambitions. I just want to finally be able to live on my own skills and wages, and live a dull but more financially independent life. I'm usually a happy and extroverted person, but this past 3 months of job hunting is starting to drain up all my energy.

Now graduation is near, and as a foreigner, I'll get kicked out of the country if I still can't find a job 2 months after that. I feel like a loser and gradually losing interest in life in general. This northeastern snow is not helping at all either."

I know projects are a big thing, but one thing I don't see people talk about is certificates.

If you are comparing multiple candidates, all with a bachelor/diploma in software development/computer science, with similar past internships, similar everything, how much weight do a few certificates have?

Specifically I am looking at some .NET certification or similar. I am also talking specifically about the programming/software development field.

I can't see them hurting, but some seem to cost money and/or are a time sink when the effort could be put into something else. Curious on how much they matter to employers hiring students/new grads."

I lived in a big house with a lot of relatives. Life was Ok. I Got to secondary school (high school) and did  well within African standards. It was immediately set in Gold that I would do Engineering because engineers made a lot of money.

My Single mum saved up and sent me to Canada to study engineering 3 years after I graduated high school. I came here with high hopes and the future seemed bright.

Then it started, Everything that could go worse happened, from having nothing to eat on most days , homelessness and even getting a civil court case. I had to pick up various part time jobs to get by. My mom sends money to me to pay my tuition but its not enough so i have to work. I am sitting on a 2.94 Gpa because of various incidents i have had to deal with.

The silver lining for me was the co-op program in my course. I figured if i could get an internship, i would be able to save enough to help out with my tuition and help pay bills. But I am unable to even land an interview. The winter semester is half-way through and there's nothing in sight. I'm Learning SQL and matlab to pass away the time.

I absolutely love engineering and would do it again if i had to. I am very positive and i know i will eventually get a break, but its hard not to get emotional.

Well, I'm in my 3rd year of BMsC right now, and trying for Double Major in Phys Pharm, but I'm not sure how that's going to go, as my marks are to say the least, crap. They've been crap for the last 3 years. It seemed straight off the bat from first year, no matter how much I studied, I just couldn't show the results of my effort and as a result am hovering borderline 60s in some of my module courses. Now I know that 60s is the standard to pass, so yay, but not yay, its fucking 60, why should I be happy about a 60. Maybe I have motivational issues and thats why I can't bring myself to try more harder, but last night as I lay in bed after receiving my 59.7 that I got on the recent Phys 3120 midterm, I realized my university career is going down the drain, and might be too deep to salvage, but nonetheless I'm going to put forth everything I have to try and bring whatever I have left of this year and semester back up to a respectable level.

I'm enrolled in the 3391 Science Internship program this year, and I used that as a crutch to make myself believe, that If I get a position working somewhere, I could secure myself a job in the future, regardless of how shitty my GPA is, but now that I'm actually applying to multitudes of these places, I'm seeing that even then, my GPA is important, despite what all these ""GPA doesn't matter after you get a job"" articles I read, and I worry that I won't even be able to land a job, and that these 3 years of school have been for naught.

So I ask of you Reddit mustangs, if any of you have had experiences where it feels like you're sinking and are a lost hope, if there is anything you did to salvage your university life. And I ask of any experts, who know of any way to turn this around to help me. 

Thanks in advance

EDIT: OP, again, I gave it a day to let the comments build up and read them all at once, and thank you everyone for your assistance. Everyone reassured me and everyone gave me multiple options that I can do/try out, and i truly thank all of you. I'll do my best to bring my marks up so I wouldn't have wasted your time, maybe retake some 3rd year courses to bolster my important marks, look into some masters programs. Thanks everyone."
2vf5hm,12,2015-02-10,It's worth it!,papiepie,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/2vf5hm/its_worth_it/,"Hi all !

I just wanted to share with you my LDR experience. My boyfriend and I started dating early 2012, when we were both about to graduate from junior college. I was determined to go abroad to university, and we'd been together for almost six months when the trial began and I moved abroad. 

And man it was tough. There were so many issues and so much drama. At times I wasn't sure this was the right thing to do, keeping up an LDR is hard work and we hadn't been together for that long. But we'd been friends for years and we had an amazing connection. We want the same thing for the future. Basically, everything was perfect, apart from the distance. 

But distance can be a lot! We started talking to each other on Skype for hours a day and one day I realized I  had no friends in the new country, only acquaintances because I spent most of my free time on Skype. We tried to fly back and forth as much as we could afford (4-5 times a year) and spent holidays together. But time together could be hard too. There is so much pressure to enjoy every minute and too spend every second together, and the shift from not seeing each other for months and talking to each other while the other person pees is overwhelming.

But this post isn't about the tough times! It's about the reward. After two years apart, I found a way to do an internship in my home country and get it evaluated at the university. And finally, I moved back home and my bf and I found a lovely tiny little apartment to rent in the best part of the city for a great price. 

We've now been living together for 8 months and everything is just wonderful. All the drama has evaporated from our relationship, we live together but are both very busy with our different things so we spend a healthy amount of time together. My internship has come to an end and I'm now working on my final thesis from home and mostly keeping in contact with my supervisor via email and Skype. 

I know this isn't the most interesting post on this thread, but I just wanted to tell you guys that it can be worth it. It can work out wonderfully, like it did for us. We even got a cat!

Oh, and spending so much time with such weird relationship dynamics can really put things in perspective. Like, when we argue over dirty laundry and who's turn it is to do the dishes, we're also really happy that we finally reached a place where we Can Argue Over Household stuff. It's really nice. 

I wasn't the strong one in the LDR and sometimes I really wasn't sure it would work out. But it did, and I'm so happy that I didn´t give up, because now I feel like I'm living the happily ever after of a Disney movie. I'm writing this as I'm sitting at the library at my university, as I'm away from my bf and home country for a week to meet with my supervisor and tie up some loose ends. The distance that once seemed so impossibly vast now feels so easy too handle. The town that I once resented for representing the lack of what I wanted is now the place where my relationship grew and I'm enjoying meeting my friends from school (yes, I eventually made friends).

I'll be back home in two days and I'm looking forward to it, but it's not eating me up on the inside that I'm not there yet, like it used to. Our relationship is much healthier and nicer now, and I hope all of you will get to experience your own happy ending one day.

Mainly, I was in charge of upgrading the office computers, either by upgrading them to Windows 7 or completely installing a new computer. I'd set the new computer up in the build room, transfer their files over the network, then replace the computer, leaving maybe ten minutes of downtime for user. Usually.

&gt;**Me**: ""Hi, I just wanted to find out, when could I replace your computer? I can do it when you're at lunch, if you want.""  
&gt;**Worker**: ""That would be great, I normally take lunch at 1.""

So, 1PM comes around, and I change out the computer without an issue. I go back to the build room to set up the next computer, until about half an hour later.

*Knock knock knock knock knock*  
&gt;**Me**: ""Hello?""  
&gt;**Worker**: ""You replaced my computer and none of my files are there!""  
&gt;**Me**: ""Let me take a look. If something went wrong I have your old computer here.""  

I follow her back to her desk, and she sits down, pointing at the screen, with her Documents folder open.

&gt;**Worker**: ""See, they aren't there! [Folder 1] and [Folder 2] aren't there!""  
&gt;**Me**: ""They're right here.""  
&gt;**Worker**: ""That's not them!""  

At this point I'm starting to question myself. Did I make empty folders? Is she missing her files? Nope, they're all right there.

&gt;**Me**: ""These aren't your files?""  
&gt;**Worker**: ""No, these aren't them.""  
&gt;**Me**: ""Okay, let me go plug your old computer in in the build room.""  

I go off, and plug her old computer into the network. I decide to get a cup of coffee quickly, and ask the other intern to go take a look so I can make sure I know where her old files are. I head back, and find my fellow intern and the worker arguing. He didn't have as much patience for this situation.

&gt;**Intern**: ""Your files are right here.""  
&gt;**Worker**: ""Those aren't my files, or my folders. I need my files or I can't work.""  
&gt;**Intern**: ""But they're right there.""  
&gt;**Me**: ""Can I sit down for a second?""

I bring up Remote Desktop, and bring up Windows explorer on her old computer, side by side with the documents folder on her new machine. We sit there for ten minutes, opening and comparing files, showing her they are the same. Exact. Files.

&gt;**Me**: ""See, they are your files.""  
&gt;**Worker**: ""No they aren't, why do you keep saying they are. They have the same information, but they're not mine!""  
&gt;**Me**: ""Wait... What?""  

I look at the two computers' folders, and back at her blankly. She just said it's the same files, but they're not her files. I'm at a loss, until I notice the one difference between the two.

Her old machine had Windows Explorer set to Large Icons, and the new computer had the default as Detail."

Obviously, the more relevant experience, the better though.  You should come into this expecting and wanting to learn a lot quickly.

Other skills (in descending order of importance) that you can either learn if you're interested, or may help you if you already know them:

* Ruby on Rails, or at least Ruby

I'm a UI/UX intern and helped release an app awhile ago. I would love some honest feedback on all of it. 

The app is a lockscreen for Android that allows you to push photos and messages directly onto other Android lock screens. I envisioned this being used like Snapchat by being used to send funny photos. Some initial reactions I got was it would be great for trolling or for very private use with close friends and family. I'm trying to decide who to design for as well as how to figure out the UX components. 

Again, any and all feedback would be great! I'm crazy to know if I helped create something people would actually use.

Today I saw some recruiters at a career fair who said they've already started looking for summer interns. Should I go ahead and reach out now, or wait until March?",DickCheeseSupreme,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2vg1ul/a_company_told_me_to_reach_out_to_them_in_march/,"**Some back story:**

A couple months ago, I applied for a Summer Internship position at a company and got an interview.  The interview went amazing, but there was only one hang up: While they acknowledged the job posting clearly stated this was a *Summer* position, the company had run into an unforeseen problem, and to help solve it they wanted to bring in some interns for the Winter/Spring.

At that point I had already signed up for classes, bought books, etc., and for a few reasons which I won't get into now, I generally would *not* like to delay getting my degree any further.

The company was extremely understanding and even told me they believe education should come before anything, which surprised me. 

After the initial interview I sat down with the Director of Talent Acquisition and Engagement, and she told me the company would still be interested in me this summer, but that they currently must focus on the immediate problem, which included hiring someone for the Spring. 

This is where she told me to call her ""around March."" 

**The current situation:**

Today there was a career fair at my university, and low and behold, this company had a table there! I didn't recognize the recruiters, so I introduced myself, chat for a bit, gave them my resume. I told them this whole story, and they confirmed that they were indeed looking for Summer interns now.

Here's my dilemma. If they're looking for interns *now*, I don't want to wait another month to reach out. I did another application for their Summer position when I got home from the fair, but I still want to call my contact at the company.

Would it be bad for me to call her ~3 weeks before she initially told me to, in this situation?

**Edit:** I realized this doesn't sound specifically like a Computer Science-related issue, but I am a CS major, and the company is a software company."

First, let’s talk minors. Do employers really care that I have a minor? If so, what type of minor would be most beneficial? I was thinking digital media would be a safe bet but I honestly don’t know.


My school offers seven different certificates within the marketing program. These include entertainment marketing, healthcare marketing, retailing marketing, selling and sales management, services marketing, sport marketing management, and e-marketing. Which of these would be most useful in general?


I keep seeing that marketers need to be proficient in HTML, Excel, Photoshop, etc. to be successful. Where can I learn these skills, preferably for free, on my own? Any additional skills that would be of value?


Lastly, internships. Since I haven’t had any marketing courses yet, should I even try to look for internships? I live in a suburban town of ~50,000 people so they would be hard to come by as is.

Any additional information or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance!

I have bachelors degree, internship, and student work experience related to what I want to do. And a good portfolio!

I finally cave and apply for some internships. I got an interview today for one. Woke up and threw up. Trying some medication for my bladder problems i am having (possible disease/possible allergy) and that definitely set it off.

I powered through and got ready anyways. I show up to the place, and they are totally unprepared and asked like 4 questions. They seemed uninterested and said ""get back to you in 2 weeks."" holy shit I could find anther job by then. 

So then i walk out to my car, and the door is frozen shut. I live in NE Ohio, mkay. I walk back in to ask to use phone to call AAA (i left mine in car) and the interviewer sees me. So I am def fucked on that job. Had to explain quickly, apologize, and call. The secretary sympathized. I tried not to let it bother me. Maintenance guy outside helped me unlock door. I was like cancel AAA and booked it out.

Throw up on way home.

Phone interview a couple hours ago for a similar position. Asked the most moronic questions that I basically covered in my cover letter. They seemed put off by my salary requirements (i basically gave lower than i want to get a job) and my drive (it's like 40 min idc).

basically, today has been shit, and I have $12 until Friday. Also, my grandma is dying from lung cancer, and my bladder hurts.

tl;dr:threw up before and after interview, locked self out after interview, horrible interview experiences, dying for a job"

So usually when I smoke it is purely for fun. I wait til the weekend after finishing all my school work and do it casually just as people would drink on the weekends. But this week I decided to do an experiment where I would do it during the week when I have school and homework. I wanted to see how much it would actually effect me when I have important responsibilities whether it be in a good way or bad way. I figured I would be extra lazy as that is usually how it makes me feel when I do it during the weekend. Actually the exact oposite of that happened. I was so productive, even more than I would be normally. I was so focused on what I had to get done. I structured all the work I had to finish for the week in a to-do list, finished my duties for my internship for the week, and was just generally happy about doing good work rather than normal where all I do is dread that next assignment I have to work on. I spoke up more than usually in a discussion based class with creative ideas that I normally would have kept inside. I thought a lot about my career path and decided that I need to start being more active in internship and job searches as I am graduating in a few months, and emailed a few out of state internships. I was just able to see the academic and professional sides of my life through a different lens than I usually do and it worked wonders. Normally all I am thinking about when I smoke is playing video games, eating, or just hanging out with friends. I never realized how helpful it could be in other settings. 

Sorry to drag on, and if you've read this far, thank you! I just wanted to share how much this little experiment I thought of helped me in areas of my life where I struggle with and knew I needed to improve, even though it was a small step, its something I wouldn't have normally done. Smoking was able to give me a different more positive perspective on these important parts of my life!

TL;DR - Decided to smoke during the week when I have responsibilities - positive outcomes!"

-Get decent grades(3.5GPA)(Neat course load)

-Succeed in talking to professional people(They seem to like me and claim I make a good impression on them.)

-Have a summer's worth of experience working at a convenience store. My co-workers and employers both seemed to have a very good experience with me.

My main interest lies in lower level electronics/computing but I feel like it might be easier to start out with a programming job that isn't in C.

C++ would be a pretty obvious extension I guess. I've heard Lua has really good integration with C so that could be useful, but it's not that big yet. Python is apparantly simple to pick up but I'm not sure how useful it would be in the grand scheme of things. Same with Java. Or maybe I should just buckle down and try and get more proficient with C.

There's just so many options and I don't want to spend valuable time before interviews for internships in a few months on a language that won't be useful for me, so if anyone has any experience/advice to share I'd appreciate it!"

She will let any coworker do anything he wants to her anyplace and anytime, regardless of age, race, looks, or marital status. She dresses, acts, and talks like a slut.

I happen to be the official office slut where I work. My name is Jennifer and I'm 20 years old, my breasts are a perky 34B with an equally perky ass. Almost every guy in my building has fucked me at least once. I've even let a couple of 19 year old interns make me their property in my car during lunch. Ive always worn short skirts and thigh highs so the men have easy access to my cleanly shaven pussy and tight little asshole. Everyone knows I don't wear panties because of all the peep shows I give the men around the office. All a man has to do is call me into an office or bathroom and bend me over and spread my legs exposing my slutty married wet pussy and ass. 

All while I beg them to fuck me hard as they can and call me a dirty whore then they fill me with thick rope after rope of their portent cum. Almost every day I go home to my husband, cum dripping from both of my fuckholes If only he had any clue what happens when his wife is at work for the day. I want this RP to focus on all of my escapades throughout my average work day. From when I leave for work kissing my oblivious husband good bye, to when I leave the office wiping cum from my lips as I leave through the front door. If you want to add/change anything let me know. I'm always open to new ideas.

As a result, I've had to take the project they gave me and run wild with it.

I'm building a web application that searches a database (in the form of a JSON file) which is comprised of a series of arrays containing objects containing more arrays. At the heart of the mess is a file name which I search for in the directory, also JSON format, and contains the info necessary for the webapp. I have the search function and data-parsing/display working with JS and jquery.

My next step is to create a database from a few excel files and access that with the application to search for info related to the file that the original JSON file produced.

I don't have any experience with servers or databases and I'm really just looking for the quickest/easiest solution to this possible. I want to have something up and running so the tool is usable by the other engineers and then I can go back and implement something a little more maintainable or detailed ( I have a deadline for ""something workable""). I don't have time to do as much research as I would usually do in order to get this up and running in time.

After a little research I've come across PHP and sqlserver as possible solutions. Where I'm not really sure how to proceed is how I can implement the php with my JS and so forth. I assume I can just link to the php file in my html, but how can I relate the two things. Also, how do I relate the php and the sql database? 

Forgive me if I'm not making any sense. I've never done anything web related before this internship and I've been completely on my own teaching myself JS/jquery, html and css while simultaneously trying to make progress on this project. Any advice or alternate solutions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks "
2vgkry,3,2015-02-10,Need advice! Employee or working for family company?,aerox11,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/2vgkry/need_advice_employee_or_working_for_family_company/,"Hi guys I need your advice.

I have to decide the next 2 months which way I go regarding my professional career.

First I want to introduce myself. I am 28 years old and I am graduating from a Top 10 Business School in Germany.

Before I studied I did an apprenticeship with 16 as an industrial salesman and worked 8 years for this company in Germany and Spain. After that I went to university and did 2 internships in consulting and one in a big telecommunication company.

Now I am unsure about my future and I want to ask you for advice. I have following options

**1.  I do my master’s degree**

Pro:

+  I will gain new experience and knowledge. Can go abroad for one year

Contra:

- I have the feeling that I didn’t learn much how to run a business. SO maybe studying two more years is waste of time and I will be 30 when I am done…

**2.  I will start working now in sales or in consulting and don’t do the masters**

Pro:

+ I earn “good” money and I can “travel”
+ Work in consulting was fun I liked the tasks
+ Maybe I will have the opportunity to work in a different country like Dubai or Sydney? I like vibrant big cities :)

Contra:

- in consulting I worked a lot. Around 60-70 hours. Never be at home before 9 pm… (No time for sports, friends…)
- I will be an employee and work for someone else. At least for the next 5 years.
- I am 28 or 30 when i am done with uni and start as a junior consultant. Other people will be already senior consultants with the same age. Nobody care in consulting about my past work experience.
Maybe my age is an disadvantage to get a high position?

**3. I start working for my parents company**

We have a real estate developing company with around 30-40 apartments).We build and sell/ rent houses/apartments.
The company is small (Brother, mother and my dad). But there are many opportunities in my opinion to increase the business.

Pro: 

+ I like to be my own boss and be independent
+ the business is very interesting and I can generate a passive income. (My brother has already 3 houses and generates an extra income)
+ The business ran quite well the last twenty years and I would say my parents are wealthy
+ parallel to the business i could trade and get more knowledge about trading, My dad and me are passionate with trading at the stock exchange. And I could start a second business (import / export )

Contra:

- I have no clue about real estate developing business and had to learn everything from the scratch
- At the beginning I would get much less salary from my parents compared to consulting
- Maybe it is difficult to work with the family?
- I would be in a small town in south Germany not in a vibrant city like Dubai. But I could move to Munich which is just 30 min away from home.
-And the biggest disadvantage: I have never really said to my parents that I want to work for their company. My parents don’t know that I would like to work for them.   

**During my study i never said to them what i want to do after graduation. I always said we will see but my parents also never asked me if I want to work for them**
(maybe because they know I like to travel and discover foreign countries…) 

My feeling says I should work for their company but on the other side I miss the beach and foreign countries. (Lived in Spain, USA and Australia).

I am also aware if I don’t start working now for my parents it will be too late.
My dad is 60 and will get retired in 5 years I think. Furthermore I have to gain a lot of knowledge in this business to be successful.

Please give me some thoughts because right now I am not sure what I shall do.

How shall I speak to my parents that I want to start at their company?

2vgmae,194,2015-02-10,[F]ingering [m]y Intern: A story from the medical school days,drgoofy,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/2vgmae/fingering_my_intern_a_story_from_the_medical/,"Promised I'd post more of my exploits, and since people seemed to like the medical angle, here's one from way back in my medical school days.

I was on my first rotation, actually, doing inpatient medicine. I had an awesome team: my 3rd year resident was pretty much a super hero in my eyes, my attending was an old, wise Korean doctor with little skill for English but incredible talent in the physical examination, and there were two interns on the squad. One was pretty much completely inept with patients; this was fine because he was off to radiology after a year anyway. 

The other, I'll call her Margaret, was the picture of wit and compassion. She went to Best Medical School before her internship at our hospital, and you can tell she must have graduated from the top of her class. Her brilliance was probably 50% of why I was so attracted to her; she knew *everything*. The other 50% of my attraction came from the love she had for her patients and vice versa. She was one of those people who could defuse any situation and who could turn a horrible day into a bearable one.

Very little of my initial attraction for her came from her looks. She was tall (about 5'9"") and slim with long blonde hair, alabaster skin and ice blue eyes. She looked like she had just arrived from Sweden, basically. This isn't a look I'm typically into, and to be honest her face would never make the cover of a magazine. The first four days I saw her only in scrubs, which don't flatter the body, but on that Friday of the first week she had her afternoon in the clinic, and so I saw her in the morning dressed more professionally. Wearing a button-down blouse with a smart scarf, I got to see her great fashion sense and a bit of the curves that weren't visible in the harsh fabric of the scrubs. By the end of the week, I was basically head-over-heels for this girl.

As an aside, I go head over heels for a different person seemingly every day, but that's another matter entirely.

So we work together for near a month. I've never learned so much from another person and I find myself losing steam during her days off. But being on a team with her pushes me to do my best, and my attendings have all noted how hard I work and how much I know, especially for just being in my third year of medical school. None of those compliments matters compared to when she compliments me. My heart bursts. I'm 15 again.

Throughout that month, there is definitely some tension between us. We do look at each other frequently, and we went out for beers after work once (her idea, not mine). While there, we laughed and laughed. We talked about life, and she told me about her long-distance relationship with her medical student boyfriend (who still went to BMS). It wasn't working well, but she was trying her absolute best. The schedule of an intern is brutal, especially when you take the time zone change into consideration. She asked me for advice and I said I had none. Secretly, as awful as it was, I wanted them to fail. 

It was the second to last day we would have together before I would rotate to a different hospital. Since she was in the residency program of my medical school, there was always the possibility we would work together again (it actually did end up happening the next year, in the emergency department, and perhaps I will later post some of the stories from that time...), but regardless it felt like we would never see each other again. We kept making jokes that the hospital was divorcing us, and underneath the jokes -- at least for me -- was this forlorn longing that things could have been different if she didn't have a boyfriend. 

I had picked up two very strange patients that day, so I knew I'd be up late reading up on their diseases. I had made a recent affirmation that I would stop bringing my work home, so I decided to just stay in the team room in the hospital until I was done studying for the night. Margaret also was staying late that night; she was about ready to leave at 6pm, when one of her patients coded. They had revived the patient, but now they needed to escalate care in a big way -- and perhaps move her to the ICU -- which meant that Margaret had to stay to hold down the fort. Actually, the night float team would have taken over, but Margaret was fierce about her ownership of her patients and wanted to stay to take care of her. 

So it was just Margaret and I in the team room, at the small table right across from each other. Me looking up at her furtively from my book when I thought she wasn't looking, and her pretending not to notice. She didn't have much to do in terms of studying, and her patient was stable for the time being. She had been texting her boyfriend, but being three hours ahead, he had gone to bed long before. 

""Did I ever even ask you if you have a girlfriend?"" she asked, out of the blue.
""Haha, no, I don't think you did.""
""Oh my god, I'm such a bitch. I spent like an hour complaining about my relationship to you the other night and I didn't even ask you about your life at all!""

She had this complex look on her face, the mixture of a smile and an apology.

""It's totally fine! I have so little going on in my life that it would have been a 20 second story anyway,"" I responded, trying to put her at ease.
""Whatttt? No girlfriend? No hobbies? Nothing?""
""No, I mean I have *hobbies*, but no time really to do anything other than come to the hospital and go home and study, you know.""

I can tell she had marked the fact that I didn't refute not having a girlfriend. 

""I don't know what I would have done in medical school if I didn't have a boyfriend. Best way to work off all that stress.""
""Believe me, I know,"" I said, shooting her a pitiful but pregnant smile. 

She laughed at that, which made me feel great, but then sat back somewhat pensive.

""Isn't intern year supposed to be more stressful than medical school?"" I asked
""Yes, and I'm dying,"" she replied quickly, definitely not talking about the stress of her job. 

It felt like a comic book or a movie moment, the way we both just looked at each other right then. Both of us obviously considering the same thing. It was 11:30pm and nobody was about to come into this locked room without even a window. Certainly not her boyfriend.

The way she was looking at me, I knew what she was saying to me: ""I can't make the first move here.""

So I did. I leaned over the table and just kissed her on her lips. I could feel her whole body tense up at first then completely relax as she melted into it. It was an uncomfortable position with the table being the way it was, and she stood up out of her chair and came around to sit on my knee, not breaking lips the whole time. Kind of impressive in retrospect, actually. She was now on my knee with her head tiled and turned back to kiss me. 

We kept kissing and *man* she was a good kisser. Her tongue kept doing things that felt like she was just showing off her tongue skills. My hands instinctively came up to her (what must have been B cup) breasts and the moment I pinched the scrub material over her nipples, a loud sigh came from her mouth. I knew right then and there that my job right now was to make her cum. I've always been a giver, and in this moment a sense of duty came over me: she was so wound up, she had pretty much saved someone earlier in the day and she had certainly saved me on this rotation. She needed this and she deserved it. 

With one hand I glided up into her scrub top, under her bra and felt for her nipple. She squeaked -- clearly someone with very sensitive breasts. Awesome. With her other hand, I slowly ran it against her pant line once, twice, three times, each time forcing her to interrupt her kissing just to breathe and squeak. I took all of that as the go-ahead to continue, and I slid my hand into her scrub bottom and under her panties. I didn't encounter any hair at all, which to me was curious since I've found that usually girls will only shave if they're going to be sexually active, and got right to her warmth before I even knew it. She gasped again and pulled back from my face, giving me this almost desperate look. 

She didn't have to say anything. I ran a finger slowly up against her warm and already-wet pussy lips and her legs entirely tensed up. Her breathing got faster. Her eyes were dilated. She was in heat. I started to rub my finger around and around her clit, her reactions getting more intense with time.

""Inside"" was the one word she was able to get out, and I got my index finger inside of her while my thumb was still on her clit. Surgeon hands can do cool tricks, even before we know we're surgeons :P

This sent her through the roof. As I used my index finger to rub the ventral front side of the inside of her pussy she started to squeak faster and faster. I took my hand off her breast -- which had been alternating swirling around and grabbing her nipple -- and put it over her mouth to keep her more quiet. 

""MM CMMUNG"" she muffled through my hand and I felt her go entirely tense for what felt like 10 seconds before her legs began to essentially convulse, her back relaxed and arched again and again, and her breathing got more and more irregular. Even with my hand there, she was pretty loud. 

And then, silence. Relaxation. 

We began to kiss again. She got up off my lap and told me she wasn't comfortable reciprocating, and I was understanding of that; she just broke one huge barrier already, and deciding to break a second one (especially during post-orgasm remorse) would have been too much. She gave me a big smile and thanked me for understanding. 

I went home right afterward (I wasn't going to be able to study after that...) and had one of the better fap sessions of my life. "
2vgmja,0,2015-02-10,Consulting or working for family company?,aerox11,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2vgmja/consulting_or_working_for_family_company/,"Hi guys I need your advice.

I have to decide the next 2 months which way I go regarding my professional career.

First I want to introduce myself. I am 28 years old and I am graduating from a Top 10 Business School in Germany.

Before I studied I did an apprenticeship with 16 as an industrial salesman and worked 8 years for this company in Germany and Spain. After that I went to university and did 2 internships in consulting and one in a big telecommunication company.

Now I am unsure about my future and I want to ask you for advice. I have following options

**1.  I do my master’s degree**

Pro:

+  I will gain new experience and knowledge. Can go abroad for one year

Contra:

- I have the feeling that I didn’t learn much how to run a business. SO maybe studying two more years is waste of time and I will be 30 when I am done…

**2.  I will start working now in sales or in consulting and don’t do the masters**

Pro:

+ I earn “good” money and I can “travel”
+ Work in consulting was fun I liked the tasks
+ Maybe I will have the opportunity to work in a different country like Dubai or Sydney? I like vibrant big cities :)

Contra:

- in consulting I worked a lot. Around 60-70 hours. Never be at home before 9 pm… (No time for sports, friends…)
- I will be an employee and work for someone else. At least for the next 5 years.
- I am 28 or 30 when i am done with uni and start as a junior consultant. Other people will be already senior consultants with the same age. Nobody care in consulting about my past work experience.
Maybe my age is an disadvantage to get a high position?

**3. I start working for my parents company**

We have a real estate developing company with around 30-40 apartments).We build and sell/ rent houses/apartments.
The company is small (Brother, mother and my dad). But there are many opportunities in my opinion to increase the business.

Pro: 

+ I like to be my own boss and be independent
+ the business is very interesting and I can generate a passive income. (My brother has already 3 houses and generates an extra income)
+ The business ran quite well the last twenty years and I would say my parents are wealthy
+ parallel to the business i could trade and get more knowledge about trading, My dad and me are passionate with trading at the stock exchange. And I could start a second business (import / export )

Contra:

- I have no clue about real estate developing business and had to learn everything from the scratch
- At the beginning I would get much less salary from my parents compared to consulting
- Maybe it is difficult to work with the family?
- I would be in a small town in south Germany not in a vibrant city like Dubai. But I could move to Munich which is just 30 min away from home.
-And the biggest disadvantage: I have never really said to my parents that I want to work for their company. My parents don’t know that I would like to work for them.   

**During my study i never said to them what i want to do after graduation. I always said we will see but my parents also never asked me if I want to work for them**
(maybe because they know I like to travel and discover foreign countries…) 

My feeling says I should work for their company but on the other side I miss the beach and foreign countries. (Lived in Spain, USA and Australia).

I am also aware if I don’t start working now for my parents it will be too late.
My dad is 60 and will get retired in 5 years I think. Furthermore I have to gain a lot of knowledge in this business to be successful.

Please give me some thoughts because right now I am not sure what I shall do.

How shall I speak to my parents that I want to start at their company? 


Thanks"

I've had a lot of fun on dpp playing a high school or college-aged girl with an older guy. Neighbor, student, intern, etc. But for some reason none of them excite me as much as babysitter or nanny, maybe because it just seems so possible in real life!

But when I babysat for a few families when I was younger I never saw an opportunity. Most of the guys I wouldn't have wanted to anyway, but there's always that one that looking back I wish I had, um, gotten a tip from. But I didn't :(

So what's your scenario? What do you think is a realistic way that a babysitter or a nanny could get with the daddy of the kids she's watching? Be original! Be crazy! Or be realistic! But don't be creepy and ask how young I'm willing to play.

I want you to lay out the whole situation so that we can jump right into the fun part! No need to tell me hold old you are in real life, I only want to know about your character.

Is your character married or single? Were you out on a date or working? Am I a Friday night babysitter or a regular nanny? Am I innocent and require convincing or does the situation work because I'm kind of slutty?

If you want, you can send a picture of what my character looks like, or if you want I can send you a picture of some girl on the internet that I want to look like.

Thanks!"

I am currently a junior getting my ece undergraduate degree, and just recently got an offer for an internship, and was wondering if this specific offer would be worth it. 

The details are: it is a software engineering position, and they pay ~$14.25/hour (which I feel like is under what I could be making elsewhere), but they have the offer that if I stay with them through next year, they will pay for grad school (technical or otherwise). 

The work seems cool and interesting, I am mostly just wondering if I'm getting really screwed on the wage part of it. 


Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"
2vgzjf,39,2015-02-10,"I am not salaried and my employer won't pay me beyond 35 hours a week even if they assign me to work events and attend meetings on mornings, nights, and weekends.",[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2vgzjf/i_am_not_salaried_and_my_employer_wont_pay_me/,"So here's the deal: In September of 2013 I began working for the California State Legislature at a legislator's district office as an unpaid intern. After about 6 months into the internship I was planning on ending the internship and pursuing law school. The Chief of Staff called me on the phone to see if I would be interested in working as a full time staff member. Fresh out of college with little work experience I was happy to take the offer to continue to both build my resume and start making money. He said I would be paid $14/hr and he said the goal would be to have me work full time with benefits by December. I figured I could study for the LSAT in my spare time.

I went through the hiring process and in February of 2014 I started work as a full time employee. When I asked how the payment worked for hourly employees, our Chief of Staff explained to me to mark down 35hrs a week on my time sheet that I submit to payroll every 2 weeks. Now, a big part of my job is attending community events and meetings in the place of the legislator, or to act as personal staff when they are present. This means I often work well outside of 35 hours a week, so obviously I have little time for studying and pursuing higher education.

I went along with this for about 6 months until I had had enough with working extra hours without pay as a non salaried employee. I asked the Chief of Staff if I could begin to mark down the hours I work beyond the 35 hours and he explained to me that at a rate of $14 an hour for 35 hours a week that I make as much as an entry level salaried employee, just without benefits. He explained further that they would pay me more if they could, but since the Speaker of the Assembly sets our office budget, we don't have a the funds nor the means to pay me more. I said that I understood what he meant and that was the end of that. While the speaker does indeed set our office budget, the Chief of Staff either didn't know his math or he flat out lied to me in regards to my income in comparison to entry level salaried employees; I looked up online what they make (all public employees salaries are open information)  and it turns out I make two thirds of what they make in take home pay.

Obviously, I was angry. But knowing that the Speaker controlled the purse strings and that our office budget was tight I optimistically waited for December. The reason being that this is when the Speaker adjusts the budgets of all assembly offices for the new legislative session. I was told that it is an unwritten rule that the offices who volunteer the most for nearby Democrat assembly I campaigns in will be rewarded with a higher budget come December. So I volunteered countless hours waking for nearby assembly campaigns that were close races.

The outcome? I have been a full time employee for over 1 year and the conditions of my compensation have still not changed. I fear that I will be fired if I do not tread carefully and speak out to the wrong people. There is also no whistleblower protection for legislative employees.

Here's my dilemma. I know this is illegal and that I am being taken advantage of. I am not interested in rocking the boat because I do not want to burn this bridge for the purposes of both networking and having a good resume. At the same time I will be going to Paris for the Summer to live with my girlfriend and I need as much money as possible because I will not be able to work when I am there without a permit, which is virtually impossible to get (I am not an EU citizen obviously). This means that I cannot find a new job because nobody will hire me if I am just going to end up leaving in 3 months time. 

My plan is to bring up the legality of what they are doing it up to my supervisor at our monthly one on one meeting next week. However I want to know the labor code sections that clearly show what they are doing is illegal in an effort to have them start paying me for all the work I do. I could have called HR months ago, but again I don't want to burn that bridge, and I am not even sure if HR would even go to bat for me. I am paranoid  they may contact or reprimand my boss, which is not my intentions."

There are days where I think ""I'll learn this!"" and just never bother, or find it too difficult to understand and give up. 

I used to enjoy programming as a whole and would make little projects every week, working on them a few hours each night, then I ended up in a job and stopped. Doing development work all day, albeit not very difficult coding as it's only an intern, I just cannot be bothered to do any at home.

I try to push myself by asking other developers I know to do projects with me, but they never seem to happen either. I've tried researching into other parts of computer science such as cryptography and gave up quickly after realising I wasn't clever enough to understand the mathematics side of things and felt incredibly useless. I've tried hardware side, arduino's, bought lots of little things, sensors etc, then realised I wasn't clever enough to understand how to use them. Maybe I'm not useless, just lazy.

Do I give up or continue? Does it get worse or better? Any help would be appreciated if anyone else has been in this position. I'm young (early 20's) but I'd say it's too late to change career path after doing 6 years of education in computing, degree, etc."

I had a lot of trouble with college, only being able to manage a couple of classes at a time, and I did really well in those because of the way they were structured. I spent two years studying network engineering, got three certifications, ready to enter the workforce, then my bipolar decides to kick in. Fucked up an internship opportunity because of a surprise mixed episode. 

I've never been able to succeed at any job I've had; never getting into the routine, always forgetting things, socially awkward. I end up either getting fired or quitting after a few months. Now I'm just stuck living at home until I can find out what I'm supposed to do next. I've at least gotten the bipolar under control, but now I have to contend with my slow processing speed. I can't handle job interviews because I am completely incapable of thinking on my feet in those kinds of situations. I'm utterly unemployable at this point. No chance of success anywhere. 

I'm trying to get things back together, but I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing right now. All the IT jobs I've been looking to apply to require associate's or bachelor's degrees, and there is absolutely no way I will ever be able to achieve those kinds of credentials. I'm stuck.

2vhp2c,0,2015-02-10,Seeking Programming career advice from Mechanical Engineering job,[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/2vhp2c/seeking_programming_career_advice_from_mechanical/,"Hi everyone,

I could really use some career advice. I have been working as an ME for about a year now, and am thinking about my future plans. I don't know what the etiquette is on this sub, but I would really appreciate your input: 

I'm currently a mechanical engineer, working at a small machinery company. I started in February 2014 after my graduation from a top engineering program (BSME) in December 2013. My GPA was very low (&lt;3.0), although I had one decent looking internship at a startup. I didn't learn much in college, but walked out with a degree, a little bit of coding experience, and basic engineering knowledge. 

My company is a mid-size manufacturing company (&gt;150 employees). As 1 of 3 of an engineering team, my duties have been substantial and have consisted of the following:

* 40% Machinery Design (Solidworks)- my designs have been implemented on a few of our most popular machines and are in numerous clients' fab plants 

* 30% Documentation (Solidworks, AutoCAD for air, SEE Electrical)- Part/assembly prints, PDM, electrical prints, air prints 


* 15% hands-on part fabrication, floor/assembly, electrical panels

* 5% coding- javascript google chart for tracking group tasks, solidworks macros using VBA, custom motor sizing calculator using Python

* 5% Engineering analysis (Solidworks simulation) + other failure calculations by hand

* 5% R&amp;D - implementing new processes, finding new programs to use, new standards to adopt, making new scripting tools

I am gaining an invaluable amount of experience in mechanical design, manufacturing processes, and electrical design. However, I know that I want to get my Master's degree in the near future, and it makes sense, with my background, to strive to do a robotics program. Additionally, I keep feeling an innate desire to do more programming, and am pretty sure that if I could go back and do college over again, I'd study EECS, with a focus on programming. 

What is the most realistic path I can take to get a programming-centric job? I have a low undergrad GPA, and a mech-heavy job. My current plan is the following: I probably will try to apply to numerous big companies at the end of this year as some form of ME-- Google, Tesla, Microsoft, etc. If I don't get any of those jobs, I will probably keep working and aim to get into a Master's program. Does this make sense? In the meantime, what should I set my sights on in the future in terms of career focus? In a perfect world, I would love to be a hardcore coder at Google, but my programming skills are NOT at that level and are pretty basic. 

Sorry for the rambling, that's what years of no writing does to a person. Thank you all for your help :)

**Dependent variable:** 

- Crime Recidivism (logit)

**Independent variables:**

- Dataset 1 (computerized, LOTS of variables that we have on EVERYONE)
- Dataset 2 (Must get interns to sort through handwritten papers and code things)

Dataset 1 and Dataset 2 are both linked, but we simply cannot go through 100k paper copies. At best, we can probably go through 2k of the people in our dataset and code them.

Let me come up with a sample equation that might explain what we're doing...

Logit recidivism

IVs: age (All 100k), sex (all 100k), race (all 100k), type of crime (all 100k), disciplinary writups (only 2k), drug use (only 2k)

Is it possible to come up with a model that allows us to use disciplinary writups and drug use in the same model that can later be predictive for everyone else, provided that everyone from now forward will have digitized disciplinary writups and drug use (they will no longer be missing in any future file)?

[Which libertarian predictions over the last 20 years were the least accurate? Which were the most accurate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohpy1k?context=5)|Hmm, good question. Go back a bit more than 20 years, and you'd have to say we were right on the long-run prediction that communism would collapse, but not very good at realizing in the 80s that the collapse was imminent. Non-interventionists warned that U.S. intervention around the world, especially the Muslim world, might well lead to ""blowback"" and terrorism. Libertarians also predicted that debt and Federal Reserve money manipulation would cause an economic crash, but -- perhaps because we really don't have much faith in economic forecasting -- few of us called the timing in 2008. In re-reading the 1997 edition of my book, I was surprised to see how optimistic I was about school choice, given the poor state of public schools. They're still in poor shape, and yet 90 percent of parents still send their kids there.

Also, probably the wrong place to ask, but what kind of employment opportunities exist at Cato for young, liberty minded individuals with a BA in Political Science? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohpcme?context=5)|A lot of people see libertarianism as a brand of conservatism, as ""on the right."" We talk a lot about free-market economics, so that's understandable. But as I discuss in chapter 1, libertarians come out of classical liberalism. We're for human rights, toleration, religious freedom, etc. And today we work against war, police misconduct, crony capitalism, the drug war, gay marriage bans, and lots of other  things that might seem to put us on the left. Check our website for opportunities. We hire lots of interns and a few research assistants, video producers, etc.
[Do you see the Republican party as the place for the political manifestation of libertarianism/classical liberalism, or do you think the GOP will remain true to their conservative values in the next few election cycles?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohpd6m?context=5)|That's a longstanding debate. Libertarians tended to be Democrats back in the days of Jefferson, Jackson, and Cleveland, Republicans in the FDR-Reagan era. What now? If Rand Paul runs for president, then I'd guess most libertarians will want to support his campaign. If he isn't the nominee, then our studies show that the libertarian vote can swing between parties. Also: not all politics is parties. Libertarians can get involved in tax-cut, school choice, term-limits, antiwar, and other social movements and initiatives.
[David, Thanks for taking the time to do this AMA.  What do you think Cato's role in the libertarian movement is?  And what would you suggest for young people looking to get involved in the liberty movement?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohpl4a?context=5)|At Cato we try to apply libertarian analysis to current policy issues. I hope we're supplying high-quality policy analysis to members of Congress, the media, and interested people in all walks of life. I'm too modest to say more:-) Interested young people should join Students for Liberty and Young Americans for Liberty, check out the programs at www.theihs.org, and get some experience writing for the school newspaper, working in a political or issue campaign, other practical efforts.
[Big fan of the Pauls here, but I find their almost justification of anti-same sex marriage and pro-life very confusing and contrary to their normally libertarian feelings.  What are your thoughts on the topic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohqui8?context=5)|I think libertarians can and do differ on abortion. It's the role of government to protect life AND liberty. I can see both sides. Gay marriage is a tough issue for lots of people, especially older people. But there I do think that if the government offers a benefit or license, it should offer it on an equal basis. So I think they're wrong -- but not as wrong as most Republicans, who have tended to endorse a federal constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.
[What do you believe the libertarian solution to curbing global warming would be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohq15a?context=5)|The first question is whether there's a problem that needs a solution. Cato may be the only think tank with an actual climatologist on staff. Based on his analysis, I believe that the earth is warming, that it's partly manmade, but that it's not a serious problem. If that changed, then I would urge that we consider solutions (see page 323) that rely on markets, customary law, and science.
[Why do you think libertarianism has had challenges getting a foothold in Europe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohq5ga?context=5)|All the libertarians fled the ancien regime! Maybe only the statists stayed. But don't forget, Europe is a society of private property, markets, rule of law, human rights, and religious toleration. Not as much so as we'd like, but pretty good in hisotorcal context. And Students for Liberty is now drawing hundreds of students to multiple European conferences, so keep your fingers crossed.
[If elected President, will Rand Paul make the US more free? If not, is his campaign a risk for a libertarian future? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohqdjp?context=5)|I think he'd move the country in a libertarian direction. He wouldn't make it Galt's Gulch. Of course, any president can disappoint his fans. They promise not to raise taxes, and then do. They promise not to abuse the power of the presidency, then do. I believe Rand Paul believes in liberty, so I feel reasonably confident about his intentions. But nothing is without risk.
[Mr. Boaz: Big fan, your speech at Cato University in 2007 was a huge inspiration in my formative collegiate years. In an increasingly binary political system, what can us young voters do now to make a dent in politics that seems to focus less on whether a government SHOULD do a thing, rather than one of two interpretations on HOW the government should do that thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohp7ww?context=5)|Thanks! Like I said, the first thing I want to do is make libertarian-leaning Americans KNOW that they lean libertarian and understand that they're not really part of the red team or the blue team. Then political organizers and candidates can try to organize them. But you're right, it's just so easy to see a problem and ask ""what should the government do about it?"" We just have to remind people that government programs tend to fail, and to cost money.
[For those of us that have read Politics of Freedom and Primer, give us the 30 second speech on why we should pick up your new book?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohpal3?context=5)|The new book includes a lot of the core material on individualism, pluralism, law, and economics, updated with new numbers etc. But the chapters on policy and the parasite economy, and the first and last chapters are very different. New material on Bush and Obama, cronyism, inequality, terrorism, overcriminalization, etc.
[Thanks for doing this AMA! How would you explain Libertarianism to someone who is absolutely sick of both the Republican and Democratic parties? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohq7u6?context=5)|In 2008 voters rejected the extreme social conservatism and the endless wars of the Republicans. In 2014 they rejected the bankrupt spending of the Democrats. If you dislike both those things, you just might be a libertarian. If you like lower taxes, social tolerance, and avoiding foreign wars, you just might be a libertarian. 
[What qualifications, experiences, and characteristics do you look for in your researchers and authors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohpv0f?context=5)|Knowledge of subject area, commitment to classical liberal/libertarian values, analytical ability, and a genuine interest in changing policy. Ideally we believe in qualifications, not credentials, but realistically college degrees and better yet advanced degrees are expected for policy scholars.
[I don't know if it's a ""libertarian moment"" or not, but some of the bigger public policy shifts of recent memory imply that Americans are getting at least slightly more libertarian -- same-sex marriage, marijuana legalization, the growing backlash against the surveillance/security state and police militarization, etc.  Do you think there's anything to the concept that we're getting somewhat more libertarian as a country, at least in terms of becoming more skeptical of the inherent goodness and capabilities of government?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohqp1w?context=5)|Skepticism, even cynicism, about government is definitely growing. People think the government is inefficient and dishonest.And yet so many of them turn to government to give them stuff or ban things they don't like. Still, you're right about the recent shifts and battles moving in a libertarian direction. Nick Gillespie and Matt Welch put a lot of emphasis on cultural and technological changes that undermine all sorts of establishments and allow more diversity and flourishing.
[Elizabeth Bruening recently published some harsh criticisms of libertarianism on her New Republic blog. It's nothing really new, but one thing did catch my eye. She said that libertarianism is incompatible with Catholicism. I'm not sure of your religious background (if there is any\), but do you have any thoughts on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohqdkm?context=5)|I'm no expert on Catholicism, but I would say that Christianity sets moral standards for individuals. I don't see that it requires coercive actions by government. Christianity, in someone's view, may tell people to help the poor, avoid premarital sex, or whatever. But Jesus didn't say ""tell the government to help the poor with tax money."" He said you should help the poor.
[David,  What do you think is the key to social change? Public opinion? Political action? Influencing academia? Agorism? Something else? All of the above?  Thanks for doing this AMA and I hope to talk to you this weekend at ISFLC!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohqsx4?context=5)|All of that. And who knows? Seriously, I think ideas are created, and some of them spread. Sometimes technology prompts change. Some changes only happen when political action happens, but what causes the political action? Social scientists don't seem to have definitive answers to these questions.
[Many prominent members of the Republican party have taken strong stances against reforming our immigration system, why do you think that the party of supposedly free enterprise is so against reforming a system that even they admit is broken? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohqf5p?context=5)|Partly politics. They think the base of the party is anti-immigrant, though in fact polls show most Republicans want a reasonable solution. Partly they focus on the illegality of some immigration and are concerned about the rule of law. Partly they just forget their commitment to free enterprise when it comes to foreigners.
[Hi Mr. Boaz! Could you shortlist some of your own favorite writings? Sorry I'm not familiar with your work. I've only read Justin Logan and Dan Ikenson's papers on China. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohpda7?context=5)|THIS BOOK! And THE LIBERTARIAN READER, which will be reissued next week. My studies on the libertarian vote with David Kirby. My articles on government funding of the arts, on gay marriage, my NYT article on the drug war in 1988 -- many of these online and in POLITICS OF FREEDOM.

2vi19f,21,2015-02-10,Being poor is so much worse and more complex than people think,[deleted],TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/2vi19f/being_poor_is_so_much_worse_and_more_complex_than/,"I guess it starts in high school. I didn't really get an allowance so I didn't eat lunch so I could save up money to buy my own guitar. Of course, that was reduced price lunch so it took a while. Some years it was free lunch. Sometimes my mom would have to ask me for money and I'd help her out using my lunch money I'd saved.

Then in college I went out-of-state and dropped out my second semester. My mom doesn't know anything about financial aid and she's still paying back that loan. (I'm 24 now. That was ONE YEAR of college, seven years ago.) I was lucky enough to get into community college and then a guaranteed admissions agreement but if I wasn't lucky enough to be in a state with ""good schools,"" I'd probably be paying off my loans like everyone else. My mom's since declared bankruptcy but the school loans don't go away. The government needs their money after all. 

And there'd be things you wouldn't even think about. Our dorms closed down for breaks and if I couldn't afford an amtrak ticket home I'd have nowhere to go. (And I lived in a dorm--SO MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE--because surprise! I didn't have the money to pay first and security upfront.) Luckily my mom could drive me home but if she had to work (minimum wage job, no paid leave!) I'd be SOL.

I went to a liberal arts school but I couldn't major in just anything. I thought I could at first, but when graduation came around I realized that ""finding myself"" wasn't going to help me pay the bills. It wasn't like my mom was going to be able to help me out. (I went to a ""good school,"" where most of the kids there came from private schools and money, so I heard ""Can't your mom just help you?"" a lot.) 

I was depressed in college but I didn't have medical insurance so I saw the school psychologist. I never got medication or proper treatment because I couldn't afford to see a real therapist outside of the school.

Well, I've since graduated and I had a well-paying internship for six months, which was amazing. I bought name brand toilet paper! I bought things in bulk! I even bought a car. But now I don't have that internship and unfortunately I'm not amazing at office jobs (I tried but sitting for 8 hours is excruciating. I think I have ADD. I was diagnosed but I can't afford the weeks of psych appointments required to finally get medication.)

I live next to Whole Foods so that's where I shop. It's a pretty irritating experience. Everything is organic of course, and the shoppers there are rich and entitled. I see the person in front of me buying $70 worth of ~organic~ groceries like it's nothing, getting into their new SUV, and driving off to their nice house, while I'm behind them having to ask the cashier to take that can of soup off my bill because I can't afford it. And then I walk home through the snow and look stupid slipping around because I can't afford good winter shoes. 

I have no credit and I see my rich friends with their credit cards that their parents pay off. They have great credit because their parents help them out.

I have a rich friend who tells me I should ""buy in bulk"" when my whole life growing up I was taught not to because it's more expensive in the short term. I don't have $18 for bulk RIGHT NOW, I only have $6. So I'll buy the cheaper thing, although it adds up in the end. Don't you think I know that? People don't understand that I CAN'T spend ""just a little more."" I LITERALLY DO NOT HAVE THAT MONEY.

My employers are always telling me I'm not dressed ""nice enough."" But I can't afford ""nice clothes."" I don't own business clothes. Goodwill? Nothing fits right. And after three hours of searching in barely-organized racks, it gets discouraging.

I know that everyone will tell me that I'm being a baby and it's not that bad but that just annoys me even more. Try being stressed out about paying your rent every single day. Try listening to your sister tell you that she can't afford her medication. Try listening to your mom tell you that she doesn't know how she can pay for everything this month. Day after day. 

And you know it will never get better because this is just who you are and how it's always been.

Worse, I was arguing with my friend who actually told me I was better off than him because I have ""white privilege."" He is rich and will never have to worry about money in his life."
2vi3jr,2,2015-02-10,Feeling stressed about internship applications,lowgpaintern,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/2vi3jr/feeling_stressed_about_internship_applications/,"I'm upset about my academic performance and I feel as though it will hurt me as I'm right now applying to internships. 

I had a 3.6 gpa until last term where I failed my first signals course and got a C in my complex analysis class. My gpa sunk to a 3.3. I also have a D from another math class. 

I'm applying for some top companies, and well anyone that will take me as well. 

I'm a Junior EE, and I have some advanced coursework completed.

 As in:
I've taken 3 device physics courses (Fundamentals, QM for EE and Optoelectronics)

I've also taken a 2 courses in computer architecture and one in a digital design lab. I feel in arch that I've mastered the foundation material, as We've covered both Hennessy and Patterson books. I've completed a Verilog Processor, with an extended pipeline and advanced branch prediction. I'm working independently on adding OoO with an ROB and speculation right now with my group of 4 now that the class is over. 

I've been a student researcher for 2 years, with experience in semiconductor device characterization and fabrication. 

I've also taken two courses in embedded systems including work with RTOS and high performance (Dual core A9) embedded , and I'm working on the TI innovation challenge right now. 

I feel like that this is a good position to be in for a Junior, except for that low overall gpa. And the fact that I don't come from a top even 50 school for EE. 

I have really bad math grades (another F earlier in Diff Eq from Freshmen year that I repeated for a B+) and a D, F and C from recent classes. 


I'm hoping to get into Intel and Micron, (and a ton of other places I'm applying to) but I don't know if my gpa will end up screwing me over. 


This is my first internship experience I'm applying for.

Edit: 3.3
Thought I should add that I have independently studied from a Perl book a bit about perl, and taken the Linux course on EDX so I'm somewhat familiar with Unix systems. Only programming languages I know are Python from my intro, C from embedded systems and Java from OO design. "
2vi6pe,1,2015-02-10,My ex-girlfriend [20/f] broke up with me [21m] during midterm and right before valentines,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2vi6pe/my_exgirlfriend_20f_broke_up_with_me_21m_during/,"I met this girl a bit more then two months ago. We hit it off right at the beginning. She was the first girl who I didn't sleep with on the first date. I would later find out that she gave me her virginity. I asked her why and she said because she can tell I cared. So we went on more dates hanged out so we got to know each other very well. Her friends said I was a keeper and she told me she was going to keep me. We both really liked each other. We both acknowledged that we didn't want to lose each other. 

Then school and midterms came. We were both busy. She was very busy because she has internship interviews and I am studying engineering and playing on a varsity team. One day I went to go visit her school because we go to different universities but in the same city. I haven't seen her in a week since our last date. (Last date went really well) Unexpectedly she told me it is not going to work out. She said because she is busy with school and the internship and she is also going on an exchange for 4 months to Paris. It was perfect up till that point.

I talked to my roommate which knows her well and she said before my ex met me she had these determined goals and that when I came along I came into her life as a surprised. So my roommate told me she does not want to tie me down so maybe that was her reason for breaking up with me. She is also a perfectionist in school having a 3.8/4 GPA and can get pretty upset if she does not get a good grade.

I just really don't understand it was perfect. We were both happy. My roommates even told me that she looked very happy when she is with me. I am planning to talk to her after the midterm week is done to know what happen.

PS: I texted her saying I understand the circumstances and will be there for her as a friend. She replied that it means a lot for her to hear that and that she really thinks I am an amazing person. 

Any thoughts?

2vi7ur,3,2015-02-11,I've been way too upset.,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2vi7ur/ive_been_way_too_upset/," Hi people on reddit. To be honest, I never thought I would never talk about this over here, but enough is enough. 
I'm looking for advice. Let me state that I feel very blessed for the life I live. I don't take for granted my health, or my family. With that being said let me get into it.

Four years ago I began college. I had a girlfriend who I loved very much, and friends who I couldn't be without. Throughout the years this all changed. My girl left me, and my friends are flakes. I'm about to graduate college, and I don't know what's next.

I am supposed to get a job, right? Well, I don't even know where to start. My internships all fell through, my minimum wage job can only get me so far. I produce music but I know that's just a hobby.. So I've been bugging out. How can I possibly move out of my house when I've got no plans for the future? I don't know what I want to do/ what I'm actually qualified for. College is odd.

My girl left me for another man. I thought this would spark a fire under my ass. Instead, a year later, I still think about her and regret my decisions.

My friends. Oh man, my friends. It's like they don't actually like me. I feel ignored and unappreciated. Meanwhile, I give everyone the utmost respect, attention, and thought. All they care about is the next high, or the next food stop. I don't actually think they consider me one of their better friends. I feel like they leave me out. I'm not trying to bitch, but it's the facts. It's right there in front of me. I am easily forgotten

I wake up, go to school, go to work, come home, eat, and sleep. I can't keep up with that. I'm losing my mind. I feel like I'm growing old and I'm only 21. I have no girlfriend to come home too, or a friend who just wants to chill out. It's running a toll on me. I become miserable and fall into a deep dark place.

It's kind of scary when you don't have a reason to get up in the morning. You never think that it would happen to you, depression, but when it does- you understand. I hope for a better tomorrow, but for years I have been running into the same wall.

I come here to ask... Well.. For your thoughts. It can be anything. I talk to my mother about my feelings but she can only know/say so much. 

I don't know if I can keep going this way. I feel so alone,and lost. I just want to be happy- not waking up upset. Not feeling betrayed. Not feeling depleated.

My sister is seven years older than me and continually tries to tell me what to do. She'll do this in front of my girlfriend too, bringing up internships and whatnot... passive aggressive.

My mom is narcissistic, how? Whenever she does something wrong, she doesn't say she is sorry, rather, she'll say that you always blame her or that it's not her fault-- rather, it's yours. 

And if you stick to what you say.. she'll bring up all the ""good"" she has done for you and what a good mother she has been, how hard she has it with you, etc.....  doesn't talk about the actual conflict.

My dad? I think he figured this all out long ago, he stays quiet and minds himself. 

My sister will always defend my mother.  For an example, i found evidence that my mom threw one of my debit cards away because my desk only had the card in it when i placed it in there. when i opened it, it had pencils and paper in it instead.... i ask her.. she says she never say it before and i bring up the new items. Only then does she say she saw it and keeps bringing up reasons why it's not her fault. It was all to ""Help me""..... 

my sister's take: I should have been more careful with my things, as if purposefully hiding my things wasn't enough right??!

She'll even defend my mom when she disrespects my physical boundaries and touches me when i tell her not to. As far as anyone is concerned, i have no rights living in this house. 

Please tell me there is a way out of this mess, I think I'm going to either go crazy or kill myself if i keep living with this family for another 3-4 years. i've already emotionally disconnected myself from my mom and my sister. 

ps. I try to talk to my girlfriend of 1 year and a half about this... but im afraid it'll scare her off or it'll end up with her breaking up with me because of my family baggage. Is it alright to talk about this...? I don't want to sound like im creating drama... "
2vinx3,4,2015-02-11,Need advice! Consulting or working for real estate family business?,aerox11,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/2vinx3/need_advice_consulting_or_working_for_real_estate/,"Hi guys I need your advice.

I have to decide the next 2 months which way I go regarding my professional career.

First I want to introduce myself. I am 28 years old and I am graduating from a Top 10 Business School in Germany.

Before I studied I did an apprenticeship with 16 as an industrial salesman and worked 8 years for this company in Germany and Spain. After that I went to university and did 2 internships in consulting and one in a big telecommunication company.

Now I am unsure about my future and I want to ask you for advice. I have following options

**1.  I do my master’s degree**

Pro:

+  I will gain new experience and knowledge. Can go abroad for one year

Contra:

- I have the feeling that I didn’t learn much how to run a business. SO maybe studying two more years is waste of time and I will be 30 when I am done…

**2.  I will start working now in sales or in consulting and don’t do the masters**

Pro:

+ I earn “good” money and I can “travel”
+ Work in consulting was fun I liked the tasks
+ Maybe I will have the opportunity to work in a different country like Dubai or Sydney? I like vibrant big cities :)

Contra:

- in consulting I worked a lot. Around 60-70 hours. Never be at home before 9 pm… (No time for sports, friends…)
- I will be an employee and work for someone else. At least for the next 5 years.
- I am 28 or 30 when i am done with uni and start as a junior consultant. Other people will be already senior consultants with the same age. Nobody care in consulting about my past work experience.
Maybe my age is an disadvantage to get a high position?

**3. I start working for my parents company**

We have a real estate developing company with around 30-40 apartments).We build and sell/ rent houses/apartments.
The company is small (Brother, mother and my dad). But there are many opportunities in my opinion to increase the business.

Pro: 

+ I like to be my own boss and be independent
+ the business is very interesting and I can generate a passive income. (My brother has already 3 houses and generates an extra income)
+ The business ran quite well the last twenty years and I would say my parents are wealthy
+ parallel to the business i could trade and get more knowledge about trading, My dad and me are passionate with trading at the stock exchange. And I could start a second business (import / export )

Contra:

- I have no clue about real estate developing business and had to learn everything from the scratch
- At the beginning I would get much less salary from my parents compared to consulting
- Maybe it is difficult to work with the family?
- I would be in a small town in south Germany not in a vibrant city like Dubai. But I could move to Munich which is just 30 min away from home.
-And the biggest disadvantage: I have never really said to my parents that I want to work for their company. My parents don’t know that I would like to work for them.   

**During my study i never said to them what i want to do after graduation. I always said we will see but my parents also never asked me if I want to work for them**
(maybe because they know I like to travel and discover foreign countries…) 

My feeling says I should work for their company but on the other side I miss the beach and foreign countries. (Lived in Spain, USA and Australia).

I am also aware if I don’t start working now for my parents it will be too late.
My dad is 60 and will get retired in 5 years I think. Furthermore I have to gain a lot of knowledge in this business to be successful.

Please give me some thoughts because right now I am not sure what I shall do.

How shall I speak to my parents that I want to start at their company?

2vj7th,2,2015-02-11,How to benchmark yourself in an SME/job?,ThrowawayUKJobhunter,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2vj7th/how_to_benchmark_yourself_in_an_smejob/,"Apologies if this comes off as a rant, i'm not sure what advice anyone could realistically give. Its been theraputic to type though.

Hi, Im 24 and currently work in the UK for a small SME. I'm basically the entire marketing division (encompassing design, idea generation, CRM, sales, the lot!) of the company which is basically just myself and the two directors and another couple of agents we work with. This is a position I've been in for a year now. Being an SME operating in a well established market (our competitors are HUGE compared to us) we're performing averagely/struggling despite our unique services. This is not helped by the fact that the directors have other businesses that is their priority and I feel do not really give me the support I need to do the job properly. I'm paid poorly on an internship level wage which I do not feel is enough to cover basically running the company myself, however we would not be profitable if I were to get a rise.

I should mention that I have won an award recognised by the local council (intern of the year for my region), which I felt good about for a while however I feel this was just due to my networking ability and the fact that my job is more complex than many of the competitors. I do not feel that my education background is great (shitty university) and I've attended a few interviews/applied for a few posts and not been successful. I've recently become a director of a local charity to further my CV (and its something I wanted to do!) however I still find myself getting auto discarded for marketing positions as everyone seems to have better experience. Even if i did get a marketing role I really do not feel confident in my abilities due to the struggles of working in an SME. I'm fed up of working alone (I'm in the office alone maybe 50% of the time including right now). I feel I have a lot to give but just feel a little bit down about this rut.


Thanks."

2vjiln,5,2015-02-11,Question about inconsistent sleep patterns,SIM0NEY,sleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/2vjiln/question_about_inconsistent_sleep_patterns/,"I hope this is the right sub to ask this, but I don't really know where else I could post it, even amongst the suggested subs in sidebar.

I just turned 30. I'm in my senior year of my undergrad degree, and I work a full time office job. Lately school and my job are both at more demanding points than they have ever been (only had the job since April, part time intern here before that). So needless to say, in order to keep my grades up, I have had many nights of near or no sleep recently. This has never been a big deal for me, but I'm having an issue that someone may be able to explain.

As the title says my sleep periods are inconsistent. 


**Example:**

Night before last, I got about 3.5 hours of sleep, then woke up yesterday, worked a full day, went home and worked a full night on homework, but I managed to get to bed at a better time last night. I slept for 6.5 hours. 

Yesterday (on 3.5 hours of sleep) I woke up refreshed. Today (on 6.5 hours of sleep), I can't even walk in a straight line.

I know about the practice of regulating your sleep cycles, and am pretty certain I woke up between sleep cycles both nights. It's not even really waking up properly. It's my functionality throughout the *entire* day.

So my question is this: If I sleep for 3.5 hours one night, then the next night, would it be better for me to sleep as much as I can, or would it be better to stay consistent from day to day?"

I can't stop thinking about her.,Russianboss776,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2vjqoy/girl20f_i19m_dated_and_have_fallen_in_love_with/,"This girl moved to my town in November in Illinois from Washington to stay with her parents while she took a year off from college. She started working with me and we had a lot in common and started dating. She was expecting to move back to Washington to resume her college Fall 2015 but at the start of January she got a call saying she got an internship, but in order to keep the internship she has to be enrolled in class immediately. She told me she loved spending her few months in Illinois with me and wanted to spend her remaining two weeks with me. I was touched by this and she knew how much I liked her.

Over the last two weeks of being with her, I opened up and told her how much I liked her and she was flattered. I asked if I could kiss her and she asked if I ever kissed a girl before. After saying no, she took me in and gave me my first kiss. 

Unfortunately with her internship, the next time I would see her would be in the summer and only for a week. We are planning on going to a music festival together which we both are really excited for.

Now this is where my problem comes in. Ever since she left, I can't stop thinking about her. I know many people say they have found the perfect girl but I seriously think she was the one. Every single thing I enjoyed, she did too: Football, mechanical/aerospace engineering majors, space and science, movies, and the most important, EDM music. She is the only person I know who enjoys EDM as much as I do and whenever I listen to it I always think of her and it makes me sad. Almost every night I am thinking about her and sometimes even cry myself to sleep.

I really want to be with her but I know it probably would not work out. I already asked her if she would like to be in a committed relationship with me but she politely declined because she would be on the other side of the country. I need help. I do not want to forget her because she is the most amazing girl I have ever met and we are going to see each other this summer. We text and snapchat each other almost everyday so we are still close.

I do not know what to do. My mind keeps thinking of how perfect she was for me. And I know she has feelings for me as well, I just don't think it is as strong. Ever since she left I have been behaving differently. Not as bad as depression, but just really sad about this whole situation. I do not know if it is effecting my school work but it is effecting my social and personal life. It is hard to listen to my music without thinking about her and it is hard to focus without my mind going on tangents. Its been about four weeks now and its not getting any better. What should I do??

TLDR: Cannot stop thinking about girl I love."

I was a content, good-natured kid growing up, always on the path to success. Honors classes, sports, friends, the whole shebang. I was accepted to NYU's prestigious film program, and 17-year-old me knew he was going to be a famous television producer one day. So my parents footed an insane bill - think buying a new car every semester - for the sake of their child's dreams and happiness (I guess my family falls somewhere between middle class and upper-middle class, my parents bring in a combined $175k a year).

So they shipped me off to New York City. Freshman year was a blast. NYC was this new world and I loved exploring it with my new friends. We smoked weed on rooftops, went to concerts, early film screenings, it was awesome. Then two of my best friends at school transferred because they weren't satisfied with the program they were in. I was left with one good friend, my roommate, Joe. Unfortunately all Joe liked to do was sit around and smoke weed, and I feel like I wasted a lot of my free time doing nothing with him. By sophomore year, the mystique of the city had faded, and I was slipping into a pretty crummy routine - go to class/work, come home, smoke weed with Joe. Around this time I was also starting to get much more introspective - questioning my future, my goals, whether this city is really where I want to be.

I stayed in the city that summer so I could intern at a fairly successful television production company. I left the internship after 7 months feeling disillusioned, completely turned off by the sterile, corporate environment that I was ultimately training for. I was practically by myself in a small apartment that summer - no friends in town, save for a few occasional visits from acquaintances. Then I learned that Joe wouldn't be returning to New York - he would be transferring to a small school in Vermont. I thought, great, this will give me the chance to get back on the right track. Yet here I am, spending my nights alone in my apartment, smoking weed by myself. I'm completely disconnected from my classes, I have ""friends"" but no one that I have really connected with, and terrifyingly no one that I really WANT to connect with. I'm stuck in this mindset of being lonely but at the same time completely uninterested with associating with my peers. I go home to New Jersey every few weekends just to spend some time with people that I consider close friends. I dread being in the city and I'm just counting down the days until I can return home to boring suburbia for the summer.

So, as you can see, I'm not in a great place right now. New York has left me completely jaded, I feel like I've wasted my college experience, I feel like I've wasted my parents money, and I have no idea what I want from the future."

Under the burn of fifteen studio lights, Anderson smiled when he should smile and frowned when he should frown. He rattled off the C-stories (“…a little girl and her pet kangaroo…), powered through the B-stories (“…local politicians say the tax hike won’t affect small businesses…) and channeled every ghost of news anchors past he could for the hard hitting A-stories (“Terrorists in Syria have demanded the return of four captured insurgents…). 

He pinched his nose and lips at the last, placing his large hands on the desk in front of him in what he hoped would be a gesture of humanity and sincerity (“These are difficult times for us all…and our prayers go to their families…”).

Wrap story, brief banter, sign off, cue music, dim lights, hold. 

The director signaled him from behind the cameras and he found his breath coming back to him, his friendly but homely co-anchor beside him erupting into an explosion of chit-chatter. As the lights died the studio came to life around him, the drones rushing out to wipe down the desk and trade notes. Cameramen stretched, producers checked their cell phones and when he looked again at the director he shot him a thumbs up. Life as usual. He adjusted his suit, stood up tall and strode over from the desk into the prep area of the soundstage. 

“Great job, Bill.” The director called. There was that thumb again. 

“Keep it up, we’re back on in three.” He cleared his throat and sucked in his chest then, “Hear that everybody?! We’re back on in three hours! Get your shit together!” 

Anderson smiled and looked round at the bustling faces. They smiled when they noticed his eye contact, but not before. Not even his co-anchor, the always bubbly Melissa, who was still at their news desk and from the looks of it had caught a gaggle of sound techs in conversation. Anderson could almost hear her twang as she smacked her lips up and down at them, their eyes darting left and right for an escape. A chuckle escaped his lips. 

One in response sounded out next to him.

The first thing he noticed about her was her hair: it was red as a rose and thin, but the healthy variety. Down from there, his eyes took in her face, the way her body curved in with her little hips, her long legs standing in that must-be-practiced half bent stance of the eternally cocky, and of course how what looked like a more than an ample chest was being pulled down by a tight tee shirt promoting some Rock’n’Roll band or another.

“Can I help you with something, Mr. Anderson?” His eyes shot up to hers. She was grinning right at him. He gave her a slow smile back and said nothing, grabbing a Styrofoam cup off the table and pouring himself a coffee. He poured slow, taking another moment to take in the sight of her again: it did not disappoint. Her skin was fair and her face unpocked with acne scars or the tell-tale too much make-up he knew to be an indicator of disappointment ahead. Her thin red lips set themselves into grin and the whites of her teeth became exposed, “Mr. Anderson?”

“I was just trying to figure out which department you are,” He answered without hesitation, “Electric?” 
She took a step back, her face scrunched up, but then looked down at the heavy industrial tape and thermal insulation gloves on her hands, “Clever.”

“Just experienced.”

“Right.” She rested a hand on the table and managed to shift into an even cockier posture, “I’m a gaffer, specifically.” 

Anderson nodded and took a sip of his coffee, the ring on his finger rising up into her eye-line. He knew a lot of jokes about gaffers, the lighting wizards of the entertainment industry and he half got the feeling she was waiting for one. So he just smiled and nodded. Her eyes darted towards his ring for just a moment and her face set, her jaw clenching and her brows moving just a little closer. 

“Every time you look good behind that desk you have me to thank.” She leaned in closer, and Anderson realized she was pushing those tits he had noticed straining under her band shirt up and out, subtly angling her body so they stared him down like a second pair of eyes, “Not much I can do when you’re in front of it though.”

“You think I could look better then?”

“Oh no,” Her eyes went wide like a Japanese schoolgirls, but Anderson noted there wasn’t a trace of fear in them, “I think you look very good for a man your age.”

Anderson’s laugh was short and hoarse, “A man my age, huh? If there’s anything I know about a girl your age it’s that nobody looks better than a man my age.” He took another sip and didn’t drop eye contact. Her eyes trailed up and down his body and he knew full well she was impressed. He had kept to a strict weightlifting schedule for twenty years and it damn well showed. 

He found his body inching over the table, his spine straightening to give himself maximum height, and in the tiniest corner of her mouth her teeth bit down on her lips. “Luckily for me, that’s a sentiment my wife shares.”

The lip bite became a full fledged chomp. She too straightened up and backed away from the table, trailing her fingers on the wood as she did so, “Lucky woman. I’m sure there’s more than one intern around here who would like to trade places with her.” A beat, “Like Gareth. Or maybe Mark.”

Anderson ignored the jab and tried to surprise with a move from left field, coming round the table and striding past her. She didn’t flinch, not losing an inch of frame. Instead she shifted a little to her side and made sure her hand brushed his, those manicured red nails sending a shiver down his spine.

“Oh, I’m sorry Mr. Anderson.” Her voice went an octave higher, 

“Didn’t see you coming.” Her fingers trailed back down his arm again, “Didn’t see a thing.” Just one finger now, down his fingers, arcing down like it was going to go further. She slowed down, and in her deep green eyes he saw a fire that matched her hair. Her finger dropped at last, she bit back another smile and turned away.

He would be lying if he didn’t admit to watching her leave, his eyes on her ass like he knew she knew they would be. When the sounds of the world came back to him there was a single bead of sweat on his brow, and a tightening in his pants.

He asked me to explain topic models, which I mention on my resume.  He had a general understanding of machine learning but told me that he hadn't ever witnessed the Bayesian side of things.

My explanation was rather poor, and it was hard for me to explain both LDA and Bayesian modeling / modeling with PGMs in such a short amount of time.  To most people without a technical background, they're satisfied if I say that LDA yields list of salient groups of related words over a collection, with documents represented as a mixture of these groups.

The interviewer, however, familiar with simpler indexing schemes, asked me genuinely what the difference is between LDA and tf/idf indexing, for example.  The best I could come up with is that 

After this experience, I realize that although I understand certain machine learning algorithms on a technical level, I need to work on my intuitive understanding of what they accomplish.

Looking back at the original LDA paper, the only explanation is the following:

&gt; While the tf-idf reduction has some appealing features—notably in its basic identification of sets of words that are discriminative for documents in the collection—the approach also provides a relatively small amount of reduction in description length and reveals little in the way of inter- or intradocument statistical structure.

Reddit, how would you answer this question?  Can you provide any insight in to the quote above?  What limitations does TF-IDF have that LDA improves upon?

TL;DR if an interviewer asked you what the difference between LDA and indexing by tf/idf or something similar, how would you respond?"

[Hi guys, do you think there's a difference in administering a psychedelic, during medical assisted therapy, in indoors from the outdoors? All the subjects go home by themselves at night? Thank you for helping those in need with all the 'weapons' available and beyond the frontiers of knowledge! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vju7x/we_are_the_multidisciplinary_association_for/coiblay?context=5)|First, no, subjects in the PTSD studies have an overnight stay at the study site, and do not return until the next night, and people in the study of LSD-assisted psychotherapy for end of life anxiety also had an overnight stay at the study site. Subjects in the study of MDMA therapy in people on the autism spectrum with social anxiety do return from the site at night, either to their place of residence or if they live farther away, a nearby hotel.
 |You ask a good question about differences in setting, such as being indoors versus outdoors. So far, no one has approached researching setting directly. It is also possible that time of day might change an experience, but this has not been researched either.
 |Ilsa Jerome, Ph.D., Clinical Research and Information Specialist, MAPS Public Benefit Corporation.
 |Subjects in our study do spend the night at the study site. That is an integral part of our approach. We want people to take time out of their lives to focus on their issues and not be distracted. By spending the night and resting after the session they can stay focused on their experience and it facilitates their integration. We administer the MDMA during the day so that subjects can actually get some sleep that night. The next day we have a non-drug session so that the therapists and subject can work on integration and prepare the subject to return home.
 |All of our studies take place indoors, in a protected environment with music, a nearby bathroom, and necessary medical equipment. However, occasionally in the study sessions, we will take people for a walk outside, if they're feeling especially stuck. One of the best examples happened in the Israeli study a few years ago. This was someone who had PTSD for more than 40 years and during the session was having difficulty and wanted to walk around. The therapist agreed to walk around outside with the subject on the grounds of the mental health facility where the study was taking place. He felt grounded by touching the trees and being outdoors. When he returned inside he had a powerful breakthrough. What was remarkable was that when he was outside there were fighter airplanes overhead going to fight in Gaza. While we were on the ground helping someone heal from a prior war, a new war was being waged overhead. In a way this work sometimes feels futile but it makes this work so important to do.
 |There is a lot to be said about psychedelic experiences outside in nature. One of the most mystical experiences I've had was taking MDMA while camping right on the Pacific Coast, hearing the ocean. It was exquisite to be alone in nature feeling the full experiences of MDMA. Lots of other people have had It's terrific to be able to do that however it's especially important that you're either in a very safe place or with someone who is not doing drugs who is a mediator between you and the outside world. The circumstances in our study are designed for safety and protection and an opportunity to go inside and do deep work. Part of doing psychedelics is being open to the inner world which can make you vulnerable to all sorts of things that would happen in the outside world.

[How do you feel about the use of marijuana (through edibles or vaping, to avoid carcinogens from smoking\) during pregnancy and while breastfeeding? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vju7x/we_are_the_multidisciplinary_association_for/coid6gg?context=5)|Currently in our marijuana study we exclude pregnant or nursing mothers due to insufficient data on effects of exposure in utero, on the basis that we don’t know if THC or CBD can make it past the placenta and we do know that THC can pass into breast milk. The scientific study of prenatal marijuana exposure and infant marijuana exposure has generated mixed results. Concerns range from low birth weight to behavioral and morphological (shape) abnormalities in brain development. However, many studies that have been conducted on mothers include both tobacco and marijuana smokers, or polydrug users using marijuana in addition to other drugs during pregnancy. Many of them focus on samples that come from disadvantaged backgrounds, which introduces bias in results from long-term studies in adolescents that look at IQ and cognitive function.
 |In contrast, a study published in 2014 in a sample of 396 mothers found that marijuana use during pregnancy was not related to late initiation of prenatal care, preterm deliveries, birth weight, or neonatal intensive care unit admissions (1). An ethnographic study published in 1994 on Jamaican mothers using marijuana to ease morning sickness found no difference between infants who had been exposed to marijuana (N=24) and those who hadn’t (N=20) in a matched sample (2). A 5 year follow-up on the same children found  no significant differences in developmental testing outcomes between children of marijuana-using and non-using mothers except at 30 days of age when the babies of users had more favourable scores on two clusters of the Brazelton Scales: autonomic stability and reflexes. The developmental scores at ages 4 and 5 years were significantly correlated to certain aspects of the home environment and to regularity of basic school (preschool) attendance (3), supporting the interpretation that socioeconomic status and other aspects of child-rearing are more important than marijuana exposure in determining functional outcomes. Ultimately, in the absence of data from a randomized, controlled clinical trial on prenatal marijuana exposure, it is up to the mother to review the existing data and decide on their own.

[I personally am starting by taking an undergrad in neuroscience. I'm gonna keep my eyes open for research / internship opportunities and move closer to MAPS headquarters once u have my degree and can afford it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vju7x/we_are_the_multidisciplinary_association_for/coi9rsh?context=5)|I thought I’d chime in here since my only degree is a B.S. in Biopsychology and I graduated in May of 2014. Through my involvement with the Tufts chapter of Students for Sensible Drug Policy, I was guided to events where I had the wonderful opportunity to hear Rick Doblin speak. His words profoundly resonated with my own developing ideas about psychedelics and the state of mental health care in America and I decided in my Sophomore year that this was where I wanted to make my career. I applied to MAPS internships several times and got denied, rallied a few friends of mine to go to the Horizons: Perspectives on Psychedelics conference held annually in NYC, and mustered the cash to fly out to California and volunteer for MAPS’ own Psychedelic Science conference in 2013. I turned every paper I could into an opportunity to explore the existing work being done with psychedelics. When I applied for an internship again this year as I was graduating and was offered a full-time position, I was ecstatic to accept. However, if I hadn’t gotten the job, I want to believe that it wouldn’t have stopped me from pursuing work that matters to me.
 |I don’t at all think that an undergraduate degree in neuroscience is a waste of time if it’s what you feel called to study and you can make that work within the larger trajectory of what you want to accomplish. We have people here with advanced degrees from Stanford and Yale, and we have people working here that learned their craft without the aid of even an undergraduate degree. More than anything else, you should study something that fulfills you (of course it doesn’t hurt to acquire the practical skills necessary to delve into your dream projects after graduation and it also wouldn’t hurt to move closer to people doing the type of work you want to be involved in :)). My point is that you can guide the course of your study in the direction of what you actually care about and you can always pick up more skills down the road. The internet is a beautiful thing!
 |Your question as well as many other questions on here imply a desire to support our mission, a mission that is larger than our small organization. There are a great many more of you brilliant people than there are careers to be had at MAPS in particular and your voices are valuable and needed.

[Is there going to be any specific research collating the psychedelic experience with Temporal Lobe/limbic Epilepsy ? Both seem to cause religious experiences. Will the studies be able to pinpoint the areas within the brain that allow us to have these transcendent experiences? Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vju7x/we_are_the_multidisciplinary_association_for/coibmlx?context=5)| In our clinical trials we are trying to optimize the therapeutic benefits so we are not taking people into brain scanners while they are under the influence of MDMA or LSD. However, we are planning one study to be conducted in England that would take people who are veterans with PTSD and put them under an fMRI while under the influence of MDMA. It is a one-session model to try to understand what happens acutely in the brain.
 |There have been studies with [MDMA](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10989265), LSD, and [psilocybin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25563444) with healthy volunteers who have gone into brain scans during the experience. We do administer the mystical experience questionnaire to all of our subjects and have found that LSD study with subjects with anxiety related to end of life, there was a relationship between the depth of the mystical experience and therapeutic outcomes.
 |However, in our MDMA study there were a fair amount of people that did report mystical experiences, more than you might anticipate, but we found no correlation between the depth of the mystical experience and therapeutic outcomes. The explanation for that is that for PTSD, it's events that have occurred in a person's biography that have been traumatic and that continue to torment people. People seem able to work through that and become healed in the process that we are starting to think about in terms of memory reconsolidation. With people who are anxious about dying, the spiritual mystical experience can indeed be very helpful as part of the therapeutic process.
 |The link between temporal lobes, and temporal lobe epilepsy and mystical experiences, Dr. has found that he is able to produce certain mystical experiences through magnetic stimulation of the temporal lobes. Psilocybin reduces activity in the default mode network, though I'm not sure how this correlates to the temporal lobes. for those who really want to learn more about it, you could look at the [recent brain scan studies with psilocybin and MDMA](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4034428/).

2vkkmw,39,2015-02-11,Net Worth Zero: Day 1 of the Rest of My Life,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2vkkmw/net_worth_zero_day_1_of_the_rest_of_my_life/,"Today, for the first time in my adult life, my net worth is not negative. I have as much debt as I do retirement savings, and a hefty tax return (part of which will pay off debt, and part of which I will invest) has officially put me in the black. 

I started out 2014 with over $20k of student loan debt and no savings. I made my first (early) loan payment in June after graduating college and starting a full-time job, and threw every spare dollar I had at the high-interest loans over the summer. I unexpectedly had to move in August, which ate up what modest savings I had in an emergency fund. I took a break in these early payments to rebuild my savings, and started making minimum monthly payments when my post-graduation grace period ended in November. My extra payments resumed in January when I got my year-end bonus. All told I paid off over $10k of high(er)-interest debt in six months by throwing every dollar I could spare at the loans and living as frugally as possible while still maintaining my sanity and social life.

After receiving my tax return today, my net worth is no longer negative. I have two student loans remaining, under $10k total, both with a 3.5% interest rate. Those will be paid off by the end of 2015. I also managed to save about $6k in an employer-sponsored 401-k over the past six months. With my employer's matching funds, that's over $10k in retirement savings. I have a modest emergency fund and a new brokerage account into which I deposited the remainder of my tax refund (~$1k). I'm creating a moderately aggressive portfolio: I don't need the money right now but would like to own a house sometime in the next 5-7 years. Hopefully that $1k will grow into the beginnings of a down payment. 

Per the FAQ here is some advice I would share with others looking to pay down debt quickly, especially recent graduates:

* **Minimize expenses, maximize income.** It's simpler to say than to do, but there are tons of resources on Reddit and elsewhere to help you reduce your cost of living and increase the money coming in. I cook at home, bring lunch to work, shop sales in the grocery store, use dishtowels instead of paper towels, read library books, visit free museums, make my own cleaning solution, have friends over as often as I go out, and choose restaurants with specials and happy hours when I do go out. I sold a lot of my shoes, clothing, and accessories on eBay and Craigslist when I downsized apartments, and also do freelance writing and editing for side income. Use your free time in ways that will either make or save you money, when possible. 

* **Invest in yourself.** When I got my full-time job I was able to move into an apartment of my own, instead of sharing with roommates as I did throughout college. I could be spending less on housing, but it's the one bill I am happy to pay each month. The privacy, sense of peace, creative freedom, social flexibility, and general happiness that my place gives me is well worth what I spend. I'm also not afraid to buy things when I have to: one really good knife replaces my four crappy older ones, one good blazer outlasts two or three cheap ones, and one energy-efficient air conditioner is more durable and costs less month-to-month than the behemoth I inherited from my old place. I started buying quality over trendiness/quantity when I was a teenager, and it's such a great habit to get into. I have shoes, coats, kitchenware, and bedding that I've used for 8+ years still going strong. /r/buyitforlife is a great resource if you want to learn more. 

* **Take advantage of the resources you have.** If you're lucky enough to have family in or near your city, take the support that they offer, whether that's networking introductions or free babysitting or moving back home or the occasional trip to the grocery store. If you have professional mentors or coworkers willing to help you, take them up on their offers to introduce you to new people or write letters of recommendation. If you're in college, use your career center and alumni network to get a job or advance in your career. In my case, that meant working to turn my internship into a full-time job. I asked my mentor for help, set up meetings, pitched myself to senior people, and eventually accepted the offer they made me even though I wasn't sure I wanted to do this long-term. In the end I took the offer because this job would pay well and lead to future opportunities. I'm not doing what I studied in school, and probably won't stay in this industry for more than a couple years, but it was what I had to work with. You might have to choose between following your dreams and getting your financial health in order, and I can't make that choice for you. But what I decided to do was take the opportunity in front of me and try my best at it, knowing that I would be in a much better position to search for my dream job when I had savings, no debt, and a couple years of professional experience. Now that I am employed I use my benefits to the fullest extent possible: tax-advantaged savings accounts, 401-k matches, subsidized transportation, health benefits, discounts, and the occasional free lunch. I also use my downtime in productive ways, studying for new qualifications and reading career-and finance-related books (plus, yes, a little Reddit browsing).

* **Personal finance is a long-term game.** Having goals and dreams has been immeasurably motivational to me. Picturing the house I want to buy one day or the final student loan payment helps me choose not to order takeout, take a cab home, send my laundry out, or buy this or that amazing accessory. It can be hard to make these small decisions every day, but for me keeping my eyes on the prize makes all the difference. /r/financialindependence is very helpful and motivating in this regard. 


Thanks to all of you for your advice and support over the past few months. It's never felt so good to be at zero!"

*Amber and I have been friends for about 8-9 years.* 

**Here are Amber's defining qualities to remember:**

- Amber is funny, quiet, pretty, sometimes sweet, and intelligent.

- Amber is deceitful, secretive, and mysterious.

- Amber is not honest, caring, or loving as a person.

- Amber is extremely defensive.

- Amber is extremely uptight and does not handle stress well. She has epic meltdowns when things get difficult.

- Amber does not like being asked to pay bills, rent, or anything owed.

- Amber is the most manipulative person I have ever met.

- Amber is not a secure person and therefore forms her identity by leeching others hobbies and interests. (i.e. I am vegetarian, she becomes vegetarian. I study graphic design, she studies graphic design. I like a band, she LOVES said band, etc. She collects these from everyone she knows.)

- Amber can only have one best friend at a time and therefore will unfriend without notice when she meets someone new. She hurts others with abandon. She comes back when she decides she needs you and acts like nothing happened. Que manipulation.

- Amber is incapable of showing appreciation for things people do for her. 'Thank you' is something she never says, no matter the magnitude of what you've done to help her. She takes advantage of everyone close to her.

- Amber does not make friends easily and does not keep friends easily. Leaving her with a handful total.

**Backstory:** 

I met Amber in high school through my best friend's boyfriend, who also happened to be my boyfriend's (Jack's) best friend (confusing and complicated, I know, but vital to the story). She skirted on the outside of our very close group of friends for years, dating a few, causing some mild issues that have become rather indicative of who she is. High school stuff.


I reached out as I graduated, attempting to be her friend as Jack moved to Boston for school and her brother and my best friend went to college together out of state. She was alarmingly close to her brother at the time, so it was natural that she would develop feelings for Jack. It was kind of awkward between us because of this and I feel like our friendship was forced. We weren't close at first, but I wanted to be. I was always looking for that fairy tale, best bud, companion type friend and I thought that we could eventually reach that point.


In 2009 I struggled through one year of community college and eventually decided it was time to join Jack in Boston where he was attending school. So I picked up and moved the 1600 miles north from Tulsa that fall. Jack and I had been having some trouble because of the distance and I had become increasingly aware that the key to my happiness was to join him. We were on and off after he moved, and during that time he had sort of created a relationship with Amber. It wasn't serious, but it created a sexual tension that has plagued all of us since. 


Amber came to live with us a year later to join me at my university (Fall 2010). I had some reservations about it, but she was so excited and so interested in experiencing a new city that I couldn't say no. I didn't have too much of a reason to be concerned at the time. I found out very quickly that being friends with Amber was thankless and oddly unsatisfying, as if I were giving more than I was getting. Friendships are extremely important to me, and I have a tendency to be kind of affectionate (not physically, just overall) with those close to me, so I disregarded my doubt. Amber seemed to want to be close, so I kept trying despite noticing her dependency on others, her almost chronic need to take advantage of those close to her.   


The real trouble started during her second year of school. We had moved into a new place, and I was finishing up my last year (year round program, so I finished in 3 years). Toward the end of fall 2011, Amber found out that her parents did not qualify for another Plus loan. I had struggled personally every year to get any kind of funding, and I did not have a parents help, so I tried very hard to help her work this out. She had so many options that she refused to consider, which made me suspicious. But at the time things were fine, she was a terrible roommate but our friendship was okay. Jack had asked me to marry him that fall, and one night while very drunk, I made the foolish decision to ask her to be my maid of honor.


When she purchased a ticket for Jennifer, her childhood friend, to come visit us, it became clear why she was refusing help with school loans. Jennifer was the worst kind of asshole. She hated Boston, and she complained the whole time she was there about everything.  Jennifer and Amber treated me and my roommates like total garbage that week. Amber was never very good at paying her bills, choosing to spend that money on shopping instead. In general, if Amber was asked to pay or clean something, she threw a fit. This behavior was exacerbated when Jennifer visited. They were very destructive that week, talking bad about me loudly in the hallway, screaming at our awesome roommate when he asked for the 2 months of unpaid bill money she owed, making huge messes, asking me to take them to see different places in Boston yet inexplicably ignoring me the whole time. It was *ODD*.


They went back to Tulsa when the week ended for Christmas break, and when we returned Amber had decided to hate Boston too. She refused more funding for school and dropped out. She got a part time job with the intention of moving home after our lease was up in September. Living with her became a nightmare. She couldn't afford rent with her part time job, so we had to take on another roommate in our already cramped, three bedroom apartment. Jack and I had to move into the living room. She eventually decided, about two months later, that she still couldn't take the financial stress and that she would move back home. Our agreement was that she would at least pay her part of her rent while living and working in inexpensive Tulsa to prevent breaking the lease, this was enforced by her father who was her cosigner. 


One of the worst nights of my life was her going away party. We had gotten very drunk, there weren't a lot of people there because Amber made only one friend during her time in Boston. We were having a fun, lighthearted discussion when she revealed that she had kissed Jack before. I was a little shocked and asked him about it immediately, expecting a funny story. I should mention that Jack is a great guy. He is all good looks, talent, and good intentions (with the biggest heart). He has never regretted anything more than this. According to him, during my first Christmas break back home after moving to Boston in 2009, while at a friend's NYE party I had gotten too drunk and was put in a bedroom to sleep. Amber and Jack slept next to each other in the living room with everyone else, and hooked up while the others slept. Not sex, but close. They had kept it a secret for three years. What I found most infuriating is that they should have told me before Amber moved across the country to live with us. Jack chose not to tell me when I was thinking about asking her to be my maid of honor. This whole situation, everything could have been prevented if they had just told me what they did.


That summer was hell and Amber was Satan. She had moved back home and was paying her rent share kicking and screaming. Her dad knew she would try to get out of it, it was thanks to him that we made it until September. Multiple times she called Jack, SCREAMING like I had never heard before, trying to convince us she didn't need to pay rent. I was so angry and heartbroken. Jack and I had repaired things, but I was having trouble trusting him. This was until around August when Amber called me in tears, saying that Jennifer had been terrible to her and they weren't friends anymore. She called me to confide in me and repair our friendship, this was really abnormal behavior. I hate to say that it worked, I am a sucker for being needed. I was so happy that we could put it all behind us, because it hurt too much to keep thinking about. Plus, I still hadn't worked up the courage to remove her as my MOH. I just wanted a best friend and she was saying all the right things.


**Fast forward:** 

Jack and I were married fall 2012. Amber was an abysmal MOH, it's not quite in her nature to do things for others but she tried and I appreciated it. Our friendship was okay for a while but we were growing apart. I struggled letting go of what had happened in Boston, though not openly. I never ever wanted to move back to Tulsa, but due to an unfortunate family situation I had no choice. This left me extremely depressed for about two years. Amber slowly stopped talking to me, I was a lot less fun when I was miserable. Amber's behavior became repetitive. She'd grow close with someone, break their heart, and decide she didn't need them anymore. Months later she'd change her mind and decide to miss them, and come back. She inadvertently toyed with all of us. Every time she would say all the right things and I'd fall right back into her weird fucking trap.


**Early 2014:** 

Amber suddenly comes back into my life, after months of living with a different best friend. She has met someone and after four months they have decided to get married. She asks me to be her maid of honor claiming, ""I couldn't imagine anyone but you."" I was wary, I forced her to talk to me openly and honestly about our friendship. I requested consistency, honesty, love, and companionship and she agreed to all of it. Her new fiance is a super sweet guy, I thought he had changed her. She was different and I was thrilled. As the summer came to a close, I noticed that our friendship was not working out exactly as she promised.

It was after I threw Amber a (rather expensive) engagement party that I found out what she had done to her friend Heather. Heather contacted me after the engagement party and tore me a new one. Apparently Amber had moved in with her the previous fall with her fiance, treated her like shit (surprise), created hell in Heather's marriage, and the kicker: she had asked Heather to be her maid of honor. It turns out that Amber never told Heather that she had changed her mind and I was now her MOH. Amber made Heather help her move into a new apartment and stopped talking to her for months (without thanking her, surprise). And out of nowhere Heather had received an invite from me to Amber's engagement party. Heather. Was. Pissed. And Amber had lied to me *again*. Heather and I ended up bonding over shared trauma from Amber, realizing that Amber had always purposefully and obviously tried to keep her friends from hanging out or talking or even meeting.

I realized that I was an idiot and that I never should have trusted her. I never told her that Heather and I had spoken, so she has no idea that I know what she did to Heather. So I stopped deliberately contacting her. Amber never, ever initiates communication with me and never tries to hang out, so I haven't seen her since. 

**Here is my problem:**

- I found the best bud companion I had always wanted upon moving back to Tulsa, Beth is always there for me and says thank you when I do things for her and hugs me and makes me laugh. Amber doesn't like her, naturally. 

- Beth's boyfriend and I go way back, he was part of our group of friends in HS. He got an internship in Portland summer 2014, coincidentally where Jack and I were looking to move already. Amber knew we were interested in moving there, so when the four of us took a trip to Portland to move Beth's bf in, she tried very hard to go with us. (Over all four of our dead bodies would we let that happen, she has a terrible history with road trips.)

- Upon returning, Amber grilled me to see if we had decided to move (we told her IDK yet), she claimed she wanted to move anywhere we were moving because she couldn't imagine not living with us. Apparently she now remembers her Boston experience rather fondly. I understand her now though, she is leeching (as she does) and very obnoxiously using me to get out of our home town. I am desperate to see that this does not happen, I need to get away from Amber. She is toxic and she destroys my self esteem. 

- Beth's BF got a job offer starting June 2015 in Portland, so Jack and I have have decided to not miss this incredible opportunity and are moving with him. *We still have not told anyone.*

- Amber's wedding is in October 2015. I have barely spoken to her since October 2014 and from what I can tell I am still her MOH. 

- Jack and I are still kind of close with her brother, who married my HS best friend. I am worried that if I drop out of the wedding they will think I'm a horrible, cruel person and I will have ruined a 12 year friendship with them and their families. That's a nightmare to me, I would hate carrying around the knowledge that I had hurt them.

- If I don't end my friendship with Amber by June 2015 and if I fly back for her wedding, I am worried she will decide to move to Portland, thinking we are still friends. I really don't want to continue pretending she didn't hurt me repeatedly, over and over. I don't want to pretend everything is okay.



 **How do I get out of this wedding without burning bridges and hurting anyone? How do I move to Portland without fear of her moving there too? What is the RIGHT thing to do? Am I being cruel? Should I continue being friends with Amber and learn to accept her faults?**"

I've busted my behind to get an M.S. in clinical psychology and then opted to go to a 2 year psychoanalytic-training internship after that... which gave a $400 a month stipend. Before grad school? Oh, well I worked an agency for $13.50 an hour... where I was punched multiple times in the head by a HUGE schizophrenic teenager. 

There was a stint, in my years before school that I worked as a server and made *really good money* but I was unfulfilled. So, I quit that after four years and took on a tutoring position... and went $2000 into debt. YAGH!

Here's my point. I LOVE what I do. I LOVE working with my clients and I want to keep on doing it. In fact, I have raised my fee significantly and have changed my cancellation policy to increase the predictability of my income and, therefore, the stability of my attention and presence in the consulting room. Truth be told, I still have some very low fee clients that I am committed to continuing treatment with for the long term.

BUT, I'm tired of this attitude within the mental health field that it is our duty to sacrifice for our clients - our health, our finances, our relationships. Sure, there is the ever present nod to ""self-care"" but it is often frowned upon when actually put in place, a sign of not *quite* being committed to the work.

All this to say, I would like this to change. It is not a zero sum game. Money is a symbol. With more money, I can go to yoga classes or get a monthly massage. I can eat organic food and have time to prepare my meals. I can get regular consultation and afford my OWN psychotherapy. I can pay for classes to increase my skills as a therapist. My mother is in her 70's. It would be so great if I could fly up to see her every few months or fly her down to spend time with me. This would lead to such an increase in both of our qualities of life!

The bottom line: If I have more money, I can be there - present, focused, healthy, alert - for each and every one of my clients. There wouldn't be that ever-present shadow of burnout or that lingering fear (""What if one of my clients leaves...?! GULP) that I hear so many of my colleagues talking about!

What if, instead of looking at therapists who are finding ways to make a very good income (again, which translates to time for exercise, good food, energy for volunteering, a connected social life) with suspicion and envy, what if we might look upon them as examples to be respected, emulated even?

What do YOU all think?! Do you notice this mentality among your therapist and social work colleagues?"

She will let any coworker do anything he wants to her anyplace and anytime, regardless of age, race, looks, or marital status. She dresses, acts, and talks like a slut.

I happen to be the official office slut where I work. My name is Jennifer and I'm 20 years old, my breasts are a perky 34B with an equally perky ass. Almost every guy in my building has fucked me at least once. I've even let a couple of 19 year old interns make me their property in my car during lunch. Ive always worn short skirts and thigh highs so the men have easy access to my cleanly shaven pussy and tight little asshole. Everyone knows I don't wear panties because of all the peep shows I give the men around the office. All a man has to do is call me into an office or bathroom and bend me over and spread my legs exposing my slutty married wet pussy and ass. 

All while I beg them to fuck me hard as they can and call me a dirty whore then they fill me with thick rope after rope of their portent cum. Almost every day I go home to my husband, cum dripping from both of my fuckholes If only he had any clue what happens when his wife is at work for the day. I want this RP to focus on all of my escapades throughout my average work day. From when I leave for work kissing my oblivious husband good bye, to when I leave the office wiping cum from my lips as I leave through the front door. If you want to add/change anything let me know. I'm always open to new ideas.

- Ideally, I wouldn't mind working for either company after my internship if I was given the opportunity. Which one is more likely to offer a full-time position and have a better culture/work-life balance?

- Which of these two programs would give me the upper hand in my resume given that I decide to pursue other companies?

(CAN),cantoes,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2vl2a4/moving_from_toronto_to_seattle_good_idea_to_buy/,"Hello, I am a student (age 22) and will be starting work at a tech company in Washington after graduation (base salary ~100k).  Having done multiple internships and jobs, I will be graduating without student debt (whoo) and some amount of cash (~16k CAD).   

I would like to get a general sentiment around buying a car here (Ontario) and driving it to the US.  This will be my first car as well.  The car would serve a few purposes:

1. Bring some of my belongings with me that I normally wouldn't normally bring on a plane and without shipping it (cookware, desktop computer, etc...)
2. Let me easily search for housing once I get there
3. A ride for when I want to get out of the city, haul sports equipment around, or furnish my new place.
4. A short cross-country adventure :)

I've done a bit of research and it looks like there are some checkmarks to tick, such as :

* passing EPA (need a letter from manufacturer)
* buying a North American built car (not necessary, but avoids tarrifs at border)
* register at washington DMV and pass driving test there (cannot exchange ontario license)
* other?  

I've briefly contemplated 2010 or 2011 models of Toyota Corolla, Toyota Matrix, Honda Civic, and Ford Focus -- something reliable and cheap-ish to repair in case anything goes wrong.

Given the exchange rate, this seems feasible .  But there seems to be a lot of misinformation out there and may not be getting the full picture.  I would like to know if there are any glaring issues with my thought process, as well as any experience anyone may have doing this, and other things that I should consider."

Mine


* First internship: (Interning on hotel design firm): Maybe 300

* Second internship : Huge hospital but not counting this as I decided on absolutely nothing (though this building would probably double my tally)

* First real Job (2001) (small provincial practice, mixed): 150 tops (on sunday more as i dd a church)

* Move to London work for big practice: 4k in big office development (i did cladding so i'm counting all of them as using 'my' stuff) and 1.5k through a concert hall  (did the front doors, totally counting that)

* Boom time small firm: we went bust before it opened, not counting these

* Other small firm: Couple of office buildings, 300 people

* BIG HOTEL CO: hard so say they were all mine as i wasn't design architect but 2500 rooms of people staying in rooms that i have had some influence on.


So potentially 8750 people going through my 'work' every day, I rather hope i didn't fuck it up. I oddly feel most responsible for the last lot, i had less influence but they pay every time.

I'm currently getting my Master's in SpEd along with my teaching certifications, and I'm at a bit of a crossroads. In my program, we can skip student teaching and do a year-long internship where we teach as the teacher of record in a school and receive full benefits and pay. I have the option to do either, but I'm concerned about which one is best for me.

Financially, obviously the internship is better, as the opportunity cost of not being paid for six months works out to about 25K. I can get student loans to make up for it (I'll have to take a night class in order to keep my full-time status), but I'd prefer not to take on debt if I don't have to. 

On the other hand, I've never taught before, and I'm terrified of walking into a classroom on the first day of next school year and having no idea what to do. I'm doing my practicum right now, where I spend six hours a week in a life skills classroom, but that's nowhere near the same as being the teacher of record.

I'm also concerned about the possibility of finding a job. I'll be student teaching in the fall, and it seems like there won't be very many job openings for the spring.

So, did you guys find student teaching helpful enough to make up for the opportunity cost? If you could have skipped it and gone straight to teaching as the teacher of record, would you?"

Recent college grad here who just began full time employment. I've spent the better part of the last couple of months educating myself on money management and retirement planning, mostly from this sub. I'll be filing my taxes this month, and I was hoping for some advice about a combination of Roth/Traditional IRAs that I've been considering. I did an internship in 2014 and made about 13k, so this is my first real tax return. 

I know that Roth is generally the go-to IRA for people my age, but the benefits of a traditional IRA such as a lower taxable income and the hedge against uncertain future interest rates are appealing to me. Can the strategy of doing an allocation like 70% roth, 30% traditional (or another ratio) be beneficial and allow me to enjoy the best of both worlds? (I don't think it matters as much for this return as it will for next year, when the possibility of putting a certain amount in a traditional could get me in a lower tax bracket).

If the answer is yes, should I take a different approach towards each account in terms of selecting funds? Are certain funds more suitable for a roth over a traditional and vice versa?

Had a good laugh and closed it.

Explanation: if you're familiar with switches, you know that they can be configured to display a 'message of the day' (motd) upon logging in that typically displays between entering the username and password.

Cue the intern, as I'll call him here. He's a good kid who really wants to learn, but some times I wonder if all the neurons are firing in the same direction...

He was supposed to check our environment if anything was still pointing to the old Radius server, so he's going through our switches and routers to check. Apparently he had never seen the default motd banner for this particular line of switches before, as most of our switches &amp; routers are configured to display the same text, some semi-legal blurb along the lines of 'this is a private system, unauthorised use can result in penalties'. However, it turns out that some of them are lacking this little line of config for some reason.

One explanation later and now Intern is also aware of this."

2vnd2p,1,2015-02-12,I feel like I've sunk so deep that I've forgot which way is the surface,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2vnd2p/i_feel_like_ive_sunk_so_deep_that_ive_forgot/,"I just need to write all of this out of me and it is probably going to be a quite lengthy post, but I could use some advice and support so I'm extremely grateful if anyone reads through it. 

It's hard for me to point out when I first started feeling depressed, but now I don't even remember the time when I felt different. I remember when I had to take various psychological tests a few years ago to determine if I am mentally suitable and healthy for my studies and I passed all of them. The results were that I am very confident, have high self-esteem, good under pressure etc. I also know that when I was taking these tests I wasn't completely honest in all of the aspects. I kind of figured out what is expected of me and I remembered how I was before the depression so I pretended to still be that person and didn't want the depression to get in the way of me achieving my dreams. I thought that once I get over it, I will be that person again. But I didn't realize at that point that it will get only worse.

It's hard to do, but when I look at myself now, I can see that all my confidence is gone, I'm completely incapable of making any decisions, I avoid any responsibility and just want to be left alone. 
So when I started realizing that this depression will not just magically disappear, I decided that I need a change in my life. I got the opportunity to do an exchange semester in a different country. Even though it would prolong my studies for another year, I decided that it would be worth it if it means that I could get my life back on track. And at first this seemed to work. New environment, people and experiences took up all of my time so I didn't have time to think about anything else. I even met a someone and fell in love. But then the semester got to the end and I had to decide what am I going to do next. I couldn't go back to my studies back in the middle of the year so I had to either find a place for an internship or take a time-out for half a year. I wanted to have it all, so I thought I'd find an internship in the country where I did my exchange semester, so i could stay with the person I fell in love with. But it's a very specific field so finding an internship was hard, I got a great internship offer from one of the biggest companies in Europe in another country that I turned down to stay with him here. Then the time ran out and I still didn't have an internship. But I thought that will not be the end of the world, I could just get a job for half a year here and just relax until I need to get back to my studies at home. And this is where it all went back to shit. 

I was done with my studies, all the other exchange students that had become my friends flew back home, I didn't have an internship, a job or a home. I moved in with my boyfriend and his friends temporarily until I find a job and we can afford a place for ourselves.  And now that I am not occupied with anything anymore, I'm starting to realize that the depression never left, it was just a few months of distracting myself from it. Now I sit at 'home' with nothing to do, all my friends are back in my home country, I don't speak the native language here and English is not my native language either. I used to have a wide circle of friends and a very active social life but now I can't even force myself to talk to anyone. I am too afraid and discouraged to keep trying to find a job, I have no confidence - even if I find a job opportunity, in my head I just think ""But why would anyone hire me, if there are so many more competent people out there."" I spend a lot of time crying with no real reason. I don't think I have cried so much in my entire life that I have this past few months. My boyfriend is extremely supportive, he knows about my struggles with depression and tries to help as much as he can. But I still feel so alone, I feel like I am ruining his life with my constant sadness and then I just keep crying because I am crying all the time. I don't want to burden him with my problems and make him feel guilty that I stayed here because of him and am miserable now. But I don't have any other friends or social support here and can't really tell my friends back home about this because I am so ashamed of it. I feel like a burden to everyone and just wish i could disappear. Every night I lie awake in bed and just keep wishing that I didn't wake up the next morning. There are still a few good days, when I don't feel the constant anxiousness, the feeling you get when you realize in the morning you have slept in only the feeling stays with you the whole day with no reason. But even on these days, I wish i could just stop existing, just so it would all be over. I am not suicidal, would never hurt myself but I just wish there was a way of deleting my whole existence. 

I know that there is also the possibility of going back home, where I have all my friends and family but if I think about it, I feel like I'm a huge failure. And I don't think anything would change there. I also feel like I'm not giving my all with anything because I'm afraid that I will still fail after trying my best. It is easier to cope with failures if I know that I didn't put the maximum effort into it, but I also know it is also a lot harder to succeed at anything with this mentality. 

I have no idea where to start with fixing anything and how to get a purpose for my life again. I don't even have a reason to get out of bed in the morning. I had to choose between being with friends and my family, career/internship and love and I feel like every possible choice would have been the wrong one. "

She will let any coworker do anything he wants to her anyplace and anytime, regardless of age, race, looks, or marital status. She dresses, acts, and talks like a slut.

I happen to be the official office slut where I work. My name is Jennifer and I'm 20 years old, my breasts are a perky 34B with an equally perky ass. Almost every guy in my building has fucked me at least once. I've even let a couple of 19 year old interns make me their property in my car during lunch. Ive always worn short skirts and thigh highs so the men have easy access to my cleanly shaven pussy and tight little asshole. Everyone knows I don't wear panties because of all the peep shows I give the men around the office. All a man has to do is call me into an office or bathroom and bend me over and spread my legs exposing my slutty married wet pussy and ass. 

All while I beg them to fuck me hard as they can and call me a dirty whore then they fill me with thick rope after rope of their portent cum. Almost every day I go home to my husband, cum dripping from both of my fuckholes If only he had any clue what happens when his wife is at work for the day. I want this RP to focus on all of my escapades throughout my average work day. From when I leave for work kissing my oblivious husband good bye, to when I leave the office wiping cum from my lips as I leave through the front door. If you want to add/change anything let me know. I'm always open to new ideas.

2vnlkz,5,2015-02-12,Underpaid and overworked. Love the company and need advice on if I should ask for a raise.,MidnightThirty,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2vnlkz/underpaid_and_overworked_love_the_company_and/,"Hi PF,

As the title states, I am feeling a bit under paid. For the last two and a half years I have worked for a small fast growing software startup as an analyst. When I started two years ago we had just over 70 people and are about to blast through a couple hundred employees and I am still the only ananlyst. My formal title is financial analyst, but in reality I do all of the sales and marketing ""business"" analytics as well.

To give you some background - I started as an intern at $10 an hour and every six months managed to raise my salary bit by bit. I graduated a year ago in April with an Econ degree and at that point they gave me my most recent raise from $42k to $55k.

Lately I've been getting all sorts of praise from the executive leadership (CEO, CFO, CMO, etc.), and my boss told me that he considers me to be equivalent to the Sr. financial analysts he had at his last job. Funny thing is - his last company reached out to me for a job before he started and they were paying $65-70k for entry level analysts... We have one other analyst who works in a different department who is paid [redacted] almost double my salary and a higher bonus %, but he does have a master's degree.

Normally we have annual reviews/raises on our start date anniversary, but mine was skipped last year because of my raise in April and my start date of October. April is coming up again and I have a feeling my boss wants to make me wait for October instead... I will be getting my standard annual bonus next month and there will be a performance review involved going over why I am getting the bonus they are giving. I'm considering bringing up then that I feel underpaid for the amount of work I do (60 hours a week most weeks) and value I have added in the past year and feel I deserve a raise and promotion to Sr. Analyst.

I guess my question is - should I just wait until my normal review in October to bring up a raise/promotion, or ask to be considered now and would it be too audacious to ask for $70-75k expecting them to go down to $65k? I really want to stay here at least until the IPO (2 or 3 years away), so changing companies isn't really an option.

I've never asked for a raise, so any advice is appreciated!

TL;DR
Started as an intern and worked my way up. Feeling underpaid (typical since I didn't change companies) and want to ask for a raise/promotion before my official annual review. Currently at $55k and would like to ask for $70-75k hoping to land at $65k+. Any advice?"
2vnm7v,9,2015-02-12,I scored an internship with a tech company and I couldn't be more excited!,Untgradd,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/2vnm7v/i_scored_an_internship_with_a_tech_company_and_i/,"So long story short: I have a summer internship lined up with a startup in California to do development work!

I have had a privileged life, but that hasn't spared me from difficulty. My mom died when I was a kid, I got into a lot of trouble in high school, and earlier this year at the age of 22 I was finally diagnosed with persistent major depression. I got really close to failing out of college, grew distant from some of my friends, and overall felt pretty worthless for a long time. Recently I was prescribed an anti-depressant that really works for me, and while it will take a long time to repair my GPA (at this point I'm just trying to get a diploma as I think honors is pretty far out of the question) I am finally doing well in school again for the first time since I was about 12.

It just so happened that as I was getting my shit together, my dad ran into a dude in a hotel bar and got to talking -- he was in the tech sector and I am a computer science major so my dad got his card so I could contact him about internships. At first I didn't hear back, which wasn't very encouraging, and I forgot about it for a couple months. In the meantime I sort of looked for summer opportunities, but I had grown so distant from the career counselors in my major that I had no real plan or networking to help secure an internship. 

Out of nowhere, just a week and a half ago, the guy from the bar contacts me and asks if I'm still interested in an internship. I tell him that I am indeed still looking for summer programs and within a day I'm doing a four hour intensive interview with the team at this startup in California. They're small, and launched only three years ago, but they were funded with 20+ mil and have successfully brought their product to market. I found myself talking to the CEO, CTO, team leaders, other developers, it was crazy!

So I thought it all went well, and a day later they conditionally offered me the job, but they had to contact my references before it was official. It took them about a week to do that, during which time I was so nervous that they changed their mind or that my references weren't good enough. Well, yesterday at 7PM I got a call right as I walked out of my last class and they offered me the internship!

This is a bit of a brag, but I'm so excited I can't help but share it: they're gonna pay my ass $17,000 over the course of three months to go and live outside San Francisco so I can develop software with their team. It's more than I've ever made a job before in my life! 

I finally feel like all the years I've spent learning to code, spending tons of personal learning Node.js (which happens to be a technology they use and that not many developers are familiar with yet), is actually worth something. I feel validated. I feel so god damn good, and just feeling good makes me feel even *more* good because it's such a departure from where I was just six months ago.

So that's why I'm happy. AAHHHH I'm so excited!! "
2vnpca,1,2015-02-12,Me [21M] having some trouble dealing with emotional fallout regarding my ex [21F] of about 1 year,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2vnpca/me_21m_having_some_trouble_dealing_with_emotional/,"I've been pondering posting about this for quite some time but I keep going back and forth on how much it bothers me, but I just read something on here earlier today that gave me a good way to word it. So here it goes, no throwaway cause everyone I know already has an idea about this all. Hopefully I won't let this get too long, I just feel the need to flush out the background.  

**tl;dr:** My ex and I had a relationship in which she guilt tripped and manipulated me frequently, and she was extremely depressed. I tried to help her, but eventually I realized I had to break up with her. She insulted me publicly on social media, actively sabotaged relationships, and cut me out of her life. Now she's still around me and my friends ALL the time and acts like she never did anything wrong, and no one else seems to think so either.

My ex, let's call her Rose, and I are both in college together. We participate in a lot of the same extracurriculars, and are in the same grade. We have known each other since Fall of 2011, and started talking more in Fall 2012, starting to date officially in around March or so of 2013.  

We had a great relationship. We always had a lot of fun together. I found her to be intelligent, attractive, and just generally fun to be around. As far as I know, she always thought the same of me.  

Now, I have always been very confident. She was always someone that tends to get nervous, and also tends to get down on herself very easily (for example, back in high school she managed to make a top chair in her district band junior year, and failed to do the same senior year, after which she didn't go to school for a week out of depression).  

So things were going great, until around April of 2013. Each of us went out for a new extracurricular (a university tour guide, which has an intense application process). It was my second time applying, and her first time. I got it, she didn't. When this happened, she didn't talk to me, sleep, or let herself be around anyone for about 48 hours. About a week later, we each went out for leadership positions in our university marching band and, you guessed it, I got the position I went out for and she did not.  

To compound things even further, her and I had been working to go to the gym together that semester as I had been working hard to lose weight. All in all, I lost 20lbs that semester primarily through pretty big dietary changes. She wasn't able to lose any weight, which is something she had always been self conscious about.  

After that... the relationship started to take a turn for the worst rather quickly. Over time, she got more and more in her own head about how ""inferior"" she was to me and how ""perfect"" I was. How I ""got everything I'd ever gone out for"" and had never experienced disappointment in my life. How I had an internship in my field, how I was smarter than her, how I'd never experienced any sort of depression (not true). She would not hear ANYTHING I had to say regarding any of this, or how wonderful she was.  

Over the next months, she began to... well, become emotionally abusive, I would say. Idk if that is true, I feel like I'm crazy even trying to talk about it, which is why I don't really admit that to any of my friends. When I would have to do something for one of my extracurriculars, she would cry and tell me I didn't need to go and if I cared about her AT ALL I wouldn't remind her that I ""got these things"" and she didn't. This obviously.. hurt. If I tried to talk to anyone else about how I was feeling (since I couldn't go to her) and she found out, she would scream at me and cuss me out for talking to anyone else about her ""behind her back"". Eventually, she began to cut herself regularly and lock herself in her room. However, if I got fed up with her behavior and tried to go back to my apartment so I could do some homework, she would run out and literally hold onto me and not let go until I agreed to say. I could never spend a night by myself at my apartment, lest she cry or cut herself more. It even went as far as her once calling me 15+ times and texting me 30+ times in a 20 minute period when I left because I was fed up with her treating me the way she did.  

I convinced her to go to counseling which she quit because it ""wouldn't help, they don't understand me"". We tried couples counseling, where anytime a real issue was addressed she would say we were ganging up on her. Nothing was working, things were getting worse. Eventually, I felt that I could not take the emotional manipulation and guilt tripping anymore, and also felt that as long as she was using me as an emotional crutch that she would never get better. So, I broke up with her. I still cared about her, but the relationship just wasn't healthy for either of us on any level.  

After the breakup, she wanted to stay friends. Fine by me, I'm friends with all my ex's. As you can imagine.. this didn't work out well. It was abundantly clear that she wanted to get back together with me. She would say she was ""better, 100%"" and that it wouldn't be a problem anymore. She would accuse me of lying to her about wanting to be friends if I tried to distance myself slightly, since she still clearly wanted to be more than friends. This included calling my a liar and cussing me out on Twitter, though she eventually deleted her account and all her tweets. If she caught wind of me being involved with another girl, she would track them down and do everything in her power to make sure it would NOT happen.  

Since then, she was finally convinced by some mutual friends to cut me out of her life for a time, since she had never gotten over me. This let her go over me and, obviously, resulted in her completely cutting me out of her life. She is best friends with one of my roommates, and is at my apartment ALL the time, often with her new flings. She will be living in this apartment next year for grad school with one roommate, while the rest of us are graduating. She doesn't think she has done anything wrong, and thinks I just need to get over myself and the whole situation. ""I managed it, why can't you?""  

Sorry this got so long everyone. I've clearly just had a lot I've wanted to get off my chest with this. I'm so fucking angry all the time about the way this all worked out. I can't even fucking stand being around her. I worked my ass off to help her, and gave her everything I had. She responded by manipulating and guilt tripping me, actively sabotaging relationships of mine (and succeeding, at least two separate times), and then acting like nothing ever happened. Everything else in her life is perfect now. She got tour guide, and band leadership, and all of our mutual friends are as close with her as ever. She has never been admonished for any of her behavior. No one seems to even believe that anything ever happened, and I just am having a lot of internal conflict over how much I care and cared, and how hard I worked, and how it ended up for me.  

Maybe I need to just hear the cold hard truth from someone. Maybe I'm just a little bitch. I should probably go to counseling but every time I have an appointment I go in feeling fine and don't have anything to say and just feel like I'm being stupid. Does anyone have any advice for me? Or any kind words? Maybe some not-so-kind words? I know I wasn't perfect in the breakup and handling of the fallout. I made mistakes. But I just can't reconcile this outcome.

**EDIT:** I can easily provide clarification on anything necessary in the comments, I just was wary of the length my post had already reached."

I am a soon to be new graduate whose initial plan was to do my masters immediately following my undergrad. I have specific interests within CS (distributed computing) that I thought would be best served by going to graduate school before starting work. So I applied to a bunch of schools back in the fall, and while I was waiting for responses I applied to just one job, a software engineer position at one of the Big 4. I had previously been rejected for internships from almost all of them so I was not optimistic. Somehow I got the job, decided to forego graduate school due to my interest in the team/project, and was planning on reapplying. However, another huge surprise came in the form of an offer of admission from an Ivy League school whose CS program is ranked in the top 10, WITH full funding which is quite rare for an MS. So, my question is, which path would you guys choose and for what reason?

TLDR: Intended to do MS immediately following undergrad, sent off applications, applied for cool job, got cool job, got better than expected offers of admission for graduate school, now stuck."

However, writing it all up was very cathartic, and advice is welcome.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2vnzbu/i_was_going_to_post_this_on_rfindapath_but_typing/,"Hi everyone,

I need help aligning where I am with my career and where I really want to be. I feel like I started off on the wrong path, and now I have no idea how to get where I want to be. My apologies, this is LONG, but I need to get it out.

**What I know**: When I think about what makes me happiest, it's working with animals. I've been this way since I was a tiny little kid. There are a lot of unrelated things I'm interested in and I think I would be good at, but when it comes down to it, animals make me happiest. I am also not the kind of person who can sit behind a desk all day. I truly hope that my current job (where I'm typing this) will be the last traditional desk job I ever hold. I want to work hard, be challenged, and come home exhausted every day. That's the dream.

**College**: I graduated with a BA in Environmental Studies in 2011, and was a C+/B- kind of student for the most part. Don't get me wrong, I value my college experience and really did enjoy my major, but if we're being honest I don't think the environmental field was ever really for me. It was more something I chose because I knew I *could* do it as opposed to *wanting* to do it. I naively thought that I would eventually be able to wheedle my into some kind of wildlife conservation job or something. Obviously, that never happened.

Looking back, I wasn't ready for college. I don't regret my experiences and, truly, I learned so much. I love my alma mater. But because of a combination of anxiety issues, not knowing how to properly study (I was one of those people who eased through high school and had no idea how to study for college), not really being all-in on my major, and misplaced priorities, I was not as successful as I could have been. I still have ~$30,000 in student debt.

**Career**: During college and after graduation, I was never able to land a single job or internship even remotely related to the environmental field. My resume is all over the place because I've always done whatever I could to make money. I worked part time and lived at home for a long time, then I got a secretarial position at a hospital (and even then only because my mom knew the recruiter). For the past 2.5 years, I've been kind of stuck here. I live on my own now, but still work two jobs. I dabbled in taking some courses, but time, money, and distance were all problems.

**Near Future**: My boyfriend and I are (hopefully, if all goes well) uprooting and moving to another state this Spring because he has a pending job offer. I'm seeing this as an opportunity to get my shit together and really work on developing myself and figuring out my career. We'll be in central Florida, which is so rich with nature and wildlife and farms that I can't just not take advantage of it. (In contrast, we've lived largely in city and suburban areas up north where opportunities to work with animals have proven slim.)

So here I have a few dilemmas. Obviously, I need a job in our new town. I live paycheck to paycheck right now, so am going in with almost nothing in my savings. On one hand, I could get a standard 9-5 job and probably make some pretty decent money, plus get benefits. It would probably be a receptionist or secretary or whatever kind of position, which I can do pretty easily, but I don't enjoy. Again, I am not a desk person.

On the other hand, I can take the route that might leave me poor and without benefits, but with a lot of flexibility. This would be working in retail, food service, or any number of things that won't limit me to 9-5 and so will give me some space to do school, volunteering, or whatever else I might want/need. I'd be on my feet, facing new challenges, and generally not bored. However, the pay for these roles usually sucks and doesn't offer benefits. The dream would be to find something that pays well, keeps me active, and puts me in some kind of position that could play into my education. Hell, I'd happily work at a front desk if it also meant useful experience with something I love. I'm casting a wide net with sending out applications, but the bites have been few on both ends of the spectrum.

So finding a job is one thing. At this point, I feel like all I can do is throw myself out there and hope that not only does someone catch me, but it's someone I want to work for and who will fit my needs.

But finding a job in the immediate future is not the biggest issue, and almost 850 words later we're starting to get to what I really came here to talk about. I need to go back to school regardless of what my work schedule works like. A low-key job with flexible hours would make it easier, but is not the deciding factor.

Not too far from where I'll be living is the University of Florida, and I'm really excited about the potential of going there for grad school (so if any Gators are reading this, I'd welcome any advice you can offer, or anyone you can put me in touch with who might be able to help!). I've done a lot of research on the different grad school programs that interest me and related career paths, and my top choices (in no particular order) are Zoology, Wildlife Ecology &amp; Conservation, or Entomology &amp; Nematology.  All of them present their own challenges - I've never been the best at the hard sciences or math (especially math...), and I almost failed Ecology in college. However, I feel like I'm finally ready to commit to working as hard as necessary in school to reach my goals. If I don't understand something, I want to study it until I do. No more blowing off discussing problems with the teacher because I want to take a nap before my next class. No more cramming. If I'm going to add several thousand more dollars to my debt, I need to make it worthwhile.

Okay, so let's say I've taken the GRE, gotten a decent score, and chosen my major. Now what? The grad school requires a 3.0 GPA minimum, I have a 2.8. In addition, all pre-req information I can find says that you need to have undergrad experience in biology, chemistry, math, and even physics - I have a little in bio, but nothing else. I even actively avoided taking these classes because I didn't think I could do it. So what do I do - can I enroll as an undergrad and take these courses? Do I need to get another Bachelor's degree? Where do I even start?

The only other thing I'm really interested in doing is Veterinary Technology. I know it's extremely difficult, long hours, no respect, emotionally taxing, lots of poop. I can handle that and will even welcome it if it means getting to take care of animals. The big thing deterring me from this path is the money. I just don't know if I can go forever making $11/hr. If it weren't for that, it wouldn't even be a question.

**TL;DR** Majored in the wrong thing, not sure how to get back on track.

2vo687,1,2015-02-12,Trying to get my life together... Again... Looking for some encouraging words. (Long),[deleted],ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/2vo687/trying_to_get_my_life_together_again_looking_for/,"This is going to sound like a first world problems rant, but everyone's got their own shit to deal with.

I go through bouts of self reflection every few years, and the last few weeks have been a doozy.  As a little background on me, I was the typical ADHD-PI undiagnosed kid who was too smart to show the signs until it was too late.

It started in 1st grade when I would constantly forget to put my name on my papers before I turned them in.  It baffled my parents, and they (with the help of my teacher, Mr. Littel, who will always be one of my favorites for this) set up a system where I would get an action figure for every x number of papers I turned in with my name on it.  Let me tell you, getting Iron Man was some good incentive there.

I cruised through grades 1-7 with almost no effort.  I was constantly moving, and was making new friends every 2 years, and seeing new places, and life was great.  Finally, in grade 8, it caught up with me, and I got into a sneaky downward spiral of not completing projects and just putting them off for the first half of the year.  I almost got my first, and only F, in a class.  The experience of having your parents empty out your backpack only to find half completed papers that were never turned in...  The shame of it kept me from falling into that trap again.  There was legitimate fear there that everyone in the world would forever feel that disappointment that I saw in their faces as they kept pulling paper after paper with no teacher markings on it.  No grades.  If I couldn't do my best, why even turn it in?

Fast forward through the awkward HS years.  I graduated with an A- average.  Got into my first choice of college and proceeded to fail miserably.  I couldn't get up, couldn't go to class, couldn't concentrate on studying.  Then I found my major.  It was a combination of business and art, and I got to work with my hands, learn all kinds of new things, and I had a talent for it!  I succeeded!  I graduated with an eventual 3.6 from college after my grades were at a low point of 1.8!  Sheer force of will to rectify my situation pulled me through to enter the job market... in 2009.  Lowest point of the recession.  Entry level jobs were being taken by people with 5-10 years of experience.  I had to take an unpaid internship and work reception at a gym for 12 hours a day just to pay rent.  I did it though.  I moved from the gym to a wine sales job, and did design on the side for a couple of years, then I got a job as a design engineer!  Not exactly what I went to school for, but it was an actual career move!  I was pushing through it all, making a career, and getting myself into a respectable position.  Ironic, because I failed out of engineering classes.

Then I got another DE job, and things got intense.  juggling 11 projects at once with intricate detailed requirements just got too much.  I started falling a little behind and the same pattern reasserted itself.  If I couldn't do it to the best of my abilities, why even try?  I started hiding mistakes, and it caught up with me.  I had a bit of a breakdown and couldn't figure out what was wrong with me.  My gf, a teacher, joked and said I might have ADHD.  That was when I first started looking at this sub.  I found a therapist.  I talked.  He talked.

I took a test (substituting ""Boss"" for ""Parent"" and ""Job"" for ""Schoolwork,"" etc.).  He told me that I scored about as high as anyone can score on both hyperactive and inattentive.  I got a prescription.  Holy shit I can function as a human!  It only took 27 years!

Now I'm actually doing really well, considering.  I've tripled my salary in the 5 years since school (mostly while off of meds!), but that's not the only measure of success, trust me.  I'm tired of the constant attention to details.  I don't care how many threads are in the screw that I'm speccing out, or what size tube is optimal.  This isn't what I want to do.  Everything so far is a story of how someone can adapt to their surroundings through force of will, not how someone can succeed by doing what they know they love and have a talent for.  I want that story.  So now I have to re-create a portfolio, and use skills that have atrophied, and it's nothing like I remember.

I have no grades to motivate me.  No teacher asking to look at my progress every week.  I don't have a group of people all working on the same thing to get me motivated, or to run ideas off of.  I have my family's support, but when I ask for help, I don't know how to ask for the right things.  I need someone to tell me that I can do it, that I just need to start, not tell me what I need to do, and remind me of what I'm not doing.

I feel like I'm getting a little livejournal-ey, now.  I know that a lot of people on this sub are just figuring out that they have a problem, or are happy with their successes and want to share, but everyone needs a little push to keep going when you've hit the point in the middle, where it's easy to settle for comfortable.  The middle is hard to let go of, because you can't ever go back to how it was once you know what you're capable of missing, and it takes so much to go further.  It's time to push myself again.

Edit:
TL;DR - I go through cycles of self discovery where I rehash all of my issues, and in the latest round, I'm looking for someone to tell me that I'm better than my current state of affairs, and I have proven that I have it in me to change myself."

Jamie is a 19 year old intern who is currently studying business at a local college; Abbie is a 32 year old business woman who recently became the head of an important company that leads most of the finance within the small town it's based in. 

After a few short minutes, Abbie walks out of her office with a folder full of paperwork. Jamie looks over his deck and sees her sexy hour-glass body, her long brunette hair swaying as she walked and her beautiful blue eyes looking around the entire office.  Abbie then walks over to Jamie's deck ""How you doing today, Jamie?"" Abbie stares into Jamie's eyes, ""I'm doing great, I love this experience. But it's hard work."" Abbie smiles ""Yes, it is, very different to how you do it in college."" Jamie gives a nervous laughs ""It is indeed."" Abbie puts down the folder of paperwork and leans over Jamie's deck ""We are having a staff meeting this afternoon and I was wondering if you could come to see how we handle staff meeting around here, it that okay with you?"" Abbie smiles at Jamie, ""Yes, that'll be great"" Jamie begins to feel weak with Abbie leaning quite close to him. ""Good, see you then"", as Abbie picks up her folder and walks around the office, Jamie gets a good look at her juicy ass and whispers to himself ""holy shit!”

Hours go by and it's time for the staff meeting, Jamie sits inside a small room which has nine other people sat around a long table. Abbie enters the room and opens up a presentation which shows business numbers and so on. Instead of watching the presentation, Jamie looks at Abbie's sexy body, thinking of all the dirty things he would do to her. He has a thing for older women; he loves how mature they are compared to girls his age. Jamie continues to admire Abbie's body as she nears the end of her presentation, ""Okay, thank you for attending our meeting for today and I hope to see you all soon."" as all the staff go back to work, Abbie walks up to Jamie ""Jamie, come to my office please.""  

Abbie is sat in her office working through mountains of paperwork as Jamie enters ""Jamie, take a seat."" Jamie sits down as Abbie looks through her computer, ""I just wanted to check with you on your intern ship and see how it's going."" Jamie looks at Abbie puzzled, ""Did you talk to me about that before?"" Abbie looks back at Jamie and smiles ""Why, yes, yes I did...which leads me to the real reason why I sent you to my office Jamie."" Abbie gets up from her deck and stands in front of Jamie, ""I've noticed that you've been ""looking"" at me, admiring my body, my ass...I saw you in the staff meeting...admiring me."" Jamie begins to tense up, feeling his cock twitch at the sight of Abbie standing in front of him.

He grips onto the chair as Abbie sits on his lap, Jamie gasps, but loves what's in front of him ""I know your horny for me, you want me and I want you...your sexy fit body, oh, I can feel that growing six pack..Oh..I can feel your growing cock!"" Jamie quickly looks down and sees his cock growing ""Yeah, you like that?"" he says as he smiles at Abbie. She begins to unbuckle his belt..""Don't worry about making to much noise, these walls are sound proof."" Jamie’s hard cock is soon unleashed and a smile comes upon Abbie’s face “Hmm, nice cock Jamie…mind if I suck it?” Not wanting to wait for a reply, Abbie takes Jamie’s cock down her mouth. The sensation of her mouth on his cock sends Jamie into full ecstasy and he soon grips her hair begging for more “Harder you bitch!!” Abbie begins to gag on his cock, spit and saliva soon crawls down Jamie’s cock as Abbie slowly removes her mouth “Hmm, I can feel your pre-cum” she lips the head of his cock and goes back to sucking, “Fuck Abbie, harder, harder!!!” Abbie can feel Jamie cumming so she takes her mouth out and jerks him off “Come on Jamie baby, cum for me!!!”  Jamie cums a huge load all over Abbie and himself…

They are both there, covered in cum. “Fuck, that felt so fucking good!” Abbie tries to catch your breath, “I've never had my cock sucked before” Jamie says as Abbie turns to him.. “Really, you've never had your cock sucked before?” Jamie nods as Abbie touches his leg. “Yes, in fact…I'm a virgin...” Jamie looks down, thinking of what Abbie would think. “Aw, Jamie, I'm sure you won’t be one for long now” She smiles, “You’ll lose your V soon” Abbie stands up and walks over to her deck. “I’m so into you Jamie, I've never been into younger men before and I know you men like older women.” Jamie gets really tense, Abbie reaches for the bottom of her desk, “Do you like to be dominated Jamie?” Jamie looks up at her with an innocent look in his eyes. “I don’t know, I'm just a virgin.” Abbie laughs “Aw, bless you… I can tell you Jamie, I’m into some sick shit!” Abbie then takes out a sleeping mask and throws it at him “Take it, it’s yours” Jamie looks confused “Why did you give me this?” Abbie smiles, “Jamie, I have a secret and I only want you to know about it!” Abbie writes her number down on paper on gives it to Jamie. “Call me if your interested!” Abbie then slowly reveals a little something that looks like a whip, Jamie slowly leaves the room “I will, see you tomorrow” Abbie laughs “See you later”. 

Jamie returns home and sits on his sofa, thinking about what Abbie said and whether he wants to see her secret, unable to resist, he calls her “Abbie, do you want to come over and have some fun?”

To be continued 

I hope you enjoyed this and are looking forward to chapter two!

I am currently working full-time, and interning to finish up my graduate degree in School Counseling. In the fall, I will quit my job to finish my internship by the end of the year. I will graduate in December, when the majority of jobs that open up in my field will be long term sub positions (or outside of school counseling entirely). 

My thoughts are that the time beteween December and August (when I could start at a new school as (hopefully) a full time counselor) would be the ideal time to have a baby. Any job I get during that time will be temporary, so it could instead be a good time to have a baby and bond for a few months. 

The husband thinks that money situation will be too hard (and I fully acknowledge that it will be tough during the time that we don't have my salary). He believes it will be better to wait until I get a permanent job in the fall, and then going for baby. I'm really worried about being pregnant my first year, because I don't think I'll be eligible for benefits and I'm worried that I won't have my contract renewed if I have to take time off for the baby.

I don't know how professional it would be, or if it would impact my career, to have a baby during my first year counseling. I don't know how crazy it would be the have a baby immediately after graduating with a Masters and unemployed. I just want some unbiased thoughts. "

I have a bit of a job search dilemma on my hands. At the start of the semester, I interviewed with a few small non-profits and now have an offer from one of them. The internship is in the same field I worked in prior to law school. My advisor warned that by having another internship in the same field I am sending a message to future employers that I am interested in this field exclusively (I am not sure I want to stay in this field). 

I just received the last of my grades, and they were definitely not what I expected. I am at a T20 school with a 3.2 curve, and my GPA is above 3.9. I keep hearing that 1L summer does not matter as long as you have something legal. Should I take this job or continue looking? Would my GPA give me any advantage for 1L summer opportunities? I would hate to reject this offer and end up with nothing for the summer. At the same time, I don't want to decrease my chances of getting a job in a different field if I do take this job, or potentially miss out on any other opportunities for this summer. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks guys. You are an awesome sub!

I've always liked technology and the degree itself has been somewhat interesting, but I mainly got into it because of job security. Now that I'm holding an actual IT position, I can't stand it. I hate not interacting with people and sitting in front of a computer screen all day. 

I need something more than this and IT just isn't doing it for my personality type or whatever it may be. I want something that isn't tedious IT tasks or centered around staring at a computer screen all day, but what? Has anyone used their IT degree to get a job that's not IT related? I worked with mentally disabled individuals for years and loved it but need enough of a salary to payoff school loans. Any insight or direction is much appreciated."

My questions for you:  
  
1. What types of jobs do electrical/computer engineers typically have in this field? (DSP, RF circuit design, antenna, board design, ASIC design, firmware, etc?)

How do I get my first real job?",BearsNecessity,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2vpgec/didnt_use_my_degree_bad_at_networking_have_only/,"So I obtained a math degree from Berkeley in 2010, but finished with a pretty poor GPA in college and felt that I wouldn't be good enough for grad school or a career in any major sector. I didn't do any internships either, leaving me in a bit of a networking hole too.   
  
I was also kind of burned out on the subject so I decided to go into writing, social media, digital content management, community organization, and all that jazz, but my career has kind of stalled out there too because I never got promoted by the company I work for (stuck in independent contracting hell) and have always been stuck in remote positions.    Now I'm back at home with my parents, 28, and only earning enough to pay for my food and rent. 
   
I'm wondering what the next best step would be for me. I've applied to a bunch of startups but have been rejected pretty quickly (maybe one or two phone interviews with 25 rejections). My networking skills are pretty poor. I am good with most applied math but have no practical experience. I'm trying to learn programming and data science too, but I'm probably months away from being close to fluent in any of them.  I've considered returning to college to learn some marketable skills like engineering, programming, computer science, but don't have the funds to pay for it.

I hope you like it! And if you want the rest, or any of my other work when it comes out, just PM me your email address and I'll add you to the mailing list I'm building!**

Under the burn of fifteen studio lights, Anderson smiled when he should smile and frowned when he should frown. He rattled off the C-stories (“…a little girl and her pet kangaroo…), powered through the B-stories (“…local politicians say the tax hike won’t affect small businesses…) and channeled every ghost of news anchors past he could for the hard hitting A-stories (“Terrorists in Syria have demanded the return of four captured insurgents…). 

He pinched his nose and lips at the last, placing his large hands on the desk in front of him in what he hoped would be a gesture of humanity and sincerity (“These are difficult times for us all…and our prayers go to their families…”).

Wrap story, brief banter, sign off, cue music, dim lights, hold. 

The director signaled him from behind the cameras and he found his breath coming back to him, his friendly but homely co-anchor beside him erupting into an explosion of chit-chatter. As the lights died the studio came to life around him, the drones rushing out to wipe down the desk and trade notes. Cameramen stretched, producers checked their cell phones and when he looked again at the director he shot him a thumbs up. Life as usual. He adjusted his suit, stood up tall and strode over from the desk into the prep area of the soundstage. 

“Great job, Bill.” The director called. There was that thumb again. 

“Keep it up, we’re back on in three.” He cleared his throat and sucked in his chest then, “Hear that everybody?! We’re back on in three hours! Get your shit together!” 

Anderson smiled and looked round at the bustling faces. They smiled when they noticed his eye contact, but not before. Not even his co-anchor, the always bubbly Melissa, who was still at their news desk and from the looks of it had caught a gaggle of sound techs in conversation. Anderson could almost hear her twang as she smacked her lips up and down at them, their eyes darting left and right for an escape. A chuckle escaped his lips. 

One in response sounded out next to him.

The first thing he noticed about her was her hair: it was red as a rose and thin, but the healthy variety. Down from there, his eyes took in her face, the way her body curved in with her little hips, her long legs standing in that must-be-practiced half bent stance of the eternally cocky, and of course how what looked like a more than an ample chest was being pulled down by a tight tee shirt promoting some Rock’n’Roll band or another.

“Can I help you with something, Mr. Anderson?” His eyes shot up to hers. She was grinning right at him. He gave her a slow smile back and said nothing, grabbing a Styrofoam cup off the table and pouring himself a coffee. He poured slow, taking another moment to take in the sight of her again: it did not disappoint. Her skin was fair and her face unpocked with acne scars or the tell-tale too much make-up he knew to be an indicator of disappointment ahead. Her thin red lips set themselves into grin and the whites of her teeth became exposed, “Mr. Anderson?”

“I was just trying to figure out which department you are,” He answered without hesitation, “Electric?” 
She took a step back, her face scrunched up, but then looked down at the heavy industrial tape and thermal insulation gloves on her hands, “Clever.”

“Just experienced.”

“Right.” She rested a hand on the table and managed to shift into an even cockier posture, “I’m a gaffer, specifically.” 

Anderson nodded and took a sip of his coffee, the ring on his finger rising up into her eye-line. He knew a lot of jokes about gaffers, the lighting wizards of the entertainment industry and he half got the feeling she was waiting for one. So he just smiled and nodded. Her eyes darted towards his ring for just a moment and her face set, her jaw clenching and her brows moving just a little closer. 

“Every time you look good behind that desk you have me to thank.” She leaned in closer, and Anderson realized she was pushing those tits he had noticed straining under her band shirt up and out, subtly angling her body so they stared him down like a second pair of eyes, “Not much I can do when you’re in front of it though.”

“You think I could look better then?”

“Oh no,” Her eyes went wide like a Japanese schoolgirls, but Anderson noted there wasn’t a trace of fear in them, “I think you look very good for a man your age.”

Anderson’s laugh was short and hoarse, “A man my age, huh? If there’s anything I know about a girl your age it’s that nobody looks better than a man my age.” He took another sip and didn’t drop eye contact. Her eyes trailed up and down his body and he knew full well she was impressed. He had kept to a strict weightlifting schedule for twenty years and it damn well showed. 

He found his body inching over the table, his spine straightening to give himself maximum height, and in the tiniest corner of her mouth her teeth bit down on her lips. “Luckily for me, that’s a sentiment my wife shares.”

The lip bite became a full fledged chomp. She too straightened up and backed away from the table, trailing her fingers on the wood as she did so, “Lucky woman. I’m sure there’s more than one intern around here who would like to trade places with her.” A beat, “Like Gareth. Or maybe Mark.”

Anderson ignored the jab and tried to surprise with a move from left field, coming round the table and striding past her. She didn’t flinch, not losing an inch of frame. Instead she shifted a little to her side and made sure her hand brushed his, those manicured red nails sending a shiver down his spine.

“Oh, I’m sorry Mr. Anderson.” Her voice went an octave higher, 

“Didn’t see you coming.” Her fingers trailed back down his arm again, “Didn’t see a thing.” Just one finger now, down his fingers, arcing down like it was going to go further. She slowed down, and in her deep green eyes he saw a fire that matched her hair. Her finger dropped at last, she bit back another smile and turned away.

He would be lying if he didn’t admit to watching her leave, his eyes on her ass like he knew she knew they would be. When the sounds of the world came back to him there was a single bead of sweat on his brow, and a tightening in his pants.

2vpm04,7,2015-02-12,Seeking a Church/Christian Fellowship...feeling kind of alone too,[deleted],Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/2vpm04/seeking_a_churchchristian_fellowshipfeeling_kind/,"About 3 weeks ago, I moved away to another state (in New England) to start a new job out of college. For the past few weeks, I have been seeking out a church to attend and find fellowship with some other believers. However, I tend to be a bit more of an introvert and semi-socially awkward, so getting connected with church-related things has always been a struggle that has led to several frustrations (the ministry I was involved with in college was great in my later years).

I have checked out a few churches so far, but where I have been so far the people have not felt the most welcoming (being new nobody really talked to me much) or there does not seem to be a lot of peers my fellow age I could connect with (would be nice, but having a variety of different generations as well would be nice). This gets quite frustrating, as we are created to be in community with one another.

I attended a church last summer during an out of state internship, but felt out of place as while there were a lot of young people, they were all engaged/married to each other and I felt out of place being in a long-distance relationship. The people were nice, but I did not feel I fit in well necessarily. Lastly, I feel it is hard as people sometimes are busy and don't just want to hang out, and I feel its hard to find fellow Christians who have similar interests (one of them being D&amp;D)

I know a lot of this may be ranting and disjointed, but any advice for me in seeking out a church and getting connected, especially if someone had been in a similar situation? Please keep me in your prayers that I will find a good church, and not become isolated and slowly lose faith. It's tough when your family and SO are 1000 miles away and basically the only form of people interaction you get is at work."

I just graduated from college (marketing major) and this is my first professional gig (outside of internships.)

I have *some* experience in SEO, but i'm a little concerned it's not enough. However, I've been studying and reading out SEO for a couple hours each day for the last few weeks. Experience wise, I have taken two ""internet marketing"" classes- basically building our own site from scratch (albeit basic) in Dreamweaver and learning how to build a simple, content worthy site with a logical site map that encourages conversion and user engagement and a site that hopefully google would reward.

In a previous internship, I managed their website (on wordpress) and kept the content fresh and updated, added alt tags for new images, added links from reputable websites (in this case news articles about our company), and linked to social media.

TL;DR and to get to the point: What are some things/ resources I can read on up? MOZ has three sets of articles (a 101, social media, and link building) that have been incredibly useful to connect the dots in this SEO puzzle for me. 

What type of questions could I expect in the interview?

Also, what I lack in ""experience"" I'm hoping to make up for with my interest in the subject, it's something that I find very interesting and want to learn more and more about and develop it as a career hopefully. It's the future of marketing as we all know.

Essentially I would fix bugs within the company's databases. Meh. Not exactly what I asked for, but good pay, good experience, and would look good on my resume so I decided to go for it. As much as I would like to say I am an experienced programmer due to my degree, I am not. With that being said, since day one I Have felt inferior at my internship. I stress and overthink things because I do not want to look like a fool. Now they have me learning Perl which I find boring and simply not my type of programming. Because I am not motivated to really learn Perl, I feel insecure, out of place, and feel like I'm not able to do my job correctly. I hate this feeling and it's eating me inside. Everyday I come to work hating it and wanting to quit. I come home and I can't stop thinking about it.

What I really enjoy doing is creating websites from scratch and I feel I am decent at it. I have a lot to learn but I LOVE learning about it and I practice everyday at home by building my portfolio.
 
What is holding me back from quitting is that I am moving across the state to California in June to live with my boyfriend who is also a Web Developer. He tells me to suck it up and get as much money and experience as I can until June, but I don't know if I can take it anymore. I feel like I am depriving someone else of an opportunity to take my place, do a far better job, and love it.

What do you think I should do? Should I continue to be unhappy and stressed in this place for a few more months? Or should I try and find another job? My mind is telling me to stay, but my heart is telling me to leave. 





TL;DR - I hate my current job and feel I am the wrong person for it. I am stressed and unhappy everyday. However, I will be moving to another state in June. Should I stay there or try and find another job where I'll feel confident and happy?

2vqj4i,12,2015-02-13,"AskTransgender, what's your life story up to transitioning?",KlokWerkN,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/2vqj4i/asktransgender_whats_your_life_story_up_to/,"I knew since I was young (I vividly remember at age 12) feeling envious of girls, and feeling out of place in my own body. I was struggling with my sexuality and gender identity, I didn't know that ""coming out"" was such a thing. I went to therapy, and didn't really make much progress. I buried my feelings and returned to focusing on my hobbies and the computer, a way to escape and forget about what I was thinking.

The next couple years were spent exploring my feelings, trying to distract myself with my projects and hobbies. I was working towards keeping my grades up so that I could be accepted to the local University for Electrical Engineering (which I was later accepted to, and with several large scholarships for my time spent on the High School Robotics team).

Fast forward to July 2010, Just after my 17th birthday. I spent the previous year really trying to understand my feelings, talking with the couple friends I made in High School, it was at this time I could truly label myself as Homosexual and Transgender. Wow. I really knew how to describe how I felt. As surprising as it was, I felt relief, I wasn't just ""mixed up"" inside, there were other people like me out there, living normal lives and still being who they wanted to be. I built up the confidence to tell my sister, and the conversation that ensued was rather disappointing. Plenty of put downs about how I would make an ugly woman, how I don't know I'm gay because I've never been with a man, various other things were said. It was an upsetting conversation, I was done talking with her and I went to bed.

Next morning, I am enjoying a sandwich (mind you this is during summer vacation at the time for me) and my mom comes home, and very sternly asks me if there is something I need to tell her. I can feel a pit form in my stomach in an instant. I start shaking, I know that this is going to go very wrong. I eventually am able to stammer out that I think I am gay and transgender and she immediately starts screaming. Telling me I'm wrong, that someone told me that I was this way (on the contrary, I was the first gay and transgender person I knew). I immediately started crying and ran to the basement. I spent the next 3 days in the basement just crying my eyes out. In that moment I felt so broken, like I was such a failure and I did something wrong. Before that moment I was a confused, but otherwise happy kid. It started a long spiral of self destruction that took years to get over. My parents tell me that I need therapy to get over this ""phase"". I spent months in therapy with a therapist that caused more harm than good and I refused to talk to him about what had happened.

That August, I was very depressed and lonely, and started to talking to guys online. I was in a very terrible state emotionally as I had no support from my friends or family, and was desperately looking for some sort of emotional attachment to help. I met up with a guy I had talked to online, alone, and he proceeded to rape me. He was much bigger than I was and I was just forced to be used by him. After that moment I felt many times worse than I did prior and when I started my senior year my previous grades of A's and B's slid into D's, and I even failed a couple classes. I came to school, slept and cried, that's the best way to describe my senior year. For the next year or so I slept around with a lot of older guys. Luckily I am STD/disease free, somehow.

I was hospitalized in October for suicidal ideation, basically I was deemed suicidal by my therapist and sent to a hospital for 3 days to deal with my depression. After I got out, I was prescribed antidepressants that made me feel empty and I began cutting, trying to feel some emotion. my forearms were covered in cuts, but covered by my baggy clothes and no one knew. I had no one to talk to. The few friends I could talk to didn't want to deal with my issues, and I had given up on life. I learned that I was accepted to my University of choice so I didn't give up hoping that it would change things for me.

I graduated, just barely hanging onto my chance to get into school. If my grades had slipped much more I would not have made it in. I started my internship at Bosch Engineering and things were... disappointing. I wasn't enjoying the work, I was tired of trying to convince my parents to let me see a doctor or a therapist that would help me start hormone replacement therapy. I decided to buy hormones (Spironolactone and Estrogen) online and began taking them in September 2011. I began buying more feminine clothing and I was feeling a bit more comfortable about myself.

My internship ended and I began classes and I struggled to adjust. I was still extremely unhappy, both from myself and dealing with people in general. I didn't feel like I was making any progress in my transitioning and ended up in the hospital again for suicide. After I got out, I had an old friend from my home town invite me to dinner, with him and another friend of his. I go over, and his friend is a skinny, attractive guy. We began talking and pretty much instantly fell in love. He came with me and we spent the weekend together at my dorm, and just talked about everything, it was an amazing feeling to have someone really, truly love and care about you.

He got into a massive fight with his step dad and was kicked out. Not knowing what to do, I let him stay with me in the dorm. After a few days he was asked to leave, or I would be ejected from the Dorms. Having no clue what to do (that's a common theme here), I thought maybe he could stay the night at my parents house until we figured things out. I introduce him to my parents and they immediately freaked out. They kicked him out (he was 5'9"", 115 pounds, a very non threatening skinny feminine kid) and he walked in the cold 5 miles to my friends house. I was stuck arguing with my parents, and gave up and slammed the door. My mom opened the door and grabbed me by the hair, dragging me in and began beating me. I was cut up and my dad offered to take me to my friends house (luckily the same friend my partner walked to). I walked in the door and broke down and collapsed, crying, in his arms.

Our lives revolved around each other, since we had no real incentive to try and live for ourselves. It was a relationship built on helping the other person cope with all the things we had dealt with. I hated school and dealt with harassment and discrimination at my following internship, and the entire experience put me off of wanting to try at all at school. We had a tense relationship at times, both from our own in-maturities and just the broad spectrum of issues we had. Having high amounts of estrogen didn't help.

I gave up and dropped out a semester later, and things with my partner didn't work out and we broke up on bad terms in December 2012. I moved back home and my parents would hold ""interventions"" to try and set me ""straight"" and talk me out of who I was. I was extremely depressed and reached out to my local LGBT organization asking for a place to live while I tried to get my life together. On Feburary 2nd 2013 I met with someone who had a place for me to stay in a month or so, when he moved out of his apartment to a trailer in a very tiny city about an hour north of where I was living. I would take care of the house and try and work towards getting a job. We had a plan set out and he dropped me off... to a house completely locked. I couldn't get in, all the doors were locked (we lived in a relatively rural area so we never locked doors) and my mom opens the door and says ""I found the hormones, you need to go"". I wasn't about to argue, I was more than happy to get my stuff and leave. I packed a backpack and a duffel bag full of clothes, all the while my mom is threatening to push me down the stairs. I was terrified, since she had attacked me before. I called the police and my roommate, and I left that night.

I was now sleeping on a couch of a guy I barely knew. I had no money, no food, just a bag full of clothes. For about 3 weeks I slept on his couch, and eventually we moved into the trailer. My room was barely big enough for a bed and a desk, but I felt safe. He was very friendly and things were okay... until I had no food. I applied for food stamps (welfare in Michigan) since he would be busy at work and I would be at home with nothing to eat. For about 2 months, I had almost no food, starving, just barely enough money to eat once every couple days. I lost about 30 pounds in 2 months just from lack of eating. I slept around with a lot of guys just so I could get money and enough food.


In April, I was hired at a small computer repair place about 20 minutes away, and my dad offered to let me borrow the car so that I could get to work and back. I was working for just barely above minimum wage, but I was finally working and making money. I thought things were smoothing over with my parents, and in late april I moved back home. Huge mistake. Things were immediately off to a terrible start. I could not present or dress female in front of my family (I was skinny and on hormones for about 4-5 months so I looked fairly feminine) and I would leave the house in baggy clothes, then change on my way to work. Luckily, working in IT is fairly accepting of LGBT people so my work had no issue with it. My boss was a scumbag that would make rude comments but I was thankful for a job. In June my Ex, Emily (formerly Nolan) messaged me.

We chatted and met for lunch. We instantly fell back in love. We had a very strong bond and knew we made mistakes. We made plans to get an apartment together not too far from my job, and in early July we moved in together. About a week later I was fired for reporting a wage dispute, my boss was not paying us correctly and I told the parent company we worked for. I was later hired in full time for about 3 times more than what I was making previously. I was making enough to support myself and Emily. She struggled to find a job and that put stress on our relationship, and she moved in to a friend's house even though we still were together. I gave up trying to transition since I felt like I couldn't make any progress. I gained weight and felt really unattractive. Emily moved back in and really worked hard to get a job and things were fantastic.

It's now July 1st, Emily and I have been doing fantastic together, I was eating healthier and as far as I knew our relationship was doing great. We were very happy together and she had a job working as a field laborer in a local farm. I quit my job from doing computer repair and was working at a managed services company doing server administration. I hadn't heard from Emily almost all day, so I was anxious to get home and give her a big hug. I remember walking through the door and the entire apartment being incredibly hot. Too hot for someone to stay in. It really had me a bit upset because it must have been over 90 degrees. I called for her but I heard no response. Things felt too quiet. Normally the moment she hears the door open she would jump out of her hiding spot and hug me, and we'd talk about her day. Not today. It was silent.

I head to the bedroom and try to open the door, it felt like it was wedged shut. I pushed with some force and I heard something fall from behind the door, surprised I open the door and turn on the light to find Emily laying on the ground, with a belt around her neck, blue. She hung herself, about 4 hours prior to me getting home. No note, nothing. She just impulsively decided to kill herself. We didn't have a fight, we were doing okay. Better than okay I thought. I remember screaming as loud as I could, I just froze up and screamed and ran out of the room. I felt like if I screamed loud enough she would somehow be fine, but I knew. The once always smiling, beautiful face was a unnatural blue, she was cold to the touch. I panicked and threw a blanket over her. I called 911 and they were there in minutes. I called her parents and told her mom that Emily had committed suicide, she didn't believe me. She came over and just was in utter disbelief. I called my Dad and said that shit happens and I'll get over it. I also won't forget the cop saying ""Hey look on the bright side, at least it wasn't a shooting!""

July 2nd my car broke down and July 3rd was my birthday. I had a panic attack at work and freaked out, telling Emily's parents I was going to kill myself. The police came and I was in a hospital for about 6 days for suicide ideation... again. I was in a psych ward with schizophrenic gang bangers telling me that they kill faggots and how they're freaks. I was glad to be out of the hospital. I spent the next few months in a haze, going to work, coming home, sleeping. The panic attacks would be overpowering and unfortunately many new scars were added. I didn't know where my life was headed. 

In September I knew I had to transition, change my name and get as far away from here as I could. I began taking hormones more regularly this time through a doctor, and in November I quit my old job. In December I changed my name (taking Emily's last name for my middle, so that she'll always be with me in some way). I have been presenting female full time for about 7ish months and I feel like I can begin moving on. I've lost 30 pounds and I'm skinny and feeling confident about myself for the first time in a long time, in the end the only person I needed was myself, it just took me a long time and a lot of pain to find my inner strength.

I work for a small IT consulting company (and as a camgirl on the side) in a nice city, I just purchased my own car (2014 Malibu LS) and soon I will be going back to school to obtain my Computer or Electrical Engineering degree.

2vqksx,1,2015-02-13,"Smoked for the first time in my life a month ago, and I have a hair follicle test in 2 weeks :(",Call_Me_Salamander,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/2vqksx/smoked_for_the_first_time_in_my_life_a_month_ago/,"I'm not a smoker at all. In fact I smoked for the first time in my life on new years day, and I smoked once more 2 weeks after that, on the weekend of January 17th. Those are the only two times in my entire life I have smoked. I went to a friends house and had a blast. We smoked a shit ton. We passed around a bong (both times) around 5 times, and then I smoked 5 bongs worths of weed on my own. I tend to go overboard when it is my first time of anything... Didn't really get high my first time, but my second time I definitely felt it. Overall the experience was great. I had two great nights with my best friends.

Anyway, it turns out I got a very good software development internship offer for the summer, but I have a hair follicle drug screening in two weeks... I'm freaking the fuck out. I've only smoked twice in my life just to give it a try and now I may be in danger not getting my dream internship that will hopefully lead to my dream job. I've been trying to intern at this company for two years now and I finally got it. I've been reading some things about people applying chemicals to their hair and whatnot several times a week to try and get anything out of their hair, but I do not think I want to do that. I don't feel comfortable possibly damaging my scalp and my hair permanently. I'm also 5'10"" 235 lbs so I am not exactly a skinny guy either.

So am I fucked or what? Should I even bother getting the drug screening done? I'm sitting here at home alone wondering if I just ruined my entire life just because of two small life decisions I made. I have read that smoking once or twice might not even get detected by a follicle test, but I smoked a shit ton of weed on both days. I went way overboard on the amount that I smoked.

Thanks for the input guys. I really hope I am not fucked :(. Needless to say I won't be doing anything like this again until I have a stable job out of college and I know for sure I will not get drug tested."

I have no professional programming experience, but I just got a job as a systems technician where I work in Linux all day and run python scripts/sync SQL databases to help engineers setup wireless testbeds.  
 
There are a lot of internships out there, but their requirements are either a freshman or juinior/senior studying CS or someone in a CS Masters program. I technically do not fall under any of these categories. I just completed my intro &amp; intermediate java class.  

 I am currently taking data structures and algorithms, Assembly, and Programming languages. I then will take an Operating Systems Class, Advanced Algorithms, Computer Architecture, and Software Engineering to fulfill my requirements to apply to a Masters Program. I have a few questions that I am confused about.  

1) What am i considered to be? Am I a sophomore since I barely have any CS Classes?  
2) Would it even matter if I get my MS after having completed those prereq requirements, which consist of the entire core curriculum of my local cal state scool[less electives] - Cannot get a 2nd bachelors?

I need some help on a dilemma im currently facing.
Im 23 and after working and trying different bachelors im now trying fort the third time and am 2.5 out of 4 years in on my bachelor marketing/sales.
Ive always hated school and i basically got all my points by doing nothing. But im missing a lot points as well so the way it looks now is that im not going to finish my education in those 4yrs.
After my internship i really felt that i want to work. So when the opportunity arrose i went and applied for an inside sales position. Sales had always been a passion of mine and this particular job is close to my home and offers a really Nice wage.
Now they already said they want to hire me and after test working there for a day i think i want to work there too..
However i will have to finish my bachelor in my free hours which will be really though.
Ive been thinking alot about what to do and i cant figure it out. One of the arguments i het from friends and family is that they think i might postpone my study so much that i wont finish it at all. But With my current motivation that will probably happen anyway, or it will take longer at least.
So should i start working now and finish study in My free hours with relevant working experience or should i continue with my study (which i work along side anyways in work that i dont like to pay for my house and such) and finish that in 2yrs and start working then..

2vqyj9,1,2015-02-13,"25 Days+, strategy.",streihtup,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2vqyj9/25_days_strategy/,"I stopped fapping a little while before my 21st birthday, but I use it to measure the no-fapping distance (I dunno the actual initial date). I don't see this streak ever stopping.

I found that the streak-breaking trap was a sleep-deprived mind drunk off self-congratulation, luring me into thinking I can spare a soothing whack; this is why my previous attempts failed so quickly.

Upon turning 21 last month, I realized that I don't deserve to whack off any longer. I'm the last person to ever self-flagellate. I wasn't raised in any religion. Turning 21 as a virgin, sipping pitiable light beer with my family, with my angelic little sister plain shocked that I wasn't getting shitfaced turnt up for my birthday while at university (for some reason everybody thinks I smoke mad weed and party hard, neither of which I've really ever done), made me realize that the way I've been leading my life has been straight pathetic. While my peers have been banging like bunnies, having fun, and making memories together, I've been a recluse. I can point fingers at being conditioned by bullying, but the truth is that it's a biological predisposition to insularity that made me a target in the first place. Biologically, I'm inferior; my genetics are undesirable and my sperm, along with my adolescent sex drive, has passed its expiration date.

So I decided, hey, let's not fap anymore. It's over.

There have been no apparent benefits besides the extra time to kill. Before NoFap, I had already been working out for a good five years. I don't consider myself socially impaired. I've got hobbies. I don't play video games or watch television. I eat unreasonably well for a college student. I'm spartan about getting all my nutrients and vitamins. I'm below average in intelligence, but I manage to convince other people that I know what I'm doing. I guess my stride has improved with the size of my nuts.

I don't really feel an overwhelming respect for people or women. I suppose that's what I wanted to feel, starting NoFap. I do feel angry. I hate the shit I hungrily watched. When you're young, porn is contraband; it's exciting to indulge in shit you know you're not supposed to. When you're old, it's exploitative, formulaic crap next to Super Bowl ads. It's corny. You end up looking for actual contraband to get that same thrill. I hate that I missed so many opportunities when I was a kid. I used to find so much pride in the fact that I was apart from people, as if it somehow made me special. Now, since 18, I've been making such a dedicated attempt to integrate, and be normal, and have normal, fulfilling experiences, but I'll never be able to catch up or feel the way they do. The lead-like plaque of disuse in my brain makes seeking intimate contact as foreign as imagining a color outside the RGB spectrum. Upon receiving it, I would still be the cold person I am.

I go to a super-competitive university. My peers are the types with LinkedIn profiles and business casual outfits ironed so hard for internship fairs that you could get a paper-cut just looking at them. International students everywhere. Passionate wunderkind. Sheltered Google types with stars in their eyes. I love them, but I get jealous. I'm amazed at their capacity to socialize and find such good in what they do, simultaneously deep frying me on the underside of the bell-curve. With my inexperience, shitty taste in music, and intrinsic negative bent, I don't ever see myself coupling with the lovely genius girls at this place. I'd be troubling them, and there's nothing more shameful than that. I have no social circle; I won't be coupling with anybody. I'm not one of them.

I've got a secret, though, I guess. I'm not choking the chicken till sunrise, while they are.

I wish I had something constructive to say for NoFap-aspirants. If you truly want to stop fapping, you will. I've got confidence in you. My strategy of despondent asceticism may sound a little depressing, but I think it's been working remarkably well compared to my previous attempts. Good luck."

Am I an asshole?",heepofsheep,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2vr68x/i_left_my_old_company_less_than_a_year_ago_and/,"Ok so this company took me on as an intern. I was already graduated at that point, but I learned a lot in that position. This company also happened to be the biggest entity in the industry in a sort of weird shadowy way. 

Anyway when my internship was ending I did a sort of weird side shift to another position in a sister organization and my boss didn't want to let me go (even though he was going to before he learned I was going to the ""other side"") 

So I did a 50/50 split with my time with this new group and his.... he still paid be the same rate as I made as an intern. It was a generous amount, but living in an expensive city it really wasn't that much. After my leverage position ended due to external factors I came back to his group.... he continued to pay the the same rate as I made as an intern but also gave me some opportunities for higher day rates here and there. 

Towards the end of the first 12 months I was there, it totally became pretty apparent I was contributing a lot of work and being compensated a very, very minuscule amount. During this whole period I was a freelancer and during a period they didn't bring me in for 2 weeks. I panicked and started digging deep and found much better paying jobs in the main city where our industry is located. 

So without much thought I left with a 2 weeks notice and that was that. They were on the whole... not.... joyful that I left, but were happy that I was on to better things I guess. The first reactions I got were usually, ""shit fuck you're leaving?""..... 

Now after 6 months of being gone I sort of feel guilty. Without that position I wouldn't have the skills, knowledge, or the experience to be where I am now. In a lot of ways I was vastly underpaid, but I had the freedom and power to do a lot of things I can't do now. 

I panicked after not working for two weeks and I jumped ship I guess.... I don't have any regrets, but I feel like I used them up and spit them out in sort of a way. There also one of the most hated companies in the the country at the moment, so I don't think anyone would take much sympathy... "
2vr70j,3,2015-02-13,[For Hire] Multi-Talented Autodidact Looking for Work (Remote/Willing to Relocate),[deleted],forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/2vr70j/for_hire_multitalented_autodidact_looking_for/,"Hello, I am a 20 year old college dropout living in the US west coast looking for some new opportunities. The easiest way to get in contact with me would be to send a PM or leave a comment here.

**What can I do?** 

My professional background mainly consist of 1-2 years of quality assurance work using Python, Ruby, Chef, and Selenium. I also have experience with wordpress, HTML5, CSS and C. I've been exposed to Django, Ruby on Rails, and am very interested in functional programming.

Outside of computer science topics I have done customer support and some volunteer community management. I speak a little french and am practicing everyday. I am open to learning just about any an everything.

**What am I looking for?**

I've always liked apprenticeships or internships for people who aren't in college. Ideally, I would like to work in a junior or apprenticeship position(preferably paid) doing software engineering or embedded programming. However, I'm really just looking for anything interesting that will let me learn something new and preferably make some money. For example, need a hotel/hostel worker who works for a bed? Let me know I might be interested. I would prefer to work remotely however I am open to relocation staying in the US if possible.

**Why am I a dropout?**

I have very strong opinions about college and education in general. I don't like the way students are being taught and the way the educational system is setup. After doing some hard thinking I realized it would be very hypocritical of me to just conform and remain in college while I feel this way so I left.

**Not in college? What am I doing then?**

Just because I'm not in college doesn't mean I'm not learning. I'm currently taking  classes from Texas A&amp;M in Cyber security, engineering classes from Coursera, and programming classes from edX. During my down time I learn French and am currently working on memorizing Japanese kana.

I appreciate you taking the time to read this whether or not you reach out to me. Thanks."
2vrbue,10,2015-02-13,Triangle Opportunity,Aquareon,libraryofshadows,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/2vrbue/triangle_opportunity/,"When Samantha called me for the first time in eight years, it was surprising for two reasons. The first is that roughly 90% of the calls I receive these days are from debt collectors after me to pay down my student loans. The other being that we parted on pretty ugly terms, most of that was my fault and I honestly never expected to hear from her again. 

I scolded myself afterwards for being so eager. Fell out of bed, tangled up in the sheets trying to get my hands on the phone, then tapped the green icon and breathlessly answered. It’s been eight years, I shouldn’t give a shit. She should be like any other person to me. 

*“Jack? You sound so different. But then, it’s been a while hasn’t it. I’ve been wondering what’s happening in your life.”* I struggled to sound composed but nonetheless stammered a little bit as I searched for words. *“Y-yeah Sam, it’s...you sound different too. It’s nice to hear from you though. You must’ve Googled me, right?”* She said that she had, and congratulated me on the trip to Africa I’d taken in my first year interning for the local paper. 

*“That must’ve been so fulfilling. If you don’t mind me asking, what are they paying you?”* I assumed she knew it was unpaid if she’d bothered to ask, so I didn’t sugar coat it. *“Wow, that sucks. But that’s the economy, right? Plenty of people are working for free just to get their foot in the door. Then they let you go right before they’d have to hire you and take on new interns.”* Technically the law prevents that, but I was aware of loopholes. 

*“You know, I might be able to help. I’m working for this promising new tech startup, it’s right up your alley. There’s plenty of opportunities for someone like you, maybe we could meet for coffee and I’ll tell you about it?”* Sounded just similar enough to a date that my heart skipped a beat. Reflexively, I blurted out yes. She supplied the day and time, which I dutifully recorded in my calendar app after she’d hung up. 

Long after the call ended, my heart was still racing. I’d gone through hell after the breakup. I think only because I was dumped. Something about rejection makes you cling to that person, even if they were nothing special to begin with. I’d seen a local therapist about it for three years before I felt put together enough to stop. Well, not a real therapist. Psych students in training. That’s why it’s free. 

Clarity began returning to me, and I wondered if I hadn’t made a mistake. Seeing her in person would only rekindle feelings I’d spent most of a decade trying to extinguish. The therapist, insofar as it was right to use that word, urged me to cut off all contact for my own good. That seemed logical at the time. But then, doesn’t absence make the heart grow fonder? They can’t both be true.

It was a long, excruciating road to recovery. By recovery I mean reaching a point where I was borderline functional. I’d built so much of my identity around Samantha that she was a sort of load bearing pillar. With that removed, the rest collapsed in a heap of flaming wreckage. Years one through three were just the panicked wanderings of a lost child. Years four through six were a frankensteinian process of patching together whatever pieces I could salvage and trying to rebuild something resembling who I’d been before. 

Not a lot of meat to it. Mostly skeletal scaffolding, duct tape and staples. The smallest impact would bring it tumbling down, but for the time being it worked well enough that I was finally holding down a job again. If you call unpaid labor a job. With most of my friends flipping burgers or waiting tables, doing something related to journalism elevated me considerably in their view. All smoke and mirrors though. At the end of the day, they’ve got an income. I’ve got an IOU. 

From that perspective, Sam’s mystery job offer sounded tantalizing. I couldn’t bring myself to care what exactly it was about so long as I’d be working with her. That meant frequent time together, which in turn meant a chance to patch things up. My mind telling me *“that’s childish fantasy you should throw in the fire before it hurts you”* while my heart says *“don’t be afraid to bet it all on a long shot, if the prize is everything you’ve ever wanted.”* 

I listened to my heart. I want to say it’s a poor understanding of probability and defective pattern recognition. Probably why I buy lottery tickets, come to think of it. I’ve been with a string of girls since the breakup and one after the other I drove them away. Self-sabotage, my therapist told me. My own experience of it was something like the emotional equivalent of when your body rejects a donor organ. My anti-rejection drug is alcohol. Works great, problem is that I eventually sober up. 

That’s not a healthy way to live, but it’s a lot healthier than the alternative. Which, for several years, was a long drop off a nearby bridge. Popular spot for jumpers as there’s a road below to smash your head on and a picturesque view for reflecting on your life before you do it. The city put up fences as a deterrent but people just climb ‘em. So they put in some free phones which connect you directly to the suicide hotline. 

Never bothered using it. I knew the spiel. *“Suicide is the ultimate act of selfishness”*, because your own suffering ends but you cause everyone who knows you to suffer afterward. There’s two sides to it, though. I could understand if someone were suicidal over some transient problem. They might have a point then. But if not, then isn’t it selfish to demand that somebody prolong their suffering by multiple decades because you’re scared of death? 

I drove past the bridge on my way to the coffee shop and recalled the time I’d spent all night there, deliberating over whether to jump. Some rando intuited what I was there for and took it upon himself to talk me out of it. He said his piece, I said mine, then we watched the sun rise together. I didn’t wind up doing it. He got to leave feeling good about himself. But my life remained unchanged. What did he save me from, except relief? 

The coffee shop was a national chain that people whose identity centers around contrarianism like to snub their noses at. Certainly the coffee is nothing special but there’s something to be said for being able to reliably get the same product, clean and quickly, anywhere on the planet. Samantha sat in a booth waiting for me. She had on a dress I recognized, and a neon yellow and blue windbreaker that I didn’t. Down one sleeve, it said *“E-hance your life!”* Sheepishly, I took a seat opposite her and prepared to break the ice. That’s when I first noticed the necklace. 

*“What’s that around your neck?”* She seemed delighted by the question. *“Sharp eye. This is the product! I could tell you about it, or you could just try it out yourself. I brought one that should fit you.”* She withdrew it from her purse and slid it across the table to me. I objected that I’d not yet so much as ordered a drink. 

*“Oh, of course. I had one before you got here but I could go for another.”* I offered to pay, and had her tell me what she wanted. It turned out to be incredibly specific. I gave up on getting it completely right halfway through the description. You get points towards free food or beverages if you order drinks with their special card here and I’ve always had an addictive personality. It’s why I stay away from gambling and freemium games. Didn’t manage to avoid drinking, but you can’t win ‘em all. 

When I returned with our drinks she had a blue and yellow binder out, splayed open across the table with various perplexing graphs and diagrams. *“I figured you’d have questions about how we operate, what the pay and hours are like and so on”* she explained. It actually hadn’t occurred to me. I was ready to take the job just to work with Sam. But of course I couldn’t say that, so I feigned interest.

*“So Jack, here’s the deal. Todd is my manager, so to speak. I started working for him three weeks ago. Jill, a friend of mine, also works for him. He works for Dennis, who has a lot more people working for him than either Todd or myself. So far! I hope to narrow that gap today.”* She flashed a grin at me. I just sat pensively, staring at the nonsensical pie charts and spreadsheets in front of me. She continued.

*“The great thing about this is that everybody can be a manager. You have someone who you report your sales to, and they take a cut of your earnings, but there are also people who work under you. They report to you and you get a cut of whatever they earn. So the more people you share this opportunity with, the more your profits stack up!”*

She seemed deliriously excited now. I didn’t know how to break it to her. I seriously considered going all-in despite what I suspected, just because it was a chance to spend time with Sam. But that same lingering love also forced me to speak my mind about what she was involved in. *“Sam, this is a pyramid scheme.”* She spit out some coffee and laughed in my face.

*“Todd told me you’d say that! Those exact words, because of your high Krion level. Sometimes I think he’s psychic. I can see why you’d think that, but no, this is a new and dynamic business model called network marketing. You see, it’s all about who you know, like in any other business. Forming connections, like the connection from Todd to myself and Jill, or between you and I.”*

I cringed when she said it. How I wanted such a connection to exist. But I couldn’t leave it alone. *“Does Todd ever pay you any of his earnings?”* She blinked at me, and said no. *“So the flow of money is one way. Always from the recruit, up to the person who recruited them. Then from that person up to whoever recruited them.”* She frowned, flipped through the binder and found a diagram of a web-like structure. *“See? A network”*. 

It certainly was possible to draw it that way. But the structure was the same. *“Sam, let me guess. There are meetings you go to every so often where they give you a pep talk, you buy more of the product from them, and they coach you with counter-arguments for when people like me tell you it’s a scam.”* Her eyes widened, and her voice grew irate. 

*“Do you really think I’m so stupid I’d fall for something like that? Is that what you think of me? Now I remember why I left you. Look, I’m doing you a favor by introducing you to this opportunity”*, she said. *“If you’re too narrow minded to recognize it, then go back to your life as a failure.”* It knocked the wind out of me. I considered storming out. But even if at the end of the day she hated my guts, I felt like it would be a small price to pay if I could spare her the misery and financial ruin she was headed for. 

*“Sam, I’m only saying this because some part of me still cares for you. If you won’t take it from me, search the company name online. Or the name of the CEO. Even if they call it something else, structurally, it’s obviously a pyramid scheme. If you don’t get out of it now you’re going to regret it before long.”* She looked infuriated, but after a few deep breaths, replied: *“Look, just try the product. If it doesn’t blow you away, then I’m wrong, and it’s all a scam.”* She nudged the necklace closer to me. 

I agreed to give it a shot, pocketed the necklace and we parted more or less amicably. I drove home in a fog of confusion and anxiety. Maybe I’d gone in with unrealistic expectations. But this was by far a worse outcome than I could’ve imagined. When I got home, I searched “E-hance”. Every search result was in some way affiliated with the company. I could find nothing negative about it. Even the Wikipedia page was spotless, consisting of what read like one long advertisement for their product. 

When I tried to edit the page, it was immediately reversed and I received a warning from one of the mods. I explained to him how E-hance is structured, that it’s plainly a pyramid scheme. His reply read: *“That’s some of the most astonishing ignorance I’ve ever seen. It’s network marketing, do your homework. E-hance is a dynamic and promising startup that is revitalizing small business in the US.”* I pleaded my case with other mods but got some variant of the same response from all of them. 

So, I turned my attention to the necklace. Really more of a neck brace as it was rigid, with two small hinges at the back so the “arms” could flex enough to get it around your neck. Neon yellow and blue, just like Sam’s jacket. The thickest piece was the back, to which the two hinged arms attach. On either side was a metal plate, and between them a small hole that I could not discern the purpose of. 

So, I looked up the E-hance webpage and clicked the *“how does the E-hancer work?”* tab. It displayed a flashy animated diagram of the necklace as a rotating wireframe, with a sort of legend to explain what various parts did. I hovered my cursor over the metal plates on the back, and a window popped up. *“The E-hancer never needs to be recharged. It runs directly off of your body heat! This also reduces the toxic materials used to make the e-hancer, which is a boon to the environment!”*

I moved my cursor to the little hole, but no window popped up. It wasn’t possible to select. So I scrolled down to read the body of the page.  *“There’s no doubt that it’s a sick, sad world out there. Anyone can see that. But why doesn’t anyone do something about it? That’s the vision which compelled our brilliant founder and CEO, Bruce Hance, to invent the E-hancer whole-body Krion removal device. Krions are nasty energy particles which poison your thoughts with doubts about Bruce Hance, E-hance Ltd and the E-hancer device.”*

An inset jpeg depicted a handsome smiling man with perfect teeth and a touch of grey in his carefully sculpted hair. Beneath it, gold text reading *“Bruce Hance, pioneering founder and CEO of E-hance ltd.”* I continued reading. *“How does it work? Simplicity itself. Just pull the necklace apart as shown and place it around your neck from behind. You will immediately feel rejuvenated, revitalized, and convinced of the tremendous value that the E-hancer has to offer people in your life who suffer from high levels of Krions.”* 

An animated gif showed a featureless figure putting on the necklace in an endless loop. *“Once this occurs, find your nearest E-hance motivational center to buy E-hancers in bulk to share with your family and friends, as well as to receive instruction on how to deal with doubting Thomases whose negative energy threatens to disrupt your upward trajectory to a brighter future. Do not react with anger, remember it’s just their Krions talking.”* 

I stared with a mixture of disgust and alarm. Who could fall for this? How big was this company? I couldn’t find anything about where it was located. Surely they were required to divulge that by law? I reported the website to the Better Business Bureau. A short time later I received a reply scolding me for being too closed minded where alternative business models are concerned and urging me to try their product for myself before judging it. My stomach sank. 

The next logical step, it seemed to me, was to take the damned thing apart. My degree was in engineering, for all the good it’s done me. But at last, it was coming in handy. I dug up a set of fine tools of the sort used to dismantle watches, smartphones and other delicate devices. Whoever designed this thing, they really didn’t want anybody getting into it. The barely visible seam afforded no gap to wedge anything into. 

Only by gently hammering the finest flathead screwdriver against the seam like a chisel did I manage to split it open. Even then, bits of one side broke off and remained connected to the other. I quickly realized this was a lucky break: The tabs where the two sides joined together had sensors attached. Evidently the device could tell if somebody was taking it apart. Did it phone home or something? Could I expect a visit from the cops? 

The tabs remained in place however, snapped off in the process of removing one half of the casing. The circuitry inside laid bare, what struck me was the complexity of the chip inside. I’d expect to see this in a top of the line smartphone, not some gimmicky health necklace, or whatever it was. There was of course a small pouch type LiPo battery underneath, to keep it ticking while not worn. But also a spring loaded needle.

That surprised me. Why was that in there? It was positioned to extend through that hole I couldn’t figure out the purpose of before. A bundle of hair thin wires trailed from the back of the needle to the same PCB that the processor was mounted to. Try as I might, I couldn’t wrap my head around it. But there, next to the CPU, was what I recognized as a small solid state flash memory chip. If there were any answers to be had, I knew that’s where I’d find ‘em.

Gingerly, I cut the pins attaching the chip to the PCB one at a time until it came loose. Then set about the slow, tedious process of soldering new leads from each of the pins to a breadboard I’d use to interface with the little guy. One of my robotics projects involved this sort of work so I already had the software needed to dump the contents of the chip. It was not the instant eureka moment I hoped for. 

This was some seriously sophisticated code. I couldn’t make heads or tails of most of it. The nearest basis for comparison I had was that some of it appeared to be for motor control, navigation and network disruption. Then I found what I quickly determined was a sort of flowchart. The kind used for very simple AIs like Alice. Trigger words would simply return the appropriate reply from a database.

The replies included *“No, it’s network marketing”*, *“Just try the product once and if it doesn’t blow you away then I’m wrong”*, *“E-hance is a dynamic and promising startup that is revitalizing small business in the US”* and so on. I shuddered, having glimpsed a small piece of the puzzle which I desperately hoped wasn’t what I now suspected. Just then, the disassembled necklace began beeping.

Oh shit. Did it have a cellular antennae? Was it alerting somebody that I’d breached the terms of service, or whatever? I hadn’t signed anything but recalled that in some situations simply using a product is implied acceptance of a long list of terms you don’t even have to read. When I hovered over the necklace searching for what tripped it, I realized too late why it was beeping.

A little CCD camera pivoted to look at me. Then two tiny nozzles took aim, each releasing a violent burst of aerosolized chemical. I dodged, but not quite fast enough. One eye was full of the spray and now burned with a pain beyond description. I thrashed about, screaming in agony until I had the presence of mind to locate my eye wash kit. Hands shaking, I performed the steps from memory as tears streamed down my face, and soon the burning subsided. But I could see nothing out of that eye. I hesitated to call an ambulance because of the insane price of the trip, instead calling a friend to drive me to the hospital. He arrived about thirty minutes later. Would that delay make the difference? 

There was somewhat of a crowd waiting to be served but I had health insurance apart from state coverage and my condition was apparently serious enough to merit immediate attention. I hadn’t seen my doctor since I was maybe ten or eleven, that time I wiped out on a dirtbike and needed stitches. Still had the scar on my forehead, the source of no small number of Harry Potter jokes from friends. 

*“Oh, I’ve seen this before”* he muttered once we were alone in the examination room. I felt hopeful. *“It’s reversible, right?”* He looked at me sternly. *“You opened your E-hancer, didn’t you.”* Only now did I notice the familiar blue and yellow brace around his neck, tucked almost invisibly into his coat collar. *“That’s a violation of the terms of service, which clearly state that to protect E-hance ltd’s intellectual copyright, the device contains countermeasures to prevent reverse-engineering.”* 

Fuck. The fucking thing was boobytrapped. Asking to see a different doctor got me nowhere. when the nurse came in, she was wearing one of them too. I was sent home with an eyepatch, a tube of antibiotic eye drops and instructions to procure and wear a replacement E-hancer at my earliest possible convenience. Lying through my teeth, I assured him I would, and met my friend in the lobby. He was flirting with a tall statuesque redheaded nurse who was just about to put an E-hancer on him. 

*“NO!”* I blurted out. Everyone stared at me. I seized him by the arm, and over his protestations, dragged him away from the nurse and into the parking lot. *“What the fuck, dude? She said she’d give me her digits if I tried on some necklace dealie.”* I explained what I knew so far to him on the ride home. He smiled through all of it, and laughed here and there. *“Sounds like a conspiracy theory breh. You need some sleep.”* 

I gave up on it for the time being. Once home, before I hit the hay I sent an email to my boss suggesting cases of eye injury from the E-hancer as a possible story lead. I lay in bed for a while, worrying about my eye before I drifted off. My dreams were bizarre. Always, but especially tonight. I explored my city, or a version of it, where every billboard was blue and yellow. Bearing the E-hance logo, naturally. Every bus ad was for the E-hancer. Everyone wore blue and yellow clothing with the same logo on it. 

I woke up sweaty and disoriented. I’d forgotten to set my alarm, but that weird sixth sense that normally wakes you up a minute or two before it goes off saved my bacon. I checked my inbox and found two emails. One from yesterday night, one from this morning. The first read *“Very interesting Jack! I can always count on you to find stories where nobody else is looking. I’ll have my assistant check this out and get back to you when I’ve decided.”*

The next email took quite a different tone. *“Jack, this is concerning your lead idea from yesterday. I got my hands on an E-hancer to see what the fuss was about, and I really think you’ve got the wrong idea if you think this is a scam. It’s like night and day! Have you tried this? I hope so. I went back and read your last email, it smacks of Krion poisoning to me.”* 

I held my face in my hands. None of this could be happening. Yet when I opened my eyes, reality refused to change. I got up, showered, shaved, took a shit, then applied the eyedrops and put on the patch. Oh boy, I thought, here come the pirate jokes. The other interns had a seriously jockular take on what professionalism means and while most of the time it made work go by faster, my forehead scar made me a target from day one. The eye patch certainly wouldn’t help.

Only, none of them commented on it. No *“Arr matey”*s, nothing about doubloons, pantaloons or anything ending in ‘oons’. Each greeted me with an almost sickeningly chipper expression and went about their work as if we were strangers. That is, until they noticed I wasn’t wearing an E-hancer. Which is also when I noticed that all of them were. *“Krions really sap your productivity you know. If you want on the payroll I’d seriously consider E-hancing your life. I mean, if I were you. Just a suggestion”* one of them said. 

Didn’t recognize him. Lots of turnover at this level. I got more or less the same spiel from the other interns though. Apparently word spread very quickly that I wasn’t wearing my E-hancer and thus didn’t take the job seriously. After an hour or so I was called in to speak with the HR guy. My boss was also there. 

*“Jack, I’ve been hearing some disturbing rumors. Is it true that you’ve been told about the benefits of E-hancing your life with a stylish, high tech E-hancer but refuse to? I have to wonder what motivates a poor decision like that. You must not want to E-hance your productivity. Is that because you’re secretly not dedicated to this company and want to see it fail?”*

I balked. Then, thinking quickly, began to act my ass off. *“My E-hancer was defective. That’s how I got the patch. As soon as I find the time to buy a new one I’ll E-hance my life with it, asap.”* Their expressions turned from vaguely menacing to warm relief. *“I figured it was something like that, my boy. You always were such an efficient worker. Looks like all of this was just a big misunderstanding! Here, let me save you the trouble of buying a replacement, I have one here.”*

I froze. He pulled out a neck brace identical to the one I’d disassembled in my apartment and handed it to me, with an expectant smile. *“Well, go on then. As soon as this little matter is settled we can discuss bringing you on as a part timer.”* I wanted to cry. The easiest thing in the world would’ve been to slip it on, get the job and reconcile with Samantha. Everything I wanted was just one short step away. 

I looked at my watch. Salvation. *“It’s lunch break. I’ll put it on once I’ve had something to eat. Better to E-hance my life on a full stomach, surely?”* They looked quizzically at me, but didn’t press the matter. As soon as I was out the door I headed home. Just above the speed limit, as a cop pulled up behind me and turned on his lights. Fuck, not now. 

I rolled down my window to greet him, license and registration in hand. He asked me what the rush is, and as he leaned in, I noticed the blue and yellow necklace on him. *“I’ve only just heard about the fantastic potential of the E-hancer to revolutionize my life! There’s no time to lose, I have to go buy one!”* His face lit up. *“Well shit, if I’d known that I wouldn’t have stopped you. On your way already! Your E-hanced life awaits!”* 

Couldn’t believe it was that easy. But the cops too? How did this happen so quickly? I drove past some other poor fool that’d been pulled over. He was cuffed, up against the squad car, and as I squinted to get a better look I realized the officer was placing an E-hancer on him from behind. Returned my eyes to the road just in time to avoid rear-ending a semi. 

I burst through the door to my apartment and frantically set about taking the E-hancer apart. This time wearing a welding mask. The aerosol nozzles blasted the mask with sticky blue spray. I took the mask off as I’d no longer need it after that point, and set about neutering the devious little machine. I intuited it needed to think it had already implanted the needle. So I placed one finger on either of the little metal pads. Soon after, the spring loaded needle did indeed jut out of the little hole. 

Looking closer, almost invisibly thin tendrils had emerged from the needle’s tip and were flailing around in the air as if searching for something. I snipped the fibrous bundle connecting the needle to the PCB, gripped the needle itself with a set of pliers and yanked it free. A light began blinking and the familiar beeping started, so I snipped out the battery. Just in case it had a GPS tracker, audio bug, or any other unwelcome surprises. 

With all of that done, I delicately reassembled the E-hancer and re-sealed it with model airplane glue that cured transparent and could be dried in a few seconds by spraying accelerant on it. Once finished it looked good as new. It’d have to. I admit some degree of hesitation to put it on, even after I’d completely disabled it, but there were only fourteen minutes left in my lunch break and they’d begin to suspect something if I didn’t return on time. 

When I showed up at the office with a fake smile on my face and the E-hancer on my neck, everybody’s demeanor was completely different. Where before they’d treated me with stiffness and suspicion, they now congratulated me for “E-hancing my life” and spoke to me with the sort of fondness normally reserved for family members. *“Knew you could do it, m’boy!”* My boss strode up and violently shook my hand. *“Welcome to your new E-hanced life.”* 

I smiled as wide as I could, made direct eye contact and did my best to sound the part. *“Yes sir! E-hance is a dynamic and promising startup that is revitalizing small business in the US, and I’m proud to be a part of that!”* You could practically see the endorphins flooding his brain when he heard that. Like the specific rungs and notches on the end of a key depressing every pin by exactly the right amount to open a lock. 

I was promptly hired on, not part time but full time, and experienced no further trouble from the boss or any of my co-workers. Once they believed you were “E-hanced”, their weird subtle hostility simply vanished and they turned their attention to the next guy without an E-hancer. The story I was assigned was a big one. Especially for someone who’d been an intern until today. Something about a massive cyberattack on multiple east coast cities involving hijacked TV screens and loudspeakers. 

I typed it up best I could. Engineers are not renown for their spelling or grammar. However I received zero criticism when I submitted it for review. Word had gotten around that I’d E-hanced my life. Now it seemed like I could do no wrong in their eyes. My skin crawled. I didn’t understand it fully, not just yet, but the more I saw of this phenomenon more my gut churned. 

As I prepared to drive home, I got a call from Samantha. My heart stirred, even as I tried to disrupt that foolishness. *“Hello?”* Her voice verged on euphoria. *“I heard the good news! That’s so incredible! To think that the E-Hancer has the power to change the heart of even the most Krion-hardened skeptic! We should get together and celebrate.”* I wanted to decline. I told myself I couldn’t, for the sake of keeping up appearances. But really, petty as it is, I hoped I would now have an in with her. Something to bond over, the beginnings of a new connection between us.

Her idea of celebration was to attend a motivational meeting together. Everybody was lined up in rows of folding metal chairs. Some clean cut douchebag in an expensive suit stood at a podium upfront, with crates of E-hancers stacked floor to ceiling on either side and a projector screen just behind him. 

*“It’s so wonderful that you could all make it again. Welcome, my brothers and sisters! I see we have a number of new faces in the crowd today! Congratulations on E-hancing your life! If each of you could stand up and supply a testimonal about how embracing the E-hancer has improved your life, that would be fantastic.”* 

It sounded optional, but wasn’t. One by one people stood and ranted excitedly about how they’d been destitute, lonely and lost before they E-hanced their lives, but were now on an upward spiral of wealth, hope, and personal growth. My turn came up. There was no literal spotlight on me but it damn well felt that way. I nervously stood, thought about how to proceed, then began to gush. 

*“I uh...was a failure before the E-hancer. My girlfriend left me, I was working a thankless job for no pay and Krions were sapping my productivity. But when I...E-hanced my life...everything changed for the better. You might say it revolutionized my life with its dynamic potential, really. Now I’m a full time employee at the local paper, and reconnecting with people I care about who I never thought I’d see again.”* 

Everybody clapped uproariously. When I looked down at Sam, she was smiling, her lower lip trembled and there were tears in her eyes. More and more I wondered if this wasn’t all for the best. I had the job I wanted. I could for the first time in nearly a decade see a realistic way to get back with Sam. Couldn’t I just let it happen? 

The lights dimmed and the projector cast some sort of infographic on the screen. Initially dull sales figures, but then a world map. Red dots indicated locations of motivational centers. The coasts of America were solid red, completely saturated. *“Bad news for the Krions!”* he joked. Everybody laughed identically. 

We watched clips of ads for the E-hancer in Chinese, Korean, Spanish, Italian and French. Everybody clapped after each one even though they were identical except for the language. Then came an animated display of projected international spread over a one year timeframe. Something seized up in my chest as I watched the red dots rapidly engulf the entire map. 

The temptation to go with the flow drained from me. Even if it meant I could have Sam. Even if it meant I could have the job and life I always wanted. I could not abide this. Whatever primal instinct causes us to revile filth, illness and decay flared up in me. 

I stayed for the rest of the meeting so as not to arouse suspicion and gave no outward indicator of distress. Inwardly, I was constructing plans to escape the city. I had my old bugout bag from that prepper phase I went through during the Ebola scare. It did double duty as my spontaneous weekend camping gear. That included everything I’d need for perhaps three days on the road. But what then?

*“Are you alright? You look troubled. Have you forgotten the blessings of your new E-hanced life?”* Samantha clung to my arm, doting on me. It felt inexpressibly fulfilling to receive that kind of attention from her. It’d been so long. But I did not falter. 

Smiling wide, I lamented: *“Just thinking about all the poor Krion-infested fools out there who haven’t yet E-hanced their lives. If they only knew what they’re missing out on.”* Wordlessy, she scooted over and planted one on me. *“I really like the new you”*, she whispered. No. No, I privately told my heart. Not for you. 

Once home, I did some more reading on the website. *“Do not disassemble or otherwise tamper with your E-hancer. Doing so could result in serious injury. Do not remove your E-hancer once it is applied. Doing so will result in epileptic seizures, followed by death. By purchasing the E-hancer you acknowledge these dangers and agree to abide by the terms of use included in the box, and described on this website.”*

Would’ve been nice to know that earlier. I rubbed my eyepatch. I could see only formless, colored shapes. I hoped that meant my eye was recovering. Then I got to wondering if anybody else knew about this. I turned on the TV and flopped down to catch up on the news. After the tail end of a story about the cyber-attacks on East coast cities, there was some fluff piece about a three legged dog who saved a baby. Then something about E-hance! My ears perked up.

*“A number of consumers have come forward to complain about a new health device taking the North American market by storm, the E-hancer. Brainchild of Bruce Hance, the E-hancer is purported to improve health, morality, productivity and general happiness by removing Krions from your body. Watchdog organizations we contacted to get their take assure us Krions are real, a serious threat, and that the E-hancer is a dynamic and promising method for removing them. My viewers will know I’ve busted a lot of scams in the past and I won’t fail to investigate this one. I’ll try on the so called E-hancer and find out for you, the viewer, whether it lives up to the hype.”*

I groaned. As expected, when he returned he had only glowing praise for the device and urged all viewers to buy one as soon as possible, *“With your last few dollars if need be!”* Then, abruptly, the emergency broadcast system cut in. It didn’t take long to guess why. Nor did I stick around to wait for the national guard. From what I’d seen to date, I figured when they finally got here, they’d all be wearing E-hancers and the relief trucks would be loaded with crates of ‘em. 

I considered buying a gun on my way out of town. Initially, remembering that there’d be a waiting period and background check caused me to write off that possibility. But on a hunch, I stopped by the nearest gun shop my GPS could find. Sure enough, the guy at the counter had an E-hancer on. Breathlessly, I informed him that dangerous creeps who refused to E-hance their lives were after me, simply for delivering a testimonial to them about how it changed my life.

*“Muthafuckin’ Krions!”* he shouted, and spat on the floor. *“This here’s what you need, brother.”* He handed over a vicious looking rifle with a massive scope, and a small pistol clipped to the stock. *“The rifle’s for taking ‘em out from a distance. That little guy on the butt shoots rimfire, get ‘em in the leg with that, then when you’re close enough, E-hance that sumbitch.”* He laughed, so I did too. When I asked what it would set me back, he waved it off. *“On the house, since it’s for a good cause.”* 

That worked so well, I used it several more times to score free gear. Dehydrated backpacking food, camping gear, jugs of gasoline, a tent, tarps, even an emergency radio. After a while I worried I was pressing my luck too far. With my car loaded up, I headed for the interstate. Recalling what I’d seen at the meeting, I evaluated my options as to where I could go. I parked for the night off the road after covering the car with tarps and a bunch of tree branches. 

Sleep was fitful. More weird nightmares. When I woke up I had a dozen voice messages on my phone. A few from Sam, about how my boss called her wanting to know where I was. The rest from my boss. The first few sounded worried and compassionate. Each one after that sounded increasingly suspicious and hostile. 

I kept going like that, assuming the worst until I began to pick up government transmissions on the radio. *“If you’re receiving this and haven’t yet purchased or worn an E-hancer, desist from doing so and stand by for an emergency state of the union address.”* I turned up the volume and eagerly listened. 

*“My fellow Americans. Those of you receiving this address who have already partaken of the E-hancer product which has spread across the country like wildfire over the past month, I am not speaking to you. From what intelligence tells me, this is some kind of contagion. The necklaces hijack the central nervous system, and afflict the brain in such a way as to stop short any thoughts critical of E-hance, any efforts to remove it or desire to obstruct its propagation. It rewards with high doses of dopamine and seratonin any thoughts supportive of E-hance, about convincing others to try it, and to facilitate its growth around the world.”*

It lined up with what I’d seen so far, and it was an immense relief to see that an official effort to put a stop to all of this was underway. *“I advise those of you not yet afflicted to seek some out of the way retreat, off the beaten path. Do not speak to anybody wearing the E-hancer. If they approach you and you shoot them, you will not be prosecuted. Be warned that they will try every means of contacting and locating you.”*

I looked at the messages on my phone, now rapidly multiplying. Check. 

*“They will make every appeal to your emotions, to practical concerns, to family obligation.”* I searched through the new messages. Some were from my sister and parents. All this time, it never occurred to me. There just wasn’t time to save them. 

*“Any attempt to spread the word through official channels about what the E-hancer really is and how it works will never make it any further than that, as I guarantee you, whoever you contact in the media will already be wearing one. That is in large part how this spread so quickly without anybody realizing what was happening. They act in support of one another to achieve their singular goal, and gang up in mass opposition to any poor soul who realizes what’s occurring and tries to stop it.”*

2vrih5,0,2015-02-13,[F4M] Introduction To The Office Whore!,OfficeWhoreDPP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2vrih5/f4m_introduction_to_the_office_whore/,"Every workplace of any substantial size has at least one official office slut. She will let any coworker do anything he wants to her anyplace and anytime, regardless of age, race, looks, or marital status. She dresses, acts, and talks like a slut.

I happen to be the official office slut where I work. My name is Jennifer and I'm 20 years old, my breasts are a perky 34B with an equally perky ass. Almost every guy in my building has fucked me at least once. I've even let a couple of 19 year old interns make me their property in my car during lunch. Ive always worn short skirts and thigh highs so the men have easy access to my cleanly shaven pussy and tight little asshole. Everyone knows I don't wear panties because of all the peep shows I give the men around the office. All a man has to do is call me into an office or bathroom and bend me over and spread my legs exposing my slutty married wet pussy and ass. 

All while I beg them to fuck me hard as they can and call me a dirty whore then they fill me with thick rope after rope of their portent cum. Almost every day I go home to my husband, cum dripping from both of my fuckholes If only he had any clue what happens when his wife is at work for the day. I want this RP to focus on all of my escapades throughout my average work day. From when I leave for work kissing my oblivious husband good bye, to when I leave the office wiping cum from my lips as I leave through the front door. If you want to add/change anything let me know. I'm always open to new ideas.

**Detailed/literate/long-term responses take priority. You can also include a picture of what you'd like my character to look like/be wearing for extra points**

2vrz0a,39,2015-02-13,My (26f) entire life is falling apart and I feel trapped.,everythingisfragile,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2vrz0a/my_26f_entire_life_is_falling_apart_and_i_feel/,"I have to say this first, that I am a lucky person and I have a fiance, friends, and family that love me. I know this. But everything else is falling apart and I'm scared. 

I graduated law school last May. I did alright. Ended with a 3.0. My school is not well known nationally but is in the top 100 and well respected in my city. I had two great government internships. I currently work 20 hours a week at an employment law firm making 22/hr. My finances are not great. I am around 170k in debt and have close to 2k in credit card debt. Please don't yell at me. I know this is bad. 

I failed the bar last July. I failed by 4 points and it crushed me. It's embarassing. People judge you for it. I'm taking it again in 11 days. I will fail it again. I'm pretty sure of that right now. And I feel like my life is falling apart.

I had to work through the bar this time to pay for it and support myself. I never ended up only working those 20 hours. All I have been doing is studying and working and it's not enough. I know I'm going to fail. I'm tired, burnt out, and miserable. I will lose my clerking job after this and I don't know how I'll support myself. I was already only making about 1.3k a month. I can't move home and my fiancé can't support me. I'll have about a month after the bar to look for a job and save as much money as I can before I find out if I fail or pass and have to find another job. 

I feel like a failure. I've never felt this low in my entire life. At this point, I don't even know if I want to be a lawyer anymore. Which makes me feel worse for wasting my time and money and sanity. I've picked up terrible habits of drinking every night and that's about the only time I'm not anxious. I don't drink extremely heavily (2-4 beers in a night) but I do drink often. 

I can't go back to school. That would be ridiculous with my debt. I don't know what jobs I qualify for that will be enough to support myself. I don't know what to do anymore. 

I feel stupid and like I failed everyone in my life. I don't even know what I'm asking for here, I just need help. Sorry for rambling. 

**tl;dr** The past 3.5 years of my life have made me into a miserable person with bad habits. I have fucked up everything and I'm tired, scared, and embarrassed. Help. "

Now I need more clients if I'm going to make enough money at this to get by. 

So I have two questions: 1) Do you have any ideas about who I should talk to, where I should post ads or leave cards, etc. to drum up business?, and 2) Does anyone need a writer, editor, or English tutor?

Your help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

The parking lot had only a few cars, and I was the only person on the floor. Just about everyone went to the annual training conference at the national headquarters for the week. Initially, I was upset that I was stuck here because of a meeting with a client tonight, meaning I missed three days and three nights eating and drinking on the company’s dime. However, I’ve cleared my schedule, rare for a younger executive. Now, it seems that I only have to stay available and I have the rest of the day, and the weekend, to myself. I do wish I dressed a bit more casually, instead of the grey suit, tie and shirt that I chose. 

I’m finishing my second cup of coffee, feeling a bit satisfied that I might get some golf in when I hear the unmistakable sound of high heels walking down the hallway. You turn the corner into my office and I see it is:

-The intern, here on her last day, double checking if I need anything and confirming my letter of recommendation will be provided;

-The cute, shy girl from legal who I’ve thought was very pretty;

-My girlfriend, surprising me;

-My ex, surprising me;

-My pushy, demanding boss, who is difficult to deal with but dead sexy;

-Someone else I was not expecting (Your choice).

If any of these interest you, let me know. Include a description of who you are, what you look like, and what’s happening. If you need to explore anything kinky, we might need to get a hotel across the street.

2vsdwf,346,2015-02-13,TIFU by implying I would have sex with my interviewer to land a job,KidsBeRagin,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2vsdwf/tifu_by_implying_i_would_have_sex_with_my/,"Today I was having my first skype interview ever with a company I would like to intern at over the summer. I had not anticipated that they would ask me logic puzzles during the interview (this is a computer science related internship) and so I was a little off my game.

The guys that were interviewing me soon traded off to a lady who was mid 20's and a guy who seemed to be in his late 30's. They were a lot more approachable than the other two so I began getting a little more comfortable. They asked me my interests and what I do in my spare time. I answered with things like swimming, biking, and riding my unicycle. The unicycle part stood out and they seemed interested in it but continued on with the normal interview.

Towards the end of the interview they opened the floor to me to ask them questions. We eventually just asking off topic questions back and forth when the guy asked me: ""I have to ask, what's up with the unicycle?"" To which I replied: ""My parents bought it for me one Christmas as a joke and I picked it up pretty quickly.""

The lady asked me: ""Would you ride your unicycle to work every day?""

Without thinking, the words: ""If I get the job, I'll ride whatever you want me to ride"" tumbled out of my mouth.

I did not realize what I had said until they both started laughing hysterically and the guy said ""we won't take it that far!"" My face turned bright red and I couldn't help but to laugh with them. I am currently waiting on a call back from them hoping that they will forgive me for my word vomit.

TL;DR: I accidentally offered to ""ride"" my potential boss in an effort to land an internship.

EDIT: I would just like to announce that I now have the job :) Thank you to everyone for the kind words.  Not too much of a FU after all."

2vsgjx,3,2015-02-13,Just about everything in my life is making me feel like shit.,Stark_ravingMad,whatsbotheringyou,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/2vsgjx/just_about_everything_in_my_life_is_making_me/,"Let's start this off by letting you know I'm 22, male, and in college studying mechanical engineering. And I can't think of a good way to make this narrative style, so I'm just going to list off my issues in the order they come to me.

1. I've never had a girlfriend. I've never even been on a date. I kissed one girl, once, last weekend. Saw her the next day in class, smiled, said hi. Her response: she looked at me like I was a panhandler who hadn't showered in weeks. I have asked several girls out. The first said yes and then stood me up after dragging me through the mud for 2 weeks. The second, I actually respect because she was honest and told me she wasn't interested. The majority of the rest have been a string of obviously bullshit excuses. And the latest just never answered. The latest, a girl I met over the summer, is really cool. I really like her, and I think she likes me too, but every time I ask her to do something just me and her, she doesn't respond until after the date would have happened. With Valentine's day being tomorrow, this is just hitting me harder than it normally would. I don't even really care about sex all that much, I just want someone who I know actually wants to be there with me.
2. School is killing me. I'm in my 5th year. I know that's fairly normal, but I still have 1 year to go. I'm only taking 13 credits, but the sheer amount of work I have to put in to keep up leaves me absolutely no time to do anything I actually want to do. I usually ski regularly; I haven't been out once this season. 
3. I can't get a decent job to save my life. Right now I work part time at $9 per hour as a ref, but the season only has 2 weeks left. I've spent the last 3 years in school trying to get an internship. My first and second years, I didn't even get an interview. This fall I got 4 interviews, no offers. There's another career fair coming up next week and I don't know what I'll do if I don't get an internship. I have a guaranteed job for the summer, but it's working for minimum wage as a gardener.
4. I'm overweight and out of shape. I'm not enormously overweight -- 6', 240lb the last time I weighed myself -- but I'm terribly out of shape. I get out of breath if I go up a flight of stairs a little faster than normal.
I want to try to work on it, and I have been watching what I eat to some extent, but I just don't have time to work out.
5. My parents make me feel worse about everything I already feel bad about. They're not bad people, and they aren't trying to make me feel bad, but the way I'm programmed, that's just how it happens. Anytime I go out with friends to have a couple beers they ask if I have a drinking problem. I tell them how I'm doing in school, they tell me they know I can do better. They tell me I need to eat right and exercise -- I know they just want me to be healthy, but all I hear is that they're ashamed that I'm fat. They told my brother and I that they would pay for us to get our first bachelors degree, which I absolutely love that they were willing to do, but my school is expensive enough, on top of everything else, that if I don't get financial aid, I won't be able to go to school next year. 
6. I don't know who I'm going to live with next year. I've already signed the lease to keep the apartment I'm in now. One of my roommates is moving into her sorority house, another is moving out to live with some other friends, and I just found out my third roommate is thinking about moving out. That leaves me to find 2 roommates, on top of all the other shit I have to deal with. My landlord is breathing down my neck because he wants to get everyone to sign the lease, but there's nobody to sign it.
7. I feel like a horrible friend. My best friend bought me a computer for Christmas because he wanted me to be able to play video games with him. Due to my severe lack of time, I haven't been able to play any video games since December. Also, one of my friends at school recently got an internship. Normally I would be happy for her and only be a little upset that I still didn't have one, except for the fact that the internship she got is the one I've been trying to get for the last 2 years. And she only talked to the company at the career fair this fall as an afterthought because I was talking to them and they had a short line. I really want to be happy for her, but I'm too upset that I didn't get it.
8. I feel like I don't have anyone I can talk to. All of my friends are almost as busy as me, so they don't really have any time to talk. But when we do talk, we end up spending 90% of the time talking about their problems. I love helping my friends, but sometimes *I* need to vent too. I know some of them would gladly let me vent, but I don't know if they would actually care, and I would feel bad for burdening them with my problems.
9. The only time I ever feel happy is when my friends and I are drinking. I don't think I'm an alcoholic. I've even been trying to cut down on my drinking to help me lose some weight. But when I'm drunk and around friends, I can turn off the stress and just forget about all the shit that's piling up around me.
10. I feel like I'm easily forgotten. My friends make plans to hang out fairly regularly. The problem is, they almost never seem to remember to tell me what the plans are. I almost always have to ask if there's something going on.

All of this shit -- my loneliness, my lack of free time, my apparent lack of future -- has been steadily compounding as the year goes on. I just don't know how much longer I can handle all the stress, and I know it's only going to get worse as the school year progresses. I would never kill myself, so that's not an issue. I've definitely thought about it, but, being me, I would have to do it in a way that wouldn't inconvenience anybody, and that's just not possible. I just couldn't do that to the people I love.

Sorry for the length, I just needed to get all of that off of my chest."

I also took a Data Structures and Algorithms class and a Java class.

I've been doing a research internship at a nearby university implementing machine learning algorithms in Python and Matlab for almost a year now, but I don't know how relevant this experience would be (my name is attached to a couple published papers, though).

I do intend on finishing a 4-year degree in Math or CS, but the soonest I could start would be next January. Given that I basically have half a year off and I'm pretty tight for money, I thought it would be good to try to get a software development job. I'm in the Bay Area, and I'm sure there's something for someone in my position, but the fact that I'd be going back to school 7 months after starting seems like it could complicate things.

Any thoughts?"
2vtdnz,8,2015-02-13,Best advanced degrees to pursue between undergrad and MBA?,gl581c,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/2vtdnz/best_advanced_degrees_to_pursue_between_undergrad/,"I'm finishing undergrad this spring and starting at a major firm (not far outside of MBB and Big-4) in June. Undergrad is in Mechanical Engineering. I'm studying for the GMAT and targeting a full-time MBA in 3-5 years, goal of getting in to an M7 school. My firm's education benefit isn't great but not terrible, pays out a reasonable fixed amount annually regardless of degree (as long as it's relevant to my work) which would cover most of a part-time M.S. assuming no financial assistance. I'm staying in the same city as my alma mater and have great connections in a few grad programs with them, plus a few other good schools nearby with solid options.

I'm not completely sure what sector/area of consulting I plan to focus on long term so I'm hoping to improve my knowledge and boost my credentials for MBA applications while keeping my options relatively open. If I had to pick something now I'd be shooting for management consulting at an MBB firm following my MBA. Here's the options I've though of so far but I'm open to suggestions.

* **MS Mechanical Engineering**. Highest chance of acceptance as well as receiving a decent amount of financial aid. Could start as soon as Jan. 2016 if accepted. This builds my technical credentials but I'm worried it will take me down a more specific path than I wish to pursue. Can transfer in 6 credits out of 12 grad credits and retake the other 6 in 2 classes I've completed and excelled in.
* **MS Computer Science/Engineering**. Decent chance of acceptance at my alma mater but I'd have to complete about 12 credits of prerequisites first.
* **MS Finance**. Need 12 credits of prereqs.
* **MS Business Analytics**. No prereqs.
* **MS Information Systems Technology**. No prereqs.
* **MS Applied Mathematics**. No prereqs + 6 transferrable credits.

I'm leaning towards Finance or Business Analytics (if I can get in). I feel like I'm in pretty good shape to be competitive, I'm taking GRE/GMAT in April and anticipate performing solidly in the 90th+ percentile. Undergrad GPA will be 3.1-3.2 with varsity athletics, continuous part time work and internship experience, plus major leadership positions in a couple extracurriculars.

I'm hoping to narrow down in the next few weeks to 3 options to research in dept and apply to. Any thoughts on which direction to pursue? Thanks!

I am stuck and I don't know what direction to go.",Snakey1024,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/2vtfd5/graduated_with_asian_studies_and_asianamerican/,"I graduated last December, receiving a B.A. in Asian Studies and a B.A. in Asian-American Studies.  I knew going in that there was not much of a job market with either degree, but I enjoyed learning about all Asian cultures/languages/etc. It was something I was good at and thoroughly enjoyed (and the professors were amazing).  

I had been leaning on the idea of teaching English in Japan for a few years, to get teaching experience (since I thought that it would be a viable career option), on top of making connections in Japan with the possibility of landing another job there.  However, I didn't make the interview rounds with JET, Interac was too expensive to even start, and the other companies seemed to be more of a business run school compared to actually teaching.  I was driving with the blinders on.  Of course they are a business, they need to make money.  So I decided that teaching English is a no-go, for now.

My dream job is to work for a video game localization company, like XSEEDS or Aksys Games.  However, all of these types of companies are very small and I don't have most of the necessary requirements to even apply. Most of them aren't even hiring.  Or working with a manga/anime publishing company.  Something related to Japan, since that was my area of focus.  I have a JLPT (Japanese language placement test) level 4, borderline level 3, so Japanese fluency is still a ways off.    

I have been applying to many jobs not even related to my field, and I have received about 3-5% call backs/interviews, but never have been offered a job.  I have warehousing/logistic experience, managerial experience, and customer service experience.  But none of them long enough to be considered experience to full-time employers.  I had an interview with a manga publishing company, however, they are only taking unpaid interns with no guarantee of full employment afterward.

I was thinking about attending a JC in the Fall to start taking Computer Science courses, however, I am terrible at math.  I even struggled with college algebra.  I know for a fact that upper division math is going to be painful, but I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to take classes and eventually a major that I know are going to be rough, makes it seem like a big waste of money if I drop out of the major (which seems to be like my 2 B.A.'s).

So where do I go from here? None of my dream job companies are hiring.  I don't have the experience they are looking for and some of the requirements I don't have. Any advice would be appreciated.   "

I've been applying for internships and I applied to Citi's Summer Technology Analyst Program. The internship opportunity popped up through my university career website. I have an interview with them next week. My dilemma is that I am a computer engineer so I know about both hardware and software but I dont know either as masterful as an electrical engineer or a computer science student would so I am really scared of what the interview questions will be. 

Part of the job description for this position mentions ""Knowledge of C#, .Net, Java, Closure, SQL, or any other related languages""

And  the Application Developer track mentions ""Candidates should have a fundamental understanding of current programming, multi-threading, and familiarity with basic concepts of relational databases. Working knowledge of either C# or Java should be demonstrated to design and build technology software solutions to meet business requirements.""

Basically I know mostly C and a little bit of C++ through coursework and looked at python tutorials last summer. Im mainly familiar with low level/embedded programming so I know nothing about high level database stuff but apparently Im qualified enough to get an interview. 

Besides low level programming I was really good at my Data Structures class (I kinda loved it actually) so if they ask stuff about data structures I think I should be fine but stuff about relational databases or C# or java I dont know anything about. Is there anything that I could do to prepare??? Or am I pretty much doomed lol. This is pretty much gonna be my first real programming interview"

2vtonu,21,2015-02-13,Nmom tried to control my sexuality.,ivysavoy,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2vtonu/nmom_tried_to_control_my_sexuality/,"As long as I can remember, my nmom has tried to control my sexuality. She had always made the notion that sex equals babies and women who had lots of sex are nothing but whores. She forced those beliefs upon me many times that I was afraid of having sex. And I didn't want to displease her.

She started to say those beliefs when I was 12. I'm nearly 25.

Every once and a way, I get a large sex drive (like now as I'm writing this). And I'm attracted to men. 

You must be thinking why are you waiting? Well, I have many reasons. The first is that I haven't found the right guy I could trust. I had many opportunities (I wasn't really interested in sex in high school), but there was something in my gut that told me no. I eventually found out later that my gut instincts were right. These guys were self-absorbed assholes who's main interests where seeking sexual conquest and talking negativity about a girl's body (ex: she was too fat, her ass was dirty, and calling her a stupid bitch)if she didn't have the ideal body. Another reason was (and still is ) chances of pregnancy. Yes, I know that birth control and condoms have come a long way, but there are not 100% effective. Plus, the side effects. I'm still in college (but graduating soon and planing to start a marketing internship soon) and I'm not financially and emotionally ready for kids. I do want kids in several years (once I'm mentally, emotionally, and financially ready), but I do not want them right now. And I don't want to get any STDs.

What pissed me off about my mom's views was that she was a hypocrite. Before she met my Edad, she had ""some fun"". Now, I'm all for people to express sexuality in their own ways, but I really dislike hypocrites. My religious Ngrandmother is a bigger hypocrite by having 8 kids by 5 different men!

So I'm still waiting for that special guy (whom I can trust and respects me) to sweep me up my feet. And no I am not waiting for marriage. And casual sex is not for me either. It will fuck me up emotionally."
2vtqke,18,2015-02-13,"Coming Out, or, How I Found Out It Was Crohn's and What Was Done About It",IWasBeingSarctastic,CrohnsDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/2vtqke/coming_out_or_how_i_found_out_it_was_crohns_and/,"TL;DR - My Crohn's DX story. 

I've had CD since 1994. I've always been pretty closed-mouthed about it. I've never told my story, or even mentioned having the disease ""publicly"" - i.e., social media, blogs, my reality TV show, etc. – assuming no one would care to hear my whining. Besides, it's gross and embarrassing, right? But after 20 damn years I'm finally starting to realize that connecting with people who would likely understand or relate might actually be a good thing. Maybe it will help me deal... take some of the pressure off my long-suffering spouse. Maybe it will help someone else. So here I am, opening my first Reddit account and sharing my experience. I'm a little nervous I'll do it wrong, but please bear with me.

I feel compelled to mention at this point that, if you're just starting down Crohn's Road, and you're scared shitless – so to speak – you may want to stop here. My journey, as I understand it, was not necessarily typical, and it was at times pretty horrifying. But in retrospect, it's also mildly amusing.

Here goes.

When I was 21 and still in college, I became very suddenly and severely ill, with searing gut pain, night sweats and rapid weight loss. Tests and tests revealed nothing. At one point my doc felt compelled to test me for AIDS... I was utterly terrified, but it came up negative. Finally – in what seemingly amounted to a medical Hail Mary – Doctor J prescribed ulcer medication, and lo and behold, it resolved within weeks. Eureka! Ulcers be gone!

However, one morning a full year later, with no warning, I awoke in agony, able to do little more than vomit repeatedly and crawl to a phone. A friend came and drove me to the campus clinic, where I knocked over a rack of brochures trying to get to the bathroom to puke again. They immediately called an ambulance to take me to the local hospital – Ellensburg Hospital in WA – where I was admitted, intubated, poked, prodded and violated in a thousand ways.

The most notable violation at this early stage, I think, was probably the naso-gastric tube, or NG tube. For the uninitiated, this is a not-quite-as-narrow-as-you'd-think tube that is placed up the patient's nose and run down into the stomach. The tube is attached to a noisy pump that continuously slurps out the stomach contents into a clear jar. So much noise. So many colors. 

I had that tube in for 12 weeks, and while it was the one thing keeping me from exploding, by the end it hurt worse than almost everything else. Almost.

To put it the tube in, three nurses – preferably large ones – surround you. They hand you a cup of water with a straw and tell you to start drinking, at which point they close in and ram the tube up your nose. If you instinctively stop drinking due to the shock of having a tube rammed up your nose, the other nurses will shout, ""KEEP DRINKING! DON'T STOP DRINKING!"" So you continue drinking, tears squirting from your eyes, as the tube is snaked down your throat and into your stomach.

Tube firmly in place, I was put in a room and occasionally subjected to inconclusive tests. After two weeks, I was released, ostensibly just because I *wanted* to go home. The surreal conversation went something like this:

Doctor: Well, how are you feeling today?

Me: Thanks to this tube up my nose, I guess I'm doing okay.

Doctor: You wanna go home?

Me: Yeah.

Doctor: Okay.

So I was released - still with no explanation for my symptoms. After a half hour, still filling prescriptions for God knows what (to match my non-diagnosis), it started up again. I didn't want to go back to the hospital with their tubes and needles and fingers, so I went to the apartment of my sorta girlfriend for the night, where things continued to spiral perilously downward. 

I guess I was dying. That's what the surgeons said later, anyway.

I survived the night and returned to the hospital at dawn. I was immediately readmitted and retubed. Ellensburg is not known as a hotbed of medical science, and not really the ideal place to get a ""mystery"" condition. 

That's how the doctor termed it; I was a total mystery, he said. By this time I was on a cocktail of powerful drugs, but I think I said something like, *then please send me somewhere else… somewhere where they solve mysteries would be good.* 

Next thing you know, I was on an ambulance, headed over the mountains to UWMC, a teaching hospital at the University of Washington in Seattle. Three hours later, I was surrounded by doctors, interns and medical students. Class was in session.

The doctor in charge described my symptoms and history, then went around the room asking what the next move should be. Most all of them suggested more testing and further observation. The last student said shit on all that, let's cut this bitch open. Like now.

In spite of the abiding terror, I had to chuckle to myself. This guy's way too hot to trot, I thought… he's about to get shut down hard.

""That is absolutely correct,""  the doctor replied to my shock and dismay, ""and exactly what we're going to do.""

They still didn't know what was wrong with me, but they figured there was only one way to find out. Two hours later I was counting down from 100.

I don't remember the surgery, so I guess the anesthesiologist did his job well. I woke up during a colonoscopy once, and that was pretty fucking bad - I fleetingly wondered what I had done to end up in prison. I'd *really* hate to wake up to my jiggling, glistening guts being pulled from my abdominal cavity. I don't imagine that happens very often these days, but it probably does sometimes. Probably at Ellensburg Hospital.

When I came to, my family was all standing there… my mom, my dad and my brother. I remember I had these weird, transparent inflatable pants on… they would ""breathe"" at regular intervals, and it looked like each of my legs was being swallowed by a transparent, asthmatic anaconda. These pants utterly delighted my brother. I had to admit they were pretty hilarious.

As the world continued to swim into focus, I was introduced to my surgeon by my weeping mother. ""This is The Man Who Saved Your Life."" she said, somehow capitalizing it in her speech.

Admittedly, I was no less taken with him at that point. I thanked him profusely. This was before I found out he took my appendix while he was at it. Because it was there. Seriously. Apparently one of the risks you take when you get emergency abdominal surgery at a teaching hospital is that the surgical team will have carte blanche access to any ""vestgial"" organs.

Clearly I'm still bitter about it. But I digress. 

They had removed eight inches of my small intestine, specifically from the terminal ileum –   the portion immediately preceding the colon – which had become as useless as an equivalent length of garden hose. They sent the nasty, wiggling thing to the lab for biopsy, but the surgeon already suspected Crohn's disease. I'd *heard* of it, but that's about it.

The biopsy confirmed it was indeed Crohn's. I was so relieved to have a name to slap on it, I experienced virtually no despair. I thought, Crohn's disease! Weird! So now I'm cured, right?

Well, no, of course not. They explained that there is no cure, that the cause was unknown, and that I would likely experience a recurrence in the Future. But I was just young and stupid enough not to give a shit about the Future, which was this abstract thing that had no bearing on here and now. Here and now, save for the staples and whatnot, I was all better.  

So at this point, all I had to do was heal up a bit, cut a fart, take a shit, and I could go home. The minute I farted, I was told, I could get that fucking tube pulled and have some food. Weeks of nothing but TV with its parade of junk food commercials had been testing my sanity. By this time it had been more than a month and a half since anything but ice chips had passed my lips. I wanted food so bad, I could taste it. Only I couldn't taste it. Farting had now become my mission in life.

One morning, the Boss Doc and his team - including some med students - showed up as usual for my morning prodding. They had me lift my gown to expose my stapled belly. The prodding began, and I noticed the wound was tender. More to the point, it ached like a bastard. There were also red lines radiating out from the incision.

An intern materialized at that moment with a pair of snips. No one told me what was happening exactly. The intern simply snipped about 11 staples from the wound as I looked on curiously. The edges had healed just enough that the wound still held closed on its own. That is, until Boss Doc resumed prodding, at which point the wound suddenly exploded with a spectacular arc of pus and blood at least a foot into the air. I yelled in agony, and the docs recoiled, barely avoiding a faceful of infected goo. Someone - Boss Doc, I think -  shouted ""Whoa!"" It was like popping a zit on Goliath's ass.

The doc began excavating in there, jabbing cotton swabs into tunnels of infection running through the muscle. I kept jamming my thumb down on the morphine button, but it was useless. I was weeping openly by this time, but I couldn't look away.

The wound, they said, would have to heal openly, from the bottom up, and it was gonna leave one hell of an awesome scar. They told me, to my astonishment, to go take a shower and to ""let soap and water flow into the wound."" I thought this sounded insane, but I obliged. I always obliged.

As I stood under the spray, the nauseating smell of my exposed, bacteria-laden gash mixing with the steam suddenly punched me dead in the face. Weak as I was by this time, the foul stench was the last straw… my vision receded to a pinhole, and I collapsed on the bathroom floor. I tried to call for help, but it came out as a pitiful squeak. I somehow managed to pull myself three feet (miles?) to the wall and pull the emergency string, and two large people came in and put me in bed soaking wet. I was very grateful.

Things got hectic in a hurry after that. Suddenly I was being wheeled down the hall again, going into surgery. What I didn't know at the time was that this event was known as ""wound dehiscence,"" and about half the time it ends in death. The care team - wisely, I think - chose not to divulge that specific information at this juncture.

Once again, I did not die. When I came to, there were no inflatable pants, but there was a huge bandage on my midsection. A nurse began to change the dressing, and I got my first of many, many looks at the gaping, meaty maw that my belly had now become. A gorge of right red about eight inches long, two inches both deep and wide, with a ridge of hard ivory fascia on either slope. The nurse explained the process of caring for the wound step by step as she went along, as I would be doing this myself three times a day when I went home.

The process involved rubber gloves, long wooden swabs, gauze soaked in saline and giant abdominal pads. The wound was to be stuffed with the gauze, tucking it into the edges with the swabs. A pad was then to be taped over the top. The act of stuffing stuff into what was once my insides was incredibly bizarre, but it eventually became old hat. 

It took me two weeks to squeak out a tiny little fart, signifying that my gut was finally returning to life. I got Jell-O. I was the single most delicious thing I had ever eaten – even better than the three cups of scrumptious orange-flavored barium they made me drink for a test earlier that week. Two days later, I  finally took a shit that felt like a flaming refrigerator but resembled a Brazil nut. I got a hospital version of an Egg McMuffin for my efforts. That too was the most delicious thing I'd ever eaten. 

Now it was time to go ""home,"" which in this case was my parents' house in Monroe, WA. I didn't grow up there - they moved in when I went away to college, so it wasn't really familiar, although it was about to become so. I spent the next 60 days recuperating in that house, faithfully changing my dressings and going to my follow-up appointments.

This was also where I detoxed. See, throughout my hospital stay and subsequent home convalescence, I was on an array of addictive drugs… for a total of about five months. At first it was Valium, for some reason. After a few days at E-burg they finally decided I wasn't faking and warranted actual painkillers. IM Demerol, in the butt cheek every few hours. Made me sweat like crazy, but at least it took the edge off and time was passing more quickly. When I arrived at UW, they switched me to Dilaudid, the stuff they were keen on stealing in the movie Drugstore Cowboy. The nurse explained that this was a newer drug, way better than Demerol. She had no idea.

When she first stuck that needle into my IV tube and pushed the plunger, my vision suddenly failed, and I felt my sleeping bowels jump for the first time in many weeks, and even though I had that tube up my nose, I was certain I was going to first throw up, then die. I remember thinking, *I can't have this stuff! I'm allergic or something! It's going to kill me! I'm going to die!*

Ten seconds later, I didn't care what happened… dying or not, everything was just hunky dory far as I was concerned. I developed an instant interest in my nurse's backstory, and later in the individual fibers of my hospital sheets. They were such beautiful fibers.

For the next six weeks, in addition to my morphine button, I got 4mg of Big D straight into my vein, at 8-hour intervals. The last four hours of each of these intervals was a clock-watching fest for me. *Come on, come on. This Morphine sucks!* [pushes button] *I want my goddam Dilaudid!* When I finally started taking food, they took me off the IV drugs (much to my dismay) and put me on 15mg of Oxycodone, at the same interval. This was what they sent me home with. 

Later, at a follow-up at UW, the young resident I was working with handed me a refill script for the Oxy, and Doc Boss took notice. He quickly snatched it from my hand. ""He doesn't need those anymore,"" he said matter-of-factly. 

What followed was not exactly like Basketball Diaries or anything, but I can tell you my body definitely did not like the sudden denial of it's happy chemicals. The next day was Thanksgiving. I sat at the table with my family in Monroe and stared miserably through the gravy boat and off into space, wishing I had drugs… wishing that my every joint would stop aching… wishing that every cell in my body would stop screaming for Oxy. I ate almost nothing and was pretty poor company. For the next four nights straight, instead of sleeping, I would alternate between thrashing, sweating and searching under my bed for just one stray pill that never turned up.

Anyway, that was the beginning of my journey. Still more things happened after that. A lot more… What with twenty years having passed and Crohn's being incurable and all, y'all know that the horror stories keep on comin'. At least I didn't have an ostomy.

I have recently gotten accepted into both UMich's and UIUC's Engineering CS programs. Most likely, my college decision will be between these two.

**My question is:** For those who have attended these schools/are familiar with them, which school will provide me the better CS/engineering education and ultimately land me a better job (i know, i'll have to work hard, just the school alone won't get me anywhere)? I am looking for advice on which to pick, if i do not get in anywhere else.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am planning on working on the West Coast after I graduate college. Prestige/name might matter for getting my first job out.

If it matters, I already have tons of programming knowledge (backend, frontend, mobile dev). Last summer, I had an internship at a local tech company. I also have one lined up for me this summer in NYC.

Thanks a lot."

I was accepted into B/S Computer Science this afternoon and I'm pretty excited. I have a few questions about UI:UC...

How competitive is the computer science major ?

* Is it extremely difficult or is it possible to get good scores by working hard

* Are professors effective at teaching, and are they friendly

* Do students compete with each other, or is it pretty chill

2. Are there good internship opportunities from good software companies?

3. Is there life outside of the campus? ie: is Urbana-Champaign a nice city?

4. Is there a ""hacker"" / ""maker"" culture?

5. Are students focused or is there a significant drug/party culture?

Thanks much, can't wait to hear your responses!

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the responses. I have a much clearer (and positive) picture of UI:UC now. Still have a lot to research, but at least I know that the community is friendly. "
2vua1p,6,2015-02-13,"GF (23/F) is extending her oversea stay, possibly another 3-6months. I'm losing my mind (23/m)",boobooyum,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2vua1p/gf_23f_is_extending_her_oversea_stay_possibly/,"I just need cheering up...

Sorry this is a VENT. I've been anticipating her getting this internship for the past month. I have been worried sick, my appetite is really bad lately, and i'm just not happy in general. Now i got the news she will 95% be likely getting the second intern.

We have dated for 5 years. During our time together there had been 3 other occasions where we have been a part for 3 months due to travel reasons.

She has been away for 3 months now. Initially this was how long she was supposed to stay as she is working as an intern. 

She heard about a month ago that it might be possible for her to be accepted into a new internship, working for a world know organisation, at the same location. However she had not heard anything about it, and has been waiting to hear back from HR to confirm she can do the intern (visa problems). The impression i got from her was that if she hadn't heard back from HR lady until today, that she would go back home as planned.


Anyway, i just found out today that she was told 2 days ago by the GM of this organisation, that everything should be fine and that she will most likely get the intern. She still however, needs to get the confirmation from the HR person. My GF sais out of 10, she is 9.5 sure she will be getting this intern.

I had already booked flights to go see her, next weekend. booked about a month ago. She thinks i should probably credit the flights for another date in the future, when she's staying overseas for her next intern.

Now i'm freaking out, the thought of another 3 months of seperation kills me. I'm happy for her, and i want her to succeed, but i don't want this. I've told her this and she understands my point of view. I also said that 3 months is the most i could do, letting her go originally for the 3 months was hard enough, and if she was offered longer I said i'd prefer if she not accept that position. She said 'okay i'll only do 3 months then, you never know it could just be one month'. I can't tell for sure if she's saying that to make me feel better temporarily. I keep thinking in my head she's going to get offered 6 month-1 year internship, and say 'ummm, so the internship will be 7 months, and i've been taken around where i will work and it looks awesome, i'm going to have to take it', with no regard of where i stand on this.

I'm also worried about what the distance may do to our relationship. We were really happy before she left. Half way through these 3 months she told me she was having doubts about us b/c of the distance, but that seems to be behind us atm, or so it seems. We still talk everyday, she says she loves me, misses me, and intends to move back into my house once she's done. This internship obviously will be putting this on hold.

I'm worried that she is going to get these thoughts again, I opened up about this to her just an hour ago on skype, she said 'stop worrying about it, we are going to be good, this past 3 months has flew by, we've done it before we can do it again, we are going to be fine, please don't worry.

3 months is scary to me, but it's not all that bad. Assuming she gets the role, she will be back here in 3 weeks time, will stay for 3 weeks, go overseas again for 3 months, in which i will visit her half way through by changing my flights. I mean the longest we will be a part then would be one month, which isn't too bad

But i don't want her to go any longer. To be honest i'm actually praying for that 5% chance that she is unable to extend her visa. I feel bad about that, but i can't help it. 

How can i come to peace with this guys? I'm just constantly on edge and don't know what to do..

 Any words of encouragement would be nice


   
**tl;dr**: Am I wrong feeling like this... How do I become more positive about this? I'm stressing out too much need to chill"

I am currently in a class this semester that teaches me everything about Excel, Access, VBA, and SQL (in that order). By the time of the interview, we would have covered Excel and Access but not yet learned VBA or SQL. By the start of the internship I will have learned everything.

I was wondering what the best option would be for my resume?

1) Put it directly under ""Skills"" and explain the situation in the interview (if i get one)

2) Put something like ""Learning VBA and SQL"" in my ""Skills"" section (and explain in interview)

3) Leave it off completely but somehow bring it up in the interview

Opinions? Any advice is greatly appreciated"

I entered as a GE but slowly discovered I liked CS. So for the past two semesters I've (stupidly) been set on getting into CS, took 125 and 173 and other classes.. My grades in 125 and 173 are As but my overall gpa is pretty poor, just shy of 3 at 2.97, mainly due to struggling with time management and study habits. In the process of addressing these problems, taking 225 right now and it's going as well as it can for three weeks in.

I'm working smarter this semester, should be able to raise my GPA to 3.2 but I know that isn't high enough for Eng. CS so I've pretty much given up on that. 
I was interested in CS/Stats but reading through the recent influx of transfer posts it's looking like that won't be a possibility either. I'm simply not competitive. 
I'm worried what will I do when I can't get in? At this point, CS is the only thing I want to do, the only thing I've really liked, but transferring to another school to do CS isn't an option due to my gpa and being instate. I'm already a sophomore and most of my classmates have been going to career fairs, getting internships, doing amazing things, but honestly because my resume is bare, because I've barely made any progress in my current major, I can't get anywhere. I feel like such a fraud too, going to career fairs and networking events as my current major when my heart isn’t in it (and it probably shows), yet being unable to sincerely talk about CS since it’s not my major and I won’t get in anyways. So much time is slipping by me and I don't know what to do. I feel like I’ll have wasted an entire year at the end when I do try to transfer and end up with nothing.. what do I do at the end of the year? I don't want to continue with my major as I honestly don't have any feeling towards it, and the principle of doing something I don't love but have to is awful. But I have to face the reality. I only have two years left and I’ve done nothing but waste my parents’ money. I’m not literally failing college, but I feel like I am..I don’t belong and I don’t even have a single friend.

Talked to an advisor in LAS and she ended up suggesting sociology. Planning to talk to a CS advisor on Monday but expecting to hear the same gloom speech I've been telling myself for the last month. So what can I do besides get the best gpa I can and cross my fingers? What do you suggest I do right now to make the most of my situation? Any good major ideas? I'm just completely panicked and trying to funnel that into something productive instead. Thank you...

Where I am currently, I'm doing Coldfusion development and writing a lot of SQL. The work isn't exactly up my alley, but I'm not opposed to it in any way. The people are great, the office is nice, and the perks are cool too (free breakfast, fountain drinks, a gym), but it's also 30 minutes away from campus, and getting there during the day is really starting to bog me down. Traffic can be brutal in either direction, too. 

The other internship is a more front end oriented one, with some .NET work. I've got an interview next Tuesday for an open position and my roommate asked me to pursue it, since he works there. This place is only 10-15 minutes from campus, and a bit more lenient on how many hours I put in a week during classes. 

Does it reflect poorly on me to leave an internship after only two months in favor of another? Both internships have a chance of turning into full time positions after I graduate this May, but neither is a sure thing. Just looking for a little insight if advice. Thanks! "
2vujkf,3,2015-02-14,"Virtual relationship, real heartbreak",Victorfranz,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2vujkf/virtual_relationship_real_heartbreak/,"Do you remember when we first met 5 years ago, on that subculture/music/pseudo-dating website? Your username just sounded different, your pictures were blurry and your profile very succinct, yet you seemed so unordinary that I felt compelled to message you and learn more about this mysterious lady. I added you on MSN (yes it’s been that long) and we talked until 4-5am. I think that we got along pretty well quite fast, sharing life-stories and just providing our mutual loneliness with a genuinely caring company. I felt as if I knew you, as if I had always known you. 

It became an everyday thing once you were back from the hospital. I would come back from school/work, sign in on MSN and spend the evening/night/morning sharing songs, thoughts and feelings. When I was playing online with my friends, I would quit earlier just so I could spend some time with you. Sometimes, I would literally end up sleeping next to my laptop, exhausted because we had spent 12 hours chatting (that’s just how comfortable our discussions were). It seemed we never ran out of things to say, even with the language barrier or the physical distance. You would tell me about your problems and your fears and I would try to transmute them into goals and dreams. It was natural for me to provide the best advices; the little experience I had about life was the best I could offer and I guess it was enough for you. I know that sometimes you just needed to vent, that I shouldn’t always try to help, but trying to solve your problems was something important for me, I needed to feel useful during this journey by your side.

Eventually, we grew fond of each other (or I grew fond of you and you tagged along), never using the big L-word full of commitment and implications, but our constant companionship, a virtual one I have to admit, was our bond, our own way of being faithful to each other. You wanted to take things further and make it an official statement on Facebook but I was reluctant to do so. I felt it would damage the connexion, make it as futile as what we have always been used to… all these failed relationships we both experienced before. I also wanted to meet you, to travel these 1,509km separating us so we could figure out for ourselves if we truly had something worth longing for. You were hesitant, you wanted to become someone who would “sweep me off my feet” (your words) before we could meet. I did not see any need for that considering that I was already obsessed by you, but because I knew how anxiety and fear affected you, it would have been a bad idea to show up on your porch with my Sunday smile and a *bouquet* of good intentions.

And then you disappeared. You blocked me on Facebook and you did not show up on messenger. The summer was over, you were back in college and something happened…boys happened. I cannot blame you for picking someone who had more physical presence than me. This person existed in the material world while I was only a thought. I was devastated. I fell back to my old self; drinking until I could hear my heart pounding and waking up next to girls who did not make me feel alive. It was as if we never met, you left with the good part of me.

Almost a year passed, and I ended up going on MSN on my smartphone for no particular reason… and you messaged me. A little “Hi there” as if we never parted. I don’t know if you had been waiting for me to show up, or if it was just a coincidence but I can recall exactly the moment and the place where I was when it happened: waiting for my bus at the metro station, it was a sunny spring afternoon. My blood was flowing, I felt alive once more. Of course, you had some apologies to make; you had to earn back my trust. But your explanations would suffice, I understood that by keeping me away you wanted to protect me, at least protect what we had from the side effects of frustration, some potential conflict bred by jealousy. I guess I would have probably done the same thing… You were back, it was all I needed.

Then we wrote a new chapter of our common narrative. You were transformed; growing older made you feel more grounded, more confident. The relationship seemed more real now that you were back. I felt that you came back for the good reason: us. We renewed the friendship and eventually went back where we had left the romance, starting anew but on foundations we built before. We also moved our chats to Skype; we witnessed the death of MSN together. I bought calling cards and spent them on long distance calls. We would spend some of my off-days together, going on “webcam dates” while wearing our best attires. I was confident enough in what we shared to tell my friends and family about you. You were part of my life at that moment.

Getting my undergraduate degree meant that I had to go through internships. I found one in a multinational company in May 2013. That is when you stopped showing up on Facebook or Skype, or if you were online, you would just ignore my messages. Juggling between the internship and losing one of the most important person in my life became a true ordeal. I was not focussed at work (I was mainly trying to analyze why you were gone) and could not speak about my personal life without getting teary-eyed. We eventually managed to have “the talk”. I learned that you had met someone and that you felt “it was serious”. You still wanted to be friends and keep contact but we both knew how it would end… I blocked you on FB so I would never get to hear about you again. This summer ranked pretty high in the “top shitty summers of my life”.

2014, last year in college: I met a lovely girl in one of my classes. Not too sure if she was into me but I sure found her attractive and we were getting along well. I started talking to her more and more. I felt that this person could be someone I would be willing to wake up next to for at least a part of my life if not what remained of it. Then, once upon a night, I left my Skype on…

-You: Hey!

-(No reply from my part)

-You: Yeah I wouldn’t either…

Then you left a message saying that you had been missing me, that things had changed in your life and that you were ill-prepared for these transformations… that lately, you had been crying every night. Seriously... how was I supposed to feel now?

…It fucked me up. I was under the impression that the wounds were healed... I had been pretending that I was done with you… I decided to stop wasting time chasing someone who could take your place in my heart. I wrote you some lengthy message asking what your motives were and how you planned on reconnecting with me. You replied, apologizing for being a shitty friend, that you missed me “as a person” (a euphemism for “I only like you as a friend”) but you would understand if I wanted to remain out of your life. I replied that if you were still with that person I wouldn’t want to be part of your life (I admit that I used ""you are dead to me"" out of spite) and I blocked you. Then you stalked my LinkedIn, I blocked you. You made another profile, I blocked this one too. Now, whenever an anonymous user looks at my profile, I assume it’s you. I can’t seem to block you enough. I blocked you on Steam… even if we were not friends there. I know all your internet aliases (yes I can stalk too) but since that day, I never went to see your online profiles because I’m trying to stay sane. To acknowledge your existence is just too painful. Whenever I am in contact with something that reminds me of you (a song, a TV program, a book, the mention of the State you live in, someone with the same name… the list can be quite long) I avoid it; I recite mental litanies to avoid the painful memory, temporarily shutting my senses into oblivion until what reminds me of your existence vanishes.
It’s been almost two years and I still miss you more than ever.

**TL;DR** : INFP meets INFP online. Relationship ensues. Breakup ensues, twice. OP misses her. Happy Valentine’s day."
2vukt9,9,2015-02-14,"24F4M Looking for a RP Partner for ""corruption""-themed story",WhiteLinenDPP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2vukt9/24f4m_looking_for_a_rp_partner_for/,"So DPP --

I have been having some strong and unusual fantasies of being corrupted lately.   They usually go something along the lines of a guy honing in on me and destroying my image,  taking advantage of me,  using me for his own means and pleasure.  Maybe compromising my relative morals and chastity are part of a revenge plot, or simply a difficult conquest worth having.

I can't seem to get the itch to go away.   I have had some luck satiating such needs before through RP on here.   I figured that it might be time to dust off the keyboard and see if anyone is willing to help.

So, I guess with that being said I am interested in finding someone aroused at the idea of roleplaying such a scenario out with me.   I tend to have pretty long poses normally,  but adjust somewhat to the style of the person I am playing with.

Since I like character development and story, I tend to prefer mid- to long-term correspondence.   I do have a busy life (including a boyfriend, if that bothers you, ) so I am not really a good match for someone who is going to be unhappy if I can't always respond as soon as they hit send.   I usually do manage several,  if not more,  messages a day,  though.

My kinks can vary.   Due to the nature of this roleplay they are going to tend to be on the rougher side.  If your character can make mine start acting like a porno starlet, all the better.   No bathroom stuff, animals/bestiality, or blood,  please.

I'd love to hear some ideas and kinks/wants people have.   I have provided a couple prompts I have thought up below,  but don't feel bound to them.   Creativity and taking initiative are sexy traits,  after all.

1) The Construction Foreman's Daughter - No one said life after school was going to be easy,  but you also didn't expect a true maniac like your boss.  After two years of putting up with his screaming, mandatory overtime,  working through injuries,  and coming home exhausted you just got laid off.  

He said that he had your back,  that you had a bright future -- turns out he was just taking advantage of you.

You are commiserating at the local bar when she walks in -- the bosses' daughter.   Sure, word is that she is an ice princess, but with her overprotective father, how couldn't she be?  The truth was you caught her looking at you more than once at the work sites.   She'd always blush red and turn her head away. 

Maybe it's time to see how deep her coy crush on you goes....

2)  The Truth -- It's, been half a year now since your frat was suspended from campus.   After a series of strikes, an attempted rape charge on the fraternity president's  head sealed the case.

She said he cajoled her,  tried to get her drunk and drugged in order to take advantage of her.   He said that she was a wildcat,  begging him for it until that very last moment she cried ""no"".

She played the good girl with traditional values card in front of the school and eviscerated his defense.  

She doesn't recognize you as one from the exiled fraternity as she now gets assigned a school project with you.   The way she smiles at you,  blushes -- you can tell her self-imposed moral code has her built up like a cork.

It just will take the right man to pop that cork,  and show the world that your fraternity president was only giving her what she desperately needed, and was asking for.  Play your card rights and it might even get your chapter off suspension.

3) Intern Rivalry -  Alright,  so maybe you haven't always been the perfect son, student,  or employee,  but life is for living, right?

Despite some crazy nights and missed morning meetings,  you never thought that your future working for your own father's law firm was in jeopardy.  This internship was always just a symbolic step until you got a real position.

That was,  until she came along.   Sure,  she is nice to look at -- you can't fault your dad for keeping her around for that.   Lately,  though, there has been talk of her getting the permanent position at the law firm that was promised to you.

Time for her to learn how to live a little.   If she ends up losing her perfect image,  falling behind on work,  and maybes -- just maybe -- carrying a man's baby in her belly,  all the better.   That job is yours,  after all,  and she should respect that.

I don't really have too much dating experience as I have only been in like 2 and according to my friends am obtuse and generally don't pick up social cues as well as others. I figured everyone starts somewhere even people who are as socially awkward as me, with that in mind I decided to set a goal for myself that by the next valentines day I would be in a relationship as I am sick of being alone and seeing my friends who are all in one. I began to observe people and noticed two things that stood out for me first is a relationship works if both parties share similarities in hobbies, ideologies, ect.. so I gave some thought on what I liked to do at my leisure and that was playing video games and watching anime which is why it would favor me and the other person if both of us had that same interest. The second thing I noticed is people go out with other people who around the same height, fitness or physical attractiveness. Psychologically and historically speaking women usually favor a man who is fit or has a lot of power as they will be the best spouses to have children with. With all that in mind I began to see how I stacked up to these criteria I consider myself pretty fit as I do play varsity tennis and keep myself at around 130-140 pounds and with the height of 5'9 that puts me in the normal weight category when I calculate my bmi. As for the power thing I don't really have that much going for me yet as I am only 18, however when compared to people who are around my age range I believe I accomplished more than most, like getting an internship at Linux and turning into a job, placing in the 95th percentile in my class when it comes to SAT, completing most of my general ed with the college advantage program and even taking some ambitious courses that weren't required and passing them with flying colors like multivariable calc and abstract algebra, beyond that I am bi-lingual in Russian and English while also knowing a decent amount in Japanese and Spanish, people also say I am very talented when it comes to drawing and I more or less agree with them. I guess that's really it for me, I would like people to give me some advice and keep it mostly civil and constructive, thanks!"

I am a 28 years old single girl that accepted Christ 10 years ago while I was in college, and He has put strong believers in the first few years of my walk to show me the love of Christ. Believers that represent Christ in their speech, behavior, just overall their love and compassion towards other people. My faith in Christ grew over the years, and I have seen him provided unexpectedly and no way my rational brain could give any other explanation other than and but God. In other words, God has been real to me.

One thing that is troubled in my heart now more than ever is where my husband is? In where I live, I started to think the likelihood for the kind that I want would be very slim to none. I have kept His words, served Him, trying to do the right things in all of the situations I encountered.I know I am not supposed to worry about my life...Well,here goes my story..
I was an exchange student from Asia to study in a huge public university in the Midwest.I am physically attracted to white male ever since 12 years old..Oh how funny what puberty did to a girl's mind. There was an opportunity to study in America, and I went with it. I met my first boyfriend in a soccer match unexpectedly the second semester in the college, and I didn't know he was a strong Christian. He was very knowledgeable on many things, smart, funny, and most importantly his heart and his respect for me as a person.He said early on that he wouldn't want to do anything with me until marriage.We would just kissed....Just the amount of sweetness he had and how he treated others opened my eyes that such good guy exists. 

After few months together, We mutually agreed just to be friends due to external circumstances and also the fact that I was ready to be away a semester for an internship. We never fought.  When I came back, I found out that he started seeing a girl, and they got married a year after. Through some other things, I started to pray to God, which I hadn't done so for two years. God introduced me to a loving Christian fellowship and provided financially, which was one of the huge stressors at the time. I didn't meet anyone in my senior year as I was busy focusing on my grades and working.

 After graduated, I moved away to a different city. I got plugged in to several bible studies and young adult ministries. I met C, also without seeking, on 4th of July. I was one of the four that wanted to watch a firework displayed in a local park, while the rest of the young adults stayed behind at a party gathering over someone else's house. It was at the park C and I started conversations where we didn't have the chance before, either we were overlooking each other or what, I didn't know. We started hanging out. He was smart( civil engineer), from good home, strong believer,and very supportive. Everything about him was perfect, except I wasn't physically attracted to him. He was kinda scrawny, he was probably like 28/29 inches in waist. I am 5""8 and size 6 clothing wise, I might be the same or weight more than him. I thought to myself the attraction would come eventually once I got to know him more and more. 

I am not talking about he needs to be like Channing Tatum, in fact I find most of the men are attractive when they keep themselves clean. I tried to encourage C to gym, but it just wasn't him. My heart knew he deserved a girl that loves everything about him. So, we had the discussion that it would be good for us to stay as friends. After few months, he started seeing an Asian girl, she was about 5""2 and new to the US at that time. They got married a year after. 

 I moved away, eights months after C, to another state for grad school. I haven't met any guys ever since, that were closed to what my first boyfriend and C were. The small church I attended didn't have any single guys. But, I still stayed true in my walk with Christ, going for Bible study, going for mission trip, building fellowship with seasoned and matured ladies. I signed up for dating sites, and went out few dates with few guys. The feeling weren't mutual for some of the guys that kept us continue seeing each other. 

Fast forward, I met B. He was driven, smart, and financially stable.He wasn't in the States at that time so we were just talking over the phone. We talked about anything and everything..even to how we want to raise kids. We met for the first time after three weeks talking. The problem was he didn't have relationship with Christ at all. He said he knows there is God and never indulged the conversation further than that. We started talking about marriage, and I had prayed for signs of approval from God. Through sharing who he is and our relationships with my seasoned ladies friends, they didn't think I should seeing him. My visa status was almost up at that point, and  I understand the roles of a wife and mother in God's eyes and I am ready. I practice open communication, trust, respect..all in all the core of a marriage that is Christ centered.

The final straw was when God spoke through a woman preacher on a webcast conference that I went. She spoke quite specifically on the things that I prayed about, so I knew it was from God.
I prayed for courage to break it up with B, and I got a lot of support from the ladies in my church saying God would honored that. Now a year later, I am back in my country feeling little dim, even though I had all of these promises that had been spoken to me. On the worldly view, there isn't a lot of Christians here, so my mind started doing math and having doubt on whether I made the right move. A lot of lies in my head about the pool of eligible men are getting smaller, or I won't find anyone :( I often time hearing people having bad first relationship, but mine is the contrary. Why did God introduce those two sweet guys to me, and later dropped the bomb?


Well, your prayer is appreciated. 
PS 1: please no hate on the kind of man that I am physically attracted to. This is just one of the many factors that I will have relationship with the guy, having a relationship with Christ comes first. 
PS 2: Please don't bash saying I want to find an american guy, so I could get a green card. If I wanted to do that, I would have done that in the first or second year that I was in the US. I lived in the States for 8 years. I only want a genuine relationship that we are the right one, and yes physically attracted to each other . Thank You for your time:)"

A bit about me:

* I have internship experience at a couple of fast-growing, well-known start-ups here, in both content/writing/SEO and analytics. 
* I took computer science classes (Python, Java, SQL, PHP) in university, but did not major in this. I am good, not great, at Excel.
* I used to do well in math but haven't studied it for years, so I don't have any statistical analysis experience/knowledge. 
* I'm hoping to make $60,000+ within 1 year of graduation, but $50,000 would be fine starting out. I'd prefer to work at a medium-sized start-up than a big company.

What would you recommend as jobs I might consider? I have been looking at ""data analyst"", ""marketing analyst"", and ""product analyst"" listings but am open to any suggestions! 

Thank you!

2vw25c,2,2015-02-14,DaVinci Institute thoughts?,bullfisher,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2vw25c/davinci_institute_thoughts/,"I have applied for the Ruby on Rails 13-week bootcamp at DaVinci Institute and am waiting for the interview to see if I am selected.  Although it is not nearly as expensive as other bootcamps, it is still $6,000 that I don't have and I'm wondering if it's worth it.  I have been learning on my own, mostly, for the past year (HTML, CSS, and JS) and don't feel like I've gotten very far.  I can make simple static websites and still struggle with the basics of JavaScript. I had *zero* computer experience and even less programming experience at the beginning and although I know a lot more than I did to start with, I feel like I should know more than I do.  I also attended a front-end bootcamp but that seemed to be more lecture based watch-how-I-did-this than us actually coding, so I am even more hesitant about spending $6K if it will be similar.  My goal is to be ready for an internship or jr dev position by the end of summer.  The main reason I want to do the bootcamp is because soon my kids will be out of school for the summer and I'm afraid I will not be able to have a block of time devoted to studying unless I attend a class.  

Which brings me to my main point: has anyone gone through the DaVinci Institute or know of someone that did?  If so, please tell me your honest thoughts on how well prepared you felt for a jr dev position upon completion or any other info about the program.  Thanks!"

I'd like to hear about *actual real world numbers* (""I got X for doing Y and I had Z semesters/personal experience/previous internship experience""). Year and location would be helpful.

I live in Sacramento, CA and I know I'm getting *way* below what I'm worth, and I'm planning to leave if I don't get a reasonable raise. I have rent to pay.

I taught myself to program as a kid and decided recently to finally make a career of it so I went back to school and got an internship immediately (freshman year/0 compsci units completed).

I do server-side web development in ASP.NET/C# for the State. Typical CRUD app but on a large scale. We use an n-tier architecture, so WCF service calls between layers. Entity Framework (LINQ-To-Entities). Implementing possibly large lists of business rules using both business and presentation logic. (I had dabbled in web development on my own with PHP, Python, Perl, etc over the years so it was pretty easy to get up to speed although I had very little prior C# and no ASP.NET)

First of all I am a 23 year old from the United States and I currently hold a Bachelor's of Science in Electrical Engineering.

So, I am in a pretty okay college in a flyover state with a decent EE graduate program. I am currently employed as a research assistant at the university. I am working on writing my thesis for my Master's Degree right now and the project I did isn't showing as much promising results as I initially hoped. If I want to graduate this spring, I'm going to have to get everything done and turned in by March 20th.

I would like to think my wide range of experience in my field would play to my advantage in getting hired. Hell I've done everything from computational electrodynamics VLSI design at this point. I have a ton of both programming and hands-on experience in Matlab, FORTRAN, C, Verilog. Hell, if it's in my field, you name it and I probably have had experience with it.

So here is the meat of the problem:

I would rather not share the details of the 'why' but the long and short of my issue is that I need to get a job in Germany somehow. I'm not in trouble with the US government or any investigation agencies or something like that, but I am trying to move to Hamburg by at least late April of this year for personal reasons.

All things considered, integrating to Germany won't be a problem. I speak German on a basic level and I have people close to me I can at least live with until I get my job situation under control.

That being said, I'm facing a few dilemmas here: The only professional experience outside of being a researcher was being in IT as a web developer for a few years during my undergraduate years. For whatever reason, I could never seem to land an internship anywhere despite getting called in for interviews a lot.

Due to my frustrating experience in previous years, I'm having an endless amount of anxiety about just applying for a job in general let alone one that's in another country.

I don't even know where to start to look for jobs in Hamburg or elsewhere in Germany. NXP Semiconductor looks promising and I've applied for a few positions there, but I have no hook so far. The other place that seemed promising is DESY and I am looking into applying for them too.

In between all of this I'm still working on writing my thesis and I'm actually having a hard time doing both because I'm really lazy when it comes to writing and, again, I'm feeling extremely anxious from all the stuff going on in my life right now and all the deadlines I feel like I have.

Let's just say if you were hypothetically in my situation and you could not get a job in the USA for whatever reason, what would you do/what would be your advise? Thank you in advance for any suggestions or advice.

tl;dr: Need to finish thesis by March 20th, need to move to Germany after that, need to get a job after that. Stress and pressure is making everything harder."

I am looking for either an internship or entry level software development position. Several things to note on my resume in its current state:
 
* GPA: 3.31 is **only** CSCI courses. My major and cumulative GPAs are 2.75 and 2.93 respectively. I will remove GPA altogether if this seems misleading.

* Projects: The first is a personal project and the second is a school group project. The school project was fairly difficult and only a handful of my classmates worked on the same portion as me due to the group structure. For those reasons I felt it was alright to include the second project. (I could be wrong here). I don't have any other personal project at the moment but could add other school projects.

* Employment history: Obviously these are unrelated, but I think the coaching looks good and the construction job shows consistency. I could use some advice on trying to""sell"" both of them a little bit better.

Thanks in advance!"

I'm a junior CS student at a UC school, and I've been looking for a summer internship.


I currently have an internship that I've worked at for the past year, but I want to leave it because it's with a state agency, and I don't think it looks that good if I want to work in the private tech industry. I also have a couple of open source projects on my github, that I link to and describe in my resume.


I've been applying to internships at my school's career fairs and online since October. I've received one phone interview, which i've failed, one coding challenge that I've submitted but have yet to receive a response, a phone interview request I've rejected because I didn't like the company, and the rest were rejections/ignores. This was with 20+ applications sent out. There is one more internship fair where I will try, but I'm sad and not too hopeful at this point..


What should I do? Keep working at my current job over the summer?


Also, do you think that my current job has affected me negatively? I hear that government workers have a reputation of being lazy. I don't think this is very fair however, since the agency I work for exists strictly to write software for the government. So it has a real focus on software engineering, and we use the latest tech like ASP.Net MVC 5, the hottest javascript libraries, and so on.


How will this affect my full time job search which will start this fall? I really want to work at any tech company in the Bay Area, startup or otherwise."
2vx5f3,3,2015-02-14,Options as a foreign CS major graduating from a college in the US?,sockduffman,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2vx5f3/options_as_a_foreign_cs_major_graduating_from_a/,"I'll be graduating this June with a GPA of around 3.2-3.3. I've found my classes very challenging but rewarding, yet unfortunately due to depression/burnout I never really put myself out there and applied for any internships. I'm much better now and trying to make up for lost time and opportunities.

In a post I made some months ago I mentioned taking a break after graduating, but a few days ago I decided that it might not be the best idea. I don't really have a resume other than my school's name, and the projects I did for class (heap allocator, implementing PintOS, a MySQL backed Quiz website in Java, a COOL compiler etc.)

So:

I will apply for a 1-year post-grad OPT extension of my F-1 visa, but long term I would like to live and settle in the US and keep working here, if at all possible. 

How does this factor into my job search? How does my situation limit the number of companies that may want to hire me, that is, am I limited to the biggest companies that can afford to obtain permission for me to work? I'm afraid that I literally have to work for Google or Microsoft to be able to get a working visa, and I don't know how possible that is in my current situation.

I've heard that I should not mention that I'm not a US citizen in my resume, since that would decrease my chances of getting an interview. Is that true? If so, when is the appropriate time to talk about such a topic?

So basically here's my situation, I'm currently in a relationship with a girl who I've been with for two and a half years (ever since starting uni). I now live with her (until the end of June anyway)

Problem is, she got a new job about a year ago working at uni. Ever since she's started she's made some good friends there, and also one friend (a guy) who she seems a little closer to than all the others.

This has single handedly caused me a LOT of heartache over the past few months, and I've seen some pretty big red flags which she's raised literally right in front of my face.

- She texts him often, and then tries to hide her phone away from me when I come over to her. Like literally she doesn't even finish typing, just switches her phone off the second I begin to come near her (even though I can see who she's texting from her phone's screen)

- They've stayed at other houses together, in different cities (with their work 'friends' ofcourse)

- She NEVER invites me out when she goes out with her work friends, like literally I've asked if I can over lots of times, and it's a big fat no everytime.

- They rang each other on new years, I thought she was actually talking to her parents (seemed really personal the way she was speaking, then she puts the phone down and boom, it's the guys name)

- Last night we were out in town, and by the end of the night she says she wants to meet her friends when we were in the taxi going home. I say I'll come with her and she says that I should just go home. I go with her anyway to this university halls, and guess who's there, yep, the same guy plus 2 others.

I mean it's getting a bit ridiculous now, she seems to be seeing him literally everyday, if not in work, outside going for drinks, studying together (caught them together doing work in the library), all this shit.

So the question is, how do I bring this up to her and not loose my shit as I do it?

I've mentioned that I feel neglected before because she never invites me out with her, and she just says that she doesn't want to be tied at the hip with me, because we live together and all, but it's like everytime she goes out I'm NEVER invited. Also I work full time on an internship so it's not like I'm in the house all day either.

**tl;dr**: Girlfriend may be cheating, Lots of red flags, don't really know how to talk to her about it."

So, I'll be a year behind.

After going to to career fairs and finding out that even the companies that want Electrical Engineers actually want kids to do CS stuff, I'm wondering whether I should switch or not.


Would I be too far behind, in terms of being qualified for internships by the end of junior year? I'll have taken CS 101(into java).Intermediate Software Design, Data Structures, Discrete math, algorithms, digital logic,  and computer organization."
2vxj7r,7,2015-02-14,Trying to break into Marketing Research...do entry level positions even exist? Advice &amp; Perspective needed!,CloudsTasteGeometric,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/2vxj7r/trying_to_break_into_marketing_researchdo_entry/,"I am a recent graduate (Fall 2014) who's trying to secure an entry level job in marketing research. My degree is in Social Psych and Business Marketing with concentrations in Communications and Statistics. I work with Excel, SPSS, Minitab, and recently taught myself SQL. I picked up an internship doing applied research for a local non-profit (involved survey design, interviews, spreadsheet work, secondary research, planning &amp; admin, and more). Juggling multiple projects, delegating tasks, making inferences, reporting on data, and communicating its value are all features of my experience background. I am proficient at all levels of qualitative and quantitative research, from content analysis, to regression, to ANOVA - and have experience...but only from college and my internship. I've even developed a modest portfolio to showcase my work, to no avail.

My other work experience is pretty much grunt level (with a tiny bit of data entry)...in a perfect world I feel like this would be enough to be recruited by a company and trained to join their team...but that just doesn't seem like a reality to me. Every position I find/apply to explicitly or implicitly *demands* 2-3 years work experience *in addition* to a degree and internships. I am educated and technically skilled enough for these roles but I feel like my resume gets thrown in the trash because I'm a recent graduate who doesn't also magically have years of experience at another firm. It feel like training budgets are a thing of the past and instead companies only recruit older people who are already doing the job they're applying for at another firm.

Do entry level jobs in market research exist? The very idea of a company hiring a recent graduate seems so foreign and abstract to me...none of my peers have found salaried work in their field post-graduation...I have a hard time believing any company would hire a recent grad, even if they do have all the necessary skills, like I do. Every company demands years of experience and often times is looking for a 'pro' to do all the market research themselves, rather recruiting (and God forbid, *training*) new talent to join an existing team.

What can I do to overcome this? At 4 months and 100 applications in I'm beginning to get nervous. I apply for 5-10 new positions each week, researching and writing custom CV's for each, and I feel like I get tossed in the garbage for having the nerve to be a recent graduate. I'm searching in three different metro areas, all big in market research, close enough to drive for an interview, but too far to commute to; I have enough money to relocate for now, but if I don't find something soon I'll be in trouble, my current part time work just doesn't cut it. While I have gotten a couple of interviews, knowing that the search is a numbers game, it isn't nearly as much as I'd hoped and I feel like I'm getting nowhere.

Am I fooling myself for thinking I could get a job? What about cold-contacting firms that aren't ""hiring"" with letters of interest? Is there a possible/tactful way to do that? Do I need to re-work my strategy? Thanks for any advice!"
2vxppa,1,2015-02-14,"graduate student with decent paying job in another field wondering if I should quit to take an internship, not sure what I want to do with CS",bananashotgun33,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2vxppa/graduate_student_with_decent_paying_job_in/,"I graduated with a music degree a few years ago and after a couple years scraping by I started working in real estate to pay the bills. I'm not a big fan and I started taking some CS classes in Fall 2013 with no experience. 

I did a bunch of prereqs and started my Masters in Fall 2014. I did alright my first semester,  worked part-time and managed a 3.33. I'll be working less this semester so I expect I'll do a little better.

So we had a career fair last week and I've been sending out resumes for internships. I've actually gotten a few responses including a big 4 which had an online code test which I did not do well on (only got 2 of the 7 questions). I also spoke to another major company at the career fair and they tested me on paper and while the data structure stuff wasn't bad, I knew nothing of systems and very little of networking (I'm taking a networking class now). 

I'm working as hard as I can to fill in these gaps and pretty much all my time not in work, class or the gym is spent working on interview data structure questions in C++ but I'm still not great. I'm also involved in a Python meetup and a CTF club at school so I'm putting in the work. 

Anyway, I really have no idea what I want to do with my degree. I've only been studying CS for 1.5 years at this point, I enjoy CS in general and the only thing I don't love is front-end but it's tolerable. 

I currently have a non-CS job that gives me flexible hours and pays me decently at $27/hr. I have been speaking to a couple of small companies and while I don't have an offer, I'm pretty sure they'll pay half or less of what I'm currently making. If I was 20 that's be okay, but I'm 29 in NYC and since I'm working part-time I'm able to at least break even for my living expenses. I have some savings for a safety net and am taking out minimal loans. 

1. Is it worth taking an internship where I'll be making considerably less money if it comes to it? 

2. IS there anything else I can be doing to make myself more hireable? I'm also graduating in December 2015. 

3. Is it really bad that I haven't decided exactly what I want to do?

2vy4ey,2,2015-02-15,"I don't know how to cope anymore. I'm a burden, and it would be better if I was dead.",AllThatGlitters3682,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2vy4ey/i_dont_know_how_to_cope_anymore_im_a_burden_and/,"As the title says, I don't feel that I have any safe coping mechanisms anymore. I want to die. 

I'm 28/f and live at home. Not by choice, but trying to find a career I want to pursue in the current economy has been a problem ever since I graduated college at 22. I'm very lucky in that I've been allowed to live at home while figuring out how to use my (useless) degree. I help run the house where I can, taking care of as much of the day-to-day business as possible as both of my parents work full time in demanding, professional careers. I'm also diagnosed depressed with quiet borderline personality disorder (I rage in at myself instead of at others, but the black/white thinking and mood swings triggered by situations persists), as well as a physical health condition. I've been in therapy off and on, seeing a psychiatrist and therapist to work on DBT. I felt confident in myself and my coping mechanisms for a few years, but it's slowly falling apart to right now, when I have nothing left.

It's hard to have any close friends. I've never had a best friend, someone who knows me the best and would always support me. My friends either need mental help themselves or I'm scared to burden them, or I don't trust them. So many have their own best friends, their own social lives, their own marriages and families. Every day feels like a new borderline episode for me now that I'll just push them away with a new horrible life event and pray they don't condemn me too.

My boyfriend doesn't act like a boyfriend anymore. We've been together 18 months and now doesn't see me as a priority. Working in the restaurant industry takes up a lot of his time, and he's now chosen an active role in politics (in a party he knows I can't and will never support) over spending any time with me. I'm lucky if he remembers to send me a text message once a day when we live 15 minutes apart. I've explained that I'm having a horrible time, but he won't ask me what's wrong or even that he cares. Just complains about his job and reiterates he has no time for me due to a sudden interest in politics. But he won't break up with me. Valentine's Day has been especially horrible in this regard. 

I'm trying hard, at 28, to acquire even an unpaid internship for something I think I may want to do. But as soon as I explained this focus to him, he started to pull away from me. Every man I've dated in the past ten years has been the same: as soon as I feel confident or even better, excited, about a career prospect, I'm either dumped or left alone. I can't win.

Trying to take on this internship doesn't sit well with my family either. My father judges me because it's not a paid position and thinks what I want to do isn't lucrative. He further blames me for being a problem in his and my mother's marriage. He's convinced my mother doesn't spend enough time with him and chooses me over him in regards to spending time together. He no longer wishes to associate with me and sees me as useless. 

My mom tries to explain she enjoys spending time with me and while we share a lot, it was never our intent to exclude him from certain hobbies (such as following specific TV shows, areas of history, etc). But he always tells us he has no interest in that. He financially supports us to take trips to pursue these interests and then blames me when he chooses not to come and stays behind alone. He's stopped eating for the most part, drinks more than he ever has before, and doesn't associate with either my mom or myself. He thinks my mom doesn't spend enough time with him as a couple, socially and sexually, because of her time with me. He's been abandoned and it's entirely my fault.

I just stay in my room as much as possible. If I'm not around, I won't be a burden to my friends, boyfriend, and family. If I just don't explain how much pain I'm in, it's okay. So I just want to die now and take myself out of the equation. Not having goals makes me a burden, having goals still makes me a burden. I can't win at anything anymore and I'm better off dead for everyone in my life. No one is meant to live alone, and that seems like the only option I have anymore. I'd rather die."

She moved in with me and 4 of my guy friends last summer. We became pretty comfortable with each other after a couple of months, and eventually I started falling for her. I was messing around with another girl at the time, and I broke it off because I felt more comfortable with my roommate. I kept all of my feelings for her bottled up because I thought it would be awkward if I made any moves on her, especially since we lived with 4 other boys. Plus, I am kind of insecure and suck at talking to girls in general. She decided to take an internship in a different city for the spring semester. A few days before she left, she initiated some physical interactions and told me that she has had a crush on me for a while. We maintained an unofficial long-distance relationship for about a month, and then she told me that we could not continue. I think that her decision was completely justified because she still has feelings for her ex, and it is unfair for her to keep me tethered if she cannot make commitments. But, I cannot stop thinking about her. I have not had any legitimate, serious relationships because of my shy personality. So, when a girl actually likes me, I attach myself to her and become pretty obsessive. Sometimes I actually feel like I am losing my mind because of how hard it is to get my mind off of her. Does anyone have any advice on how to maintain a friendship with this girl? I feel like she makes me a better person so I would like to keep her in my life. But, I do not know how to do this. I think I am just extremely inexperienced. How can I disconnect from her emotionally in order to maintain this friendship?"

2vye3d,35,2015-02-15,Me [21 F] with my 4 roommates [20-22F] of this year. They're angry that I neglected my chores.,howtobediplomatic101,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2vye3d/me_21_f_with_my_4_roommates_2022f_of_this_year/,"Hi,

First I'd like to say that I know that a lot of this is my fault, and I'm genuinely sorry towards my roommates. But there's a couple things I'd like to get across to them as well.


We have 5 girls living together, and we rotate chores. Normally I get to my chores at a reasonable time and do them all very efficiently. However last week I got assigned to all of the chores. Usually that doesn't happen either, with 1 person assigned to dishes, another to trash, etc. We follow a specific order of names, which we started out staggered just so this wouldn't happen.


But last week it just happened to fall on me all at once. As a result, I literally did not have the time to do them... so I was only able to do half my chores. 


The worst was the trash, which includes recycling, compost, regular trash, and bathroom trash. This involves several trips down the block to the dumpsters. Our neighborhood can be sketchy so we don't take out the trash when it gets too late, which gives me a very limited time-frame I can do this. So I literally did not have time to take out the trash, and garbage bags were all bursting.


This morning I got a group text from my roommates calling me out and saying that they understand that I'm busy but that they're annoyed I didn't do all my chores. I need help crafting a response text back to them. 


They are all home for the 3-day weekend, which is why we're all texting each other. Of course, this is still my fault and I want to acknowledge that as well. But I would like them to understand my situation too.


Basically I want to say that I'm sorry for not doing all my chores this week... And I'd like for them to know that I'm struggling to manage 5 science classes, a job, an internship, volunteering, lab research, and weekly midterm exams. I start my day at 7am and end up coming home at midnight, sometimes past that, and stay up later studying/doing homework.


It's worse because we live apart from campus so I feel like I'm always rushing to catch the bus, which sometimes gets too full and just skips our stop. I'm stressed out, always tired, and running on a few hours of sleep.


Additionally this is the first time that I let things get to this extent, just because of the bad timing of getting stuck with all the chores during one of my busiest weeks this quarter. It's not like this is a reoccurring issue. 


I know that all of my roommates are usually home by 6pm or so and just sit around the house watching Tv shows until bedtime. I guess part of me can't help but feel a little resentful that any one of them could have easily done it too? Instead they just let all the trash overflow and the recycling pile on until it was spilling all over the floor.... I mean, it's okay that all four girls don't want to any of the chores when it's not their established turn. I understand that viewpoint. But if that's the way they want to do things (“it's not my turn, so I won't do it”) then I feel like they just sort of have to deal with the fact that I can only get to it when I can? It's not like I will completely neglect my chores, and the following weeks should be better now that I can start doing my part at reasonable times again.


How do I say all this diplomatically, since it's pretty much 4 vs 1 right now, without offending them? They all get very defensive easily. Keeping that in mind, I don't want to provoke them, seeing as this situation was technically my mistake. I want to admit to my mistakes, but also explain myself in a mature way.

---

**Tl;dr**: Got assigned to all the chores during my busiest week of the quarter. Could only get to half the chores. Roommates mad.

2vyh5g,2,2015-02-15,Internship Dilemma,bkzhotsauc3,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2vyh5g/internship_dilemma/,"Hi guys I'm here struggling with a bit of a problem. I completed an internship with a company over the summer that was located in New Jersey but I live in New York so I had to commute for about an hr each time. The pay was 17/hr. The HR called me last week telling me that my manager is wondering if I will be returning for this summer. I have to let them know by the 23rd. 
I know it is a matter of me either playing it safe vs. risking it but Im still at a loss of what to do. 

Some context: I thought the internship experience was okay. Half the time I didn't do squat but I apparently interned at a time where there wasnt any contracts to work on so I didnt do as much as I had hoped. I am majoring in Computer Engineering and the internship had me working with mostly electrical engineering stuff. I felt a bit out of place since I am not an Electrical Engineer and the stuff focused on radio frequency stuff that I knew 0% about but the engineers were definitely nice and helpful. I was hoping for a more software type role where I could interface with hardware but I am sure now that I am known in that company Im sure I can request a different job position this time. 

What's making me reconsider is the whole ""grass is greener"" type thing because the company I interned for seems to be on the average side based on glassdoor reviews and Im thinking maybe I can get an internship with a more well known company and have a better internship experience.

However when I try to look at computer engineering internships in New York I keep seeing so many computer sciencey stuff with high level programming requirements that I am unfamiliar with. Besides my courses that had me do VHDL, my only real programming experience was with C and a minor introduction to C++ when I did really well in a Data Structures course. 

I know I shouldn't limit myself to New York but I really do want an internship in New York however I would be willing to travel if a company would pay and if their internship program is good. I just never realized up till recently how much NYC loves CS majors. Its crazy and my major gets lumped with CS majors with companies thinking we do the same thing =/.

So Im just juggling so many factors right now. I have an interview with Citi on thursday that I dont really feel prepared for since it is pretty computer sciencey (database stuff I dont feel remotely qualified for) yet I got picked for an interview I suppose so Ive been refreshing on data structure stuff and hope that helps out. Then Im hoping that I hear back from a couple of companies I applied to after meeting them at my college career fair. Like I applied to Ricoh for their internship in Colorado. I seemed to hit it off well with one of the representatives. I should probably apply to more places across the U.S.

Would it be a good idea to just play it safe and go intern at the same company again? I emailed a professor about it and he seemed to favor me just playing it safe. Im guessing he was being biased because he did the same thing and worked for the same company for his whole professional career and ended up fine. But he did bring up a major point how the company I interned for has a wide range of job positions that he seems positive I could get plenty of experience. I definitely am afraid of not getting any internship offers if I risk it but shoot at the same time what if I do play it safe but I get a good internship offer? =/

tl;dr Company I interned for contacted me last week and told me they want me back. I had an okay internship experience there though I could request a position I would be more suited for. Facing ""Grass is greener"" dilemma and don't have any other intern positions lined up for me at the moment but would like to intern somewhere else to experience more things. Must reply back by the 23rd and still unsure what to do. Im kind of losing my mind weighing the pros and cons and the what-if's. I guess Im being a bit greedy?"

2vyv64,41,2015-02-15,"How can I make the absolute maximum amount of income over this next summer? [serious, read the details]",YupHio,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2vyv64/how_can_i_make_the_absolute_maximum_amount_of/,"I want to work 100 hours a week for my 12 week summer, where should I look?

I'm a mechanical engineering student and I have been unable to get an engineering internship for this summer. This last summer I worked on the unload crew for the freight truck at Lowe's at night as well as doing landscaping during the day. With that being said, I have no problem using a post hole digger for 6 hours a day, or carrying heavy boxes for hours on end, everyday, all summer.

So I have the question: Regardless of the pay per hour, or how many hours a week I must work, or how hard the work is, or where I must travel for the work, I ask: how can I make the maximum amount of money over summer? I feel as though I have an advantage being a college student, not tied down, I can live out of my truck anywhere in the country for the summer. Is there some job where I can put in 100 hours a week all summer? Is there some job that pays really high that nobody else is willing to do?

One of my room mates was making ~$28 per hour over the summer, he got an entry level job driving the roller over new asphalt in Montana. He got overtime every week, lots of overtime, that's ~$42/hour for just sitting in a little rolling machine and driving in a straight line for hours. He was making so much money that he decided to take fall semester off and just keep working for a while. Now he's back and doesn't have much to show for it because he spent most of his money while making it, my plan is to save up and graduate college with no debt. Are there jobs out there similar to this?

If it's pertinent, I'm a tall 19 year old white male currently living in North Idaho, I have good work references. I'm the tall skinny guy that keeps working and working, and I plan to work as much as possible this summer, just looking for ideas and opportunities early on.  I have 3 months now to set up a job for summer.

I'm willing to live a ridiculous lifestyle for 3 months, I've got nothing better to do. Really. Now give me ideas.

EDIT:

0) I currently work as a cook at Denny's while I'm in school. I get a free meal every shift and get to take home free food on night shifts. However, at home I eat chicken and rice, frozen vegetables, bread, milk, eggs. I keep my food expenses incredibly low, I got a big bag of rice at Costco, that's about $1 per 1000 calories. I can keep my cost of living down and live like a monk for 3 months, living expenses are irrelevant. I want crazy ideas. Also, I can arrange free housing with relatives in North Idaho over summer if I don't need to travel for work, which would help.

1) I understand an engineering internship is important, however since I still have 3 years before completing my degree, and my GPA is just below 3.0, it is unlikely that I will land a mechanical engineering internship this summer. It is currently more important for me to get as much work as I can. There is plenty of time for internships later.

2) I see many of you are suggesting labor jobs, like I could go to North Dakota, or process fish in Alaska all summer. But I would also like some ideas such as this: Theoretically, if I can sit at a desk and answer phone calls or enter data or something all day for $10 an hour, and I can work 100 hours per week, factoring in overtime that's $15,000 over the summer. It may be more practical to get two of these types of jobs, and work 40 hours at each. See where I'm going with this? I think this may be a valid way to make the maximum amount of income over summer. $15,000 for 12 weeks this summer, before taxes, is a good goal as that's what some internships pay. What are your thoughts?"
2vz1iz,2,2015-02-15,I still miss my ex as much as I tell myself I don't and it sucks,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/2vz1iz/i_still_miss_my_ex_as_much_as_i_tell_myself_i/,"We had a bad breakup over half a year ago, I messed things up, hurt her and wouldn't give her space. She forced me out of her life blocking all forms of communication, she even stopped talking to any of our mutual friends. 

I was devastated, hurt and depressed for a while. But eventually picked myself up like I always did. I tried my best to move on and concentrate on bettering myself. I payed off a 350k apartment at the age of 24, had a great semester in college, started doing more contract programming jobs, found a new job and even found an awesome internship for the summer in my field. Things were looking up and I thought I had finally moved on and was back to my happy self again. During winter break last year I even packed up all the gifts she had given me and sent them back to her.

But out of nowhere a few days before Valentines I had a dream where I ran into my ex in the halls of my old highschool. That dream made me realize how much I really missed her. I miss her dorky laugh, her cute smile, how anxious she got at times, her creative insight on things, her introverted behavior sometimes and just over all her as a person. I loved everything about her and wouldn't change a single thing. 

I spent the following night drinking and hanging out with my friends. I kept drinking to try and get her off my mind and woke up the next morning with an awful hang over. It was valentines day and I was depressed as fuck, I ended up getting into a stupid argument with one of my best friends and I'm pretty sure he's still mad at me. 

I thought I was over her but clearly I'm not and it's the worst feeling in the world to know that you still love someone but can't be with them because they probably hate your gutts.


I've made enough money to buy real estate at the age of 24, have an awesome career ahead of me as a software developer or game developer and I have plenty of close friends and family. I should be happy..... but I'm really not.

I've been through 3 long term relationships before this one, but this is the first one that left me with so much relapsed depression and awful feelings.  I hate Valentine's Day it makes me feel awful that there's a day dedicated to celebrating the one that you love and I can't do that.

Anyways thanks for reading guys, I know I'm being a little bitch. But I felt like I had to write about this. "
2vz93h,2,2015-02-15,I'm not sure what's wrong with me.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2vz93h/im_not_sure_whats_wrong_with_me/,"Hey,

So I'm not really sure what is going on with me, or better yet what has been going on with me for the last couple years. I know that I should talk to someone, that's always the first thing your told but its a very scary thing to do. So I've decided to look to the faceless masses of the internet for help first. I'd really appreciate any advice, or thoughts of what you guys think. I don't really know what the point of this post is, I really just want to talk to someone about it.

So here's a little summary of my situation. I'm a 22 year old guy, close graduating from university, have always done great in school, am currently doing a great internship that I really like and am doing pretty well financially for my age. So a lot of the issues I usually see people my age getting stressed out about or worrying about are pretty much non issues for me.

There are however issues in my life. I don't feel happy. Don't get me wrong there are days when I am ""happy"", but there are weeks where I just feel terrible. I don't think I've ever been a happy person, I was always sort of sad as a kid. I always put this pressure on myself, I always tell myself that I'm not good enough, that I should have done better. It's not parental pressure, my parents didn't pay too much attention to me. This is pressure that I put on myself, judgements that I passed on myself always telling myself that I'm not good enough that I've failed in ways X, Y and Z. That leads in to another thing. I have a few great friends but I've never really dated. I feel like this ""loser"" complex that I have is getting in the way of me living my life.

Finally and probably most worrying to me at this point is that I've been having these crazy mood swings. I would describe them as breakdowns. I've had them before but in the past few months they've been happening for frequently. For example on my birth day a few months ago, I ignored everyone walked around the city at night and just cried in park. About a month later I broke down when I was taking a shower and just lied in the shower crying. Finally when I was walking into my office building about a week ago I had another episode, and I had to sit in the stairwell for 30minutes crying.

I've tried working on these issues for years to become a happier person. I started going to the gym, joined a social group, and significantly cut down the amount of time I spend on the computer, but nothings really helped.

So that's it for the most part. I don't know does it sound like depression? Am I bipolar, I really have no clue. I've been getting closer to seeing my doctor about it, but it's still terrifying to me for some reason. I just feel like I'll be judged. If anyone can relate to my situation, or has some useful advice I'd be nice to know that I'm not alone."

So, I guess I'll list my experience here and post my resume to see if anyone can offer some advice

Exams:  I took P, FM, and MFE in October and November of 2014.  I passed all three (with good scores, but I'm under the impression that scores don't matter outside of pass/fail).  

Education:  Have a bachelors in Engineering (electrical) from Cooper Union with a 3.7 GPA.  I graduated in 2009.  

Work experience:  I do database contracting work for a local municipality's industrial development agency. Have a strong knowledge of SQL, but I feel like not having anything anywhere remotely related to the field is the biggest weakness.

I also only have one internship during school (since I traveled/played poker during the summers)

Skills:  
Programming languages:  Have a very good knowledge of SQL (as mentioned above), R, MATLAB, and Python.  Passable level of C and CUDA (and a certificate from the CUDA course offered on Coursera if that's relevant). (is not having SAS experience here hurting me?)

Other computer skills:  Excellent knowledge of Excel (but nothing outside of very basic VBA)

Techniques:  A good grasp of predictive modeling in both R and Python (two grad level machine learning courses as well as completing all but the capstone in the Coursera Data Science Certificate with the capstone to be completed in March) 

I'm just wondering what I should do here and how to improve my chances of finding something. (honesty is fine, if this isn't a career path that suits my experiences I'd appreciate finding out now)

As for knowledge I feel like I know nothing even after I passed every class I've taken so far.  And as my programming skills I've done projects in Java, C, C# and C++.

[LAB B] (https://www.lab-b.ca) is home to a community of creative entrepreneurs and freelancers. We are Brampton’s first [coworking space] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking), and membership means an alternative to working at home or in a coffee shop, a chance to share ideas and build networks, a chance to collaborate on new opportunities and keep professional skills sharp.

Naturally over time we have become family, and the space has become our home.

##Why does Brampton need a coworking space?
Brampton is home to a large group of people who are educated, creative, and entrepreneurial; however, this market is under served. Because Brampton in many ways lacks the infrastructure to launch projects and businesses, a lot of these people eventually move to Toronto or further afield. This continues the cycle of talent loss and brain drain that plagues Brampton.

When we have a space and community support, we are able to work consistently on the things that matter to us.

2vznkn,2,2015-02-15,Interview questions to ask when interviewing a CS student,JayGeeee,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/2vznkn/interview_questions_to_ask_when_interviewing_a_cs/,"I'm interviewing a few students who are currently undertaking computer science degrees and was just trying to come up with a few technical questions to ask. They have all completed just over one year of university and are applying for an internship. I studied Elec Eng so I'm not that familiar with what is taught at each stage in a CS degree.

This is roughly what I had in mind:
A few questions on computer architecture. E.g. Difference between Von Newmann and Harvard Architecture. What's an ALU and program counter?
Maybe a few questions on assembly since they all seem to have studied it. 

A few questions on data structures. What's the difference between a stack, queue, and heap? Where might you use each of those? Get them to implement one in pseudo code. See if they do it as a linked list or array, and ask a few questions about their implementation. 

A few questions on sorting algorithms. Can they name a few. See what they know about their relative speeds. Get them to implement one of them in pseudo code. 

A few questions on OOP.
What is it? What are the advantages? Can they list a few object orientated languages. What is a class, an object, inheritance etc.

Does that sound about the right sort of level of questions? Too hard/easy? Any extra questions that might be suitable?"

2. what are the chances that he got scared, scared of the commitment of long distance..scared that he would have to be more serious
3. is there a possibility of him coming back to me? if so how do i help this?

when we were together nothing was wrong! i swear, he told me i helped with his anxiety and depression and that if it wasn't for me he wouldn't be here.. he doesn't have much going on in his life, but i do and i never pushed him to be different because i accepted him for who he was...

2vzt8e,0,2015-02-15,Garfield's Suicide,Nicktheman22,parody,https://www.reddit.com/r/parody/comments/2vzt8e/garfields_suicide/,"Now, before you read this, I want to let you know it's a parody of Squidward's Suicide, just with Garfield added in. Enjoy!
______________________________________________________
I just want to start off by saying if you want an answer at the end, prepare to be disappointed. There just isn't one.

I was an intern at Cartoon Network for a year in 2011 for my degree in animation. It wasn't paid of course, most internships aren't, but it did have some perks beyond education. To adults it might not seem like a big one, but most kids at the time would go crazy over it.

Now, since I worked directly with the editors and animators, I got to view the new episodes days before they aired. I'll get right to it without giving too many unnecessary details. They had very recently made the Garfield movie and the entire staff was somewhat sapped of creativity so it took them longer to start up the season. But the delay lasted longer for more upsetting reasons. There was a problem with the series 1 premiere of The Garfield Show that set everyone and everything back for several months.

Me and two other interns were in the editing room along with the lead animators and sound editors for the final cut. We received the copy that was supposed to be ""Garfield's Lasagne Fest"" and gathered around the screen to watch. Now, given that it isn't final yet animators often put up a mock title card, sort of an inside joke for us, with phony, often times lewd titles, such as ""How Dogs Are Freaking Useless as Pets!"" instead of ""Garfield Babysits Odie"" when Garfield is forced by John to babysit Odie. Nothing particularly funny but work related chuckles. So when we saw the title card ""Garfield's Suicide"" we didn't think it more than a morbid joke.

One of the interns did a small throat laugh at it. The happy-go-lucky music plays as is normal. The story began with Garfield practicing making his five-starred Lasagne, making it sour as usual. We see Odie knocking down the table with Garfield's Lasagne on it and Garfield snaps, yelling at him to keep it down as he has a contest that night and needs to practice. Odie kept knocking down Garfield's Lasagnes, which makes Garfield kick Odie. It pans to Odie, who was bleeding pretty badly from being kicked five times. John comes downstairs and yells at Garfield to stop, which makes Garfield stop kicking Odie.

The transition screen comes up and we see the ending of Lasagne Fest. This is when things began to seem off. It shows Garfield showing off his prized-Lasagne, a couple of gangster cats come over and call Garfield's Lasagne, sour. Which makes every cat at Lasagne Fest laugh at him.

The shot goes to the crowd of cats and dogs, with Odie in center frame, and he too is laughing, very much unlike him. That isn't the oddest thing, though. What is odd is everyone had hyper realistic eyes. Very detailed. Clearly not shots of real people's eyes, but something a bit more real than CGI. The pupils were red. Some of us looked at each other, obviously confused, but since we weren't the writers, we didn't question its appeal to children yet.

Garfield shouts at Odie and the others to stop laughing. But they don't stop, which makes Garfield cry and run away into an alley. Garfield sits down on a cardboard box and just sits there. He just sat there, blinking, in this silence for about 30 seconds, then he started to sob softly. He put his hands (paws) over his eyes and cried quietly for a full minute more, all the while a sound in the background very slowly growing from nothing to barely audible. It sounded like a slight breeze through a forest.

The screen slowly begins to zoom in on his face. By slow I mean it's only noticeable if you look at shots 10 seconds apart side by side. His sobbing gets louder, more full of hurt and anger. The screen then twitches a bit, as if it twists in on itself, for a split second then back to normal. The wind-through-the-trees sound gets slowly louder and more severe, as if a storm is brewing somewhere. The eerie part is this sound, and Garfield's sobbing, sounded real, as if the sound wasn't coming from the speakers but as if the speakers were holes the sound was coming through from the other side. As good as sound as the studio likes to have, they don't purchase the equipment to be that good to produce sound of that quality. 

John is at home with Odie. They seem to be looking for Garfield, but they give up and ask some of the cats at Lasagne Fest. They tell John, the last they saw was him running into a alley.

The screen transitioned back to Garfield, still sobbing, louder than before, and half body in frame. There was now what appeard to be blood running down his face from his eyes. The blood was also done in a hyper realistic style, looking as if you touched it you'd get blood on your fingers. The wind sounded now as if it were that of a gale blowing through the forest; there were even snapping sounds of branches. The laughing, a deep baritone, lasting at longer intervals and coming more frequently. After about 20 seconds, the screen again twisted and showed a single frame photo.

I was too terrified to go back to it, since it could have been something horrible. The lead sound editor told us to stop, he had to call in the creator to see this. Mr. Davis arrived within about 15 minutes. He was confused as to why he was called down there, so the editor just continued the episode. Once the few frames were shown, all screaming, all sound again stopped. Garfield was just staring at the viewer, full frame of the face, for about 3 seconds. The shot quickly panned out and that deep voice said ""DO IT"" and we see in Garfield's hands a shotgun. He immediately puts the gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger. Realistic blood and brain matter splatters the wall behind him, and his bed, and he flies back with the force. The last 5 seconds of this episode show his body on the bed, on his side, one eye dangling on what's left of his head above the floor, staring blankly at it. 

It cuts back to John and Odie, who were still looking for the poor cat. They entered the same alley Garfield was in. They find something horrifying, it was Garfield. His eyes were ripped out and glued one of the gangster cat's eyes, his skin had been also glued onto the gangster cat. He looked like he was wearing a Garfield costume, he was pointing Garfield's gun at the two. A loud bang was heard as the screen went black.

I will (probably) never forgot this. I just wanted to share this with the public before I kill myself, goodbye.

I'm a long time lurker of this subreddit, but I finally need financial planning advice. I'm a current freshman in college in NYC. My on-campus housing options for next year are far too expensive for me to consider living on-campus (between the required meal plan and housing). I also need to help put money towards my tuition payment for next year. 

I need help now to start planning for renting an apartment for next semester. I will be living with roommates, but still coming up with hundred of dollars a month for rent is kind of expensive. 

I'm currently working three different gigs (babysitter, dog walker, office intern) and without weekly expenses I'm putting away about $120 to $165 dollars a week. I currently have a savings account with Chase, but every time I step out of line with my budget/don't make enough a week I'm tempted to draw money out from my savings. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to budget a bit more as a college students and how to optimize putting more money in my savings account. Any general personal tips and tricks to saving more money in such an expensive city would be much appreciated!

Thanks so much! "

Here's a little background story: My SO and I have been dating for around 7 years and have had our ups and downs but we are way better now and couldn't be happier. We are both currently in university, me doing engineering and her doing physical therapy (PT). We both should finish our bachelors hopefully by Spring 17'. If all goes well, I am planning to propose on our graduation night. Last night for valentines we went out to eat and this is where i need you guy's help..

I will most likely have a job right away after college due to internships and experience, and being that the town I live in is very predominant in the petrochemical and refinery side, I shouldn't have much a problem finding a job. The problem is that when my SO finishes, she will have to go to a PT school, most likely UTMB, which is 2 hours away from where we live! So at dinner last night we started talking about our future, and that's when she asked me this question.. She asked if whenever she had to move for school would I move with her since most likely we will be married by then. I simply said that if I have a job here already I would have to stay because driving back and forth everyday would be pain in the ass. This caused a small argument between us at dinner but I told her we will talk about this later.

We then continued to talk about it in the car and she said I can try to find a job closer to where she would have to stay. When i said it's not that easy to find a job she just got quiet and we were in silence. After a while i changed the subject and we finished the night without anymore arguing. 

My question is, whenever that dreaded day comes when she has to leave, if i have a job already should i leave it? Or start applying for other jobs near where she will move to? If we are married, I don't want to be living away from her. I really love her and want to spend the rest of my life with her but I don't really know what to do. "

I am majoring in Computer Engineering and I was looking for a software type role but I couldnt say no to the only offer I got. Last week the HR contacted me and told me that my manager was wondering if I want to come back for the summer. They're giving me up to the 23rd to give a response. 

The internship experience was okay. Like I saw stuff I have never seen before and the people there were definitely nice and some were funny. And I also learned new stuff and developed more communication skills and self-reliance skills and proved that I could learn stuff quickly and produce results. I was working at a rate of 17/hr but going through tolls and paying for gas sucked since the trip was about 45 mins to an hr drive each time. I have no other internship offers at the moment but I got an interview with Citi for a software spot and Im hoping to hear back from some other companies that I applied to after attending my college career fair last week. 

People have reccomended to me that I just take the internship offer because I have no other opportunities at the moment and it would suck to refuse the opportunity and get no opportunities else where. It's just that Im thinking that maybe I could get an internship with a more reputable company and also be exposed to more companies instead of feeling chained to one. I am leaning towards just taking the internship offer and requesting a software role then cry if I get any other job offers haha.

Has anyone else been in this position??? I just need more opinions on the matter =/"
2w09ht,61,2015-02-15,NMom committed fraud in my name and now won't pay for my food or gas until I fix her mistake.,madamfray,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2w09ht/nmom_committed_fraud_in_my_name_and_now_wont_pay/,"My NParents are currently paying for my grad school on the premise that I pay them back. NMom basically pushed me to go for grad school, despite me saying that I didn't want to end up in debt and I actually wanted to work. Then she threw that promise into the ring. I figured, so long as I applied and got into a school far away, I'd be fine.

I did. I ended up at a great school across the country from them. I never see them and they never call me except for rare events. I pretty much get to live my life stress free without their controlling ways. Around the same time I applied for grad school, my GCBro decided he wanted to go to med school (promptly failed to get into any schools) and then decided to get his masters while he kept applying to more and more med schools.

My parents promptly agreed to pay for his schooling. He even got to live in their high rise, 4-bedroom condo with all the amenities of expensive furniture, food, etc. Meanwhile, I'm scraping by. I have a shitty apartment at basement level, pay utilities, etc., and by the time I'm done just paying my bills, I have about $200-300 a month for food and gas. Please note, that I drive about fifteen miles to school every day. 

Anyways, my NMom has a thing about retirement. She strongarmed me to set up a retirement fund and threw about 2k into it. Nice right? Yeah...

So arbitrarily, my NMom decides to move that money into a different investment account. She creates an account in my name, uses my SSN (which how does she even have that anymore? I took it when I moved), and promptly moved all that money into an investment account without telling me.

Cue the panicked phone call. Apparently, she messed up when she was filling out forms and couldn't move the money. I'm listening to her rant before I go ""Wait, what the hell are you talking about?"" She explains that she made an account and tells me that I need to call the [unspecified investment group] and get the money moved over.

I call them, because at this point I just want her to stop yelling in my ear (and I have better things to do than to listen to her like study), and I realize while I'm on the phone with them that I don't know what ""my"" username and password is. I explain the situation to the guy, he asks me some security questions (which thankfully I can answer), and I get into the account. Of course, this is no simple mistake my mother has made. It's taken me four weeks and so far, I'm still no fucking closer to getting the money into the right investment.

So she is blowing up my phone while I'm asleep going on about how the investment is even more fucked up than before. I call her   on Friday at noon. Again at 1. Again at 2. Nothing. Finally I call her at 4 and she FINALLY picks up. No explanation for why she didn't answer before.

""You need to call them and figure out what's going on!"" she yells at me. Of course, I have no idea what she's talking about, nor does she explain it to me in any sort of detail. Plus, it's now 4 o'clock on the Friday before President's day. They aren't open until Tuesday.

During this time, mind you, I'm in the middle of writing two term papers. One is due next fucking week. I'm also applying to co-ops and internships, as well as just plain IT jobs. I'm a little exhausted. So, being pissy, I make the mistake of saying ""Yeah, there's a lot of shit I need to do.""

""WELL YOU CAN JUST FORGET ABOUT ANYMORE MONEY COMING YOUR WAY UNTIL YOU FIX IT!"" [Hangs up]

I can't do anything. She pays for my tuition and living expenses, so I can't exactly report her for fraud. She tricked me into this hellhole and now there's nothing I can really do. Financial aid won't cover me being part time, so my only hope is that one of the co-ops I've applied to will be able to cover some of my living expenses, that I can fix the mess she made, and that maybe, just maybe, I can graduate on time.

Swear to God though, I'm never fucking talking to her again after I graduate."

How's everyone doing today?  So this is a throw away because I feel really bad about talking about this in my main account.  So I am in my 2nd year of PhD program in electrical engineering and I feel really really burnt out, and want to quit soo badly :(.  So I have been in school non stop since 2004, and have received a BS and an MS in electrical engineering.  Then I started PhD, this is a whole different ball game :(.  So first off I don't like having to pick one subfield, of a subfield of a subfield to become an expert in.  I did my MS in analog design and loved it.  I really loved my advisor, and everyone in my lab, and my thesis topic I had for my MS degree.  For PhD I changed universities and started in analog design.  I hated my advisor, and hated the topic I was doing, so I changed advisors to a digital IC professor because I found his work interesting.  Now that I am working with him I feel like he is pushing me towards computer science topics that I have no background for.  I have been working with my current adivsor for almost a year now, and have zero publications with him, and am starting to worry.  He wants me to publish by April, but I don't even have a research topic yet!  The circuit design work that I am doing with him isn't going anywhere.  All of my research ideas either do not work, or have already been published.  I am really starting to freak out.  I feel that I am not in the right little subfield, and I do not know what subfield to pick.  I like analog design because I find it very intuitive, but it's applications are boring.  I find digital design to be quite a lot more interesting, but I do not like coding.  The other thing that freaks me out is how LONG a PhD is.  I have talked to other PhD students that have been in the PhD program for 7 YEARS!!  7 YEARS!!!  I do not think I want to spend the next 5 years of my life stressed about publications, and finding the right little subfield.  Honestly I have less and less to talk to my friends about, and it really makes me depressed.  Everyone in my lab is anti-social and doesn't ever want to hang out outside of school.  So I feel like I am loosing the friends that I do have, and it really worries me.  I'm afraid I am going to end up alone in my mid 30s when I finally do graduate with my PhD, and that really scares me.  But, at the same time I feel like I do have something special and I don't wanna let go of it.  I worked hard to get into my PhD program.  I am already done with classes, and classes were hard.  The only thing I have left to graduate is just a thesis, but that is going to take the next 5 years or so :(.  I have never been as depressed as I am in my PhD.  So, the way I see it I have 3 choices: 1. stick with same advisor, learn ALOT about computer science, and graduate under him, 2. change advisors AGAIN and hope I find the small subfield I enjoy.  3. give up and get a job, hope its in the right subfield, and hope it's one I enjoy. Anyways this is more of a rant than anything.  Thank you for listening.

Edit:  Thank you guys for all of the support you guys have given :):):).  You guys will never know how much you have helped me :):).  Hugs for everyone.  I think my plans for the future will be find an internship this summer to break the day to day grind of a PhD.  I just first have to get the internship :(.  I will keep you guys updated about what I do."
2w0nks,61,2015-02-15,"Is it worth taking a $15/hr offer to ""get your foot in the door"" if you lack a degree?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2w0nks/is_it_worth_taking_a_15hr_offer_to_get_your_foot/,"I picked up coding last summer and went to a web dev bootcamp. After graduating among the top of my class, I landed a 3-month paid internship at a small, high-profile agency, where I sharpened my skills with Angular and Node and received mentoring from some very talented Sr. devs. The internship term ended and I've been on the job hunt for the last two months. 

I now have my first offer and it's from a Vancouver agency that mostly works with non-profits. None of the staff have CS degrees, including the Sr. dev who's in this 50s. They asked me to think about what kind of wage I would want and get back to them.

I talked to some other devs in the city as well as the career advisor at the bootcamp I attended in order to come up with an appropriate starting wage. We landed on $18/hr for an intro period of maybe 8 weeks, then up to 45k once I'm salaried. 

Their counter-offer is **$15/hr for three months**, after which they would assess my progress and decide whether to bring me onto the team or not. This is $100/week less than internship offers I had fresh out of bootcamp. They point to my lack of experience and degree, as well as their non-profit work, as justification. They have dodged my questions about what my salary would be like if I was brought on. 

I see the potential for growth with this agency, but I can't help but view their offer as an attempt to exploit my desperation. 

I'm looking for advice on the situation and maybe some negotiation strategies if this company sounds worth pursuing. "

But alas, the depressing thoughts still come up here and there about it, so I'll just get to the point: I'm fucking lonely. I've been pretty active on dating sites/apps like OKC and Tinder with low luck and last time I posted here a couple months back it was kind of the same. But my choices are to either keep trying or accept being lonely, so since I'm posting here it's pretty clear what I choose. All I want is to meet new people (particularly female since... y'know, I said M4F), make new friends and hopefully find something bigger and closer, I really miss that kind of connection.

Now then, I honestly kind of hate talking big and trying to sell myself as if I was an ad like it seems a lot of posts here tend to do (plus I don't think I'm very good at it anyways), but of course we couldn't get anywhere if I said nothing, so I'll try to talk about myself as down to earth as I can. Just keep in mind that I'm just as human (but a pretty good one I'd wager) as you are, and we should be okay.

Anyways, I'm 6'1"" with somewhat long light brown hair and greenish eyes (though at times they randomly decide to be more blue or hazel). My body type is slightly below average, but I've been working on becoming slimmer. I know, not the most flattering info about myself and if you're looking for studlier guys, I'm afraid you'll have to look elsewhere, but hopefully the honesty accounts for something and I find someone hero who is accepting of my looks. A couple of pictures for your reference: http://imgur.com/kNACXst, http://imgur.com/J8gfcas

I'd describe my personality as laid back; I get along pretty easily and I try to be loyal and dependable. I'm more introverted but I wish I wasn't so maybe it'd work out for both parties if you tried to bring me out of my shell a little. I like intelligent conversation, but it's always good to talk about more fun and casual topics too.

I'm currently working as a software IT intern for at least the next year, and at some point I'll try to finish my Bachelors degree. I like computers so I figure I can't go wrong with a career in that, the money I'm already making is fairly nice. As for my interests, I guess you could say I'm your typical nerd archetype. I like reading, movies, video games, Reddit (big surprise!), and I have a soft spot for anime and Japanese/Korean culture (the convention I mentioned earlier was focused around that). I guess if that somehow gives off red flags or stereotypes, I'm uh... sorry for having my own hobbies? If my interests aren't your cup of tea, it's cool; I won't drone on about it.

I know, this probably doesn't qualify for Top 10 R4R posts of all time, but if you read all of this, thanks and [here's some compensation](http://imgur.com/gallery/bmx4ziI). And if it's interesting enough for you to wanna pop me a message, I'm more than willing to reply and have a conversation."
2w0td9,20,2015-02-15,"To all WSU grads, did you stay in Detroit afterwards?",GloryToColumbus,Detroit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/2w0td9/to_all_wsu_grads_did_you_stay_in_detroit/,"So, I'm graduating next fall, and I could *not* be more damn excited. I love Wayne State, but also hate so many little things about it - the typical WSU experience. Anyways, I'm truly contemplating whether or not I should stay after graduation. I'll be graduating with my degree in marketing, and I've had several internships, ergo, making most of my connections in Metro Detroit. 

I'm eager to try out somewhere else, though. So my questions to all fellow Wayne State grads is did you stay in Metro Detroit? If not, where did you go, and why? "
2w0vk0,3,2015-02-15,Triangle Opportunity,Aquareon,DarkTales,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/2w0vk0/triangle_opportunity/,"When Samantha called me for the first time in eight years, it was surprising for two reasons. The first is that roughly 90% of the calls I receive these days are from debt collectors after me to pay down my student loans. The other being that we parted on pretty ugly terms, most of that was my fault and I honestly never expected to hear from her again. 

I scolded myself afterwards for being so eager. Fell out of bed, tangled up in the sheets trying to get my hands on the phone, then tapped the green icon and breathlessly answered. It’s been eight years, I shouldn’t give a shit. She should be like any other person to me. 

*“Jack? You sound so different. But then, it’s been a while hasn’t it. I’ve been wondering what’s happening in your life.”* I struggled to sound composed but nonetheless stammered a little bit as I searched for words. *“Y-yeah Sam, it’s...you sound different too. It’s nice to hear from you though. You must’ve Googled me, right?”* She said that she had, and congratulated me on the trip to Africa I’d taken in my first year interning for the local paper. 

*“That must’ve been so fulfilling. If you don’t mind me asking, what are they paying you?”* I assumed she knew it was unpaid if she’d bothered to ask, so I didn’t sugar coat it. *“Wow, that sucks. But that’s the economy, right? Plenty of people are working for free just to get their foot in the door. Then they let you go right before they’d have to hire you and take on new interns.”* Technically the law prevents that, but I was aware of loopholes. 

*“You know, I might be able to help. I’m working for this promising new tech startup, it’s right up your alley. There’s plenty of opportunities for someone like you, maybe we could meet for coffee and I’ll tell you about it?”* Sounded just similar enough to a date that my heart skipped a beat. Reflexively, I blurted out yes. She supplied the day and time, which I dutifully recorded in my calendar app after she’d hung up. 

Long after the call ended, my heart was still racing. I’d gone through hell after the breakup. I think only because I was dumped. Something about rejection makes you cling to that person, even if they were nothing special to begin with. I’d seen a local therapist about it for three years before I felt put together enough to stop. Well, not a real therapist. Psych students in training. That’s why it’s free. 

Clarity began returning to me, and I wondered if I hadn’t made a mistake. Seeing her in person would only rekindle feelings I’d spent most of a decade trying to extinguish. The therapist, insofar as it was right to use that word, urged me to cut off all contact for my own good. That seemed logical at the time. But then, doesn’t absence make the heart grow fonder? They can’t both be true.

It was a long, excruciating road to recovery. By recovery I mean reaching a point where I was borderline functional. I’d built so much of my identity around Samantha that she was a sort of load bearing pillar. With that removed, the rest collapsed in a heap of flaming wreckage. Years one through three were just the panicked wanderings of a lost child. Years four through six were a frankensteinian process of patching together whatever pieces I could salvage and trying to rebuild something resembling who I’d been before. 

Not a lot of meat to it. Mostly skeletal scaffolding, duct tape and staples. The smallest impact would bring it tumbling down, but for the time being it worked well enough that I was finally holding down a job again. If you call unpaid labor a job. With most of my friends flipping burgers or waiting tables, doing something related to journalism elevated me considerably in their view. All smoke and mirrors though. At the end of the day, they’ve got an income. I’ve got an IOU. 

From that perspective, Sam’s mystery job offer sounded tantalizing. I couldn’t bring myself to care what exactly it was about so long as I’d be working with her. That meant frequent time together, which in turn meant a chance to patch things up. My mind telling me *“that’s childish fantasy you should throw in the fire before it hurts you”* while my heart says *“don’t be afraid to bet it all on a long shot, if the prize is everything you’ve ever wanted.”* 

I listened to my heart. I want to say it’s a poor understanding of probability and defective pattern recognition. Probably why I buy lottery tickets, come to think of it. I’ve been with a string of girls since the breakup and one after the other I drove them away. Self-sabotage, my therapist told me. My own experience of it was something like the emotional equivalent of when your body rejects a donor organ. My anti-rejection drug is alcohol. Works great, problem is that I eventually sober up. 

That’s not a healthy way to live, but it’s a lot healthier than the alternative. Which, for several years, was a long drop off a nearby bridge. Popular spot for jumpers as there’s a road below to smash your head on and a picturesque view for reflecting on your life before you do it. The city put up fences as a deterrent but people just climb ‘em. So they put in some free phones which connect you directly to the suicide hotline. 

Never bothered using it. I knew the spiel. *“Suicide is the ultimate act of selfishness”*, because your own suffering ends but you cause everyone who knows you to suffer afterward. There’s two sides to it, though. I could understand if someone were suicidal over some transient problem. They might have a point then. But if not, then isn’t it selfish to demand that somebody prolong their suffering by multiple decades because you’re scared of death? 

I drove past the bridge on my way to the coffee shop and recalled the time I’d spent all night there, deliberating over whether to jump. Some rando intuited what I was there for and took it upon himself to talk me out of it. He said his piece, I said mine, then we watched the sun rise together. I didn’t wind up doing it. He got to leave feeling good about himself. But my life remained unchanged. What did he save me from, except relief? 

The coffee shop was a national chain that people whose identity centers around contrarianism like to snub their noses at. Certainly the coffee is nothing special but there’s something to be said for being able to reliably get the same product, clean and quickly, anywhere on the planet. Samantha sat in a booth waiting for me. She had on a dress I recognized, and a neon yellow and blue windbreaker that I didn’t. Down one sleeve, it said *“E-hance your life!”* Sheepishly, I took a seat opposite her and prepared to break the ice. That’s when I first noticed the necklace. 

*“What’s that around your neck?”* She seemed delighted by the question. *“Sharp eye. This is the product! I could tell you about it, or you could just try it out yourself. I brought one that should fit you.”* She withdrew it from her purse and slid it across the table to me. I objected that I’d not yet so much as ordered a drink. 

*“Oh, of course. I had one before you got here but I could go for another.”* I offered to pay, and had her tell me what she wanted. It turned out to be incredibly specific. I gave up on getting it completely right halfway through the description. You get points towards free food or beverages if you order drinks with their special card here and I’ve always had an addictive personality. It’s why I stay away from gambling and freemium games. Didn’t manage to avoid drinking, but you can’t win ‘em all. 

When I returned with our drinks she had a blue and yellow binder out, splayed open across the table with various perplexing graphs and diagrams. *“I figured you’d have questions about how we operate, what the pay and hours are like and so on”* she explained. It actually hadn’t occurred to me. I was ready to take the job just to work with Sam. But of course I couldn’t say that, so I feigned interest.

*“So Jack, here’s the deal. Todd is my manager, so to speak. I started working for him three weeks ago. Jill, a friend of mine, also works for him. He works for Dennis, who has a lot more people working for him than either Todd or myself. So far! I hope to narrow that gap today.”* She flashed a grin at me. I just sat pensively, staring at the nonsensical pie charts and spreadsheets in front of me. She continued.

*“The great thing about this is that everybody can be a manager. You have someone who you report your sales to, and they take a cut of your earnings, but there are also people who work under you. They report to you and you get a cut of whatever they earn. So the more people you share this opportunity with, the more your profits stack up!”*

She seemed deliriously excited now. I didn’t know how to break it to her. I seriously considered going all-in despite what I suspected, just because it was a chance to spend time with Sam. But that same lingering love also forced me to speak my mind about what she was involved in. *“Sam, this is a pyramid scheme.”* She spit out some coffee and laughed in my face.

*“Todd told me you’d say that! Those exact words, because of your high Krion level. Sometimes I think he’s psychic. I can see why you’d think that, but no, this is a new and dynamic business model called network marketing. You see, it’s all about who you know, like in any other business. Forming connections, like the connection from Todd to myself and Jill, or between you and I.”*

I cringed when she said it. How I wanted such a connection to exist. But I couldn’t leave it alone. *“Does Todd ever pay you any of his earnings?”* She blinked at me, and said no. *“So the flow of money is one way. Always from the recruit, up to the person who recruited them. Then from that person up to whoever recruited them.”* She frowned, flipped through the binder and found a diagram of a web-like structure. *“See? A network”*. 

It certainly was possible to draw it that way. But the structure was the same. *“Sam, let me guess. There are meetings you go to every so often where they give you a pep talk, you buy more of the product from them, and they coach you with counter-arguments for when people like me tell you it’s a scam.”* Her eyes widened, and her voice grew irate. 

*“Do you really think I’m so stupid I’d fall for something like that? Is that what you think of me? Now I remember why I left you. Look, I’m doing you a favor by introducing you to this opportunity”*, she said. *“If you’re too narrow minded to recognize it, then go back to your life as a failure.”* It knocked the wind out of me. I considered storming out. But even if at the end of the day she hated my guts, I felt like it would be a small price to pay if I could spare her the misery and financial ruin she was headed for. 

*“Sam, I’m only saying this because some part of me still cares for you. If you won’t take it from me, search the company name online. Or the name of the CEO. Even if they call it something else, structurally, it’s obviously a pyramid scheme. If you don’t get out of it now you’re going to regret it before long.”* She looked infuriated, but after a few deep breaths, replied: *“Look, just try the product. If it doesn’t blow you away, then I’m wrong, and it’s all a scam.”* She nudged the necklace closer to me. 

I agreed to give it a shot, pocketed the necklace and we parted more or less amicably. I drove home in a fog of confusion and anxiety. Maybe I’d gone in with unrealistic expectations. But this was by far a worse outcome than I could’ve imagined. When I got home, I searched “E-hance”. Every search result was in some way affiliated with the company. I could find nothing negative about it. Even the Wikipedia page was spotless, consisting of what read like one long advertisement for their product. 

When I tried to edit the page, it was immediately reversed and I received a warning from one of the mods. I explained to him how E-hance is structured, that it’s plainly a pyramid scheme. His reply read: *“That’s some of the most astonishing ignorance I’ve ever seen. It’s network marketing, do your homework. E-hance is a dynamic and promising startup that is revitalizing small business in the US.”* I pleaded my case with other mods but got some variant of the same response from all of them. 

So, I turned my attention to the necklace. Really more of a neck brace as it was rigid, with two small hinges at the back so the “arms” could flex enough to get it around your neck. Neon yellow and blue, just like Sam’s jacket. The thickest piece was the back, to which the two hinged arms attach. On either side was a metal plate, and between them a small hole that I could not discern the purpose of. 

So, I looked up the E-hance webpage and clicked the *“how does the E-hancer work?”* tab. It displayed a flashy animated diagram of the necklace as a rotating wireframe, with a sort of legend to explain what various parts did. I hovered my cursor over the metal plates on the back, and a window popped up. *“The E-hancer never needs to be recharged. It runs directly off of your body heat! This also reduces the toxic materials used to make the e-hancer, which is a boon to the environment!”*

I moved my cursor to the little hole, but no window popped up. It wasn’t possible to select. So I scrolled down to read the body of the page.  *“There’s no doubt that it’s a sick, sad world out there. Anyone can see that. But why doesn’t anyone do something about it? That’s the vision which compelled our brilliant founder and CEO, Bruce Hance, to invent the E-hancer whole-body Krion removal device. Krions are nasty energy particles which poison your thoughts with doubts about Bruce Hance, E-hance Ltd and the E-hancer device.”*

An inset jpeg depicted a handsome smiling man with perfect teeth and a touch of grey in his carefully sculpted hair. Beneath it, gold text reading *“Bruce Hance, pioneering founder and CEO of E-hance ltd.”* I continued reading. *“How does it work? Simplicity itself. Just pull the necklace apart as shown and place it around your neck from behind. You will immediately feel rejuvenated, revitalized, and convinced of the tremendous value that the E-hancer has to offer people in your life who suffer from high levels of Krions.”* 

An animated gif showed a featureless figure putting on the necklace in an endless loop. *“Once this occurs, find your nearest E-hance motivational center to buy E-hancers in bulk to share with your family and friends, as well as to receive instruction on how to deal with doubting Thomases whose negative energy threatens to disrupt your upward trajectory to a brighter future. Do not react with anger, remember it’s just their Krions talking.”* 

I stared with a mixture of disgust and alarm. Who could fall for this? How big was this company? I couldn’t find anything about where it was located. Surely they were required to divulge that by law? I reported the website to the Better Business Bureau. A short time later I received a reply scolding me for being too closed minded where alternative business models are concerned and urging me to try their product for myself before judging it. My stomach sank. 

The next logical step, it seemed to me, was to take the damned thing apart. My degree was in engineering, for all the good it’s done me. But at last, it was coming in handy. I dug up a set of fine tools of the sort used to dismantle watches, smartphones and other delicate devices. Whoever designed this thing, they really didn’t want anybody getting into it. The barely visible seam afforded no gap to wedge anything into. 

Only by gently hammering the finest flathead screwdriver against the seam like a chisel did I manage to split it open. Even then, bits of one side broke off and remained connected to the other. I quickly realized this was a lucky break: The tabs where the two sides joined together had sensors attached. Evidently the device could tell if somebody was taking it apart. Did it phone home or something? Could I expect a visit from the cops? 

The tabs remained in place however, snapped off in the process of removing one half of the casing. The circuitry inside laid bare, what struck me was the complexity of the chip inside. I’d expect to see this in a top of the line smartphone, not some gimmicky health necklace, or whatever it was. There was of course a small pouch type LiPo battery underneath, to keep it ticking while not worn. But also a spring loaded needle.

That surprised me. Why was that in there? It was positioned to extend through that hole I couldn’t figure out the purpose of before. A bundle of hair thin wires trailed from the back of the needle to the same PCB that the processor was mounted to. Try as I might, I couldn’t wrap my head around it. But there, next to the CPU, was what I recognized as a small solid state flash memory chip. If there were any answers to be had, I knew that’s where I’d find ‘em.

Gingerly, I cut the pins attaching the chip to the PCB one at a time until it came loose. Then set about the slow, tedious process of soldering new leads from each of the pins to a breadboard I’d use to interface with the little guy. One of my robotics projects involved this sort of work so I already had the software needed to dump the contents of the chip. It was not the instant eureka moment I hoped for. 

This was some seriously sophisticated code. I couldn’t make heads or tails of most of it. The nearest basis for comparison I had was that some of it appeared to be for motor control, navigation and network disruption. Then I found what I quickly determined was a sort of flowchart. The kind used for very simple AIs like Alice. Trigger words would simply return the appropriate reply from a database.

The replies included *“No, it’s network marketing”*, *“Just try the product once and if it doesn’t blow you away then I’m wrong”*, *“E-hance is a dynamic and promising startup that is revitalizing small business in the US”* and so on. I shuddered, having glimpsed a small piece of the puzzle which I desperately hoped wasn’t what I now suspected. Just then, the disassembled necklace began beeping.

Oh shit. Did it have a cellular antennae? Was it alerting somebody that I’d breached the terms of service, or whatever? I hadn’t signed anything but recalled that in some situations simply using a product is implied acceptance of a long list of terms you don’t even have to read. When I hovered over the necklace searching for what tripped it, I realized too late why it was beeping.

A little CCD camera pivoted to look at me. Then two tiny nozzles took aim, each releasing a violent burst of aerosolized chemical. I dodged, but not quite fast enough. One eye was full of the spray and now burned with a pain beyond description. I thrashed about, screaming in agony until I had the presence of mind to locate my eye wash kit. Hands shaking, I performed the steps from memory as tears streamed down my face, and soon the burning subsided. But I could see nothing out of that eye. I hesitated to call an ambulance because of the insane price of the trip, instead calling a friend to drive me to the hospital. He arrived about thirty minutes later. Would that delay make the difference? 

There was somewhat of a crowd waiting to be served but I had health insurance apart from state coverage and my condition was apparently serious enough to merit immediate attention. I hadn’t seen my doctor since I was maybe ten or eleven, that time I wiped out on a dirtbike and needed stitches. Still had the scar on my forehead, the source of no small number of Harry Potter jokes from friends. 

*“Oh, I’ve seen this before”* he muttered once we were alone in the examination room. I felt hopeful. *“It’s reversible, right?”* He looked at me sternly. *“You opened your E-hancer, didn’t you.”* Only now did I notice the familiar blue and yellow brace around his neck, tucked almost invisibly into his coat collar. *“That’s a violation of the terms of service, which clearly state that to protect E-hance ltd’s intellectual copyright, the device contains countermeasures to prevent reverse-engineering.”* 

Fuck. The fucking thing was boobytrapped. Asking to see a different doctor got me nowhere. when the nurse came in, she was wearing one of them too. I was sent home with an eyepatch, a tube of antibiotic eye drops and instructions to procure and wear a replacement E-hancer at my earliest possible convenience. Lying through my teeth, I assured him I would, and met my friend in the lobby. He was flirting with a tall statuesque redheaded nurse who was just about to put an E-hancer on him. 

*“NO!”* I blurted out. Everyone stared at me. I seized him by the arm, and over his protestations, dragged him away from the nurse and into the parking lot. *“What the fuck, dude? She said she’d give me her digits if I tried on some necklace dealie.”* I explained what I knew so far to him on the ride home. He smiled through all of it, and laughed here and there. *“Sounds like a conspiracy theory breh. You need some sleep.”* 

I gave up on it for the time being. Once home, before I hit the hay I sent an email to my boss suggesting cases of eye injury from the E-hancer as a possible story lead. I lay in bed for a while, worrying about my eye before I drifted off. My dreams were bizarre. Always, but especially tonight. I explored my city, or a version of it, where every billboard was blue and yellow. Bearing the E-hance logo, naturally. Every bus ad was for the E-hancer. Everyone wore blue and yellow clothing with the same logo on it. 

I woke up sweaty and disoriented. I’d forgotten to set my alarm, but that weird sixth sense that normally wakes you up a minute or two before it goes off saved my bacon. I checked my inbox and found two emails. One from yesterday night, one from this morning. The first read *“Very interesting Jack! I can always count on you to find stories where nobody else is looking. I’ll have my assistant check this out and get back to you when I’ve decided.”*

The next email took quite a different tone. *“Jack, this is concerning your lead idea from yesterday. I got my hands on an E-hancer to see what the fuss was about, and I really think you’ve got the wrong idea if you think this is a scam. It’s like night and day! Have you tried this? I hope so. I went back and read your last email, it smacks of Krion poisoning to me.”* 

I held my face in my hands. None of this could be happening. Yet when I opened my eyes, reality refused to change. I got up, showered, shaved, took a shit, then applied the eyedrops and put on the patch. Oh boy, I thought, here come the pirate jokes. The other interns had a seriously jockular take on what professionalism means and while most of the time it made work go by faster, my forehead scar made me a target from day one. The eye patch certainly wouldn’t help.

Only, none of them commented on it. No *“Arr matey”*s, nothing about doubloons, pantaloons or anything ending in ‘oons’. Each greeted me with an almost sickeningly chipper expression and went about their work as if we were strangers. That is, until they noticed I wasn’t wearing an E-hancer. Which is also when I noticed that all of them were. *“Krions really sap your productivity you know. If you want on the payroll I’d seriously consider E-hancing your life. I mean, if I were you. Just a suggestion”* one of them said. 

Didn’t recognize him. Lots of turnover at this level. I got more or less the same spiel from the other interns though. Apparently word spread very quickly that I wasn’t wearing my E-hancer and thus didn’t take the job seriously. After an hour or so I was called in to speak with the HR guy. My boss was also there. 

*“Jack, I’ve been hearing some disturbing rumors. Is it true that you’ve been told about the benefits of E-hancing your life with a stylish, high tech E-hancer but refuse to? I have to wonder what motivates a poor decision like that. You must not want to E-hance your productivity. Is that because you’re secretly not dedicated to this company and want to see it fail?”*

I balked. Then, thinking quickly, began to act my ass off. *“My E-hancer was defective. That’s how I got the patch. As soon as I find the time to buy a new one I’ll E-hance my life with it, asap.”* Their expressions turned from vaguely menacing to warm relief. *“I figured it was something like that, my boy. You always were such an efficient worker. Looks like all of this was just a big misunderstanding! Here, let me save you the trouble of buying a replacement, I have one here.”*

I froze. He pulled out a neck brace identical to the one I’d disassembled in my apartment and handed it to me, with an expectant smile. *“Well, go on then. As soon as this little matter is settled we can discuss bringing you on as a part timer.”* I wanted to cry. The easiest thing in the world would’ve been to slip it on, get the job and reconcile with Samantha. Everything I wanted was just one short step away. 

I looked at my watch. Salvation. *“It’s lunch break. I’ll put it on once I’ve had something to eat. Better to E-hance my life on a full stomach, surely?”* They looked quizzically at me, but didn’t press the matter. As soon as I was out the door I headed home. Just above the speed limit, as a cop pulled up behind me and turned on his lights. Fuck, not now. 

I rolled down my window to greet him, license and registration in hand. He asked me what the rush is, and as he leaned in, I noticed the blue and yellow necklace on him. *“I’ve only just heard about the fantastic potential of the E-hancer to revolutionize my life! There’s no time to lose, I have to go buy one!”* His face lit up. *“Well shit, if I’d known that I wouldn’t have stopped you. On your way already! Your E-hanced life awaits!”* 

Couldn’t believe it was that easy. But the cops too? How did this happen so quickly? I drove past some other poor fool that’d been pulled over. He was cuffed, up against the squad car, and as I squinted to get a better look I realized the officer was placing an E-hancer on him from behind. Returned my eyes to the road just in time to avoid rear-ending a semi. 

I burst through the door to my apartment and frantically set about taking the E-hancer apart. This time wearing a welding mask. The aerosol nozzles blasted the mask with sticky blue spray. I took the mask off as I’d no longer need it after that point, and set about neutering the devious little machine. I intuited it needed to think it had already implanted the needle. So I placed one finger on either of the little metal pads. Soon after, the spring loaded needle did indeed jut out of the little hole. 

Looking closer, almost invisibly thin tendrils had emerged from the needle’s tip and were flailing around in the air as if searching for something. I snipped the fibrous bundle connecting the needle to the PCB, gripped the needle itself with a set of pliers and yanked it free. A light began blinking and the familiar beeping started, so I snipped out the battery. Just in case it had a GPS tracker, audio bug, or any other unwelcome surprises. 

With all of that done, I delicately reassembled the E-hancer and re-sealed it with model airplane glue that cured transparent and could be dried in a few seconds by spraying accelerant on it. Once finished it looked good as new. It’d have to. I admit some degree of hesitation to put it on, even after I’d completely disabled it, but there were only fourteen minutes left in my lunch break and they’d begin to suspect something if I didn’t return on time. 

When I showed up at the office with a fake smile on my face and the E-hancer on my neck, everybody’s demeanor was completely different. Where before they’d treated me with stiffness and suspicion, they now congratulated me for “E-hancing my life” and spoke to me with the sort of fondness normally reserved for family members. *“Knew you could do it, m’boy!”* My boss strode up and violently shook my hand. *“Welcome to your new E-hanced life.”* 

I smiled as wide as I could, made direct eye contact and did my best to sound the part. *“Yes sir! E-hance is a dynamic and promising startup that is revitalizing small business in the US, and I’m proud to be a part of that!”* You could practically see the endorphins flooding his brain when he heard that. Like the specific rungs and notches on the end of a key depressing every pin by exactly the right amount to open a lock. 

I was promptly hired on, not part time but full time, and experienced no further trouble from the boss or any of my co-workers. Once they believed you were “E-hanced”, their weird subtle hostility simply vanished and they turned their attention to the next guy without an E-hancer. The story I was assigned was a big one. Especially for someone who’d been an intern until today. Something about a massive cyberattack on multiple east coast cities involving hijacked TV screens and loudspeakers. 

I typed it up best I could. Engineers are not renown for their spelling or grammar. However I received zero criticism when I submitted it for review. Word had gotten around that I’d E-hanced my life. Now it seemed like I could do no wrong in their eyes. My skin crawled. I didn’t understand it fully, not just yet, but the more I saw of this phenomenon more my gut churned. 

As I prepared to drive home, I got a call from Samantha. My heart stirred, even as I tried to disrupt that foolishness. *“Hello?”* Her voice verged on euphoria. *“I heard the good news! That’s so incredible! To think that the E-Hancer has the power to change the heart of even the most Krion-hardened skeptic! We should get together and celebrate.”* I wanted to decline. I told myself I couldn’t, for the sake of keeping up appearances. But really, petty as it is, I hoped I would now have an in with her. Something to bond over, the beginnings of a new connection between us.

Her idea of celebration was to attend a motivational meeting together. Everybody was lined up in rows of folding metal chairs. Some clean cut douchebag in an expensive suit stood at a podium upfront, with crates of E-hancers stacked floor to ceiling on either side and a projector screen just behind him. 

*“It’s so wonderful that you could all make it again. Welcome, my brothers and sisters! I see we have a number of new faces in the crowd today! Congratulations on E-hancing your life! If each of you could stand up and supply a testimonal about how embracing the E-hancer has improved your life, that would be fantastic.”* 

It sounded optional, but wasn’t. One by one people stood and ranted excitedly about how they’d been destitute, lonely and lost before they E-hanced their lives, but were now on an upward spiral of wealth, hope, and personal growth. My turn came up. There was no literal spotlight on me but it damn well felt that way. I nervously stood, thought about how to proceed, then began to gush. 

*“I uh...was a failure before the E-hancer. My girlfriend left me, I was working a thankless job for no pay and Krions were sapping my productivity. But when I...E-hanced my life...everything changed for the better. You might say it revolutionized my life with its dynamic potential, really. Now I’m a full time employee at the local paper, and reconnecting with people I care about who I never thought I’d see again.”* 

Everybody clapped uproariously. When I looked down at Sam, she was smiling, her lower lip trembled and there were tears in her eyes. More and more I wondered if this wasn’t all for the best. I had the job I wanted. I could for the first time in nearly a decade see a realistic way to get back with Sam. Couldn’t I just let it happen? 

The lights dimmed and the projector cast some sort of infographic on the screen. Initially dull sales figures, but then a world map. Red dots indicated locations of motivational centers. The coasts of America were solid red, completely saturated. *“Bad news for the Krions!”* he joked. Everybody laughed identically. 

We watched clips of ads for the E-hancer in Chinese, Korean, Spanish, Italian and French. Everybody clapped after each one even though they were identical except for the language. Then came an animated display of projected international spread over a one year timeframe. Something seized up in my chest as I watched the red dots rapidly engulf the entire map. 

The temptation to go with the flow drained from me. Even if it meant I could have Sam. Even if it meant I could have the job and life I always wanted. I could not abide this. Whatever primal instinct causes us to revile filth, illness and decay flared up in me. 

I stayed for the rest of the meeting so as not to arouse suspicion and gave no outward indicator of distress. Inwardly, I was constructing plans to escape the city. I had my old bugout bag from that prepper phase I went through during the Ebola scare. It did double duty as my spontaneous weekend camping gear. That included everything I’d need for perhaps three days on the road. But what then?

*“Are you alright? You look troubled. Have you forgotten the blessings of your new E-hanced life?”* Samantha clung to my arm, doting on me. It felt inexpressibly fulfilling to receive that kind of attention from her. It’d been so long. But I did not falter. 

Smiling wide, I lamented: *“Just thinking about all the poor Krion-infested fools out there who haven’t yet E-hanced their lives. If they only knew what they’re missing out on.”* Wordlessy, she scooted over and planted one on me. *“I really like the new you”*, she whispered. No. No, I privately told my heart. Not for you. 

Once home, I did some more reading on the website. *“Do not disassemble or otherwise tamper with your E-hancer. Doing so could result in serious injury. Do not remove your E-hancer once it is applied. Doing so will result in epileptic seizures, followed by death. By purchasing the E-hancer you acknowledge these dangers and agree to abide by the terms of use included in the box, and described on this website.”*

Would’ve been nice to know that earlier. I rubbed my eyepatch. I could see only formless, colored shapes. I hoped that meant my eye was recovering. Then I got to wondering if anybody else knew about this. I turned on the TV and flopped down to catch up on the news. After the tail end of a story about the cyber-attacks on East coast cities, there was some fluff piece about a three legged dog who saved a baby. Then something about E-hance! My ears perked up.

*“A number of consumers have come forward to complain about a new health device taking the North American market by storm, the E-hancer. Brainchild of Bruce Hance, the E-hancer is purported to improve health, morality, productivity and general happiness by removing Krions from your body. Watchdog organizations we contacted to get their take assure us Krions are real, a serious threat, and that the E-hancer is a dynamic and promising method for removing them. My viewers will know I’ve busted a lot of scams in the past and I won’t fail to investigate this one. I’ll try on the so called E-hancer and find out for you, the viewer, whether it lives up to the hype.”*

I groaned. As expected, when he returned he had only glowing praise for the device and urged all viewers to buy one as soon as possible, *“With your last few dollars if need be!”* Then, abruptly, the emergency broadcast system cut in. It didn’t take long to guess why. Nor did I stick around to wait for the national guard. From what I’d seen to date, I figured when they finally got here, they’d all be wearing E-hancers and the relief trucks would be loaded with crates of ‘em. 

I considered buying a gun on my way out of town. Initially, remembering that there’d be a waiting period and background check caused me to write off that possibility. But on a hunch, I stopped by the nearest gun shop my GPS could find. Sure enough, the guy at the counter had an E-hancer on. Breathlessly, I informed him that dangerous creeps who refused to E-hance their lives were after me, simply for delivering a testimonial to them about how it changed my life.

*“Muthafuckin’ Krions!”* he shouted, and spat on the floor. *“This here’s what you need, brother.”* He handed over a vicious looking rifle with a massive scope, and a small pistol clipped to the stock. *“The rifle’s for taking ‘em out from a distance. That little guy on the butt shoots rimfire, get ‘em in the leg with that, then when you’re close enough, E-hance that sumbitch.”* He laughed, so I did too. When I asked what it would set me back, he waved it off. *“On the house, since it’s for a good cause.”* 

That worked so well, I used it several more times to score free gear. Dehydrated backpacking food, camping gear, jugs of gasoline, a tent, tarps, even an emergency radio. After a while I worried I was pressing my luck too far. With my car loaded up, I headed for the interstate. Recalling what I’d seen at the meeting, I evaluated my options as to where I could go. I parked for the night off the road after covering the car with tarps and a bunch of tree branches. 

Sleep was fitful. More weird nightmares. When I woke up I had a dozen voice messages on my phone. A few from Sam, about how my boss called her wanting to know where I was. The rest from my boss. The first few sounded worried and compassionate. Each one after that sounded increasingly suspicious and hostile. 

I kept going like that, assuming the worst until I began to pick up government transmissions on the radio. *“If you’re receiving this and haven’t yet purchased or worn an E-hancer, desist from doing so and stand by for an emergency state of the union address.”* I turned up the volume and eagerly listened. 

*“My fellow Americans. Those of you receiving this address who have already partaken of the E-hancer product which has spread across the country like wildfire over the past month, I am not speaking to you. From what intelligence tells me, this is some kind of contagion. The necklaces hijack the central nervous system, and afflict the brain in such a way as to stop short any thoughts critical of E-hance, any efforts to remove it or desire to obstruct its propagation. It rewards with high doses of dopamine and seratonin any thoughts supportive of E-hance, about convincing others to try it, and to facilitate its growth around the world.”*

It lined up with what I’d seen so far, and it was an immense relief to see that an official effort to put a stop to all of this was underway. *“I advise those of you not yet afflicted to seek some out of the way retreat, off the beaten path. Do not speak to anybody wearing the E-hancer. If they approach you and you shoot them, you will not be prosecuted. Be warned that they will try every means of contacting and locating you.”*

I looked at the messages on my phone, now rapidly multipling. Check. 

*“They will make every appeal to your emotions, to practical concerns, to family obligation.”* I searched through the new messages. Some were from my sister and parents. All this time, it never occurred to me. There just wasn’t time to save them. 

*“Any attempt to spread the word through official channels about what the E-hancer really is and how it works will never make it any further than that, as I guarantee you, whoever you contact in the media will already be wearing one. That is in large part how this spread so quickly without anybody realizing what was happening. They act in support of one another to achieve their singular goal, and gang up in mass opposition to any poor soul who realizes what’s occurring and tries to stop it.”*

2w19j0,7,2015-02-15,Trying to make sense of the local community college's associate degrees,featherycrow,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2w19j0/trying_to_make_sense_of_the_local_community/,"I'm sorry if this is something that a lot of people say or it's annoying but I could use help figuring some stuff out. I got a bachelor of arts in music around 8 months ago and I've been unable to find work (the degree doesn't help, being autistic makes it harder). I don't have a background in programming but I am interested in trying to learn computer science stuff. 

I have the option of going to the community college here, but they don't have a ""computer science"" associate program. There are two major options:

(1) Applied Science degrees for web programming, network and security administration, etc that are half classes like accounting, public speaking, economics, etc. These seem kind of sketch.

(2) Associate of Science in Engineering with a Specialization in Computer Science.  This is a lot of mathy stuff like calculus, differential equations, physics, and linear algebra, but also two computer science classes, a 'computer organization' class, and a mathematical structures class. (This is intended as a transfer degree, but transferring is not something I can do in the foreseeable future.)

I was thinking of pairing #2 with a ""database and program developer"" certificate, which would be a software design class, 3 java classes, and a database architecture class. While I was taking these classes I could try to intern and also try to build up a portfolio of my own stuff. Then at the end of the two years I could apply to entry level java / database jobs.

I know I should talk to the community college about their program, but what do you all think? Is this something that has a chance of working out if I take it seriously and spend the time on it?"
2w1cd7,1,2015-02-15,I got my first break from wanting to die in a very long time. A future seems to exist again but I'm overwhelmed by how to go forward and absolutely refuse to go back.,sistermorphinestrash,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2w1cd7/i_got_my_first_break_from_wanting_to_die_in_a/,"I really haven't seriously been thinking about killing myself the last few days.  This sounds trivial but it's probably the biggest breakthrough I've had in what has been a pretty uninterrupted slide over the last 3-4 years.  Now that I'm past the initial shock of feeling happy again, I want desperately not to go back.  I am trying really hard to convince myself suicide isn't an option, which seemed like finishing the first step I couldn't find to escaping this nightmare.


I am in a tough spot with college since this summer is followed my last year.  I haven't applied for internships in the last two months, don't give a fuck about classes or major anymore, and am stuck on a year-long lease on a shithole no one will want to sublet without me taking another multi-thousand dollar loss if I withdraw for the semester as well as lose my research position and front spot on the paper I've spent all year working towards and hopefully getting published.


My two years of daily pot use to self-medicate made a new friend and I started getting into heroin after working for months to get into shape and get it together.  I've just started IVing it and with that am finally past being able to argue I'm not addicted to it.  The high is meh but for me heroin is like finding a method of nonexistence that finally allows me to live in the world I've always felt like I'm third-wheeling in.  Unfortunately the road can't go on forever after losing 30 pounds of muscle I had just worked my ass off to build, being sick everyday, and nearly overdosing on speed since I am pretty much incapable of getting anything more than writing a two sentence email done these days.  I can't make myself eat more than like 1000 calories on a good day and even have trouble of remembering things like my name or age sometimes.


So yeah I'm a fucking mess, but the new bottom is the first I've hit where I really want to take away my shitty coping mechanisms and return to the normal world I've removed all color and feeling from.  It would have been nice a bit earlier, but oh well.  I don't even know why I'm writing this, just want to hear any suggestions for how to proceed since everyone I talk to either gets uncomfortable or annoyed with my drama and I really don't wanna call up the family and tell them that their little Johnny has been shooting dope.


My insurance is not very good since I live out of network in one of the most expensive areas of the US, so I can't really afford to be paying 150 out of pocket for 45 minute therapy sessions that didn't help before.  I have like 3k left for the year with another 10k payment due in a few months and am maxed on loans for the year.  At the same time I actually want help now, and I can't make my few friends my therapists.  They probably want to help, but none of them get it and are reasonably kind of angry at all the self-destructive behavior I made them be around.  So there's the withdrawal option from school, but as I said with the 12 month lease it's a little tricky packing up with 6 months left on it that I have to pay.  I'm looking for something free or low cost resembling professional help, just a place to talk until the lease is up or I can't stand it anymore.  I've been put on a psych hold before so my school counseling services deemed me a liability they can't take on.  In the meantime I'm doing my best to make it 90 days and go to NA meetings so I can possibly regain the clarity I smoked and snorted away over the past few years.


The main thing and the original reason I was going to post before writing a novel is how fucking weird I feel socially after living inside of my head so long.  My social skills have regressed noticeably in the last few years as I cut everybody out of my life and became a recluse.  I finally am shaking the deathwish for more than a brief moment, but I literally can't come up with the courage to start a conversation or at times look a person in the eye which is embarrassing to say the least, and I'm not going to make it another year of this level of loneliness and anxiety.  My experience with trying to get psych meds to treat any of this was basically ""here's some zoloft junky, no drugs for you"" since I have a record, and they wouldn't even change it after several months of no improvement.  Has anyone in a similar spot found a specific prescription combination that made this any easier?  I'm not trying to make reddit my doctor, but I'd like to at least be able to discuss possible routes rather than explaining how I feel and hoping they come up with it on the 13th try four years from now.  Nothing is going to improve until I can get over the anxiety and outsider feelings, but I can't do it on my own right now.



Thanks even for just reading a little bit of my scatterbrained shitpost.  This is one of the many times of day I'd usually be getting high and writing this out reminds me why I need to stick with it.  Also I can't really call people up right now and say ""HEY GUYS I WENT THREE DAYS WITHOUT WANTING TO KILL MYSELF I FEEL FUCKING AWESOME,"" but actually believing things might get better after surrendering to misery followed by an early death is a beautiful feeling and I don't want to let it go."
2w1ci5,8,2015-02-15,"How long should I stay at an ""over-promised"" internship before leaving an expecting a recommendation from the firm?",thisfunnieguy,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2w1ci5/how_long_should_i_stay_at_an_overpromised/,"I took an internship in January at a think tank that was supposed to expose me to a lot of data/stats work. They even had me take a test to prove my competency with a statistical modeling/analysis program (SPSS). After being there for about a month I was told by the office manager that they realized after the fact that they over-promised on the job when they were interviewing.

That same week I was told by the #2 in the data department that don't plan on me ever touching the data while I'm here or even have an extra license to install the software on the computer I'm using. 

I spend nearly all of my time copy and pasting data from a pdf into a power point or from an excel file into a word document, or other menial tasks.

I was really excited about the work here before I began because of what I was told. Heck, just being put through a stats test implied to me that I'd be getting my hands dirty with something. 

... but I'm not, and it seems that it was never the idea for me to do anything else. 

So, I want to leave. I feel I've done good work with what I've been asked to do, and have helped in a number of ways to improve some of the things they've been doing, but it's clear this isn't going to be an internship to further develop my stats skills. 

When I came on it was implied that the internships were for about six months (school semester). I remember being told they are ""open ended, but in about three months you'll know if you'll be offered a full time job."" That last part is important because since I just finished my undergrad degree they knew I was looking to find out if something full time was available at the end of the internship. I realize now that I'm not interested in accepting a full-time job from the department I'm currently working in, and while there is another department that looks interesting (and I've done some work with them) the office was told they won't be adding any new people for the foreseeable future. 

The people in the office have some really good contacts, and I'd like to know when it'd be acceptable for me to begin looking for my next job, which would also include me asking the other department if I've proved enough value to them for them to consider looking to bring me on full-time. 

Should I hold out for the three months? I'm not being paid much, and I expect the next job I find will be paying much more than this job.

The key is that I don't want to burn the bridge here when I leave. I'm trying to do right by the people here, because most of the people I've worked with didn't realize how the position was over-promised to me.

2w1heu,1,2015-02-15,Our band director has continuously become a worse and worse person.,[deleted],rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/2w1heu/our_band_director_has_continuously_become_a_worse/,"I go to a small school of maybe about 900-980 people total. Our football team is awful, our cheerleaders are mediocre, and our band has sort of become our pride and joy (if you can call it that). We definitely aren't amazing, but we provide results and it makes the principal happy. The thing is, there's been a lot of unrest in our band, and you can just watch a rehearsal and easily pinpoint the source: our band director, who we'll call Mr. D.

When I first came into our high school in the eighth grade (our elementary schools go from K-7, and high school from 8-12), band class was my favorite part of the day. I enjoyed music and loved playing every day, and the pieces we played were decently challenging and fun. There were many people who were very dedicated to music and put forth as much effort as they could. Mr. D appeared to be a witty and charismatic teacher who enjoyed music and put forth the effort to make our band better. I was looking forward to starting marching band thr next year.

But when band camp started, I honestly thought, ""Is this the same person?""

It was, of course, but it didn't feel like it. He would find any imperfection about a student (usually not even their playing ability) such as their weight, what they wore, how they talked, and constantly made fun of them for it, to the point where it could be considered bullying. Often times he refused to notice somebody's playing ability because of how they acted. Every single day, I would come home angry or upset about something he said to me or another student. He had lots of obvious favoritism, never pointing out the mistakes of his favorite students, or pretending his least favorites made mistakes when they clearly didn't. Here are a few examples of things he says or has said (some may be paraphrased slightly):

-He commonly says ""So easy [student name] could do it,"" and proceeds to stare at said student for a good five seconds.

-""I had to beat some sense into Asperger's Kid over there so he could get it.""

-""[Baritone player] also made it into the All-District Band, but I think it was just out of pity.""

-Constantly makes fun of one of our only good trumpet players for her height and never notices that she plays well at all.

-Often makes fun of one particular student because of his weight, with such wonderful comments as calling him ""Krispy Kreme Boy"" among others

And the reason he does this is because he's realized how much he can get away with. Our band room is pretty far from the main school building so administrators never really come to check in, and we get results at competitions so nobody really asks what goes on. Countless students have quit just because of how much of a complete asshat he is, and the number is already going up. He doesn't even care about us learning new things about music or our instruments, he just wants us to look good at concerts and competitions.

The last straw for me was when our sax quartet was putting together our last performance for our annual talent show before two of our members graduated. Our section leader and bari sax player, who we'll call C, spent almost all of her free time arranging a medley of famous songs for us to play, and it sounded fantastic (though it was very difficult, especially with me being new to the soprano sax). But every day when Mr. D could stay during our rehearsals, he would say that

A: We just plain sounded ""awful""

B: Our piece had no audience appeal, despite it including well-known songs from many eras/genres (e.g. Hit The Road Jack, Hey Jude, and Seven Nation Army among others). Appearently, his idea of audience appeal was a Barber Shop Quartet piece because a vocal quartet won last year.

and he would give barely any actual advice. The only good part was that we had an intern, who we'll call J, who could stay for our rehearsals on some days and he gave us advice on sounding better. He would listen to us and show us how to balance certain parts out and what sort of tone to use. We actually started showing a lot of improvement and we felt more confident in ourselves after each practice, and then it hit me; this was just like my first year when I actually enjoyed band. If Mr. D hadn't started finding loopholes then I would find music so much more enjoyable.

Sorry, just needed to get all this off my chest.

2w1jfr,0,2015-02-15,What it feels like when you haven't made a move...,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2w1jfr/what_it_feels_like_when_you_havent_made_a_move/,"To Everyone if you decide you want to ask someone out do it as soon as possible. Don't wait for the perfect moment. It doesn't come or if it does it will take awhile. You have to take the strategy of 3..2..1.. fuck it. Then just do what you need to do. Weather it is ask them if you can talk to them alone or just ask them out. 

As I sit here I have wasted a month of not making a move on a girl that I think is the most beautiful/cute girl I have ever seen. Plus when I have talked to her I feel like we might have a connection. I actually felt a connection with her before I realized how beautiful she really is. (Porn/masturbation messing with my brain). She is a real woman and hides her beauty all of the time by always dressing modestly. Most of the time she has her hair in a ponytail and never has makeup on. I actually think this the most attractive a woman can be because you get to see exactly what they look like. TRUE BEAUTY!   I won't get the chance to see her or ask her out until Wed or Thur because she is away from college until then for a sporting event. She is a student athlete.  We are both engineering students. I'm a senior she is a jounior. We have had a few classes together over the last few years but I had never talked to her until last fall. Before that if we ever were walking the other way we would both smile at each other. Just one day that fall she just decided to sit next to me and I started taking to her. (Sidenote: I had this perception that student athletes were off limits to even talk to. I have always though she was kind of cute but was messed up by porn/masturbation to even have any drive. I now realize that they are just people and one of my best friends is actually a student athlete now.) I determined with about 2 weeks left in the semester I was going to ask her out. Didn't really make much of an effort. I had one really good chance before the fall ended I even recognized it but completely froze up on what to say. Spent all of chirstmas break thinking about her. I came back to school ready to ask her out I just kept waiting for that perfect moment which doesn't come. It never comes. I will ask you out. 

Me and my epic engineering nerdness determined that we will be at school for almost 3 months and she still has to be at college for another 4 weeks to finish her sport. My house (parents) is about 20 minutes from school and this is where I'll be at until I start my full time job. My apartment lease ends right after I graduate.  This gives me roughly 100 days to try and build a relationship. She is going on a summer internship and will come back for her last year. I will be starting my full time job in a location that is about 4 hours away. I'm more than willing to make this drive every weekend to spend 2 days with her and try to make something of this. In a lot of cases people have been able to get companies to hire their bf or gf regarding engineers. This has happened to a few people I know at my school that already graduated. I think that could happen to us. 

Guys be honest does it seem like I've got a few screws loose? Any rate I don't give a shit I'm still going to ask her out and see what I can make of this because I got to know one way or the other. "

You guys are not going to believe this: I got a multi-thousand dollar tower, monitor, mouse, keyboard, and wires combo for free! Here's the story:


&amp;nbsp;


My mom works at a small scale manufacturing facility whose IT department recently had a company auction of all their old towers. Among them was one of their old Dell T3500's that they used for CAD / 3D design. It was given away for free because it had an issue with supplying power to any hard drive. Other than that, it was fine. Anyways, I had worked an internship at the same company last summer as, you guessed it, an IT ~~beyotch~~ intern. I had worked on several T3500s and I had a hunch as to what the issue was. Sure enough, in BIOS, there's a setting that tells it how many hard drives to initialize on POST. If you say there's only one HDD on boot, it will believe you! They had set no hard drives to be recognized in BIOS. Once I fixed that, it booted like a charm! I got a new hard drive in there, threw Windows 8 on it, and it works like a dream now! I can finally experience the true power of what PC gaming really is!


&amp;nbsp;


Now, as if I hadn't been blessed enough by Lord GabeN himself, I had a good friend of mine, [/u/Stephen304](http://www.reddit.com/u/Stephen304) , let me ""borrow"" his extra monitor indefinitely until I can pay him back for it. The end result is that now, in addition to an awesome gaming rig, I also have a kick ass monitor, thanks to a fellow PCMR brother no less! Guys, this was a really good day, and I just wanted to say thank you all for being part of it! Also, just want you guys to know, when my 2TB external drive failed on me right before a HUGE CS project was due, my mom got me a new one, and used the old hard drive platters as coasters for her desk, cause she's cool like that. Major thanks to her! Anyways, enough of my sentimental stuff, here's the pics and specs!

She was a junior in college and lived an hour or so from where we worked.  We had been casually dating for several months, chatting online a lot while at work and at home.  Out of the blue a guy she went to high school with (and had dated) called her, and told her his buddy Rick was going to come visit her that weekend at school, and that he was going to stay at her apartment and fuck her brains out all weekend.  She hasn't ever said no to a guy who showed initiative, so she didn't say no to her ex when he called.  She told me about the strange call while we were working late Friday night and I laughed, not really thinking the guy was serious, and not really thinking she'd go thorugh with it.  I told her that we hadn't ever said we were eclusive and told her to have fun that weekend whatever she ended up doing.  

I  carried on working that weekend, and got busy and didn't really think about it too much until she suddenly popped online in chat Saturday night, and we started chatting.  She said that he HAD actually come over, and that they were just watching Titanic and drinking.  I said something about ""have a good time with that"" and we wrapped up our chat because I was getting some calls at work and got busy.  I didn't talk to her all day Sunday, and she came over to my place late after work on Monday night.  We got to talking about the weekend and she confessed to me all the details of what happened.

She got home on Saturday morning after work (we worked 2nd shift at this point) just after 2AM, and went right to bed.  Her roomate had gone home for the weekend as she usually did, so my wife was alone in the apartment.  She woke up around 11AM, showered, and heard the doorbell ringing when she was drying off.   She quickly threw on some clothes and answered the door, and it was Rick.  She invited him in, and he immediately pulled her in close, and started kissing her.  They wasted no time getting over onto the couch and making out for quite some time.  He was feeling her up pretty roughly, and she was rubbing his dick throug his pants, and he then pushed her down off the couch in front of him, and she unbuclked his pants and took out his cock, and after a few short strokes, he pulled her down onto it.  She sucked him and jerked him off for a while and she quickly had him nearing orgasm.  He grabbed her hair and held her down onto his cock until she had swallowed every last drop of his come.  He told her she was a good girl and told her to get them some drinks.  This is when he put the movie on and they relaxed into the couch to watch and continue the makeout session.

He spent a long time rubbing her all over, caressing her, and she did the same to him, returing to his re-hardening cock and balls again and again.  She got up at one point to make another drink and thats when she got on chat to me.  He asked who she was talking to, ans she said her boyfriend, and thats when he got up and walked over to her.  She was standing at her computer desk chatting to me when he came up behind her, got down on his knees behind her, spread her cheeks apart and started licking her pussy from behind... while she was chatting to me.  He got up after a while and slipped his rock hard cock into her and fucked her from behind all while she was still chatting to me.  During the fucking, we wrapped up our chat, and then he continued fucking her at the desk until he came inside her.  She quickly flipped around, got on her knees and licked his come and her juices off his cock.  

They spent the rest of Saturday fucking and sucking all over the apartment... on the couch, the dining room table, her bed, her roommates bed, and in the shower.  She said she was sore still when she was back at my place late Monday night.  We fucked harder that night than we ever have before.

We've been married for 13 years now -- and she's finally ready to explore fucking other cocks again.  I couldn't be more proud of my slut wife!"

Now I'm learning Python. I'm only one week in and almost know everything to be considered an 'intermediate' Python programmer. I really like this learning-on-my-own style, and was wondering; How likely is it that I could get an internship, or even a job, this summer for programming (doesn't has to be summer, could be ASAP)?

I learn very fast, I could probably pick up C or Java in 2 weeks. But what should my next steps be?

* Any languages I should learn in particular?
* Any online classes I could take that would give me more credibility?
* Any open source projects in particular I should contribute to?
* If I made some coding projects on my own, what kind of projects would make my portfolio look the best?"

(28 F)",kombucha_hucha,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2w212w/im_the_only_child_thats_left_the_nest_and/,"I have two siblings, older sister S, (30 F) and younger brother B (23 M), who have always lived at home and have been slow to work towards independence. S and B both have extremely limited social circles outside of family, and no friends in their age range. They know they have things to work on, and they've started to attend family therapy with my dad. My sister currently works as a substitute teacher while my brother's never had a job (or attended college).

I've always been the most independent of the bunch... I started working in high school, went to college out of state, lined up summer internships, landed a great job out of school. Although my path was certainly different from my siblings, I've always felt like I understood where they're coming from. We're all introverts and have each struggled with social anxiety and finding our own place. And my mother's unexpected death a few years ago was hard on all of us. However, recently it's been so much harder to relate with my siblings, and I hate the strain/distance I feel growing between us. How can I work on this?

For better or worse, their lives sum up many of my personal fears of how I don't want to end up. Knowing that we've struggled with similar anxiety issues often leaves me feeling claustrophobic, and not always as sympathetic as I could be. I tend to feel restless and frustrated when I visit home for more than a weekend. I have a really great relationship with my dad, and I love when he comes out to visit me. But when I visit him, well, I just end up getting so annoyed with my siblings-sometimes for pretty stupid reasons. I feel like it would be less stressful if I could visit them each individually, but for better or worse it's currently a package deal.

It sucks to have such toxic connotations with my childhood home, especially when they're all good people whom I love. It's just getting harder and harder to understand or relate to their life choices and apparent complacency with their current routine. It hurts to say it, but I guess I feel like I'm losing a little respect for S and B. I feel guilty for being an unsupportive sister, especially since my life is far from perfect.

I don't want to end up feeling ""better than"" or ""more together"" than my siblings. I don't want to end up uninterested, detached or condescending. I don't want to be a stranger. But sometimes it feels like that's the direction I'm headed, and it's getting harder to have more than superficial conversations with either of them.

Has anyone else had similar struggles? How can I be supportive and loving, without overlooking their weaknesses? How can I do a better job of accepting them where they're at? How do I deal with growing up and realizing our lives have less and less in common?

A good 2 weeks ago I started my first cut. 
Reasons for cutting: starting 3 back-to-back internships and an interim position so don't have time to go to the gym that often anymore.

Anyhow, I started at 76.kg and now I'm already 73.0 kg. ([See TSR chart](http://i.imgur.com/PSWKsDf.jpg?2)).
I went from 3300kcal to about 2600. The first week I was on a ski trip so a lot of cardio but we also tried to eat a lot so I think it kind of balances out.

Anyhow, it seems I'm loosing weight way too fast. I did stop taking creatine as well (no use since I can't hit the gym that often) and there's *some* water loss from that as well. But I'm having a hard time figuring out what is the water loss and what is actual weight loss.

I don't think 2600 kcal is overdoing it  but it seems like I'm doing something wrong..."

My SO have been dating for 1 year and had dated in high school for 2.5 years. I just kind of need to vent.

I have been really depressed lately and have decided to see a therapist while my insurance still covers it. My SO, let's call him John, is training to be a firefighter but currently works as a warehouse guy for a perfumery place. The last four months have been really difficult for me. It's stupid that I feel so upset about all of this. 

John has always been a wonderful friend to me, a blast to hang out with, and a overall good boyfriend. In high school, we broke up after my first quarter in college, because I was tired of all his pot-smoking and partying which led to me always driving his drunk ass all over. I was also tired of having to try to motivate him to do something with his life. At first, he wanted to be a paramedic, yet he didn't do anything, just stayed with his dad until his dad finally kicked him out. His mom took him in (they're divorced) and he lived with her until about 8 months ago. He was consistently unmotivated and lacked the drive to hold onto a job for more than a few months.
We broke up in 2012. We started seeing each other again a little over a year ago. I was really happy at first, he was romantic and made an effort to come see me once a week, even though our schedules made it hard. He wrote me letters, cooked dinner, and we went on little day trips, nothing that required money, to do things like hike around. It was wonderful. Then, he got really wrapped up in partying hard because he moved out on his own and it seemed like he was wasting all his time and money drinking. I didn't like that aspect and then he took up smoking cigarettes. I can't smoke or be around smoke due to a medical condition. It was a major turn off. He has quit on and off several times over the last 6 months, and I found out he had started smoking again last month. I was really upset.

I know that this is stupid to be upset about but he had a wild party at his place the night before my birthday and drunk dialed my house to sing me happy birthday  at midnight (I live with my parents to save money), except it wasn't midnight and he told my dad, who had answered to ""Fuck off"". I spent my birthday listening to my parents and brother talk about how horrible all my friends were for that phone call and how I can never have friends over as a result. He called and apologized but I was still upset. He tried to make it up to me by taking me to the spa on my birthday but I was upset I had a hard time enjoying it.

Two weeks after this, he loses his job unexpectedly. I would have been totally fine with this had he just told me. Instead, for the next two or three weeks, he pretends to go to work every day and straight up lies to me when I ask him what he did at work. I don't care about the unemplyoment, the circumstances were beyond his control, I am upset about the lying.

During the month and a half taht it took him to find this new job, he made zero effort to finish this course that is necessary for him to become a full-fledged firefighter or apply to the National Forestry Service, even though he said he would. I think what really bothered me was that if I were unemployed, I would do anything to keep myself busy, filling out applications constantly and working toward something. I was unemployed this past summer and that's pretty much all I did, except spending time with family. 

He is really a great guy, but I just keep it frustrated and even though I love him, I had to ask him if we could take a break. When we broke up the first time, after high school, he really got his act together. He held a job for over a year, finally got into a volunteer fireman's program, and went to school. But then we started dating again and he got comfortable, started slacking and stopped really trying to be the best that he can be. 

Now, I am finishing my bachelor's degree and graduating this quarter. I have a post-bachelor's internship that extends for another year (I've already started). I feel like I'm moving forward with my life and he's just stuck. I love him and feel like this is the real deal but for my own sanity, I asked him for a break. Maybe its the kick in the pants he needs to get his act together.

I'm curious if anyone else has been in a similar situation or could offer advice. I really hope that I am making the right decision here.

   
**tl;dr**: My SO, who I love, has been unmotivated and I asked for a break because its driving me crazy. Any help would be nice."

There was once a glimmer of hope that after graduating, my SO could come join me in the city that I moved to for post-grad (the reason I had to leave). But, they were offered and took the job of their dreams in another country, a 3.5h flight away.

I won't finish medical school for another three years. I am hoping to move countries to be together when I do, provided I could get a job there as an intern doctor (difficult). If not, I am going to have to stay in my country for longer. 

The thought that our end date is so far away is just killing me. I am in a serious depressive funk. In the last year we managed about 7 visits, with the longest period in between 10 weeks - I found this really difficult, no matter how strong I try to be. The knowledge that I have to endure at least another three years of this brings me to tears. I also know that the next three years are only going to get increasingly busy. Plus, in my last two years of med school, I don't get summer break and only 4 weeks off each year in one week blocks (usually right before major exams). 

We are very very much in love and dream of a future together. All our friends praise us on our model long distance relationship and commitment to each other. But.... three more years? So much can happen. How can we help but grow apart, we are still so young and both of us are extremely ambitious and busy. I don't know how I am going to cope. I would really appreciate your stories and support. Thank you r/longdistance, from one of your own in need right now. "

It seems to run in my family a bit.

I have experienced some sexual assault, although assault doesn't seem like a good word for it. It tends to occur with men who are willfully ignorant, and utilize my timidity to intentionally ignore my polite, soft-spoken ways of saying 'no' in intimate scenarios. In the moment, I feel so unsure of myself because I feel like I can't breathe (might be a panic-attack?), and it usually takes me until after the fact to calm down, and reflect rationally on what happened, rethink my phrasing, and realize that it was not my fault, and that I needed to be more assertive and direct, and that the man in question most likely knew that I was not consenting, but chose to ignore me. 

I feel very alone. I have a few friends, but these days I feel neglect from most of them, possibly because I never make plans with them because they make me feel anxious, and it can be painful to be around them too much, which I think, makes my friends ignore me. They don't really understand. How could they? They invite me out periodically, but I never invite them. It's very one-sided, and I feel like a shitty friend. They always tell me all the things they have done together without me. I feel so left-out, but it's my own fault *shrugs*

I am so afraid, but I don't want to be alone. I don't know if it is possible for me to trust people. I don't think anyone has the patience for me, and I don't have the courage to let them in. 

I'm currently too busy to date with an internship that is completely out of my depth, but that I am undergoing whilst in school for the pay, because I have been unemployed for around 3 years due to anxiety and depression. I feel like I can't even function without benzodiazapines (prescription sedatives), and I've even run out early because I took too many, and needed to buy alcohol to get through the next 2 weeks at work.

It's awful. I don't know what to do. Would therapy REALLY help? I feel like assertiveness training, or something to that effect might be useful, but...everything seems impossible, and I have no support from friends, and I keep everything to myself anyway...I feel like I can't overcome my fear of men, and anxiety, and I'm just doing this to myself because I'm weak and it's been a frustrating, discouraging life where I just repeat these same patterns that leave me empty and alone.

I've never had a real relationship. I always leave very early in dating. I get scared, and just bail. It's awful, and I feel guilty dating at all with this pattern of behavior. It's not fair to these men, so I feel very ambivalent about dating and relationships, because I feel both intense fear and guilt about that fear, and how it causes me treat people. 

I'm just really discouraged and don't know what to do. Sorry for the rant. I just feel really alone and frustrated. Any advice is welcome :/"
2w2j3m,597,2015-02-16,My [27M] GF [25F] of 7 years told me to move to Ireland so she could tell me to move back.,IWannaBeAnExPat,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2w2j3m/my_27m_gf_25f_of_7_years_told_me_to_move_to/,"Between my junior and senior years at college, I had an internship in Ireland with my dream job.  It was just a 3-month internship and we were told to not even consider it turning into a real job because they weren’t hiring out of their interns. That wasn’t a problem because I just needed job experience and it was a great opportunity to travel outside of the US.  My girlfriend [25F] of 6 years at the time was very supportive.  She had already done an internship abroad the previous year.  We have both always loved the idea of travelling as much as possible and even living abroad in the future.  

Honestly, her adventurous spirit was surprising when we started dating because of her upbringing. Both sets of grandparents grew up in one town and settled in the same town. Her parents were born in that town, went to the local university, and settled in that town.  She was born in that same town, went to the same local university as her parents, and then wants to live on the other side of the world. My family, on the other hand, has always moved around.  I’ve even lived in 5 states throughout my life. 

The internship went incredibly well and I was not only reaffirmed that I love my field, but I fell in love with Ireland.  Everything about the country and the people are amazing.  Apparently, Ireland loved me back.  Two weeks before my internship ended, the CFO pulled me aside during lunch and asked me what my plans were after my last year in college.  I told him that I was hoping to find full time work while I work on earning my CFA. He responded that I should keep them in mind and joked that he already knew me, so he could skip past the boring interviews. 

I told my girlfriend about the conversation and she was extremely excited.  She visited the last week of my internship, and she loved Ireland as well.  We had dinner one night with an analyst from the company and his wife. The two girls got on wonderfully. Everything seemed perfect. 

Skip ahead a few months and I get an email and then a Skype call from the CFO offering me a full-time position.  He understood that asking me to move to another country was a huge decision, so I would need to discuss it with a few people.  Primarily this meant discussing it with my girlfriend.  

The situation really couldn’t have been more perfect.  She had taken a job the year before after she graduated and she hates the work.  She also moved into the city for her job and wasn’t happy there. A change of environment and the opportunity to start over was exactly what she needed. However, she decided that it would be better for her resume/CV if she stuck with her job for another year.  That would also make it easier for me to come over to Ireland and get settled before she moved over. This is especially true because I would be able to use a graduate visa instead of a standard work visa since you cannot have a dependent on a graduate visa.  So the plan was for me to move over for one year, and then she would move over. We would give it a total of 3 years, 1 with just me, 2 with both of us, to decide if we want to stay in Ireland or move somewhere else. Perfect. 

So I took the job, moved to Ireland, and we’ve spent most nights talking about how great it will be when she moves here and in what part of Dublin we’d like to live. I’ve spent every day falling more in love with Ireland and trying to engrain myself in the culture as much as possible. Fast forward 6 amazing months and that brings us to the present. 

My girlfriend came over to visit for the week of our birthdays. I was so incredibly excited to introduce her to my friends and show her around (last time we pretty much only looked at touristy things since that was all I knew). However, the entire week she complained about everything. The weather, the walking, the buses, the city, the countryside, etc. It was completely out of character for her. Then, on her next to last day, she drops this bomb on me: She doesn’t like Ireland. She doesn’t want to move here. She doesn’t want to be away from her parents and friends. She doesn’t want to adjust to a new culture. 

*drumroll*
And if I apply for a full working visa at the end of this year, then we’re over. 

So now I’m stuck. I’ve already closed my American bank accounts. I’ve already started to build a life for myself. I absolutely love my job. My family is thrilled for me to be here. But the love of my life wants me to move back home to the Midwest. I have literally no idea what to do. The conversations with her about this go nowhere and mostly she just tells me she wants to talk about it another time. I feel like I can’t talk to her about anything at work that is tough now because she’ll use it as ammunition for why I should go home. My gut instinct is to just move home, but my brain says I’ll end up resenting her forever if I have to give all of this up. It just doesn’t make sense to me because she hates her job while I love mine. I know this isn’t incredibly important, but I also make 3 times her salary, so how is it fair to ask me to give all of this up?  How do I fix this? 

tl;dr: I moved to Ireland for my dream job. GF of now 7 years says this is great and she’ll move over in a year.  6 months in she tells me she hates everything about it and if I don’t move home, we’re done. 

EDIT:  Thanks to everyone for their help and insight.  I'm trying my best to keep a level head and look at things as objectively as possible.  Many of you pointed out that she's probably just terrified that the move is so close and is needing reassurance.  Hopefully you're correct.  A lot of you have also mentioned that she may be completely over the relationship anyway and even if I moved back, it wouldn't work out. Hopefully not, but I could see that.  The overwhelming thing you all have pointed out to me is that either way, I would be really disappointed to be back in the midwest and that unhappiness would be associated with her.  So regardless of her intentions with this ultimatum, leaving Ireland just isn't an option.  I'm hoping to talk to her about this soon.  The problem is just getting worse the longer we leave it hanging over our heads. "

I have now been on Escitalex, a mild anti-depressant, for about a week, in addition to getting a differeent MPH medication, called Ritalin Adult.

This works much better than before, because with the old medication, I noticed almost no effect, just the side effects and the rebound. The advantage is that this new stuff does not require me to eat beforehand, so I take it right after I wake up.

On other news, I have an appointment with a therapist regarding my ADHD-depression issue on March 6th.

I still do not have a job, but this is not all that urgent now; although the job center really wants me to apply (and I do when I find the strength and a position I am likely to be able to do), my partner told me that he has no issue supporting me until I am better. We will not be getting rich that way, but it took a hughe weight off my soul that he didn't see me as some kind of burden.

He is working at a food retailer and manages the part of the store where the beverages are sold (not just alcohol, all kinds), and will ask his boss today if I could possibly work there as a kind of intern, part-time, just so I have somewhere to go and something to do. He did so because I asked him to, because just sitting at home drives me up the wall.

So, no real progress yet, but I am working on getting there.

---

**TL;DR: Got new MPH meds and an anti-depressant, will be seeing a therapist in early March. Don't have a job yet, but am applying whenever I manage. Am looking into getting some sort of internship/part-time work to get me out of the house.**"
2w2ps9,7,2015-02-16,[F4M] Welcome the Office Whore!,OfficeWhoreDPP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2w2ps9/f4m_welcome_the_office_whore/,"Every workplace of any substantial size has at least one official office slut. She will let any coworker do anything he wants to her anyplace and anytime, regardless of age, race, looks, or marital status. She dresses, acts, and talks like a slut.

I happen to be the official office slut where I work. My name is Jennifer and I'm 20 years old, my breasts are a perky 34B with an equally perky ass. Almost every guy in my building has fucked me at least once. I've even let a couple of 19 year old interns make me their property in my car during lunch. Ive always worn short skirts and thigh highs so the men have easy access to my cleanly shaven pussy and tight little asshole. Everyone knows I don't wear panties because of all the peep shows I give the men around the office. All a man has to do is call me into an office or bathroom and bend me over and spread my legs exposing my slutty married wet pussy and ass. 

All while I beg them to fuck me hard as they can and call me a dirty whore then they fill me with thick rope after rope of their portent cum. Almost every day I go home to my husband, cum dripping from both of my fuckholes If only he had any clue what happens when his wife is at work for the day. I want this RP to focus on all of my escapades throughout my average work day. From when I leave for work kissing my oblivious husband good bye, to when I leave the office wiping cum from my lips as I leave through the front door. If you want to add/change anything let me know. I'm always open to new ideas.

**Detailed/literate/long-term responses take priority. You can also include a picture of what you'd like my character to look like/be wearing for extra points**

2w2siv,16,2015-02-16,I'm an idiot who still misses his ex,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/2w2siv/im_an_idiot_who_still_misses_his_ex/,"Maybe it's stupid for me to be writing any of this, but I guess, I just felt like I needed to vent. We had an awful breakup when I messed things up with her, I got jealous, didn't respect her need for some space and I turned everything to shit. She ended up cutting all ties with me and told me she never wanted to see me again.

It was the toughest breakup I've ever had to go through and I fell into depression for a while because of it. But eventually I picked myself up and got my shit together again. 

Things were looking up I put more time into my studies and had a great semester, I've been hanging out with my friends more, I just finished paying off an apartment on my own, I found a new job and I even have an internship in my field lined up for the summer. 

A few months back I even packed up most of the gifts she gave me and sent them back to her, I thought I had successfully moved on.


But a few nights ago out of the blue I had a dream where I was running along the halls of my highschool and I ran into her. Seeing her smile, hearing her voice in that dream made me realize how much I really missed her.

From time to time she used to tell me about her future plans of having a career as an accountant after she graduated. I myself was going to have a career as a software developer/game developer and I imagined working along side her to build a future together. Even buying an apartment was part of my plan to have some real estate to help us get started in the future. 

I've been told by friends and family that I'll eventually get over her and that I should really just focus on bettering myself and as a result I'll be back to my happy self again. I've been trying to keep a positive attitude and I'm trying my best to better myself. But the truth is at the end of the day I miss her dorky laugh, her adorable smile, her intellectually creative insight into things, how anxious she got at times, her introvertedness, how kind and caring she was and just her as a person overall. She was one of a kind, I miss her and deep down I know I still love her. 


She probably still hates my gutts and there's nothing I can do about it. Guess I had some growing up to do and maybe if I was more mature at the time, things wouldn't have turned out the way they did. 


Any who thanks for reading, I feel like I got a lot off my chest. "
2w2tjj,1,2015-02-16,"Me [19/M] with my SO [20/F] 2 years, not sure if still in love",workingboyz,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2w2tjj/me_19m_with_my_so_20f_2_years_not_sure_if_still/,"Not sure what to do.

BACKGROUND:

Currently been dating this girl for about 2 years, since the beginning of college, and now were both sophomores except were on different tracks. I'm a computer science engineering major, and she's a physics major, and due to that we have different game plans going on. For example, I'm currently Co-oping with a company thats 2 hours away from our school, in the middle of nowhere where I also have no means of transportation besides my parents on occasion. 

Because of this slightly long distance relationship we only see each other for a couple/few days a month, and sometimes it's wonderful, sometimes it's not. We have been talking so far every night on the phone, even if it's just little things like saying ""I'm tired going to bed, just wanted to call say good night, and I love you"". I am isolated so I mainly just talk to my girlfriend while up here as there isn't much out where I'm doing my internship.

Back at uni she has a lot of friends in the physics department with her that she hangs out with. Most of them are guys (its physics what did you expect), and most of her friends through high school were guys, and this is the first serious relationship that she's ever been in. When I'm at school our relationship is amazing, she always seems attracted to me there, and our attractions seem aligned. However while I'm away she's more quiet and more distant, and she stills shows strong feelings of friendship but not so much romance.

DILEMMA:

So she came up to my home for V-Day from our uni, and we had a lot of fun hanging out and doing activities (netflix, hill billy sledding, etc.), but she seemed on edge a little, and the two times we had sex Fri./Sat. she didn't seem into it and looked like she just wanted to hurry. 

Well come V-day night I go into bed with her to chill and cuddle and she opens up and tells me that she feels like she's been faking and that she's unsure of her feelings for me, and that she has been more uncomfortable around me and that she even doesn't want me to touch her. 

She says she still loves me and sees me as her best friend, but that she hasn't been feeling it so much in the girlfriend/love department. This is her first serious relationship so she has no clue what to do or why  she feels this way, and usually I do a pretty good job of giving advice and helping, but I'm completely lost as of now and have no idea what to do or say. We talked and hugged and everything seemed better, but now that she's gone I'm not so sure. 

I'm hurt and I don't know what to do to fix/work on our relationship. She also basically said our calls feel monotonous and that we should call each other every other day so our talks are more meaningful.

TL;DR Girlfriend is unsure of our relationship, I still love her and feel attracted to her, not sure what to do."
2w2xe9,1,2015-02-16,Summer Housing,thebluej3w,UCONN,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCONN/comments/2w2xe9/summer_housing/,"Hey everyone! I just landed an internship for the summer that's not too far from UConn and was hoping that (worst case scenario) I could stay on campus for the summer but after looking on their site at the rates for the summer it looks like this would be a hella expensive option. 

Another option I know that's out there is people who are subleasing apartments for the summer but I'm not totally sure how I'd go about finding apartments like that.

Sooooo basically:

- Does anyone know about how much it costs to live on campus over the summer?

- Does anyone know where I could find local apartments that are being subleased?

- And also does anybody happen to have an apartment or house with available room for the summer?

Thanks everyone and good luck in this bout of cold weather!"
2w30aa,1,2015-02-16,[Software Advice] password manager app,Malcor,mac,https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/2w30aa/software_advice_password_manager_app/,"Hey guys. I haven't been much of a mac user in a long time, and am not a huge computer buff anyways so this has been stumping me.

My supervisor has asked me to look for an application that will allow him to create one administrator account with all of the web-based passwords we use, along with several regular user accounts that he can temporarily give access to passwords without actually giving the user the password (to let an intern use our PayPal without actually giving her the PayPal info, etc.). It needs to work on Mac OS X 10.6.8, as we still have several computers on that OS.

So my question is: What application would you recommend for something like this? 1Password seems good, but I couldn't tell if it had the admin/user account features I mentioned.

If you have any more questions I can paste the relevant bits of the email about it in the comments, or edit it on to the post."
2w34ru,27,2015-02-16,"Valentine's Day breakup with my [22F] now ex [21M]. Afraid I'm going to lose my close friends because they were all mutual friends, and struggling to function with all this negative energy.",sou-tan,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2w34ru/valentines_day_breakup_with_my_22f_now_ex_21m/,"My ex ended things with me after a 10.5 month relationship on Valentine's Day. I'm in the phase where I'm blaming myself for all the mistakes that happened and ended up spiraling to lead to the breakup, and struggling to maintain proper function because I wanted to keep trying and he deemed himself out of patience and exhausted of my recent behaviors that caused misunderstandings while he was away at university across the state. I've gotten maybe four hours of sleep these past two nights, not feeling hungry and can hardly eat let alone hold the food down, and just feeling demotivated in general to do anything but lay in bed and lament the end of the relationship and its consequences of my friendships even more. 


The long distance crippled us. In this sense, it's going to be easier to be away from him now that we've broken up, and I've taken to blocking him on my social media for now  until I'm comfortable enough to perhaps be his friend again. However, since he's originally from my area and is only away for university, we still have a large number of mutual friends in the area that I would consider both our main group of friends. With him away, it's completely fine for me to enjoy their company, but when we all hung out together last night fresh out of the breakup because they had convinced me it was still the right thing to do in order to see him off as a friend, it felt like I was out of place. They were friends with my ex far before I was integrated into the group and I was his friend before we got together. Now that our friends don't get to see him very often with him going to a school so far away, I can understand why he's more proactive about being chummy with them while he's in town and wanting to be with them as much as possible. But with him treating me like I'm practically invisible after the post-breakup, it's almost like I have no presence in the room, let alone any room to breathe, plus the awful feeling of still caring for him so much when he was the one who ended things, and therefore will be faster to move on especially since he's leaving again. It makes me feel even worse knowing that whenever he comes back, I'm going to have to dodge the company of everyone altogether because it just hurts to see him and there's an awkward tension in the air now when we're in the same vicinity. My friends have assured me that they will still continue to care about me and be my friend despite this breakup, but since they have known him longer and probably enjoy his company more than mine (I'm one of the two girls in the group, so it's hard to keep up with the varies in interest of the rest of the guys), it's killing me inside to think that I'm going to slowly drift away from them as time goes on just because I have to avoid my ex. I can't partake in other leisure activities like video games with them because my ex also actively participates and I just don't want to have anything to do with him right now, so I purged myself from all group conversations he was in as well and it's like I'm missing out on so much because he's a constant presence no matter where he is.


I'm just at such a loss of what to do. I know that time is the real cure here, but finding myself past the adequate amount of time after this breakup will be hard, especially when it's so fresh. I can't bring myself to be productive in things that should matter like studying and doing work for my classes when I'm set to graduated in May, really can't bring myself to eat much of anything if at all while preventing it from coming back up, still can't sleep and not sure how I'm going to make it through my internship later in the day. I suppose I'd want to ask for some coping strategies for the classic messy breakup, as well as advice on how to handle the friend situation. I already lost my closest friend in the group because that's what my ex was prior and during our relationship, and I really can't bear the thought of losing the rest of my precious friends as well but it's too difficult for me to be with them when they're so attached to him and he'll always be there if not literally, figuratively over group social media, video games we all play, and messengers.
   
**tl;dr**: Looking for advice on how to stand tall after a breakup and maintain mutual friends when my ex was in the same group of friends as I was."

2w3mgw,2,2015-02-16,I [24M] was psuedo-dumped by my SO[23F] of 2 years and friend of 5 years. Got mixed signals and don't know how to proceed.,SSJSD,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2w3mgw/i_24m_was_psuedodumped_by_my_so23f_of_2_years_and/,"I first met Melanie in our senior year of high school. She was down-to-earth, motivated, and had a gorgeous smile that just demands attention. She’s a solid 7-8 looks-wise with other qualities that easily bump her up much higher. I was instantly interested but her reservations about her ability to handle a relationship at that time caused her to rebuff any romantic advances toward her. Respecting her wishes, and genuinely enjoying her company, I sought out a friendship with the ultimate goal of having a chance in the future. A year later, we end up attending the same college and while I experiment around with non-serious relationships, she stays single. 




During this time, our friendship grows and my initial feelings for her begin to resurface. After three years of her becoming my best friend I decided to take my chance and asked her out. What followed was the best two years of my life. I was in a positive feedback loop with significant personal improvement, intense intimacy, and sustained academic success. She is everything I wanted in a significant other and made me work so much harder to get what I wanted. I eventually get close to her parents (a movie-script LDR success story) and she gets close to mine (HS sweethearts) and our relationship grew solid with each other’s family backing us up. Our relationship inexperience grew less and less prominent, and we begin to think maybe we were that 1% that just worked out on our first serious relationship.




Fast forward to four months ago, with post-college life fast approaching, and her not knowing where she will end up, I take up a time-consuming internship with a nationally prominent firm in hopes of being able to land a desirable position wherever she may go. Our time together suffers as a result and despite her assurances, I grew concerned. We saw each other less but still solid time together with me frequently visiting her in my spare time, and her continuously checking up on me at various points of the day. Despite my doubts, she eventually convinced me that everything is okay and I continue my internship. 




Last month I learned from a mutual friend (who is going out with Melanie’s closest female friend) that she’s been hanging out with an unsavory group from our early college days on my late nights and that their hangouts included long talks in secluded areas. At the time I wasn’t concerned about this as I trusted Melanie completely.




Last week however, I learned from that same mutual friend that Melanie spent the night in another man’s room talking. Not being an idiot, I assume the worse, but our mutual friend clarifies that they were just talking and that once the other man made a move, Melanie left his place. (Apparently Melanie confided to her best friend, who then confided to her significant other, who then thought I should know.) Naturally, I grow concerned and wanted a night to think about what to do. 




The next day, my fears were confirmed as Melanie and I met up at a café and she asked for a break-up. The discussion was an absolute blur with both of us becoming very emotional. I remember asking if there is anything I can do. I remember her responding with a request for space and that she loved me. I remember asking what caused her to feel this way and I remember her reply of not being able to deal with making a decision about our post-college plans in-case life takes us in separate directions. I remember asking her if there was another guy, and her answer of there not being one, but her desire of not having the label of being in a relationship right now. I asked if this was temporary and she replied that she doesn’t think so, and that we should meet in a month and see from there. We parted ways after I told her I’ll respect her wishes and give her space and she responded that she loved me, gave me a sincere and passionate kiss like never before, and walked away.




It’s now a week after our breakup and two days after the loneliest day of my life, and I’m still an unstable wreck. I’m continuing to respect her wishes through no contact but I’m at impasse on how to proceed. What do I make of the situation? My heart is hoping that she is doing this for some soul-searching and personal growth but my fears are feeding me situations of unfaithfulness. My hopes are that we can work this out and that this is just a bump in the road but my mind is telling me that it’ll never be the same and that “our future,” as I envisioned it, is dead.




**What do I make of our meeting in a month?**

**Is this a “break” or a ”break-up?”**

**Am I a victim of the “curse of the first”?**





Help reddit, I’m so lost.





**TL;DR;** Relatively inexperienced significant other suddenly desires space and wants a breakup without previous precedence, ends meeting on ambiguous note and mixed signals. Cluelessness ensues."

Thanks in advance for helping me out.

I am a first year university student and recently I went to a career fair to look for potential summer internships. I got interview calls from 2 companies and had a decent interview with them but both rejected me by saying that I didnt had any prior programming experience on my resume. (No job because no experience, no experience because no job; sad logic).

A few days ago, a recruiter from Amazon sent me an email (to my surprize). I am really excited and scared about this email as the recruiter said that I am going to have a 30 minute online assessment. I havnt heard anything like this before.

I have heard people do 90 minute long assessment tests online but not 30 minute long.

My question, is there anyone who can give me an idea of what to expect from the Amazon online assessment and what I should prepare before starting the test. What kind of questions were on the test etc.

From how things are working out, Amazon seems like my only shot for the summer internship and I do not want to lose this chance. I love programming and cant imagine doing anything else with my career.

Thanks

UPDATE: That was pretty scary but I managed to get all test passing on all the questions. It thought it would have been much harder than it was, but it wasnt. Thanks everyone."

- I graduated college two years ago and have been working a full-time 9-5 office job since then
- my partner is still in school and works part-time, has an internship, and is going to classes full time (one semester left!). because of that, he has very little free time.
- my partner is very kind and helpful and does the dishes every day after I cook
- as for me, I take on the duties of cooking, laundry, grocery shopping (i also pay for about 75% of groceries because i make twice what my partner does, I'm totally happy with this part of the situation because i'm a socialist and it makes sense haha), and, if i have spare time, cleaning/fixing stuff around the house.
- i'm currently coping with depression/anxiety/possible ADD that i've had all my life? started on some meds, it's helping, but i still have a hard time focusing and also just finding the will/motivation to get out of bed and do stuff.
- i also have some health problems---a bum knee (that i'm getting checked out at the doctor soon) that makes it hard for me to do a lot of walking or kneeling---which makes cleaning difficult sometimes.
- while I make enough money to support us, I don't make enough to hire a domestic cleaner or anything on a regular basis, especially with medical expenses from my psychologist, doctor, dentist, etc. (i need to get my wisdom teeth out this year, too)

specific situation:

our house is a mess because neither of us really has time to clean much (well, i do on the weekends, but see above problem about motivation). the mess is really stressing my poor partner out because he has to study/do homework in the room and seeing all the clutter and the clothes on the floor and the papers/garbage all over his desk makes it really hard for him to concentrate.

i would really love to have a great, organized, beautiful domestic environment. however here i am on a holiday (i don't have work today because it's presidents day! however my partner works in retail so he had to go to work) and i've been really daunted by everything i have to do. two loads of laundry, folding and putting away laundry, cleaning the room, doing inventory of all our food items, going grocery shopping, putting away the groceries, and cleaning the room are the main tasks I have set for this weekend.

i've been on and off crying all yesterday and today because for some reason it just really stresses me out looking at everything i have to do, even though i make detailed lists and try to take it on one item at a time. I know when my partner graduates college, he will have more time to help me out at home, so I don't resent him at all--he would definitely do more if he could, but he basically works or does internship in the mornings and goes to school evenings so he's beat, and what evenings he doesn't have class, he has homework or group projects. 

**tl;dr**: **My partner and I both work, but I have more time to spend at home so, by convenience, I end up having to do a lot of the domestic chores, and it's really wearing my mental health raw. Any suggestions on coping with this?**"

Need advice guys!,Yaki98,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2w44nc/me_21m_screwed_up_by_being_a_dick_to_a_girl_20f/,"This girl isn't some random girl that I met at a party. I knew her from high school and really developed a huge crush on her. However, I moved to university and never really told her anything. Years passed by and I got an internship in a different city. I was walking around at a campus from that city and I saw her! Those feelings I had for her rushed back in. I went up to her and started conversing with her. It went well and I was on my A game. Made her laugh, felt dominant, teasing her and all that good stuff.
It went so well that SHE offered me her number, saying if you need any help or anything excuse BULLSHIT she was so in to me that she had to just give her number. (lol my ego has calmed down now)
Anyways, I texted her and we had some pretty light hearted fun conversations. However, my text game wasn't as good as I had hoped apparently. I kept waiting for the perfect time/excuse to ask her out to chill. I texted her again about how her exams went and she had not responded...

A few weeks later I texted her another time and yet again to no avail; no response. I did see her at campus once with some short ugly ass dude who was trying so hard to get her (Goddd I wanted to knock him the fuck out) but they walked by and I didn't go talk to her..Like she's not even alone and she didn't text me twice!
A month later, I started giving up kind of. I was going to this live streaming game at campus and kind of still hoped I would see her and talk with her. It seemed hopeless though. However, an hour before I was leaving I got like 5 text messages..FROM HER!! She was very apologetic about not texting and said she went out of the country and her service was off. She also, made some inside jokes from previous text conversations I've had with her. I was so ecstatic! Like everything looked so bright again!

I went to the event, and I saw her there! But she was also with that short ugly ass guy I mentioned above (lets call him bob)...But I didn't care, I was going to talk to her again. I texted her in the room saying ""sucks you didnt get a seat"" I saw her reaction and she was looking around the room. She then replied and said you're here too? I texted her asking to come outside for a talk, we met up and were talking and stuff but I felt like I wasn't at my A game for some reason. Most likely because of bob. Then the guy she was with, bob,  came outside, and started talking to her not knowing I was there. He saw me and he just started walking straight like he never even knew her! (What a insecure little bitch). She started calling him to introduce me but he kept on walking. Then...I shouted towards him ""Don't worry bruh, I won't hurt you"" he turned around with a weird pose and kept on walking then.

She was like yeah that was awkward. I started hating on the guy to her. I'm like whose that guy, she's like yeah he's a friend...
I went back in the room, I think she went to where he was. I kind of was an asshole towards the guy when I was talking to her and was like to her ""lol you were watching the game with him?!"" and then when she was going back to him, I'm like ""ohh are you planning to come back with himm"" in a teasing way.. She laughed it off and said that ""Wow you're bad you're evill"" I didn't quite get why she said that but yeah...she returned to the room and I like the idiot I was, made a 3rd joke about him to her...She's like you're mean and went to her seat. I then knew I had went too far with this dumbass joke and clear hatred for the guy....I had a golden chance and I blew it...she and him had left the game early then....
I texted her saying ""did you already leave? You know I was just kidding about that guy lol"" and again...she hasn't responded to it...it's been like a day. FUCKK, I feel like she's mad at me. After finally getting something going with her again, I screwed it up and back to where I started.

Should I wait it out and hope she replies again( like come on she took a month to reply last time) or should I send her an apologetic text??
Need help guys! My hatred for that short asshole bob got the better of me and threw me off my natural game..."

My friends keep telling me it's not worth it to live in the city. But my friends who are actually from Aurora/Naperville/Wheaton say the suburbs is the last place I'd want to live.

I'm a 21 year old, social, gay college guy. I love Chicago and have always done well when I've lived in big cities. Suburbs give me a strange type of anxiety, but I'd be saving a ton of money and time. I know a few people living in Lake View, but nobody in the suburbs. 

I'd prefer transit over driving, but that means a 20 minute bike ride from the Metra in Aurora to my job. I've been looking at the West Loop and River West, since they're right on 290 and near Union Station (if I decide to take the Metra). I found a perfect place in Lake View, but the commute is too long.  

Does anyone have any ideas that might shorten the commute? Any secret towns between Aurora and Chicago I may enjoy? Or is Aurora/Naperville really not such a bad place for a guy like me to live?"

You currently have a full-time dev/analyst position that allows you to pay living+tuition expenses and still be comfortable. Full health/dental benefits. Off-the-radar company that most people don't even know exists.

Your position is kind of fluid. You work full-time remote and don't really report to anyone who influences the day-to-day -- the former is obviously great, especially as a student, and the latter is both good and bad. This forces you to learn a *ton*, and you have non-negligible amounts of responsibility -- good things. However it also comes with problems, like having no real mentorship to speak of, no development methodology within the very small distributed team, and sometimes insane project requirements given that you're one of the only technical people in the org in your subfield taking requests from people who don't know the difference between a server and UI. 

Now you get a big 4 internship offer. The pluses are receiving mentorship from extremely skilled people, being a part of a structured and professional dev team, and the long-term career boosts that (presumably?) come with having bigco listed on your resume. The downside seems to mostly be losing the relatively cushy situation you are in as a student (remote+benefits) and having to revert back to no income for your final semester. 

Do you keep the cushy job until you graduate, and then take your chances applying to new grad positions at better places? Or take the internship? "

Any advice, criticism, or any other feedback on what I'm currently doing, and my market plan would be much appreciated.",[deleted],Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2w4vow/started_my_first_business_an_online_tie_shop/,"**About NY Tieline**

So, a little bit of context.  I'm a college student who is also very involved in a small non profit (hopefully soon to be charity if we get a 501c), Mona's Wish.  My friend started [Mona's Wish](http://monaswish.org) in order to help the homeless, and so far we have had moderate success with it.  

I've always been interested in business/entrepreneurship, had a slight interest in formal fashion, and thought drop shipping would be a slightly less risky way to get my first taste of going into business of my own, and learn first hand what it takes to run a business.  I also thought it would be great if I could use my business to help raise money for Mona's Wish, which is where the idea to donate 10% of NY Tieline's profits to the nonprofit. 

NY Tieline has been live for about 3 weeks now, and has sold around $200.00.  The time I have spent on NY Tieline and Mona's Wish (you can see our website can use a bit of attention) has been limited the past month while I've been preparing everything I need to apply to transfer to various colleges on top of my current schoolwork, so March will be when I really start hustling.

**Current Marketing**

As I said, I have not been on this full time recently, so at the moment Instagram is my only source of traffic.  I messed around with Adwords a little bit, but because of time constraints I've paused my campaign until I can devote sufficient attention so as not to just pour money down the toilet.  

My pricing right now is a few dollars below what the manufacturers are charging on their own websites, and my current packaging can be seen [here](http://instagram.com/p/yiB2BymrSp/?modal=true).  Although I'm sure it doesn't matter at this stage, I tried to use colors that are in my logo (can't hurt to try to brand the company). Along with the packages I include a small card thanking them for buying from us, with a discount code for any future purchases.   

I did an internship where I worked with SEO and have been reading extensively on it, so I'm just starting to optimize my website, although there is a lot of competition in this field.  

**My Website**

My [website](http://nytieline.com) right now is very basic, and I know it can use some work.  Once I finish my transfer applications the website will be one of my first priorities.  I feel like my large graphic at the top is a bit amateurish, and will probably need to be replaced when I have the chance.  As I mentioned, I am using drop shipping and some wholesale, from a handful of suppliers, which is why the images are all varying.  I think, at least for the bow ties, it would look a lot better if I at least sized the images to be very similar in size.

**Ideas I'm exploring**

Social Media:

The plan for instagram is to become more active, provide followers with exclusive deals and coupon codes for the website to hopefully convert followers into customers.  When I have enough of a customer base, instagram contests where they tag NY Tieline with some kind of hashtag about us in their best tie/bow tie photos and I choose the best image/s for a free product or some other incentive.

Facebook and Maybe Twitter:

I'm considering creating sweepstakes where to enter, users must like/follow and share/retweet my post to enter a contest for a free (pricier) product and randomly choose a winner.  

Blogs:

Another idea I'm considering is reaching out to blogs that fit my niche and offering them free products and a discount code to offer their readers if they'll do a review or feature about NY Tieline.

Referral Program:

Something else that I've thought about is making a program with some kind of point system where customers can sign up and earn free products after a certain number of referrals, or after those they have referred have spent a certain amount at NY Tieline.  

College Students:

I have a lot of friends in frats that may be able to advertise some of my products, and I think that the bow ties in particular could be popular among frat bros.  I haven't yet shared my business with many friends/colleagues for two reasons: 1. I want to make sure my project is viable before I get 'pity sales' and 2. because my reputation is associated with it, I don't want to share it too much until I make the website the best that it can be.

Mona's Wish Events:

If any of you visited the Monas Wish website, in addition to our initiative to give our clients the skills to be self sufficient again, we also do things like canned food drives, and right now we're fundraising for another round of Project Push.  So any events, such as college 3v3 basketball tournaments are a good opportunity for me to include in the tournament packets/pamphlets discount coupons for NY Tieline.           

**Financials**

Not much to mention here.  Invested about $2,000 I'd had saved up to purchase inventory, domain name, hosting,etc.  Have made about $200 so far.  

As I mentioned previously, I'm still learning, and any feedback, criticism, or opportunities you think I could take advantage of in my marketing plan, website, or anything Else I mentioned would be really appreciated.  "
2w4vz3,1,2015-02-16,I Am depressed - (thinking up a title is incredibly difficult),[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2w4vz3/i_am_depressed_thinking_up_a_title_is_incredibly/,"First of all, I'd like to apologize for my bad English, it isn't my first language and I have a horrid writing style. This is a little rant, I just don't know what to do. 

So, where should I start? I'm a guy in his early 20s who was diagnosed with depression and PTSD 4 years ago but I suspect that I was depressed since my early teens. I'm currently taking antidepressants but don't see my therapist, as I missed an appointment and I'm just feeling too ashamed of myself to make a new one.

I think my depression is based on the discrepancy between the life I currently live and the life I'd like to live. Life is just not going the way I'd like to, I grew up in a fundamentalist Christian household and my teens were defined by self-doubt, as I'm gay and I hated myself for my feelings. Furthermore my parents kept me isolated, I was not allowed to meet friends that didn't belong to this certain religion (and there were very few people at my age) and was not allowed to join a sports club or get a hobby. As a result, I have no social skills. I really struggle when I meet new people and I tend to overanalyze every social situation and I just cringe at my behavior. The issue is that I'd like to meet new people and have close friends but I just can't, it's difficult to meet friends, especially in the evening.

After high school I wanted to escape that hell, just move far away from my parents and go to college. That branch of religion teaches that achieving higher education is a trap of Satan to get people away from God (evolution). Unfortunately my father unexpectedly died after I completed high school and as my father didn't believe that he'll actually die (Armageddon will come first), I had to pay the funeral (I was the only one with savings) and I just couldn't fulfill my plans. The death of my father and the realization that life will continue to be pure shit let me fall in a black hole and that is where I started to see my therapist. Looking back at my situation, I'd able to move out, as college is state paid in my country and the student loans are very fair but well, I didn't.

Just for clarification - when you go to college in my country, you apply for a certain field of study at a university or a technical college. You are expected to leave college with a degree (bachelor's degree being the first one) and leaving college without a degree is like not going to college at all. Now, after I did a lot of persuading, I could convince my brother and my mother to study at a local technical college while still living at home (yes, I still live with my family....). I took the field of study that had the best future prospects (there was not much of a choice) and I hated it since day one. I couldn't and can't imagine to work in this field in the future and I have no choice in drifting my field of study. I'm doing all my college work with no motivation at all, just for the degree. Somehow I still managed to pass all exams and getting the work done doing only the bare minimum. I only attend the classes with compulsory attendance, start to learn a day before the exam etc. I'm just 3 exams and my bachelor thesis away from getting my degree. I'm thinking of dropping out since the first semester but I didn't as everything worked so smoothly. The only classes I enjoyed where the ones that had nothing to do with my field of study. That's just incredibly sad and stupid, right? I see the passion my fellow students are showing for this field of study and I'm just here for getting a degree and a nice job.

I currently have issues in finding a traineeship for my bachelor thesis. As you may imagine, my low motivation led to bad grades but I've passed every course. My CV is empty, as I have never worked a single day in my life. My parents only wanted me to work at the place where my father or where my mother works/worked (which I didn't want). It feels extremely wrong to praise myself or my qualifications in my cover letter. I just want to get an internship at your place. This whole procedure is just 
incredibly stupid. The only thing I know is that I would not employ myself. Now I'm sitting in my bed 24/7 and do nothing. Thinking about life, my future, how awful I Am and how my life could have been if I'd have moved out. What would have been if I freely picked a field of study and live life the way I wanted to and study at a real university? I feel awful and guilty. I have not left my home for a month, I'm just sitting and laying in my bed and thinking all the time. When I have the energy to do something, I either sit before my laptop and check the news, go to Reddit, or read Wikipedia articles. I just realized I haven't watched TV in months. I'm unhappy and hate myself. My family doesn't care that I'm at home the whole day. They see it as a possible way for me to reconnect with their religion. That this fucking cult with solve all my problems and is not actually the root of my misery. 

I really want to wipe the slate clean. I want to start all over. Study a new field. Move out. Live the life I want to live. Be happy. But I'm afraid and feel guilty. What if I'm just a spoiled brat who throws his degree away? What if I don't like my new field of study? When I'm honest the job prospects at the course of studies I'm interested in are way worse than the one I'm currently studying. Actually way worse. Maybe I'm just lazy. Seriously, who in their right mind wants to study Slavic
studies? I'm not a teacher type (no social skills). What Am I doing with my life? I just hate myself. 

I don't know what to do with my future. The few friends I've presented my issue are split on this. One half thinks I should move out and change my field of study (self-fulfillment, I'm allowed to make mistakes, I'm young and I will find a way, I will have a hard time changing my degree from my current one when I finish it, also I'm in this case not eligible for student loans) and the other half thinks that I should finish my degree, find a job and if I still have these thoughts then I may start all over (job prospects, I will be 100% financially independent from my family very soon, maybe I'll start to like my job). 

I don't know what to do. I feel trapped and guilty. My life doesn't make sense. I don't actually think about killing myself, just what would have happened if I'd spontaneously die (heart attack), or if someone would throw me before an incoming train. That stuff."
2w4wcn,1,2015-02-16,Struggling to understand why my ISTJ ex has cut me out of his life,[deleted],ISTJ,https://www.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/2w4wcn/struggling_to_understand_why_my_istj_ex_has_cut/,"We were friends for a few years before we started to date. We dated for 2.5 years - 1.5 for long distance since we went to different colleges. We're both around 20 now.

The relationship was nice and comfortable. I'm an ENFP. We didn't match each other well and as a result he dumped me. He felt it was for the best, but we both loved each other and it made us sad.

I was depressed for a week after but quickly sprung back up and threw myself into college clubs and other activities trying to move on. He was very supportive when I was depressed from the breakup, but after I began to hang out with new boys and doing things he had previously restricted me from doing, such as drinking, he began to be angry.

He blocked me on all social media and stopped responding to texts. He sent me long, ranting emails about how my behavior was hurting him and how he felt like I was trying to ""push him away"". I told him we were broken up and that my life had not been centered around our breakup. He stopped talking to me completely after this.

It's been a few months now. Last month he unblocked me on Skype so I chatted him and asked him how he was doing but he was very distant and always seemed to mention irrelevant things, such as the fact that ""I'm doubling in CS and math now because I'm ahead"" or ""I'm applying to all the internships in the defense industry."" He point blank refused to discuss anything else besides his academic endeavors so I let him be. It seemed like he was trying to be impressive. He was very cold.

Although I've moved on from our relationship, I'm struggling to understand what I did wrong. I'm wondering if he needs more space or if I should just give up trying to be his friend anymore. I let it be clear that my door is still open and I was still friendly the last few times we spoke. Sorry for the wall of text, /r/ISTJ. I was wondering if any of you had some insight on this."

Can I please get some advice?,mraero,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2w5o10/i_cant_find_an_engineering_job_can_i_please_get/,"Hey /r/engineeringstudents! I can't find an engineering job, and it's really starting to get me down. The worst part is, it's taking a real toll on my personal life and my relationship. I am struggling with money and my girlfriend is at the end of her rope with me. It's been 14 months of searching now and I don't know what to do. I'm reaching out here hoping to find some good advice or success stories.

Let me fill you in on my background and what I have tried. I graduated with a Master's of Applied Science in Aerospace Engineering in Canada last year. My GPA (converted to a 4.0 scale) was 3.97 and I was nominated for a medal for my thesis work. I also finished school with 2 years of internship experience under my belt and several nice research projects at the university, so I graduated feeling quite confident in my ability to secure something. Since then, I have applied to hundreds of jobs all over the globe and have not yet had a single interview. When applying, I opt for quality over quantity, so each application takes a lot of time. Each cover letter and resume is carefully tailored to the job I'm applying for, and I only apply for jobs in which I meet at least 80% of the criteria. I spend relatively little time on job boards; instead, I target specific companies and try to make connections with employees via e-mail and LinkedIn. I do have clearly defined career goals and a strategy in mind: I want to work in Computer Aided Engineering (CAE), and I'm backed by strong fundamental knowledge of fluid dynamics and structural analysis, mathematics, numerical modelling, and I have 6 years of experience with ANSYS and various 3D modelling tools. I have many references who will give me a glowing review. I don't know what I am doing wrong.

I network all the time and I've had people put my resume through to their bosses, and my applications seem to generate lots of traffic to my LinkedIn profile. I often see that employers from companies I've applied to have viewed my LinkedIn profile, but I never hear back from them. I follow up on most of my applications by phone or by e-mail, but I never get any definitive information from doing so. I've scoured my LinkedIn profile looking for typos or something that would turn off prospective employers, but I just haven't found anything.

My confidence is pretty much gone now and minimum wage work is just eating away at my brain after all these years. I want to do what I love and I want to continue growing as an engineer.

Sorry for the rant. Feel free to share if you've had similar experiences. Thank you!"
2w5trb,1,2015-02-16,Investment Property Purchase After College - Critique my Plan,Aladdin16,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2w5trb/investment_property_purchase_after_college/,"Hey guys,

Long term lurker and a big fan of PF - I've used many of the lessons I've learned here over the past couple of years to strengthen my own and families financial house. Looking for some advice or critique about my plan after i finish up college this year.

**Some background info**: live in a large city in the Midwest. In 2013 my parents foreclosed on their home (purchased for 300k in 2003, worth 200k in 2013). However, we were anticipating this happening and we were lucky enough to have enough cash saved on the side to purchase a 3 bedroom condo for 80k. Not looking to start an ethical or moral debate here about why we didn't use that 80k to become current on the home loan (the loan was only in my mothers name, so we decided it would be better to move on.)


**Current Situation** - Fast forward two years and now I am looking forward to finishing my undergraduate degree and anticipate my starting salary to be between 60-70k a year. I have no debt. By working all throughout college - sometimes close to full time, and a couple of well paying internships in my field, I will have ~50k saved up, with the intention of this being a down payment on another property. My parents are elderly, my mother is retired receiving a small pension ~$500 a month and my father is looking to retire soon after I graduate but earns roughly 2k a month currently. They have no retirement savings to speak of, besides the 50k that I have saved. 


**My plan** - to purchase a 2 or 3 unit building, live in 1 with my parents and rent out the other unit and also the condo we live in currently. The purchase price will be around 300-450k in the area where we are looking in now. about 10 Miles north of the city. I have been building my credit these past 3 years in anticipation of this and have no derogatory marks - credit score of 750.

Essentially I would be renting out the other unit in the building I purchase (~$1200/month) and the current condo we live in ($1000/month). I am hoping to use the rent to cover the mortgage and use my salary to pay down the mortgage early.

Is there anything inherently wrong that I am not seeing in this plan? Any drawbacks or concerns I should think about first?"

I've been dealing with *crippling* depression for a number of years now.  While I've been trying to deal with it and be better, my Mom, who suffered the same abuse I did, a big part of the reason why we're in this situation, has only gotten worse.  More and more she refuses to take part in life in any meaningful way, spending most of her days without even getting out of bed.

I've tried to step up while also dealing with my own issues.  Apparently I've become unemployable around here though:  Growing up an atheist in a very religious community draws a lot of negative attention, so much so that apparently everyone thinks they know me.  So I get money where I can, looking for internships and writing gigs in the meantime, but mostly selling off mine and my Mom's worldly possessions to make ends meet, taking chunks out of what few good things and good memories we have left.

There's a hole in my roof, I have about 28 hours to pay the electric before it gets shut off even though I literally paid 140$ on it a week ago.  I can't call the electric company and call them out on it either, because it's my mothers bill.  But she refuses to stand up for herself, or anyone or anything really, and instead of using the receipts and bills I put together to illustrate the timeline of our payments, and thus illustrate that we shouldn't be in danger of shut-off for another month, she deflates and just asks how much we owe.

We have no money, we have no time.  My old man abused us, and I doubt he'd help anyway.  Mom's brother says he'll help, but he hasn't even tried to talk to Mom in over a month now, and every time she manages to get a hold of him, he says he'll help during a 3 minute conversation, and then does nothing, dodging Mom's attempts at getting a hold of him...  She still thinks he's really going to help when he's already hung Mom out to dry for over a month now.

I'm left with the responsibility of trying to keep this house together, pay the bills, get a job, help Mom get a job that she can hold in her current state, as well as trying to manage my own issues.  Nothing I'm doing is working though, and every day is another struggle just to find the money for groceries and bills.

I'm at the end of my rope.  There's no one to ask, all the bridges have been burnt or are being burnt.  I feel like I'm coming to the end of my ability to keep up this damage control, and I'm scared...  I'm so tired, and really I almost don't care anymore, I'm almost to the point where I think it'd be *easier* to live under a bridge for the foreseeable future...  At least I wouldn't be bothered there.

I don't know what to do...  I genuinely fear for the life of my mother, and my own life.  I'm a lot more confident in my ability to survive though, even with nothing...  But I'm afraid that if things keep going this way, even if I can walk out of this and make it as a bum, or a writer, or anything else, Mom won't.  I really believe she can't care for herself or function as a part of society anymore, and I'm only a couple steps behind her really...

I don't know what to do."

As part of the internship contract I am to perform a study of the general ecology of land parcels within our nonprofit's proposed 100 acre conservation corridor.

This is an urban neighborhood adjacent to the Puget Sound, including degraded upland woods that host a heron rookery, and a culverted salmon bearing creek. I have been granted access to around 60 privately owned parcels (way more than I could have hoped!) for my study. I only have 6 weeks to complete this to receive credit.

My intention is to create an attribute table from the data to import to ArcMap so that we can look at parcel cost vs. ecological importance and to be able to better estimate restoration costs throughout the corridor. I am thinking to qualitatively estimate the % cover of noxious weeds, determine forest type / dominant species and average DBH, note whether the slope is thickly or sparsely vegetated and if erosion is actively occurring, and whether there are structures or garbage on the site.

What else might you add, if anything? Any quick quantitative measures I can throw in? **The research question I am attempting to answer is ""which of these parcels needs our money and time the most right now?""** It's ecological triage.

My boss is offering me an extension for my internship.  I've told him many times before that I want to become a software developer.  We had a conversation earlier today regarding my QA internship extension and it went something like this:

&gt; **Boss**: NotSoHung, would you be interested in extending your internship for another 4 months at the end of April, so you'd be here runtil August?  There are a lot of interesting things coming down the pipe and I know that you would be very excited to get your hands dirty with all of it.

&gt; **Me**: I'd definitely have to think about it.  My end goal is to become a software developer -- when May comes, do you see me working as a software developer or do you see it as a QA role?

&gt; **Boss**: I can't tell you that right now.  You *could* be doing software development, it *might* be a possibility, but I can't give you an answer to that yet.  As you now know, Agile is about adapting to what's needed at the moment.  So you *could* be in development, but I can't tell right now.  The team loves the work that you put in already.  You should be very proud of yourself.

&gt; **Me**: I'll definitely have to think about it.

So it ends, and my boss seems angry/frustrated.  He also became a bit passive aggressive with his tone and would often make remarks to the developers about me while I was in the room.  Not explicitly saying anything bad about me, but just made me feel like I'm dumb.

About half an hour later, the VP of Engineering (who seems very close with my boss) spoke with me separately and stated that he would have me work with the developers directly, and not be in QA.

I'm not really sure what to do.  Should I speak with them both together?  Or should I just toss this extension aside?  My fear is being pigeon-holed into QA since I'm already in it and already established myself as the ""QA"" guy."

Which doesn't make sense when I scheduled for those two meetings after. My adviser hasn't replied to my email either so whoop-di-fucking-do that's promising. If I can't get into the next quarter then I won't be a full time student, and with me already being ""subject-to-disqualification"" (cause well I fucked up my first quarter), it doesn't sound good.

And if I'm not a full time student, I won't be eligible to apply for the one internship I was really looking forward too. I'm short on drawings to put in my portfolio, not many ""finished"" pieces. Maybe 3 or 4 I can put in there but that's no where nearly enough. There isn't a set number but I think I'd need about 15-20 to show a nice chunk of quality work. It's a bit unclear with how high level I need to be to apply but I feel like my art is a joke compared to other applicants they'll get. Was going to try to stun them with something very different or super creative but I haven't been able to make anything like that. Just random floating ideas I sketch out and try to make it a finished product.

Feeling really fucking dizzy too. Hadn't slept yet, starting to feel a bit nauseous too. 

I absolutely despise painting. I really rather get away with it and not do it. But that isn't the best idea. If I start now, I can finish but I do not have any confidence with my painting skill. I won't use the tap correctly, I'll spill or smudge and ruin it all. I don't have any nice designs/textures for this inventory. I need to fill them up though.  

On nights like these, I draw while listening to Sycra. The night just goes on and I keep drawing, sketching some pretty interesting things. Things that are-not too shabby. But I got stuck, my pace of things got twocked when I had to stop and try to fix this arm I sketched. Spent too much time on it and all the stress just came back at me.

*Shit, I have to start on that painting*

*Fu-I need to talk to my advisor*

*Uhg, I need to keep drawing. I need more. I need to get better*

*God damn, I want that cintiq 22hd... maybe it'll make me a better artist. But that's too much money for someone like me. It won't. It doesn't come with magic*

*FuCK, I have a presentation soon. Next fucking week. I haven't touched on it. I'm nervous. I don't want to talk in front of people. I already feel them staring at me.*

I hate it when I panic, I'm panicking. I'm thinking of the most worst scenarios. I fucking hate it. God god god god. Stop. Heart's already pounding from the thought of a presentation. I want to play so god damn many games. Evolve looks really fucking fun but there's no one to play it with and it's too god damn expensive. I wish I played minecraft when everyone played it. Sure the other guys still play but it's not them I want to play with that much. I want to play with *him*. He said he'd probably never get back into it either. Hoped he had a wee bit of interest so that once diablo seasons were over or when they toned down and we get enough gear we could chill in minecraft.

I'm constantly trying to make my twitch channel better, trying to stream a bit more, he told me that I could just stream when we're all playing but I kind of like having the alone time with him and it's nice not to worry about an audience. Self conscious. But it is a good idea to expand and probably more entertaining for the audience instead hearing me mumble quietly as I draw.

My back's all healed, it feels stiff in some areas but it was really scary. Never had I been in so much pain and being unable to walk normally or more as erratically as I'd want. Fucking exercise. Do something. Stop eating so much. Weight is just going to make it worse. Go on those walks. Why aren't I? Just everything's going on right now..

Diablo season 2, I want to play with my friends.

School registration, and 3-4 weeks away from the end of the quarter. Having to keep my grades up because if it doesn't reach the certain GPA then I'll be kicked.

Internship due in less than a month. I need to draw a shit ton more.

Need to exercise, and also sleep. Sleep is very important but there are times when I try to do everything where sleep isn't a factor. Of course there's some days where I shit around cause I'm a fucking idiot. Even with all this shit building up, shit shit shit shit shit. I keep adding more to it by not doing a shit. Shit shit shit shit shit shit. Hungry as fuck, fingers hurt, frustrated with drawing, stressed stressed, tired, school's tomorrow. have to go in 3 hours. Sleep isn't a good idea. Have to paint.

She will let any coworker do anything he wants to her anyplace and anytime, regardless of age, race, looks, or marital status. She dresses, acts, and talks like a slut.

I happen to be the official office slut where I work. My name is Jennifer and I'm 20 years old, my breasts are a perky 34B with an equally perky ass. Almost every guy in my building has fucked me at least once. I've even let a couple of 19 year old interns make me their property in my car during lunch. Ive always worn short skirts and thigh highs so the men have easy access to my cleanly shaven pussy and tight little asshole. Everyone knows I don't wear panties because of all the peep shows I give the men around the office. All a man has to do is call me into an office or bathroom and bend me over and spread my legs exposing my slutty married wet pussy and ass. 

All while I beg them to fuck me hard as they can and call me a dirty whore then they fill me with thick rope after rope of their portent cum. Almost every day I go home to my husband, cum dripping from both of my fuckholes If only he had any clue what happens when his wife is at work for the day. I want this RP to focus on all of my escapades throughout my average work day.

Will I still be ""stuck"" in QA?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2w75x1/2_years_in_qa_going_back_to_school_for_cs_to_move/,"So I see a lot of people here talking about how once you put a couple years into QA, you get branded as the ""QA"" guy which then makes it difficult to get back into or break into a developer role.

I graduated with a BA in economics and I've been working for 2 years as a PM and QA engineer. My first job I was primarily a PM, who also did a good amount of QA. That lasted one year. My second job I am primarily QA, but I also do PM for our biggest project which takes a decent amount of effort.

My goal for ~2 years now has been to become a developer. I've been teaching myself but I've decided to finally take the plunge beginning this May to return to school to get a BS degree in computer science. I plan on doing research for the school, shooting for internships, and working on side projects throughout the 2.5 years it will take me to complete.

However with my prior QA experience, will I still have trouble getting myself into developer roles due to the ""QA branding""? Just curious to hear peoples' thoughts on this. "

I currently have an AA from Broward College for transfering. I'm going back to school in the fall to pursue my bachelors in computer science at FAU. I live in Coconut Creek in South Florida.

What worries me is how difficult it would be to find a job in software development down here in south Florida. Also is having just a bachelors degree in Computer Science going to cut it? Don't I need a lot of experience first? Do I have to pursue an internship and quit the job I have now? Do I need certificates?

2w77xb,242,2015-02-17,What You Need To Know To Start Learning How To Code,ethanael,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2w77xb/what_you_need_to_know_to_start_learning_how_to/,"Hey folks!

Learning to code can be a daunting task.  I wanted to take a minute to write down a few personal thoughts to help a few people out there who are trying to make that jump. This dives into how to make the approach toward learning to code. Not detailing exact steps.

**Identify Your Passion**
Treat this as a guiding light. If you're learning to code with no direction it's going to make the jump from learning to the real world much more difficult.  You likely know what language you are interested in learning, but why do you want to learn it? What kind of things do you want to build with it?  What's your goal? Let this be a bouncing ball in front of you. Stay focused on it.

**Learning**
It's important to point out that we all learn differently.  The key, in my mind, is minimizing distractions and maintaining a high level of structure.  Great books can do this really well.  It's just you, your computer, and the book.

That said, buy 2 books.  The first book should be a deep dive into the language you want to learn.  The second book should be the platform, SDK, framework the language is built with. 

Want to build web apps with Ruby on Rails? Buy a ruby book, read it cover-to-cover (typing everything), and then buy a Ruby on Rails book. Read it cover-to-cover (typing everything).

**Removing Training Wheels**
The most difficult jump you'll make will not be picking up the books and finishing them.  It'll be the transition from finishing the books to building a project on your own.  This is just a difficult jump to make, but here are a few things to keep in mind to manage that jump a little easier.

- Find an idea with a very small scope. The goal should be to complete a project, not build a huge game engine or fully-featured Digg clone.  Find 2-3 features and focus on each intently. 
- Don't give in under the pressure that you'll feel. When all else fails use a lifeline (call a friend, submit a post to Stack Overflow or here)
- Adjust the idea if needed.  It's fine realizing that a 3D game wasn't the right starting point for you.  Scale back and try something new. Don't get discouraged.

**Join a Team**
The moment you feel semi-comfortable within a language should be the moment you pounce on the idea of finding an internship or a junior developer position.  The key here is learning from those with much more experience than you. If you don't feel embarrassed you've made the jump too late.

If that isn't possible (you can't move, can't risk job security, etc) then find a friend or mentor to lean on.  Attending conferences are a great way to surround yourself with like-minded people. 

**Fight Self-Doubt**
The only thing you need is passion. A little fire in your belly.  If you really want to build apps for mobile devices don't let your mind tell you otherwise. 

Be honest with yourself. If you're not enjoying the code you're writing then adventure into a different coding realm. Maybe you *thought* writing a low-level game renderer would be fun! Once you got into it you realized it wasn't fun at all. So you pivot to something a little higher level and try that out for a while. Continue exploring to find your sweet spot.

What if, after 6 months or so, you've found that you don't enjoy coding? You cringe sitting in front of your computer. Well, don't fight it. Step back and re-evaluate your path. You'll be much happier in the short life we have.

**Build, Build, and Build**
I've invested so much time it's slightly maddening. When I began learning to code for iOS I spent 3 weeks, 12 hour days, highly focused on how to use a Mac, write Objective-C code, and use the iOS SDK. Once I got through that gauntlet I focused on building my first app.

Commit yourself.  Set aside a minimum of 30 minutes to just sit in front of your books and the monitor.  Make it a daily habit and set a goal for yourself--like write an iPhone app in 3 months. 

**Takeaway**
I don't want to sugar coat this--everyone is different.  Nobody will have the perfect answer for you since we all will approach what we do in our own unique way.  Some soak in knowledge easily. Others consume things much more slowly (me). Some love low-level code like game engine development. Others like higher level things like front-end web development or building social apps.

Stay focused. Enjoy the journey. 

I've expanded these thoughts [over on xmcgraw.com](http://www.xmcgraw.com/what-you-need-to-know-to-start-learning-how-to-code/), but this gets to the heart of the discussion.

What's your story? I'd love to hear your own keys to success in the early stages (how you approached everything).  Or, if things are tough, where are you having trouble?  I'd be happy to help / lend any advice I can."

2w7ivy,6,2015-02-17,Feeling like I'm behind?,BasedFollower,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2w7ivy/feeling_like_im_behind/,"Background: I'm a 2nd year student at a private university in the Midwest that isn't a great school, and especially in computer science. I could have transferred to another school, except I'm currently in athletics, which is the only reason I'm still at this school. Additionally, I never really got in to CS until this year, and thus don't have as much experience compared to others. So far, I've learned C++, Java, JS, Assembly and HTML/CSS from my coursework. However, I've only had a semester's worth to work on most of those languages (continuing C++ right now and I've studied Java in high school), and I feel that I don't know as much as others and I thus won't get hired for an internship this summer. We're just now starting to get into data structures, and haven't hit on things like Big-O (i.e. concepts that everyone knows). Plus, I don't have projects to talk about (or worth talking about), and I don't know where to start in order to become/make myself look proficiently skilled. Whenever I try to start learning, I end up feeling like I'm overwhelmed in that I'm trying to make myself learn too much at once (because I probably am) and need to learn one thing at a time. Except I don't know what to learn. 

So /r/cscareerquestions, I guess my question is am I really that behind? And what should I learn first in order to become proficient? Thanks for any responses in advance."
2w7jis,3,2015-02-17,Overwhelmed and would really appreciate some insight into my grad school app process.,[deleted],gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/2w7jis/overwhelmed_and_would_really_appreciate_some/,"Sorry if these posts are redundant here, but I really have no one else to talk to on this matter. 

I graduated from my undergrad back in may with a degree in business admin. I discovered industrial/organizational psychology on the way to graduation and felt like it was a solid career choice for me. I spent the time after graduation up until now living with the folks and working in our family business (saving money, researching programs/schools). I narrowed my choices down to several schools in the northeast (Baruch being my first choice, then university of new haven, hofstra, and a few others).

I have my resume, personal statement, and letters of recommendation ready to submit, yet i have not taken my GRE's. The university of new haven does not require them, but Baruch and the rest of the school does. Application deadlines are rapidly approaching for both schools (granted, i was told by an admissions rep that i can apply to Baruch up until the fall semester starts. 

I'm under a ton of pressure from family complaining a whole number of things, getting comfortable, not being focused, spent a whole ton of money to go to school and now your back home type of nonsense no one needs to hear when trying to make a difficult choice like this. 

This left me with two options, apply to university of new haven while i take my gre's and submit them to Baruch before the fall semester starts (praying I've done well enough with minimal preparation)

The other option would be to wait, hold off and prepare over the summertime and apply for the spring semester of 2016. 

I've been thinking lately however, that applying for the spring would mean i would need to ask my professor and internship coordinator (recommenders) to hold off once again as i need more time to prepare myself. I also was thinking about it and maybe it would be beneficial to try and find a job related to IO and what i want to study? Maybe by the time i work for a little i can get a fresh recommendation and more experience under my belt. 

Overall I'm extremely overwhelmed at this point and the pressure i deal with is slowly getting to me. Any advice or insight at all would really help me out. Naturally applying to graduate school isn't something that needs to or can be rushed in a short amount of time, yet at the same time i need to take a step forward, in any direction. 


Thanks for the read.

2w7n6w,1,2015-02-17,About to start university; I'm in a fortunate financial position and want to start off on the right foot.,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2w7n6w/about_to_start_university_im_in_a_fortunate/,"My apologies in advance if there is already some information on this type of situation. I'm a new user and after checking out the FAQ and doing a quick search I wanted to pose my question. If there are some resources that I should read first, I'd be happy to delete my question and return later!  
    

Let me preface this a little bit by saying I’m well aware of how lucky I’ve been through no act of my own. I don’t mean to at all sound snarky or arrogant and I’m genuinely looking for any counsel that I may receive.   
  
I've just turned nineteen and am currently enrolled in my local (B.C. Canada) university's engineering program that will start in September this year. It is a 5 year program with around a year of ‘co-op’ which is like a paid internship. Recently, an uncle of mine had passed away and left my parents $50,000 to pay for my education. I had originally assumed that I would be at least partly responsible for financing my education, so I had been making a conscious effort to save money for the past four or five years. I have a background in competitive gaming and poker, and through them and various means I had saved around $30,000 cad at the start of this year. My course is only around $8,000/year, which my uncle’s money will be able to easily cover. After I am 25 any remaining funds of the $50,000 is left to me. My parents have both stated that they are happy to accommodate me at their respective homes while I go to school. While I would be happy to move out, it is not something I’m concerned with at the moment, but will perhaps become more relevant in a year or two. I do not have a job and do not plan to get one while I go to school.   
  

Basically, I feel like I’m in a situation that many people would say: “Geez, if I were in that situation, I would…” Frankly, I don’t want to be the person who squanders a rare opportunity to get everything right from the get-go. I want to start making good decisions now so I don’t look back in 5, 10, or even 15 years from now with any sort of regret. I honestly don’t know what my financial objectives are at the moment. I’m really just sitting here thinking, “Wow, this is super good I guess.”   
  

Huge thanks to anyone who shares their thoughts.

2w7ypk,768,2015-02-17,Another sneak peek at Apollo: a brand new Reddit app for iPhone,iamthatis,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2w7ypk/another_sneak_peek_at_apollo_a_brand_new_reddit/,"Hey all,

The [reaction](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2u86mj/) to Apollo was crazy. Crazy. I'm super happy so many people are excited, and you brought a ton of awesome suggestions. Development is still going really well (it's just me working away and taking Smash Bros 4 breaks with my roommates), and I wanted to share with you some new updates quickly and a preview of some features you were curious about.

For those who are hearing about Apollo for the first time, it's a brand new Reddit app for iPhone that I'm developing. I'm a former Apple intern, and I haven't really been happy with the browsing experience on Reddit when on my iPhone, so I wanted to build something a super fast and comfortable browsing experience, that's gorgeous and feels right at home on the iPhone. It's got beautiful thumbnails for media, great gestures for getting around, a Jump Bar for quickly going to subreddits, easy to navigate comments, power user features, and a lot of small touches that come together to create a really delightful experience. The [previous thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2u86mj/) has a ton of great details.

You can check out http://apolloapp.io to get an email exactly when it comes out and see some more details about the app, and you can sub to /r/apolloapp for more details on how the development is going, and post threads if you have questions (or of course post them here!). I love hearing what you guys think, it's like jet fuel. :)

Without further ado...

# Dark Mode

This was requested a *ton*. I initially didn't have it planned for the 1.0 release, but it's clear it's super important to you all, so it's included now. What do you think?

# Comments

Got a lot of questions as to how this would look, and I didn't want to share anything right away as I hadn't finished it. My main issue with comments in a lot of apps, is that it's really easy to get lost when you're deep in a comment thread. You have no idea who's responding to who, and how deep into the replies you are. I went with a color-coding solution, where the depth of a comment has a corresponding color so you can see at a glance where the comment is and who it's replying to. You can also see if a comment was gilded or edited, and full formatting is included, from ~~strikethroughs~~ to super^scripts. You'll be able to tap on the person's name to jump right to their profile, tap on a post to collapse it, long press to see a list of options for the comment, or swipe for some quick access gestures. And yes, there's a swipe to collapse the comment thread to quickly jump out. Still tweaking the comments overall though.

# Link Posts and Self Posts

The last preview showed what media such as images and videos will look like when viewing a subreddit (large, gorgeous previews of their content, with the option to shrink them if you so desire), but some people were curious what self posts and link posts would look like. I thought a long time about how I wanted these to look, and I decided for link posts that I wanted to keep it really simple. Currently, with the Reddit website and many apps, it's hard to tell if you're looking at an image or a link, because they both have the same image thumbnail. You'll tap the image thinking and half the time not know where you'll end up. For Apollo, I wanted this to be obvious, so there's a clear blue link to the content that the post is linking to that you can tap to view in the in-app browser, making it very clear at a glance it's a link, and putting the link front and center. If this isn't up your alley, I'd love to hear other suggestions, I'm still playing around with this look.

For self posts, similarly, I wanted it to be really clear you're looking at a self post, not something else. This was relatively easy thanks to the links having a nice blue link and the media having thumbnails, but I still wanted it to be very clear, so self posts also have a little indicator by the subreddit showing that it's a text-based self post.

[Self Post and Link Posts in a subreddit](http://i.imgur.com/a6jkCNt.png)

# Image Viewer

Many people were curious how Apollo handles photos and albums. Creating a comfortable browsing experience was the most significant thing I concentrated on with Apollo, so I made sure it doesn't take you away from what you're currently doing and require you to go back after you're done. I *loved* the approach that apps like Tweetbot and Twitterrific take, where it overlays the image you tapped on top of what you're currently doing, full-screen, and allows you to just flick it away when you're done. If it's an album, just swipe through it like you would in the Photos app. For albums with associated descriptions (shown in the screenshot below), those will be visible within the overlay, and there will be an indicator showing what image you're currently on. You can also pull from the left side of the screen to immediately open the comments.

# Self Post Reading

Lastly, I wanted to show you page that you're shown when you select a self post from a subreddit. Instead of just having it be the same as a media post, a lot of self-posts such as the beloved Jenny and Zack tale are incredibly text-heavy, and I wanted to make sure that it was tailored toward reading better than a media post would be. So I made the content that you'll be reading front and center, and dialed everything back a little. Just like with media, however, once you're done reading the comments will be right there. 

[Self Post](http://i.imgur.com/ta76ttb.png)

And here's a link to the full album: http://imgur.com/a/Igzqv

# Public Beta

As for the beta (been getting a lot of messages about that) it's still coming soon. I'm hoping for it to be very soon, just touching up some things, and after all the feedback last time I want to make sure it's in a really great state before I put it in your hands. But worry not, it's coming soon! If you want to know when it's coming, I'm not taking any requests to be testers quite yet, but sub to /r/apolloapp, I'll be posting there as soon as it drops and you'll be able to sign up then. It'll just be a basic form where you can enter your email address and I'll be using TestFlight to support the beta, so I can have 1,000 of you. You can also sign up on http://apolloapp.io to get an email when it launches and see some more details!

That's it for this update, wanted to keep all you lovely people in the loop on how things are going (great), and show you some more details on things you were curious about. I'd love to hear your thoughts and questions, I try to read and answer every comment so please speak up. :)

2w7zw7,31,2015-02-17,How the story goes... My narcissistic parents,solid_principles,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2w7zw7/how_the_story_goes_my_narcissistic_parents/,"Well, I have been free from the seemingly tyrannical reign of my narcissistic father for about 6 months. Conflicts have been existent through most of what I can remember of my life, and only escalated when I decided to indulge into programming and computers in high school. They insisted I do band and that it be a requirement. I had to forge their signature in order to get the classes that I wanted rather than theirs. 

From that point on, to them I was seen as an enemy. From my point of view, I was enjoying school, life and everything in general. As high school progressed, conflicts with my narcissistic parents became more frequent. At some point it became so seemingly constant it pushed me to the edge and I snapped. Attempted suicide. They didn't care, why would they? They've never supported anything I've done despite my thorough enjoyment for what I do. I'm a programmer. I write code, and in high school was on the programming team. 

In my later years I began placing top in the state in programming competitions. The time spent away from them was bliss. Then I came home and I could sense their fake enthusiasm towards my accomplishments. 

After graduating high school I came home one day to find a note that said ""Out by Sunday at noon."". No explanation, nothing. As I had done many times prior to evade conversations with them that ultimately would end up in arguments, I didn't show any signs of emotions to them. I stayed quiet. Come Sunday I was out. That was it. That began my journey to a better life. 

Well, they ended up taking $2250 out of my bank account.. All my money. They claimed it was justified because they had access to the account. (They co-signed in creating it). And because they raised me and ""I owed them"".. my only thought was ""Wow. That was low ball. Great job."". *My bank should have removed the cosigners of the account when the minor turns 18. 

So I was homeless and moneyless. But my programming career from high school helped me out. I was taken in by a professor at my local university and offered a stable living situation. Since then here are some of the highlights of what I've accomplished without being bogged down by my narcissistic parents. 

-Attending college for computer science
-Created my first corporate entity
-Less stress
-Got a job as an undergraduate intern

As I'm sure everyone knows, attendance numbers have been pretty dismal at basketball games for the past few years. Obviously the on-court product and relative lack of success is a huge factor, but I'm looking for things that we can do as a department to make it a more entertaining experience overall. If there's one thing I've learned at WSU, it's that students here won't do anything if they don't feel it's worth their time. So I want to know from students and alumni alike, what would make it worth your time? "
2w8493,8,2015-02-17,Big questions about Big Data,Ruled_by_everything,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2w8493/big_questions_about_big_data/,"Sorry for this long post and if information here can be Googled (my Googling skills could be much better). Using Reddit’s search engine, I found that there were a lot of questions on Big Data, but I sort of wanted to ask again so that I can cover all of my questions in just 1 post instead of multiple posts.

I’m an undergrad in Computer Science looking to branch from Software Engineering and move towards Big Data. 

The thing is that I’m still confused as to what Big Data is. I just think of Big Data as doing data analysis on literal large amounts of data, but apparently there is a difference between Data Analysis and Data Sciences (which is what Big Data falls under, I think).

So here are my questions:

1.	What are Big Data, Data Analysis and Data Science? What are their differences and nuances?

	•	I’ve tried Googling this, but I’m still pretty confused and see them all as the same thing.

2.	What kind of knowledge and tools are used in the Data industry?

	•	I use the term “Data industry” to include Big Data, Data Analysis, and Data Science.

	•	To my understanding, it would be nice to have a good background in mathematics or statistics along with a general CS degree, in terms of the necessary knowledge for the Data industry. What else would be helpful?


3.	What does the future of Data industry look like?

	•	Does the Data industry look like it’s going to stick around for a while?

	•	Is “Big Data” just another buzz-word that companies would like to see on resumes, but don’t actually understand?

	( This is sort of like when companies search for people with Computer Science degrees, but what they really want is a Software Engineer but cannot really tell the difference between the two. )

Just one more thing:

I currently have an internship where I work with data and would like to know where it falls under in the “Data industry”.

I write scripts in Microsoft SQL Server to complete requests for data retrieval. I also use Business Intelligence Development Studio (also called SQL Server Reporting Services, I think) and Microsoft Excel and Access to make reports and spreadsheets that automatically bring up pretty charts and tables for users."

I used to be with this girl (for only 3 months) and we got really close in a short amount of time. It all felt genuinely good and things where going great. During our time together she showed some signs if issues, having to deal with alot of shit last year. I showed interest in everything what had happened before, tried to be as supportive and understanding as possible, and generally tried to be the boyfriend who supports the other to becoming a better person and give her all the love I had. However, she had quite the bonding issue. This came up after 2 months of dating. I have no problem of being open and straight-forward about my feelings, and she responded to this by becoming very open about herself and what she had been through. However, after 2 months she showed some bonding issues, and suddenly didnt know if she wanted to go through with 'us'anymore,  so I gave her some space. 2 Days later however, shes on my doorstep and tells me its all good and shes ready for some commitment. 

After new year I noticed something was wrong, and next time I saw her we talked about it. She said she didn't have any feelings for me anymore ( while 5 days earlier everything was fine). This came as a surprise to me, but I also told her last time when she was unsure I didnt want to go through this again...and here we were 2 weeks later. She told me she meant everything she said when we were together, and the time we spent together was her happiest time in the last 2 years, and hse was very gratefull for everything we did. We broke up, and I did my best to make it go as smooth as possible which she appreciated, and we sometimes still talk a bit.

During this time I was searching desperately for an internship to finnish my masters degree. I was a bit stressed because, despite all my efforts, I still hadn't found one. 

A month later, I started dating again with a new girl. Everything is fine and shes a sweet girl, but sometimes these intrusive thoughts pop into my head comparing her to the last girl I was with, and what ways that relationship was better. I know damn well that the last one went south for a reason, but if she didn't have the personal issues she had, I think it could've been amazing, which didn't happen.

I also still have intrusive thoughts about my ex randomly, even though I am pretty much over her. I still see her around campus alot, and I don't have any problem with this.

Then last week, I found an internship. The work from school is now piling up (along with my own master thesis I am writing) and next month I predict to have 0 free time, since my internship is 36 hours a week and doesn't pay me anything, I have to work on the weekends to stay afloat financially, and follow 1 course between all this. it is all doable, but it's going to be tough. My ex told me she has started dating someone as well.

Everything is under control, but I can't shake the stressfull feeling about what is to come. Because the next 2 months are going to be so high-pressure, it feels like if I make one mistake, it could make everything come crashing down, since my time and energy is so delicately balanced between all my responsibillities. I am also really getting annoyed by these intrusive thoughts about my ex, which luckily don't have an effect on my behaviour/thoughts, but I hope these go away in time.

I guess I just needed to get this all off my chest. Thanks for listening reddit! Any comment/advice is of course very appreciated. :)"

I currently have an AA from Broward College for transfering. I'm going back to school in the fall to pursue my bachelors in computer science at FAU. I live in Coconut Creek in South Florida.

What worries me is how difficult it would be to find a job in software development down here in south Florida. Also is having just a bachelors degree in Computer Science going to cut it? Don't I need a lot of experience first? Do I have to pursue an internship and quit the job I have now? Do I need certificates?

However, lately, I've been depressed over the fact I earn so little. 

I'm a paralegal in a major city and I earn only $30,000/yr. I have been out of school and gaining experience for roughly 3 years, I have certifications and qualifications most paralegals do not- my CP, notary public, strong IT skills, etc... 

At my last job I was the only person who knew how to use Access effectively and I could see that I was getting four times as much work done as any of my coworkers who had the same task. I knew was lowest paid of the three of us and asked for a raise nicely. When they didn't give me one I got increasingly more demanding as I felt I had clearly earned it. Eventually I sent an email to one of my supervisors pointing out how they weren't doing their job properly- they weren't entering any information they gathered in the database so I had to go back over my managers work to do it for them. I was fired for pointing this out and I know my pushing for higher pay also was a factor. 

I found a new job shortly after that- it only paid $14/hr and I was fired from there for seeking a higher paying position. I soon found another job and I'm happy where I am currently working even though the pay is low. 

However, after seeing how much an average paralegal with my level of education and experience makes and talking to classmates I graduated with, I feel I should be earning $10,000/yr more. I also feel like that's a ridiculous amount to ask for only a few months after starting. I would look for a new position, but I feel I have already switched jobs too frequently in the past few years. I've also considered switching fields, but I'm already in significant debt ($100,000 between my wife and I) because of education that hasn't done me any good. I feel hopeless and without drive. I don't know what is wrong with me. I am 27 and I have never received a raise or promotion in my life and I have been fired several times. The highest paying job I've had was an internship I held in college that  paid $16/hr. I want to know how to do better. I've gone to school, I paid for and earned certifications, I go to networking events often enough to be recognized at them, yet everyone seems to be doing better than me. What am I missing? What am I doing wrong? "

My degree isn't in computer science, but I do have a software engineering internship and a decent portfolio of work I have done as a hobby.  A lot of companies don't give me a chance because I am without the degree.

The best I have been offered since is an entry level position for 44k annually that provides extensive training and a mentor for the first year, and then moves you up to software engineer at the end of training and bumps pay up around 58k. 

Should I take this offer?  Or should I value myself at more than 44k because I have gotten a much higher offer and keep looking?  I really can't decide and at this point I just want to take the 44k because living at my parents house is depressing.  I really don't know much about average entry level software dev salaries."

2w8fvg,24,2015-02-17,Well...15 years of schooling and I have no idea what I want to do. Sound familiar?,Shoger41,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2w8fvg/well15_years_of_schooling_and_i_have_no_idea_what/,"Well...15 years of schooling and I have no idea what I want to do. Sound familiar?

I know many in this world are not fortunate enough to attend school from an early age, or continue their education into college, for this reason I want to first acknowledge how spoiled I have been and how spoiled anyone is who has the opportunity to attend a structured education system.

With this said, I want to apologize, to myself and all those on this earth, because I was given the amazing opportunity to attend a well organized public school in the United States, as well as an amazing university, but I never took the appropriate time to realize exactly what I wanted and exactly how valuable these experiences were. This was, in part, my own fault, as well as the fault of the culture that the US educational and cultural systems embrace.

I grew up in a small town south of Boston, an average size community with a respectable public schooling system. I started with pre-school and slowly moved my way up to the public high school before being faced with the ultimate decision...where to attend college. The biggest decision of my life, decided at 18 years of age. Within this decision I had to figure out if I even wanted to continue school, what I wanted to study, what part of the country I wanted to be in, did I want to play a sport, and what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.

Quick summary: I went to a top 10 school in the country, played a sport, got a scholarship, majored in business, graduated and had no idea what I wanted to do. How did this happen, how did all of this schooling, training, and guidance lead me to a position where I had zero confidence in what I wanted to do in life.

As I mentioned before, this problem was in part my own fault and the fault of the US education and cultural structure. I will explain in a few different parts…

Part 1: Several other countries have periods of time between high school and college where individuals are required or pushed to take a small break from schooling to travel, explore, or learn anything they want. This ‘gap’ period was never known to me or many here in the US, it was expected that I graduate high school and immediately enroll at a university. I had never travelled, never held a ‘real’ job, and never figured out exactly who I was and what interested me. Instead I went straight to school and signed up for business classes from day one…

Part 2: Why business, because that’s what my family did, thats what my parents did, and that’s what my friends were doing. The town I came from consisted of stock brokers, private wealth managers, bankers, and a plethora of other professionals in the financial world. These are the people I talked to before entering college, these are the people that shaped my frame of reference. I did not know much else, but if I wanted to live a respectable life, start a family, and give them the same opportunity I had as a child it would be through a career in business. I had hobbies, I had passions, but I thought that’s all they were and could ever be...hobbies.

Part 3: Acknowledging a small spark in my head I decided to play in an area I have always referred to as the ‘Gray area’. I went to school and decided to enter the business school, but entertain my hobbies of building and designing things through a secondary minor in industrial design. It was at this moment that the first sense of freedom struck over me, knowing that maybe I could pursue my own path while also pursuing the path of ‘success’ as defined by my frame of reference…

Part 4: When someone plays in the gray area they often are trying to balance two things, to ideas, or two careers, and when it came time for my to apply for internships during my sophomore year I knew decisions would have to be made. So I spoke to the people I could, and sure enough they lead me to the belief that any respectable internship would be in business. 

The internships we have come to standardize in US culture are essentially an indentured service, an agreement of work for eventual freedom in the working world. These semesters of work have become the metric by which we gauge our undergraduate experiences. However, what are they truly meant for? Are they meant to give young professionals working experience and lead them to their full time job, or are they meant to give individuals insight and understanding of how the respected industry and career work? 

After speaking with several mentors I came across the best piece of advice I have heard to date. “Work for everyone and anyone, figure out not only what you love, but what you hate. Use the summers you have in college to talk to as many people as possible and explore exactly what type of person you want to be, and what type of career you want.” This advice lead me to redefine the track of internships and talk to anyone I could and weasel my way into the offices of several companies for ‘shadowing sessions’ in which I would work for a few weeks alongside an established employee. Through this I learned everything I needed to know about the industries I was in, all without the unnecessary responsibilities of getting coffee for people, stapling papers, or doing the busy work that full time interns we’re so clearly restricted to.

So I figured everything out, went back to school, pursued my new found passion, and lived happily ever after, right? Wrong. As I made my connections I spoke with professionals in every industry, from private wealth management, private equity, investment banking, global media, sports marketing, and more. However, after all was said and done I had still not seen everything, I still did not find the niche I wanted to exist in and pursue full time. So I went back to school and slowly fell back into the frame of reference where ‘success’ was defined by getting your job offer from UBS, Morgan Stanley, or one of the big 4 accounting firms. 

With friends and family looking on I applied, interviewed, and weighed my options. A fancy paycheck, world renowned organization, and excellent training program lead me to sign on with one of the biggest tech companies in the world, in their sales and marketing division. 

It took about 5 months, a bit of depression, and many internal conversations before realizing I had messed up somewhere along the 15 years of education. Everything I had worked towards day in and day out had led to nothing but a decent paycheck and the depressing stroll into work each morning. I refused to believe I was the only one with these thoughts, and as I began to open conversations with anyone around me I slowly realized the amount of people in the same position. Not just recent graduates, but individuals with families, established careers, and respectable titles all started to come out from behind closed doors and express their lack of passion and interest in their respected careers. Some were happy, some were passionate, but some, like me, felt they had never found the exact role they wanted. So do I just accept it, do I just ‘suck it up’ and accept that this is how the working world is, and always will be. 

Many chuckled, laughed, and just said ‘welcome to the real world’, but a select few spoke up, resonated with my thoughts and told me their stories and how they found their passion. After realizing that everyone in this world will give you advice, based on their own experiences and careers, I understood that individuals must take personal time to truly discover for themselves what they are passionate about, and only then can you seek the advice needed for your personal path. The path to happiness will not come from me, it will not come from your parents, and it will not come from your teachers, it will only come from your own exploration, your own determination, and your own dreams…

It was at this time that a small quote came across my dimlight computer screen that changed everything for me, appropriately labeled ‘The definition of hell’…

“Someone once told me the definition of hell: The last day you have on earth, the person you became will meet the person you could have become” - Unknown

I have come across my fair share of corny inspirational quotes, but something with this sentence struck me cold. If I was to have only a few moments left on earth, having spent my whole life working towards something I was never truly passionate about, what would I think as I met the second version of me, the one who took the time to explore the world, meet as many people as possible, assess and evaluate every possible career, and pursue the exact passion that I had always had buried within.

So here is my question to you: Who is that person you would meet on your deathbed?

I was fortunate enough to meet that second being, and at age 23, after months of working nights and weekends, assessing and refining my dream, talking to the people that matter, and forcing myself to think harder and longer than anyone else to be the exact person I want. As a result I quit my job, embodied my passion, and am currently starting my first venture, Jowl. I do not live the high life, I do not make millions, and I have not yet figured everything out, but I am living my dream and nobody elses.



I love connecting with people, I love hearing stories, and I would be more than happy to talk about who you are and what you want to do. So please feel free to reach out whenever. If you want to learn more about Jowl, or how I got to where I am today please take a gander at our site http://jowl.co/ and follow us on Twitter, Instagram, and my favorite Snapchat at: JowlCo

2w8sma,54,2015-02-17,"I'm freshly graduated from college and four days into a near-minimum-wage job. I'm discovering what ""underemployed"" means.",iwrestledasharkonce,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2w8sma/im_freshly_graduated_from_college_and_four_days/,"I'm working a part-time, temporary job as an IMAX Host for $9.25/hour.  Sounds cool, but I sweep popcorn, wash glasses, and scan tickets.  That's all I do.  My job ends next Sunday, but there's a promise for permanent part-time employment of 20 hours/week if I do well.

Say I get that job.  I'll be making an astounding $9620 a year.  However, I do get the priceless advice of customers telling me to go to school when I fail to answer their questions. ""Is membership tax-deductible?""  How should I know?  I sweep popcorn, wash glasses, and scan tickets.  That's my job.  Yes sir, I'm an idiot.  Yes sir, my generation is lazy and worthless.  Yes sir, I should have gone to college.

Sir, would you please ask about those sharks in the lobby instead?  I can tell you all about them, maybe you'd think more of me then.  *Sphyrna lewini*, the scalloped hammerhead, with the graceful curving head - I remember it because the name is graceful and lilting like its head.  It likes hanging out in schools.  *Sphyrna mokarran*, the great hammerhead, with the strong, stern, straight head - Mokarran could be the name of some strong Polynesian warrior-prince, that's how I remembered it.  All hammerheads are in the same genus except for the winghead shark, which should really be called a pickaxe head, which is in *Eusphyrna*.

The 1:00 movie is about *Carcharodon carcharias*, the great white shark, the biggest predatory fish in the sea.  It's almost warm-blooded thanks to a structure of blood vessels called a ""miracle net""; it raises its body temperature up to 20 degrees Fahrenheit over the surrounding water.  Marlin have a similar structure in their eyeballs to keep their vision acute.  Marlin have really tiny earbones, too, because they're unnecessary in the crystal clear waters where they live, but fish that live in muddier waters have huge earbones because they need to hear.  You can saw those earbones, called otoliths, apart and count the growth rings to tell the age of the fish.  For sharks, you have to saw their vertebrae apart instead, which (along with the teeth) are some of the hardest parts of their cartilaginous skeleton.

The 2:00 movie features *Rhincodon typus*, the whale shark, which is related to the bamboo and zebra sharks in the touch tank and is *the* biggest fish in the sea.  (The second biggest, if you were wondering, is the basking shark.  I don't remember its scientific name.  But it's pretty easily mistaken at the surface for a great white because it's also a lamnid shark.)  They eat nothing but plankton, which only really refers to stuff that's pushed by the currents rather than able to swim against the currents, not a specific organism.  Whale sharks are really pretty impressive: they make massive migrations all across the Gulf of Mexico.  I used to know a guy who studied their movements, trying to figure out where they were going.  He was wonderful to work with.

Did you like the cownose rays in the touch tank over in the main aquarium?  Did you know they have an almost identical cousin, *Rhinoptera brasiliensis*, and you can only tell them apart by counting their rows of teeth?  You should see the pictures of their mass migrations, they're absolutely incredible.  I grew up with them, watching them surf the edges of the islands as I looked out on them, dreaming of the day when I'd be a marine biologist.  During a summer break from college, exhausted from classes, I stood in a cloud of them, wondering whether or not my degree would be worth it in the end.  And feeling the joy they brought me, I told myself yes, of course it would be worth it.  The sea brings me such joy.

Is your membership tax-deductible though?  I don't know, sir.  I wish you would have asked me pretty much anything else so I wouldn't have looked like an idiot.  Working here, I sweep popcorn, wash glasses, and scan tickets.  That's all I do.  If there's something nasty in the theatre they call on me to clean it; all those years of dissections, vivisections, and necropsies left me with a pretty strong stomach, you see, and I save the theatre a lot of time because they don't have to call maintenance.

I have a BSc in marine biology.  You know, one of those STEM fields, get employed right away, get a job you'll love just like that, yadda yadda.  I went to a big public university, one of the top 100 schools in the country.  I worked two internships in school at a well-respected research lab.  I made decent grades in spite of my ADHD.  My references are glowing.  I did everything right:  I met people, I made the grades, I got the degree.

And here I am, sweeping popcorn, washing glasses, and scanning tickets, and getting spat on by people who think they're better than me.  I sent out a hundred apps in January and this is the only one that bit.  And I'm so desperate for money that I tackled it full-force.

I just hope something more rewarding comes around soon."

We live with two other guys. When we first found out that she was going to be our roommate we told each other that sex was out, it would make things awkward. I didn't think this was going to be problem for me cause normally I don't fall for girls way out of my league. 

Now at first everything was fine I behaved with her almost the same way i did with my other two roommates, friends. However, now it's not like that. We spend tons of time together, several hours a day on average. We'll watch movies and TV together, do homework, make dinner, talk, and discuss problems with each other, etc. These things might take place in the common area's of the apartment or each other's rooms or other places outside of the apartment. It's not too much to say we've grown very close. 

That all being said I know this girl better than I know some of my best friends. I know what she likes to eat, watch her favorite genres of movies, tv, books, her political stance, and the little things like her favorite color and foods. Everything. Now, i've fallen for her, she's all the cliche sayings, cute, funny, intelligent, and unique. 

I feel like the way i'm writing this isn't putting it into words very well, but anyways. I don't know where to go from here. In a few months i'll move for an internship and so will she but we are supposed to move back in together because we enjoy being room mates. If i'm being honest i'm don't think this girl likes me like i her. So what should i do? I'm contemplating telling her because it's hard for me the keep pretending, but i don't wanna ruin our friendship. 

tl;dr I fell for my room mate, wanna tell her, but don't want to ruin a great friendship. What do I do? 

P.S. I'm writing this because I hope the response I get will help other people in similar situations. Also, I did search for other posts, but not any quite fit the bill so..."

I went to law school, then joined the armed forces, was an infantry instructor, then joined a peacekeeping mission. I am now back in the academic world, finishing a degree I am REALLY interested into (unlike my previous experience in Uni). I speak several languages, I love to travel, I am involved in two extracurricular activities directed towards leadership and intercultural issues. I teach two different sports, depending on winter/summer season, and have a predilection for outdoor, individual activities, I like to try new things and go places. I guess you understood I probably have a (too) high opinion of myself, but for too long in my early twenties I have felt uneasy in my environment, I put myself through studies I didn't really like to please my peers. Now instead I have real friends, with a more genuine view of life, and my accomplishments in a ""lower"" faculty make me prouder than ever.

I met her [26/f] just after my deployment. She had just graduated from college, returned from her internship abroad, and was spending some time in the same mountain resort as I was. We hit it off immediately, she was and still is really sweet, loving and caring. Also, part beautiful, part hot. I realized right away she was rather quiet, but thought it would wear off. 
She then returned to her native Scandinavian country, and we had a 1 year long-distance relationship. We'd be hopping on planes every 3-4 weeks. She then found a job in my country, and now has been living a 2 h drive away from me. We will soon celebrate our 2nd anniversary. My dense schedule sometimes is a nuisance to seeing each-other during weekends, but more than once have I just driven over to spend a cozy evening with her. In our private life we are ""cute as a button"". She is incredibly sweet, cozy, warm, and listens to me.
Here comes the ""but"".
But she has now been in this city for over a year, and hasn't really formed any network. Seldom does she go out with her colleagues, and I doubt she has any friends outside of work or colleagues' friends. Ok, she is living in a city having a foreign language to her, but she has taken that language since high-school. Also, it's a city FULL with expats, and 8/10 people speak english, and there is also a fair amount of Scandinavians in that and nearby cities. 
It seems to me she spends her evenings home alone expecting my Skype calls, and with no other major event. Also, she says her job bores her. I have tried to push her to take more responsibilities on the job, and eventually apply for an other position or an other job, but she doesn't really feel comfortable with taking this kind of initiative. She has been pressuring me to move in together and go live in the middle, so in her understanding I could commute an hour south, and she could commute an hour north. By doing so I am afraid of losing a bit of my freedom (ok, peter pan syndrome), but also be cut out of my networks, and end up going to live in an area to which I am in no way attached to. I am afraid to also be dragged into her solitude. I also said that I'm not looking forward to moving in together until the end of my studies, but am looking forward to do so once I'll be earning my living again. 
I have tried several times to go out with her and show her how easy it is to get in touch with people, I tried to suggest for her to take part in classes, courses, sports, just to find something to do while I'm not around for 4-5 days a week. We haven't ever argued during the first 1 1/2 years, but now she looses her temper when I simply remind her that, as I said dozens of times before, that until the end of my studies I do not intend to move in. Reasons are as previously stated, but also because I don't know yet where I'll find a job and don't want to move my apartment for what could be a one-year accommodation, and then move again. I have been actually enjoying more quality time with her, during my exam preps I was at her place studying, and I feel like I'm getting a little accustomed to the idea of soon moving in, but then her insistence comes out and gets on my nerves. 

I also have been starting to be more intrigued by other women; those a lot more independent and spontaneous than her have become extremely arousing. I must say that these characteristics I see in them are precisely the ones my gf is lacking, and it's killing me inside. I am in love with her, but I need to grow old with a person who is more challenging, intriguing and spontaneous than her, also not only a listener, but also someone capable of giving me sound advice, and calling me out on my bs when necessary

In fact, it’s very different. There are some similar things here and there, but it’s not what I went to college for and it’s miles away from all that I’ve learned in my internship. What I thought would be a job full of creativity and freedom now has me sitting in a dark room and punching numbers into a computer to get the same result day after day after day.

In a rather blunt way of saying it, I’m stuck. I’m unsure how to continue. The job in itself is not hard and the people are extremely nice where I work, it’s not making me miserable, but it’s certainly not making me happy with where I am at. My pay is low-ish 13.00 an hour. (I’m not salary). And my hours really prevent me from having a fantastic social life. (I work evenings). In addition, what worries me is the fact that there seems to be a rather high turnover in employees in the position where I am at. Now, this is also a good thing. People move in, up or out rather swiftly. (For any number of reasons)

Now, fresh out of college I fully expected not to land my “dream job” in my field. No way. That’s just not how it works. Also, I don’t expect to be making a huge amount of money in my first job or have the “prime” hours. On the flip side, my “title” at this current position can be a shining spot on my resume. 

But, the thing is that this current job isn’t exactly what I signed up for. I was expecting a creative job; instead I now sit on a computer all day punching numbers into a system to get that end “product.” It’s not hard, actually, once I got it down it was rather easy. But, like I said before, it isn’t what I was planning on doing. It’s not what I went to college for. It’s not what my freelance work was about, or my internship. It puts me in a rather odd spot.

So, at least for the moment, I’ve made a plan…

After six months, (the lease on my apartment), I’ll begin to look for a new job while *remaining* employed. While only a few weeks in, I can very much tell that this new position isn’t for me. It’s not where I wish to be in two to three years. (That and there is no position for advancement and with incoming student loans and a car payment, 13.00 isn’t exactly fine living).

So, why am I here?

Well, I’m simply seeking advice. Is this wise? What would you recommend doing in any professional manner?

Im a 19 year old college student. I attended an internship fair two weeks ago and received a few follow up interviews out of it. One interview in particular was a bit ""better sounding"" than the others. It is with a company (we'll refer to the company as ""Company X"") owned by a private investor, however he wants to pivot and he has an all inclusive marketing platform/software that will be ready in max 4 weeks time. The idea is that a small business pays under $100 /mo and receives complete and total marketing strategy and execution from Company X. (From my experience in the tech industry and from how he described this software to me and the teams he has working on it, it would cost upwards of $60,000+ for development). Oh and I almost forgot to mention, there will be a consumer side as well. On top of having all of your marketing taken over for under $100/mo you will also be featured on a local small business search engine he is building, that will be unique to your location (like yelp/groupon).



If you own a small business and don't have time to do as much or as effective marketing as you would like would you pay under $100/mo for someone to take it over and do it ALL for you? All you have to do now is worry about running your company. 



So my question is: if you were a small business owner (you could also answer hypothetically if you would like) would this service interest you? Thanks! "

Maybe my expectation aren't realistic, but only hearing back from 2 companies out of the 16 I talked to after a week, one of which interviewed me for an Internship that would have started immediately but didn't hire me, and the second that has not followed up at all after some initial contact, feels likes a failure to me. 

I think the biggest issue I have is finding jobs outside of the local area to apply to. Or even having something like a recruiter reach out to me.

###Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG):

 **mimics** luteinizing hormone (LH). It is responsible solely for this single mechanism of action and subsequent effects. For our PE purposes, these effects are either aesthetic (maintaining testicle size) or healing (an attempt to prime the HTPA for Post-use recovery). 

 &gt;In males, LH acts upon the Leydig cells of the testis and is regulated by GnRH. The Leydig cells produce testosterone (T) under the control of LH, which regulates the expression of the enzyme 17-β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase that is used to convert androstenedione, the hormone produced by the gonads, to testosterone, an androgen that exerts both endocrine activity and intratesticular activity on spermatogenesis.

###Human Menopausal Gonadotropin (HMG):

**Is** a combination of both luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). 

 &gt;FSH stimulates primary spermatocytes to undergo the first division of meiosis, to form secondary spermatocytes. FSH enhances the production of androgen-binding protein by the Sertoli cells of the testes by binding to FSH receptors on their basolateral membranes, and is critical for the initiation of spermatogenesis.

While LH is responsible for controlling/promoting testosterone levels, FSH is responsible for fertility. 

Considering that HCG does nothing in terms of repair on FSH levels, it is generally thought that for PE purposes (AAS use precursor) HMG is the superior compound and may aid in avoiding the potential risks of AAS induced infertility.

&gt;Induction of fertility in men with secondary hypogonadismAuthor

&gt;Last literature review version 18.3: September 2010 | This topic last updated: July 25, 2008 (More) 
INTRODUCTION — Sperm production cannot be stimulated in men who are infertile as a result of primary hypogonadism (due to damage to the seminiferous tubules). On the other hand, sperm production can usually be stimulated to a level sufficient to restore fertility in men who are infertile as a result of secondary hypogonadism, ie, due to damage to the pituitary or hypothalamus. Men who have pituitary disease can be treated with gonadotropins, while those with hypothalamic disease can be treated with gonadotropins or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). (See ""Causes of secondary hypogonadism in males"".)

&gt;INDUCTION OF FERTILITY USING GONADOTROPINS — Secondary hypogonadism is associated with decreased secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), resulting in reductions in testosterone secretion and sperm production. This disorder should, in theory, respond to the administration of LH and FSH. In practice, testosterone secretion virtually always increases to normal after replacement of LH, and sperm production more often than not increases after replacement of LH alone or LH plus FSH. Testosterone replacement alone will not restore spermatogenesis.

&gt;Which patients are likely to respond? — The diagnosis of secondary hypogonadism must be firmly established before therapy is begun, since only patients whose infertility is due to this disorder will respond. (See ""Clinical features and diagnosis of male hypogonadism"".) Gonadotropin treatment will not increase the sperm count in men who have idiopathic oligospermia, in which a subnormal sperm count is associated with a normal serum testosterone concentration [1].

&gt;Several factors enhance the likelihood that the sperm count will be increased, and increased sooner after gonadotropin administration:


&gt;Development of hypogonadism after puberty rather than before. In one study, as an example, all six men whose hypogonadism occurred postpubertally experienced an increase in total sperm count from less than one million to above 40 million per ejaculate when treated with hcg alone; in comparison, only one of eight men whose hypogonadism occurred prepubertally (but without cryptorchidism) had a similar response [2].
Partial hypogonadism, rather than complete, as judged by less severe abnormalities of testicular size [3-5] and reductions in the serum concentrations of FSH, inhibin, and testosterone.
Descent of both testes into the scrotum at birth or by one year of age, rather than unilateral or bilateral cryptorchidism (which may damage the seminiferous tubules) requiring surgical correction [2,6]. In one report, as an example, only one of the seven men with prepubertal hypogonadism and cryptorchidism had an increase in sperm count to within the normal range in response to hCG and hMG [2].

&gt;Use of gonadotropin with assisted reproductive technologies — Gonadotropin treatment of men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism results in the appearance of sperm in the ejaculate in up to 90 percent of these men, but often not to normal [4]. Even if pregnancy does not occur spontaneously, the number of sperm is often sufficient that pregnancy can be achieved with the help of an assisted reproductive technique, which may be as simple as insemination with the patient's semen (intrauterine insemination, IUI) or as elaborate as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) [7]. (See ""Intracytoplasmic sperm injection"".) or in vitro fertilization (see ""In vitro fertilization"").

&gt;Use of human chorionic gonadotropin — Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) has the biologic activity of LH but a longer half life in the circulation; it stimulates the Leydig cells of the testes to synthesize and secrete testosterone. hCG is used to replace LH in men who have secondary hypogonadism and desire to become fertile. It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. Both urinary and recombinant hCG preparations are available. There is no theoretical reason to use recombinant human LH, since it has a shorter half life (10 hours) than hCG and therefore would probably not be effective given three times a week.

&gt;LH, by the use of its substitute hCG, is always replaced before FSH for three reasons:


&gt;LH stimulates the Leydig cells to secrete testosterone, which results in an intratesticular testosterone concentration 100 times that in the peripheral circulation, a concentration essential to stimulate spermatogenesis. (See ""Male reproductive physiology"".)
hCG alone may be sufficient for stimulation of spermatogenesis [2]; FSH alone is not effective [8].
hCG treatment costs approximately $2500 a year; replacement of FSH (recombinant FSH or human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG)) costs $9000 to $18,000 a year (hMG) and even more for recombinant FSH.

&gt;After stopping testosterone therapy, hCG is administered according to the following regimen:


&gt;Patients are taught to self-administer the medication intramuscularly in the thigh at an initial dose of 2000 units three times a week (the recombinant preparation, which is dosed differently, is administered subcutaneously). (See ""In vitro fertilization"".)
The serum testosterone concentration is measured every one to two months and, if it is not between 400 and 900 ng/dL within three to four months, the dose is increased accordingly. Some patients require as little as 500 units per dose and others as much as 10,000 units. On rare occasions the serum testosterone concentration fails to respond to hCG, a problem thought to be due to antibodies to hCG [9,10].
The sperm count is measured every two to four weeks, but the value is not used to adjust the hCG dose. Most patients who eventually reach a normal sperm count (over 20 million/mL or 40 million/ejaculate) do so within six months, but some require 12 to 24 months [3]. The addition of hMG should be considered if the sperm count does not reach one-half normal by 12 to 24 months. The sperm produced by this regimen are qualitatively normal; thus, less than a normal number of sperm is usually sufficient to restore fertility (figure 1) [11].

&gt;Adverse effects of hCG therapy are few and generally similar to those of testosterone. (See ""Testosterone treatment of male hypogonadism"".) The frequency of gynecomastia, however, may be greater with hCG.

&gt;Use of hMG — hMG contains FSH and is the pharmaceutical preparation used to replace FSH in stimulating spermatogenesis in men who are infertile due to secondary hypogonadism. Recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (rhFSH) is also available, but has been less well studied in men [12-14] and is more expensive. This effect of FSH is probably exerted via the Sertoli cells of the seminiferous tubules. FSH appears to be necessary for the initiation of spermatogenesis, but not for its maintenance or reinitiation. As mentioned above, only one of eight men with a prepubertal onset of secondary hypogonadism responded to hCG alone; five of the seven nonresponders showed an increase in sperm count to above 40 million per ejaculate when hMG was added [2]. The likelihood of a response was much less (one of seven men) when prepubertal hypogonadism was accompanied by cryptorchidism, presumably due to seminiferous tubular damage induced by the cryptorchidism (figure 2). (See ""Clinical features and diagnosis of male hypogonadism"".)

&gt;After stopping testosterone therapy, the following regimen is used to administer hMG:


&gt;The initial dose is 75 units (the contents of one vial) by intramuscular injection three times a week (although an hMG preparation is now available that can be given subcutaneously); it is most conveniently administered in the same syringe as hCG. Recombinant FSH preparations are also administered subcutaneously.
The sperm count is measured once every two to four weeks. The reason for such frequent measurement of the sperm count is that individual values fluctuate considerably, so that many samples are needed to detect a trend. The maximum count is usually achieved within three to 24 months.
The hMG dose can be increased to 150 units if the sperm count does not reach 20 million per ejaculate within six months. This will increase the serum FSH concentration from low-normal to high-normal, but it is less certain that it will increase the sperm count. As long as the sperm count is at least a few million, however, continuation of hCG and hMG administration is probably worthwhile, because even values this low can result in impregnation spontaneously [10] and is more than sufficient for assisted reproductive technologies.

&gt;The only undesirable feature of hMG administration is its cost: $9000/year for 75 units/dose and $18,000 for 150 units/dose. RhFSH is even more expensive.

&gt;hMG should be discontinued once pregnancy occurs because of its high cost. On the other hand, hCG (which is much less expensive) should be continued if the couple is considering another pregnancy. Monotherapy with hCG in this setting will usually keep the serum testosterone concentration in the normal range and maintain at least some degree of spermatogenesis. hMG can be added again if the sperm count is not near-normal when another pregnancy is considered. When the couple does not wish to have more children, virilization can be maintained by continuing HCG alone or by using testosterone. (See ""Testosterone treatment of male hypogonadism"".)

&gt;INDUCTION OF FERTILITY USING GNRH — Spermatogenesis can also be stimulated in men who have secondary hypogonadism by GnRH, as long as the hypogonadism is the result of hypothalamic disease. The rationale for this treatment is that replacement of GnRH in a physiologic manner, in pulses every two hours, will stimulate the gonadotroph cells of the pituitary to secrete LH and FSH, which in turn will stimulate the testes to produce testosterone and sperm. (See ""Physiology of gonadotropin-releasing hormone"" and ""Male reproductive physiology"".)

&gt;Use of GnRH — GnRH is administered in a pulsatile fashion by a pump and syringe that is programmed to deliver a bolus of GnRH every two hours and is connected to a subcutaneous needle. The apparatus is worn continuously until pregnancy occurs. The dose of GnRH initially is about 25 ng/kg body weight and is increased, as necessary, until the serum testosterone concentration is normal. Doses as high as 600 ng/kg body weight are necessary in some cases [15]. Sperm may appear in the ejaculate as soon as 12 months after the initiation of treatment but more often three years or more are required. (See ""Congenital gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency (idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism)"", section on 'Pulsatile GnRH'.)

&gt;Virtually all patients treated with this regimen attain a normal serum testosterone concentration, and most develop some sperm in the ejaculate. In one study of 23 men with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, as an example, 20 showed an increase in sperm count from less than one million to a mean of 96 million sperm/mL of ejaculate [15]. The best predictors of a favorable response are a history of prior sexual maturation, absence of a history of cryptorchidism, and a serum inhibin B concentration &gt;60 pg/mL [16]. Studies comparing gonadotropin to pulsatile GnRH treatment showed similar stimulation of spermatogenesis with both therapies [17,18]. GnRH is currently unavailable in the United States.

&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS — We recommend treatment with gonadotropins for most men who have secondary hypogonadism due to either hypothalamic or pituitary disease who wish to become fertile. Gonadotropin is more convenient to administer than GnRH and, if the onset of the hypogonadism was postpubertal, less expensive, because it is likely that only hCG will be necessary. We recommend treating initially with hCG alone and, if the sperm count is not normal within 6 to 12 months, adding hMG. If pregnancy has not occurred spontaneously after a year or more of combined treatment, an assisted reproductive technique, using the patient's semen, should be strongly considered.

Long story short, I am a 21 year old female 5 ft 3 104 pounds. Thanks to years of anorexia in my early teens, my body is not as healthy as it should be and it is very hard for me to gain weight. 

I rarely have an appetite so I tend to drink my calories and nutrition in Ensure shakes or other meal replacements. I usually do not get hungry until late at night, if at all. Most of my exercise is simply walking to classes on campus, but once Spring rolls around I plan on becoming more active.

My goal is to gain weight, perhaps mainly muscle weight seeing as how I still have a self-esteem issue whenever I see ""fat"" on my body. 

Any meal suggestions, especially thing I can make ahead of time and take on the run (work, school full-time, and internship makes it difficult to find time to eat as well) would be GREAT. I love fruits and vegetables and I mainly stick to chicken. Willing to be pretty broad/adventurous, but keep in mind I am on a college students budget ;)

Thanks! "
2w9yd9,177,2015-02-17,My husband left his ex-wife for me.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2w9yd9/my_husband_left_his_exwife_for_me/,"This is long because I have nobody else to talk to. I apologize in advance.

When I was 19, I sought homework help on reddit. One person in particular was extra helpful. We never exchanged names or anything of the sort, but became casual friends, goofing off as he taught me to navigate the stupidity of his profession.

When I was 20, my ex-boyfriend violently raped me and I had to get out. Between the hospitalization from the physical trauma, the hospitalization for my suicide attempt, and the hospitalization for my subsequent eating disorder, I made the call to take a break from school. My reddit friend and I lost touch. I could not drive on the same streets of the maniac who paid a waiter $50 to slip my ""medication"" into my diet soda and turn a blind eye while he stuffed me in the back of a cab. My boyfriend and I agreed that it would be good for me to seek internships outside of our area. He proposed to me in the airport when he saw me off to my most exciting interview; my whole body was filled with dread when I saw him get down on one knee, but I said yes because we'd been together for years and you can't just not marry the man who loved you so hard during your hardest moments. 

My interviewer and I got about 3 sentences into the interview before we realized who we were; the friends who told nerdy jokes at 3AM. He didn't know I was a woman. I didn't know he was married. We knew it would be inappropriate for him to make a hiring decision, but he asked me to get coffee with him the next morning. 

We talked about our childhood pets and favorite books. Everything lined up. He loved bands I'd never heard of. We never had to say that we liked each other. We just agreed that we'd do this the right way; we'd go home and decide if we really wanted to end it with our current partners. We wouldn't get in touch again until it was final. It wasn't right for me to only leave my fiance as long as he left his wife, and vice versa. 

When we married a little over two years later in a courthouse in his city, nobody came. My family abandoned me when I left my fiance. His family wants nothing to do with the gold digging girl half his age who stole their son away from his wife and new daughter. It stung, because we felt like we'd done the best we could. We did not even touch until he was divorced. He could not be expected to stay in a loveless marriage because of the child they shared. I did  not understand the magnitude of his wealth until he filled me in on some details of the divorce.

The first time I met his ex-wife, she spat at me and said I'd only married him for his money. This hurts me to this day because I know it is not true but I don't know how to prove it. To anyone we meet, it looks like I married him for his money. I didn't know he had as much money as he does until I'd already left my fiance for him. I've opted to maintain my own income and try my best to contribute financially to our life together. 

I ache for my husband every time I remember his ex-wife's words. Is that how little she thinks of him, that the only way I could possibly want to spend my life with her ex-husband is for her money? Does she not think that I could love him for the way he can explain anything and his stupid laugh and the way he bakes garlic bread on Sundays and what a great father he is to their little girl? Did she see any of that?

I ache for this woman. What happened is shitty. It must feel terrible, to have just had your first baby and feel like your husband traded you in for a skinny 20-something. I guess there's no helping it. We fucked her over and I feel guilty about it every day.

Their little girl is almost three now and I love her like she's my own. She's smart and beautiful. We don't see her often; her mother doesn't work, and the both of us do, so it just makes sense to have her spend most of her time with her mom. The weekends we have her, my husband and I love on her as hard as we can. We cry together after we say goodbye to her every other Sunday night. I worry about what her mother will tell her about us when she's old enough to understand. We're a year into our marriage and talking about having our own baby now, but it's hard because the physical damage from my rape has made my fertility questionable.

Nobody wants to be friends with us. Unfaithful homewreckers. We tried our hardest. We are lonely and we have peace with each other but the crinkle in strangers' noses when they realize we're a married couple and not a father/daughter pair is so painful. There's so much to our story but everyone assumes the worst. I don't know what else we could have done.

And through all this, I am still in love and still happy and confident that marrying my husband was the right decision. It's not easy, but it will pass. "

I've worked hard to keep a decent GPA and involve myself around campus with engineering and non-engineering activities.

Over the past three years I've sent out approximately 90 application to various companies.  I've gone to school career fairs to try and get an internship or co-op.  I've tried networking with others to try and get a job.  I've attended career services events at my university and have been told I have a solid resume.  

Today was our school's spring career fair.  I had four companies I was interested in pursuing in the hour I could attend.  I was busy with my on campus job and a lab later.  One company was a no show, two weren't offering internships despite my previous research that indicated they were.  The last seemed like they enjoyed talking to me and said they'd look through all the resumes and call back tonight, which didn't happen.  

Walking back from my lab, my friend gets a call from a company asking him to come in for an interview and now I have to listen to him talk as I walk back to the dorms with him. I'm pretty jealous.  

I'm tired of not hearing anything back from my online applications and getting nowhere with networking and career fairs.  I don't know what to do this summer if I don't get an internship.

I have tailored my entire resume and work to getting a job in financial analysis, research, or trading after graduation, but my GPA is barring me from getting any decent job. I was not very mature in college. I disliked school because I felt like I was not learning anything new, so I spent most of my time at home learning code or other interesting things. 

I have a broad background of mathematical finance, derivatives, statistics, and programming. My finance experience is all internship based. I have worked at in algorithmic trading, quantitative asset management, and quant at a big investment bank. GPA was not an issue back then (it was not terrible nor did they even ask it). My resume looks very good, but most if not all firms have a GPA requirement for entry level (even if I get an interview, they often ask for GPA during). For instance, I have interviewed super days at Goldman and other top firms, but they always ask GPA.

My biggest weakness is I do not know corporate finance at the moment, but I am not sure how applicable it is because I am not applying for Investment Banking positions. I actively follow the markets and news. I read research and blogs on new instruments and notable industries. I take online courses to brush on stuff that could help (corporate finance, machine learning, data analysis, etc). Also, I do not believe I lack social graces.

At the moment, I reach out to alumni and friends. I reach out to even similar backgrounds of people I don't know. I cold-call businesses (that I can find). I score through my University's career site and Linkedin. I attend career fairs. I use blogs to find more companies. I try to network everywhere I go. Where else can I look? What other ways can I find open opportunities? I am considering hiring a headhunter, but I do not even know how to or if it will be worth it.

The recruiting cycle is mainly in the fall, which is over. This process is getting more dismal as time goes on.

tl;dr - Suggestions for where to look or try to pry my way into this industry? Good resume, bad GPA. 

Thank you.

2wa98o,84,2015-02-18,Lardlover: By Calvin Klein,[deleted],fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/2wa98o/lardlover_by_calvin_klein/,"Sorry for the lack of fatlogic, but I thought that this was still a story worth sharing:

There I was. A part-time intern at a small, homely financial services company. I knew each of my coworkers and bosses by name. We had a new product out, and were marketing it to other firms around the state. Naturally, there were lots of meetings, seminars, and a generally hectic aura of rapport-building as we tried to make it happen.

&gt; Be me, schwartzenman. Riding my bike to work every day in an affluent California business district, almost being run over by Maseratis and McClarens on a daily basis.

&gt;Be bossmen, our CEO and our Vice President. Great people, great mentors for a no-nothing intern like me.

&gt;Be officemom, our caring and motherly Administrative Assistant.

&gt;Don't be lardlover, bringer of doom to poor offices everywhere.

It was Monday. I had just gotten out of class, and per my usual schedule, I hopped on my Wal-Mart bike and booked it to work. Wearing a cheap, department store suit, my shoes beaten and demoralised, I looked up at the clear, blue sky, thankful that my morning commute was saving me the sweat and smell that would accompany the afternoon heat.

I arrived on schedule, early enough to straighten myself up, lock my bike, and  walk through the back door of our first-floor suite. I greeted one of the bossmen, as he looked up and reciprocated with a warm smile. The other was in his office, door closed, as I walked by to greet officemom on such a bright and lovely morning.

I settled in at the front desk to resume a few database projects I had going. I also functioned as the office receptionist, and so I wasn't surprised when I looked up and saw the tall, glass doors begin to move. On the other side was the most enormous man I had seen in my life up to that point, struggling to open the door.

I had seen pictures here and there, but never had I seen in person such a monster as lardlover. His strained suit held a man of a conservative 500 pounds. His rascall strained under his weight, as fold after fold of fat, sweating through his emaciated suit, hung over the sides. His face was oily and unkempt, as if he smeared it with butter as part of some bizarre morning ritual.

Maintaining professionalism, I jolted out of my chair to help him with the door.

It took a couple of moments, but the smell hit me. I was shocked. His folds of fat apparently contained a mixture of repulsive scent suitable for crowd control or asymmetrical warfare. If you can imagine the smell of cold urine, somehow made rancid, somehow able to rot, and somehow concentrated to a point of being unbearable, this is it.

Reflexively holding my breath, and somehow maintaining professional composure, I forced a smile and greeted him. He was there for a meeting with the bossmen. His scent quickly drifted and hung over the entire office, in force.

""Would you like any water? It looks hot out today.""

I typically greeted clients and business partners like this, and they typically gave a cordial response, never asking for more than a cup of water.

""I'd like a coffee with a bit of half-and-half, and two lumps of sugar.""

""Of course, sir. In the meantime, feel free to wait in the conference room.""

I led him in, closed the door, and was immediately approached by officemom.

""What's that smell?"" she asked. ""It's horrible.""

""It's him! Now the entire office smells like it.""

""Well, let's open up all the doors and windows we can. I'll get the air freshener and we'll try to make the best of it.""

I told the bossmen of his arrival and did my best to make his coffee order. I stood outside the conference room with his coffee for about ten seconds preparing myself for ground zero. I took my deepest breath, opened the door, and delivered it to him calmly and slowly.

""Here you are, sir. Enjoy.""

As the door clicked shut, I gasped, with the distinct sting of concentrated urine-ish odor lining my nostrils. The office smell had improved slightly, as officemom spoke with the bossmen, who smiled in a forced and hestitant laugh. Courageously, they stepped into the conference room.

And closed the door.

Maybe they wanted their privacy, but I don't think so. It was just me and officemom, and we were well out of earshot. They didn't have documents to review, and the projector wasn't set up. They closed that door to spare us the smell, and in doing so, forced themselves to endure it tenfold.

As he scooted out, I held the door and held my breath, wishing him a good day. I went into the conference room to straighten up.

He only had one sip of that damn coffee."

2waead,1,2015-02-18,"My girlfriend is 180,000 in debt from vet school. Should we gamble and go for the 25-year-all-loans-forgiven rule or try to pay it back as soon as possible.",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2waead/my_girlfriend_is_180000_in_debt_from_vet_school/,"My girlfriend did everything right in life.  She has no college debt, went to vet school in-state, and she even worked while in veterinary school.  She doesn't come from a wealthy background, and she had to borrow from the federal government for all of her loans.  She is now roughly $180,000 in debt.

I was thinking about the best way to try and pay these back, and I'm not sure what it is.  She is currently under the income-based repayment plan, and she is paying $200/month while she does a 1-year internship.  This will go up when she begins to make more money as a full vet (roughly $80k is the average, I think).

The question to me is whether she should pay the minimum and let the rest be forgiven after 25 years, or pay as much as she can now.  Her interest alone (I think the rate is 6.4%) is around $11,500.  With me paying for rent (I come from a wealthier family) and groceries, she could pay a big chunk of that off every year.

I haven't sat down to do the math, but I feel like relying on the government to keep its word for 25 years is big gamble, if it comes out that it is better to go that route.  Plus, I believe the amount forgiven is added to income, and then you pay tax on it.

Just wondering if anyone else has done a similar calculation and what they came up with."

2wajx2,1,2015-02-18,Delayed thank you letter for Interview,highwaytohell66,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2wajx2/delayed_thank_you_letter_for_interview/,"Ok I think I kind of might have messed up here. So last Friday I had my first ever lifetime interview. It was with a local manufacturing company for a software engineering internship. I thought I did pretty well on the interview. The only thing I didn't know was how the computer systems on the Apollo missions worked, but that was more in the context of the conversation rather than a specific question he intended to ask so I think (hope) it won't be held against me. Anyway I digress.

So after reading a lot of posts on here I feel like I messed up in two areas. First, I didn't get the hiring manager's card or contact information. And I also didn't send a thank you not in part because I didn't have his contact info. So at this point would be it be better for me to send the thank you note to the HR rep that I initially talked to, or would sending it now make me look incompetent so should I just let it be and let the process work itself out? Thanks!"
2wakyz,6,2015-02-18,[Advice] 21 M: I keep trying school and Failing. What should I do?,Joshcwiththee,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/2wakyz/advice_21_m_i_keep_trying_school_and_failing_what/,"I have never been great with school, it was always an after thought for me. In high school I did three sports, boy scouts, and interact club, but still did fairly well. I got into the four-year University I wanted which was out of state. Due to my father getting laid off, I made the financial decision for my family to come home after my first year. During my second Semester before I left the University my academics started to fail me. I was more focused on working out consistently and doing stuff with clubs then I was with getting my homework done. The material I was learning in class wasn't hard, I just never put in the time to do my assignments and failed because of it. I am living at home now and am going on my second year of working full-time at a retail store and going to school. I failed all of my classes this past semester because I prioritized my job, working out, and sleep instead of my homework. My classes are going a similar way this semester and I don't know what to do.

I enjoy computers, I built mine and took A+ certification class. I also like my chemistry classes when I study the material. In fact those are the only classes I pass. Everyone I interact with in my life tells me my strongest attribute is my hard work and knowledge of computers or chemistry. I just feel like I cant do anything with that. I have applied to other jobs where I can apply my knowledge and enthusiasm about those subjects but no one will take me because I don't have a college degree at least.

I would love to travel for work and do something dealing with chemistry or computers. I love interacting with people and rather not be stuck in a lab or doing maintenance or troubleshooting. I want to feel like what I'm doing means something to the world. Right now I just want to know whether I should try to continue with college. I should be a Junior but due to transferring schools and failing a couple classes I am a Sophomore. If I shouldn't waste more with college, what should I do? I am still trying to apply to more jobs but nothing is sticking. I am not limiting my options either, I have applied to everything from IT to Chemistry internships to other sales jobs.

tl;dr   I don't do my hw but work really hard at my job and hobbies. Should I keep trying and possibly failing college? How can I get a job in Chemistry or Computers without a degree?"
2wale9,6,2015-02-18,I feel like my parents have continuously manipulated me into choosing my career options!,radicalspacegiant,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/2wale9/i_feel_like_my_parents_have_continuously/,"I am in that phase of life right now,where I am emotionally very sad and feel like a loser. I have never been given my Individual space when it comes to making life choices.They make sure I do exactly what they tell me to,I feel like a puppet with no real feelings or life goals of my own simply because I live on their property and use their money.But I am constantly working,at-least to my knowledge I am giving my best.I am doing my internship and I go into work everyday from 11:30 to 7-8pm,sometimes even till 10 pm. Plus I have my own start-up company that I am focusing on and my professional degree,for which i have to attend classes everyday from 7:30 am till 10 am. I can't take it anymore,I am so stressed,have literally no social life,no friends,no girlfriend.I feel alone,almost miserable,like a zombie.I don't get more than 6 hours sleep,and i am only 20. And to top it all off I have to finish my undergrad as well,which I am not even interested in and career wise its not even going to help me,I just want to talk to someone,you know,anyone. Just share my thoughts and just feel sane for a moment. I think i'll have a nervous breakdown. I want to drop out of college,and just focus on my professional degree and just move out of their fucking home and just be independent. Have control over my life! Sorry for the rant,its just that i have no one to talk to and i feel so alone!"

He is 38, very successful, handsome, yet so kind. His family has known mine for over 20 years now, and are very close friends despite the distance. I hadn't met him until recently (lived in separate countries, and i was a kid when we lived in the same one so i don't remember him). He really likes my parents and respects them a lot, and he helped me get an internship at the company he co runs. We don't talk at work, it is very professional, nothing more then a good morning. But seeing him at work, and how smart, intelligent, and motivated he is has made me fall for him. He is so serious and strict with this employees at work, yet when i got out with him and my family after work sometimes, he is so kind and sweet and gentle.

I can't help but fall for him, yet he's 17 years older. Is that too much of a gap? he might not even be interested in me for that reason"

I absolutely bombed the phone interview, as I was dealing with a death at the time. I did not inform the interviewers of this, but I'm sure it came out that I was a terrible candidate. 

A few weeks ago, I saw the same job posted on a major job site (in a different office location than the first job) and applied, but have not heard anything. The job posting has now been renewed, and also expanded, as I found it on another site which I am 100% sure it was not on before.

My takeaway from this is that they did not have any suitable candidates who applied from the first time the job was posted, myself included.

I have everything they are asking for, and the only conclusion is that my first interview tarnished my reputation.

Twice in the past few years, I have had an email conversation with someone high up in the company (an employee, not someone in HR) where I solicited an internship. Although they were not offering any, I'm thinking of emailing this person and stating that I applied for the position with her firm, and explaining the situation.

Should I do this? Speak with HR directly? What should I say?

There is also one other avenue I am considering. After my dreadful interview, I had an internship with another firm in the same industry. I performed well there, and have references from that firm. This is a niche industry, and its likely that my references are acquainted with the person I emailed about the internship. Should I ask my references to reach out to her, and put in a good word?

I feel like there are a few different ways I could approach this, but need guidance. Thank you very much for your time and expertise."

She will let any coworker do anything he wants to her anyplace and anytime, regardless of age, race, looks, or marital status. She dresses, acts, and talks like a slut.

I happen to be the official office slut where I work. My name is Jennifer and I'm 20 years old, my breasts are a perky 34B with an equally perky ass. Almost every guy in my building has fucked me at least once. I've even let a couple of 19 year old interns make me their property in my car during lunch. Ive always worn short skirts and thigh highs so the men have easy access to my cleanly shaven pussy and tight little asshole. Everyone knows I don't wear panties because of all the peep shows I give the men around the office. All a man has to do is call me into an office or bathroom and bend me over and spread my legs exposing my slutty married wet pussy and ass. 

All while I beg them to fuck me hard as they can and call me a dirty whore then they fill me with thick rope after rope of their portent cum. Almost every day I go home to my husband, cum dripping from both of my fuckholes If only he had any clue what happens when his wife is at work for the day. I want this RP to focus on all of my escapades throughout my average work day. From when I leave for work kissing my oblivious husband good bye, to when I leave the office wiping cum from my lips as I leave through the front door. If you want to add/change anything let me know. I'm always open to new ideas.

I don't know what exactly I'm looking for here, I guess I just need to get it out of my chest.

I live in the USA since 2010, I'm from Mexico. I have a small family, just my dad and mom and my sister, we are 5 yrs apart. I moved here wanting to learn English, since back in Mexico I graduated as an ESL teacher I wanted to learn the language very well. 

So I moved here as an Au Pair (live-in nanny), I met my husband two months after I got here, we got engaged and married within 10 months. This part of my life has been great, my husband is everything any woman would want: handsome, very intelligent and smart, successful career, caring, loving, romantic, cuddly and loves spending time together. He's my best friend. We have two babies, a 1 year old boy and a month old girl. We have a beautiful house, and everything we need to be happy.

It was a big and difficult decision to make. My family and I have always been very close. I miss them terribly. My parents and I see each other once a year for a month or two. I haven't seen my sister in almost 4 years, she's in the military hospital, as a intern. She's bright, competitive and has always been number one in everything she does.

This past Valentine's Day she tried to commit suicide with an overdose of some medicine called fentanyl. She almost died but some friend found her early enough to take her to the hospital.

My parents were here when my daughter was born to help me since I had a C Section, they had been here for a month and they still had a month to go but we got a phone call from my sister's boyfriend and my parents this morning.

My parents are proud of me, they tell me that. My mom broke down yesterday and told me she's happy I'm doing good but sometimes deep inside she feels like if I had stayed, all of our lives would have been so different, we'd be happier.

My sister moved for school to a different state in Mexico, so my parents ended up alone. Its been hard for them, and after my babies were born it was even harder to realize they'll only get to see their grandkids grow up through a computer screen.

My parents, my sister and myself have been feeling incomplete and alone. My mom is a Cancer survivor, she lost her parents and siblings to cancer so we are all she's got. My dad is also the last one. 


My decision changed our lives. I can't go back. I don't want to regret anything because I love my husband and adore my babies but always in the back of my mind I feel guilty for putting distance between my family.

My parents are getting old and I'm missing out, I understand someday they'll go and I'm terrified because I'm not enjoying their company anymore. And my sister needs family right now and I can't be there.

It hurts me so much seeing my parents cry last night, they feel like they failed her and I feel like I failed them. 

My parents will never live here, too expensive and not enough money. I can't support them either. My solution would either be rich so I could get a bigger house for them to live and pay their medical insurance and bring my sister so she can finish school here or go back. I can't do either.

This is impossible. 

After I said goodbye to my parents this morning, and watched them go, I realized I lost my family that moment I decided I would move away.


   
**tl;dr**: It's hard to be away from home."

2wcflk,2,2015-02-18,Advice on returning to a previous employer (warning this may be triggering for some),AnnaBreit,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/2wcflk/advice_on_returning_to_a_previous_employer/,"Hi all. I need your advice. In 2012 I moved to Madison, WI for two reasons 1) To live with a man I was dating at the time who had a cushy job there and 2) To find employment in the local foods/food systems planning community. The man and I are no longer together for various reasons and while I created a great network of those involved in food issues in Madison, I never found employment in the field. While in town I took a job at an agency serving those on TANF that had recently received a grant to expand their program from 10 counties to 80 counties in less than four months. Needless to say this transition was very chaotic for everyone involved and as an administrative position I was expected to teach those who knew nothing about the program how to run it while not knowing anything myself (I'm from Ohio, not Wisconsin so I didn't even know the history or politics behind the program). Everyone on my team was new and I was the youngest person there. Suddenly I was supposed to be a leader without knowing what the hell I was doing. 

While the job itself was chaotic, I felt bullied by my boss and indirect coworkers all while undergoing an unraveling relationship at home in a city where I knew no one. I had taken the job because I needed money and the salary was decent (by social worker standards at least). It had absolutely nothing to do with food work, one of the reasons I came to the city in the first place. Being right out of graduate school with little professional experience (other than internships) I was consistently scared of screwing up and doing something wrong so I went to my boss for everything and copied her on every email I sent. While I was being yelled at for doing things I thought I should be doing (and also to keep myself busy during downtimes) my direct coworkers (one of whom was extremely supportive) received consistent praise for their work. This combined with the stress at home, made me extremely depressed and I stopped caring about things like my personal appearance and hygine. The straw was when I asked my boss to provide any feedback she received and she sent me a nasty email about how coworkers were saying I smelled, looked like a slob, and had bad breath (yes the really told my supervisor that). In the midst of all of this I had identified that I wanted to try for a job with less responsibility and a lower salary and had one of the worst interviews for my life. Needless to say I did not get the other position and left the management position soon after the email went out. 

In the two years since leaving this company I have remained in contact with some of those I met in the food community while I lived in Madison, including a professor at UW. Also, I recently learned that the agency I worked for has several openings and recently obtained to a new grant focused on the Food Stamps Employment and Training Program. Also through linkedin searches and the facebook ""people you may know"" function I learned that several of those who caused me problems are now gone, including my former supervisor. 

When I left, I left on good terms and if I remember correctly may have complained about the rollout, but no one in particular. A call to HR confirmed that I am ""definitely eligible for rehire"" and ""encouraged me to apply"". I also have been in recent contact with my professor friend at UW about potential PHD funding, but will not be eligible for admission until 8/2016, so I need something to do till then, if I get in. 

The question becomes this. Does this community think I should apply for the jobs in the FSET program considering they pay well, have upward mobility, and have pretty awesome benefits (things that don't happen in the nonprofit world) and also would allow me to establish Wisconsin residency for graduate school. I am just concerned that the experiences of the past will come to bite me in the ass.

Age: 21

Sex: male

Height: 5’8”

Weight: 125 pounds

Race: Caucasian

Duration: ongoing since early 2013

USA

Location: on ulnar side of both wrist. More severe in right wrist. Center of pain feels right below ECU and behind ulnar head. (See marked photos)

http://imgur.com/a/qv4eX

Current occupation: Student

Intended profession: Programming (I absolutely love it)

Timeline:

* Late 2011: Christmas break. First recollection of wrist pain was working on laptop synthesizing and manually clicking notes into finale music program. Pain lasted 2 weeks then disappeared.
* Early 2012: Some very light and easily ignorable pain likely from playing too much piano (FCU pain). Maybe improper technique. Pain lasted two weeks then disappeared again.
* Early 2013: Some slight pain from mouse usage completing computer projects requiring lots of clicking.
* Spring 2013: Looked into getting a new keyboard and trackball to solve wrist problems.
* Summer 2013: Nearing the end of an eight-week internship, pain came back in the outside of my right wrist (FCU again). Dr. suggested wrist brace and if symptoms did not improve, to start physical therapy. Wrist brace did not help.
* December 2013: Started 8 to 12 weeks of physical therapy for my right wrist only. Focus on ECU and FCU tendons.
* Early 2014: Writing notes to lecture hall causes severe pain. Unable to do a lot of tasks now. Using bio freeze for temporary relief. Wearing braces more often during class. Unable to write notes during lectures.
* June 2014: X-rays taken and MRI focusing on TFCC and wrist area of both wrists. According to wrist surgeon, nothing could be surgically corrected in his opinion.
* Late 2014: Sought second opinion from another doctor. Agreed that the structure of my wrists were fine and surgery was not an immediate option with nothing physically wrong on X-ray/MRI results. Tried cortisone injections on the right wrist first. First location tried was inside the wrist joint, then six weeks later the FCU, and six weeks later again the ECU. FCU pain seems to have gone down, or at least now masked by ECU pain.
* Early 2015: Attempting to use Flector patches on my wrists in the event there is inflammation that we can’t remove from previous attempts. Wrist pain still exists.

Lifestyle changes and attempts to fix wrists

* (Summer) physical therapy with a hand specialist.
* (Summer) lots of running and exercise
* (Summer) Tested negative for rheumatoid arthritis.
* (Late summer) Vicodin (did not respond well at all. Nausea)
* (November) Cortisone injections in the FCU, ECU and, wrist joint. Each injection six weeks apart.

* Entire duration:
* Refraining from typing for extended periods and relying on dictation software or other people to help type.
* Trigger point massages on self.
* Friction massages on self.
* Lots of stretching


I’ve been suffering for wrist pain on the ulnar side of both wrists for over two years now. The right wrist is far worse. I’ve seen one family physician, one wrist surgeon, one chiropractor especially in wrists, sports physical therapist, physical therapist specializing in wrists. I’ve had a (series of) MRI with contrast dye in both wrists and 3-4 x-rays. It has affected my life to the point where I can no longer write without pain, drive a manual transmission vehicle, type without pain, or leave my arms and wrists at rest without pain. I can physically find the location of pain when I push on it with my fingernail. There’s a dull burning sensation what I would describe as underneath my ECU and behind the ulnar head. See photos of marker. The discoloration is partially due from my fingernail trying to relieve pain. The pain is more often there than not and on a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate ranging between a 3 and a 7. Each doctor has been confused as the last and I no longer understand what my options are. I do not recall any immediate injury that could have caused this.

I have severely limited time that I spend on the computer and write barely anything with my hand. I’ve tried 4 styles of wrist braces listed above. After a few weeks my arms began to reject them and my forearms would become painful.

The times when my wrists felt the best in the past two years were slightly during the first two rounds of prednisone, slightly with the Flector patches, and completely for the first day or two after each cortisone injection (the best one was when it was injected in the ECU). However, multiple cortisone injections in tendons have been shown to weaken them.

It has been described to me that it is unlikely my insurance will cover an arthroscope due to the nature that the MRIs and x-rays came up clean.

Every doctor and therapist keep telling me none of this should be happening and I’m too young to have any of these problems. I’m having these problems and I don’t know where to turn next.

I apologize if something is not clear or not properly described. I’ve been dealing with this for such a long time that I can’t even remember everything anymore.

The closest thing that I have to a diagnosis after all this time is the doctors labeling this as tendinitis (and specifically not tendonosis).

Is there anyone that could please help? The doctors I have seen (and are currently seeing) have not been able to pinpoint the problem and solution. I don’t know how to fix this anymore. I don’t know what to do next. I feel like I’m out of options as the Flector patches with the last idea we could think of. Is there something that I can bring up with my doctor when I see him next month as an idea? Should I try some kind of larger better fitting splint?

2wcnnq,7,2015-02-18,New DBA on the block.,AlwaysTheeVillian,Database,https://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/2wcnnq/new_dba_on_the_block/,"Hello Redditors,

I am 25 and about to finish up a degree in MIS (in May). I have had a call center tech support job for 6 years followed by a QA internship. The internship is over and being a DBA has really caught my eye.

I am looking into certifications, but as a very broke college student shelling out a couple thousand for training classes, pretests, and the test (per certification) is not really an option for me. I am wondering if there are any free or really cheap certifications or anything else that would put me a bit higher in the running for a BDA job. Sadly my Database professor had checked out of his job some years before I took it, but I loved working with the information in a logical way and learned most of what I know from fellow students in a DB type job or from sites like w3schools.

any suggestions would be VERY appreciated.
Thank you.

EDIT: Thank you to all who are responding. BTW PLEASE DO NOT post saying I am not going to get this. I am already a nervous reck so no matter how well you mean it. When someone asks for advice to help them, telling them that they are all but boned already is not help."

My husband and I live in a different state right now and are going to school. I'm also pregnant. My husband has an internship in our home state and I will be having my baby there. 

Originally, we were going to move into a property his dad owns and pay them rent while there. However, we were talking and realized that we would be asking them to boot out the people who are there just to live there for 6 months during the internship before we move back to finish school. They would be stuck finding someone else to take over the lease after that when we come back for good 4 months later anyway. 

We didn't feel comfortable doing that, because it's really hard to find people to rent for such short amounts of time. His parents suggested a few different apartments close by that they know of in our price range and also offered for us to live in their home to save money if we would like. 

The way the house is laid out, they would pretty much just give us half of the house (1 bedroom, a living space, bathroom) and access to the kitchen, etc. They're empty nesters, so this wouldn't be too big of a deal since the space they are usually in is on the other side of the house.

We have the money to pay rent, but it would be really nice to save that 600 dollars every month for savings, college fund for baby, finishing school, etc. My husband and I both agreed that we would take them up on that offer. 

Now that we've told them, he keeps telling me what a failure he feels like because none of his other brothers and sisters ever moved back in with his parents after they were married (He's number 6 of 8). I should mention his internship is with his dad's company which he will eventually run one day. I feel like being close to his parents will be good since he's working so closely with the company. 

Is there anything I can say to him that would make him feel better? It's too late to find somewhere to live with that short of a lease because we are moving next month.


   
tl;dr: We are moving in with my husband's parents and he feels like he is a failure because of it. What can I do? "
2wcvtq,1,2015-02-18,[M4F] A mockery,lookbehindyou7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2wcvtq/m4f_a_mockery/,"""This is not going to go well"" he thought as he sighed and pulled on his little blue speedo. It had been 10 months since Jack finished college and despite multiple internships and high grades he hadn't been able to land one job. Maybe it was that he wasn't the best interviewee? He often got nervous talking to people, particularly those with authority, and no matter how many times he practiced typical responses in the mirror, or dreamt up ""witty"" replies, he always stumbled when it came down to it. 

His parents had given him notice no more searching for office jobs, he needed something and he needed it now or he would have to hope that his friends were charitable and had open couches. So over the past week he had scoured his beachside home city looking for work. He had applied to multiple restaurants including the little taco shack down on Sepulveda that had so many health code violations over the years the owner must have been giving gold bullion to any inspectors that came around. He hit up a few car dealerships even though he knew that he couldn't bring himself to be greasy enough to pull of that job even if he did have the people skills, a vacant janitorial position at his old middle school, a variety of retail shops, and the Post Office even though it seem liked USPS was jettisoning employees rather than hiring them. 

Last Saturday a friend texted him with a tip saying The Lexington, a hotel in the area was hiring for some pool related position. Jack, was intrigued, getting paid to hang out by a pool seemed like a dream position, and it was March so he'd have months of work before tourist season ended! He hopped in his old hand me down Corolla, and sped to the hotel, hoping that making an inquiry in person would be more impressive than a call or an e-mail from some faceless person.

He found out there was indeed a position available, and the hiring manager was willing to hire him on the spot. To his slight chagrin he wasn't going to be able to just lounge around all day behind an outside desk, or occasionally clean the pools. His job would consist of routine pool sanitation, and keeping the pool area neat and tidy, but his main occupation was as the bar waiter and go-for for the hotel guests at the pool. Any reasonable request he could carry out he was to obey. Overall, Jack was just happy to be employed, that was until he saw the uniform.

Jack had an embarrassing secret, he let his friends he trusted know, and they assured him that he was just blowing the issue out of proportion. He wanted to find comfort in these words, but there wasn't any there to relieve the anxiety that had caused him to torpedo a number of chances he had had with attractive women in college. Jack's penis was smaller than average, and the knowledge plagued him daily. 

Now, here he was on his first day about to go out, and expose the secret he had tried to keep to the few women unfortunate enough to sleep with him and his friends. ""Well, at least they're just tourists, and you'll probably never see them again"" as he pushed open the door of the poolhouse employee bathroom and walked outside.

--------------------------------------------------

**What Happens Next?**

I'm open to varying scenarios, I'm looking for penis humiliation, it can actually be tiny, it can actually be average sized and I'm so far inside my head that reality is irrelevant. Perhaps the pool area is pretty empty and there is a young bratty woman or an older demanding woman who is never satisfied with service or a group of either. Maybe the woman/en first find Jack appealing and tease him to see if he'll become aroused, and then when he does they are are disappointed, or just want to break him down and the laughter, mind fuck, and toying begins. If you are not into SPH, I'm perfectly happy with just regular humiliation or just domination.

Another possible scenario is Jack is packing up the pool area, as it has closed, and finds some bikini bottoms left behind for some odd reason and decides to keep them or sniffs them and is caught and called out by the owner.

***Kinks***: Femdom, humiliation (not to an extreme), facesitting, body worship, teasing, edging, denial (to a point), handjobs, jerk instruction, anal (giving), non-con (both ways), women that love cum, panty sniffing/licking.

***Not into***: Incest, scat, blood, no minors  

***Other Stuff***: I'd like some build up, and know that sometimes I can take ten or so minutes to respond as I like to take my time in coming up with a response. I can be a switch and be dominant if you'd like, I kind of like rough sex, choking, and humiliation. If there is something you are into that I didn't mention ask, I like to think I'm open minded.

I'm a first year ME.  I only pulled a 2.3 GPA first semester (albeit I did have brain damage from a crash) and had to retake Calc I second semester.  

I'm currently taking only 13 hours, but I'm only passing two classes.  I've never made even a B on a math or science class test at Tech.  I'm failing CS1371 and MSE 2001.  I spend 10+ hours a week on CS1371, most of them in tutoring, but I horribly failed the first test and can't even do the homework without help.  Most inexcusable is MSE2001; I've heard it's an easy A.  It's strict memorization, but I got a 40 on the first test.

High school was medium difficulty for me, but I graduated with a 4.2 and was in the IB program.  I knew my grades would drop entering Tech as math and science were my weakest classes, but I didn't expect to be struggling to make C's.  I'm surrounded by people making As and Bs on all their tests, and my GPA isn't going to get me any internships or co-ops.

Do I not know how to learn or is something fundamentally wrong?  Every day I question why I'm here.  I love this place, but every day is more discouraging."
2wcz8d,4,2015-02-18,What Do I Have to Do to See a Psychiatrist?,Misterydwn,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/2wcz8d/what_do_i_have_to_do_to_see_a_psychiatrist/,"I was first diagnosed with a Depression 15 years ago. I am still waiting to see a psychiatrist for longer than two consecutive visits. In my brief encounters with a doctor, I have been diagnosed BiPolar, Borderline Personality Disorder, PTSD and ADHD. It's safe to say that my mental health gravely effects every aspect of my life.

I have dropped out of college about 9 times. I only have a year left for my bachelor's in accounting, however; I have run out of federal financial aid due to all the drop outs. I have had and lost over 50 jobs in the last 15 years. I have also moved around 60 times in the last 15 years. I am COMPLETELY unstable. I do not have custody of my daughter. I am often rude to people, simply because I am so f'ed up, I can't help it.
I desperately need to see a professional. 

So what's getting in the way? Let me tell you, a lot! Prior to Obamacare and my daughter, I did not qualify for medicaid. This means I had to keep a good job with health insurance long enough to get the insurance, usually 90 days. After finally obtaining the insurance, I then had to arrange for appointments, which usually require missing work. If missing work wasn't an obstacle, then I had to wait. First comes the intake appointment. Then comes the mandatory counseling sessions, often with interns. Then I waited for the psychiatrist's office to call, which takes weeks. Then the psychiatrist is booked out for months. By this time, I have had an episode, lost my job, ruined everything going good in my life and sunk down into the horrible abyss of depression. This has resulted in twice attempting suicide.

After my daughter was born, I qualified for Medicaid, as I do now. The problem with this situation is: EVERYONE qualifies for medicaid it seems. Plus, again, there are intake appointments - where they ask me horrible questions about my plethora of traumas. During one such visits, I was instructed not to cry over a dozen times because she knew she was asking awful questions. I did not cry, but at the end she refused to see me again because I had admitted I smoke marijuana.

After moving back to my parents, I am once again searching for a doctor. Hopefully not a family physician, but a psychiatrist. This doesn't seem to be in my cards though. Every private psychiatrist in my county and the surrounding counties does not accept medicaid. There are counseling centers who do, however; there are only two and I have not been able to stay in one place long enough to actually see the psychiatrist. I have all my meds prescribed through medical doctors. I am basically self-prescribing. I go into the appointment, tell them what I have been prescribed in the past and which I think will work. That's what I am then prescribed. RIDICULOUS. How do I know what medications I should and should not be taking? Especially since I am now on three different anti-depressants, two of which are at the maximum dose.

I just finally got through to a promising counseling center. Guess what? They are not located anywhere near me and were accidentally on the list.

I have no other options. I have no hope of ever receiving proper treatment. I am just going to continue trying to deal with everything, while probably being rude in public to innocent people. I hate that about me, which leads to a lot of suicidal thoughts. There are cruel people who will tell suicidal people to just do it. It's more complicated. I am jealous of the chic in Oregon with brain cancer that got to end her life with a simple medication. She went to sleep with those that love her present, and just drift off to sleep. She was suffering from a terminal illness that was horrific.

So am I."

I am a sophomore from a ""target"" school studying physics, and this summer I decided that I wanted to work in finance.  I applied, interviewed a few times, and got a sophomore internship, but I have no friends/connections in Wall Street and I don't know what to do.

Also, if it helps, my internship is in Sales and Trading, not IB.

I knew more than enough to scrape through an interview because I studied the markets and read FT, and I have a general knowledge of macroeconomics.  Some of it is still fuzzy to me, though, and I've NEVER taken a finance or economics class.  What do I need to study?

What are the expectations for me once I arrive?  I don't even know exactly what I'll be doing.  All I know is it's a big bank and it's S&amp;T.

Also, I'm a physics student, which I think was one of the main reasons they liked me, but that also means I'm a little awkward.  Any tips on how to talk to more senior people there?  Is it weird to propose going to lunch?

Thanks for all the help.  I welcome all advice.  I want this summer to be successful, but I have no knowledge of what's to come.  Please give me any advice you have!

2wd1vi,2,2015-02-18,Seeking advice on telling my mother I want to drop out of college [21F &amp; 50sF],[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2wd1vi/seeking_advice_on_telling_my_mother_i_want_to/,"I don't know if it's relevant, but I live in Europe.  I finished school at 17 and went to study Engineering at university 3 hours away from home.  I didn't know what I wanted to work in when I finished school, but chose Engineering because I enjoyed maths and being creative.  I had career guidance sessions but my grades were good in everything so even the guidance counsellors couldn't really help me narrow it down.  Engineering a 4-year degree but I had to repeat a year on medical grounds (I missed half a year because I was badly ill), which places me in 3rd year currently.  

The way my course is structured, we do a mix of different engineering types for the first 2 years (civil, mech, computer, electrical, etc) and then specialise in one area.  I've had a bit of a rough college experience for a few reasons.  In my first year I had very bad depression that I wasn't getting help for.  At the start of my second year I had a lot of problems with illness (this is when I missed half of the year), and when I recovered from the worst of it I still suffered from severe fatigue for a year and a half.  I started 3rd year in September, and it feels like the first real experience I'm having of university without medical problems getting in the way.  I didn't particularly enjoy the first two years of my degree, but I thought once I got to specialise I'd be fine.  Unfortunately that's not what's happened and I've realised I don't want to pursue a career in this area at all.  I've had 3 internships all in this area and didn't particularly enjoy any of them, I even had to quit one of them as the stress of the job made me sick.

I've thought a lot about what to do, and I've come to the conclusion that I want to pursue a career in some sort of therapy - probably either occupational therapy or as a counselling therapist (I don't actually know what that specific job is widely known as, we just call them counsellors).  My mother has funded my college education so far, and I realise how much she's invested into this.  I really don't want to seem ungrateful or to come across like I've just thrown her money away, but I've struggled so much with motivation that I don't think completing the Engineering degree is a viable option - particularly since I've missed too much coursework this year to pass.  

I'm visiting home next week, and I want to have a discussion with her in person about my future.  I've been researching the necessary education I'd need to make it to where I want to be, as well as how to finance it (I've drawn up a budget of estimated costs and looked into various loan plans), and I want to present this to her as something I am serious about.

I've never done anything like this before and I'm really afraid that she'll end up seeing me as a disappointment.  I'd really appreciate any advice anyone can give me about this.
   
**tl;dr**: I want to drop out of my current course to pursue an entirely different career path, and I need advice about how to discuss this with my mother, who's been financing my study thus far."

I am a 24yo French currently living in London. 
I am currently trying to find a job in retail or as a waiter to get some money, and eventually find a job in IT as a software developer or tech support. 
I just discovered what an apprenticeship is in the UK, and have been looking at different ones on websites such as jobsite, etc.
I thought it would be great to do one, because if I have to work for, say, £200pw, why not do it as an apprentice in my field rather than a job won't really like?
I have, however, different questions:

* can I do an apprenticeship if I'm 24?
* and if I am French?
* if so, I already have some ""experience"" as a software developer (3 internships and the equivalent of an HND in electrical and computer engineering in France), is it still worth it? Will I learn new stuff? (because I saw some apprenticeships where you could have ""no previous experience in programming"")

- overall, would you think it would be a good idea?

Thank you very much for your help guys, sorry if it looks like I didn't look it up on the internet, but I did, and since it was quite confusing I figured it might be a good idea to ask here ahahah. And sorry for if I made some mistakes, I'm not a native speaker :/"

Right now I need to make a very important decision regarding applying for college that will have a big impact on my goals.

I dropped out of high school in 12th grade due to serious health problems I experienced all through high school (undiagnosed gastrointestinal disease that was extremely painful and made high school hell). About 6 months ago I achieved full remission and can finally attend college and accomplish career goals. Despite having a difficult time in high school my a-g high school GPA is 3.68, I have a 2120 on my SAT, volunteer work with Habitat for Humanity, and am about to begin an unpaid internship with a local wealth management company as an analyst.

I have decided on Berkeley as my college because it is a great pipeline for west coast banking and Wall Street, which is where I want to work. The problem is due to my illness in high school I did not complete all of the a-g courses required for admission into the UC system. This is the only requirement I can't satisfy. I called the counselors office and they told me to explain in my essay the reason for this as best I can and hope for admission. If I apply in November and am admitted, I would start Fall 2016.

Another option would be for me to attend Santa Monica College which is the #1 transfer school to the UC system. As a junior college student, my requirements for a UC Berkeley transfer will be different and they will judge my academic performance at Santa Monica College instead of high school, so my chances of getting accepted are much higher. 

If I decided to attend Santa Monica junior college first and then transferred to UC Berkeley how badly would this hurt my chances of scoring good internships and upon graduation, getting a good analyst job at a Wall Street bulge bracket? Is this route even worth taking? Either way I'm going to be taking the Level 1 CFA in my junior year. I'm just worried I'll be looked down on by internship recruiters and will have trouble getting a job at a top IB out of college.

Any advice/guidance is greatly appreciated.

I'm joining the team I interned in, so I happen to know a lot about the people I'll be working with. I have a slight flexibility of choice between two sub-teams within my team. 

Team 1 - Aligns more to my interests (Data platform team)   
Team 2 - Aligns a fair bit to my interests (Web platform team)

I'm leaning towards Team 1 because my intern projects were in the same area. Here's the complication. The resident 'Data/BI expert' in the team is shit. Honestly it's a surprise how he's even surviving in this company. He plays his cards well, keeps the management happy, does a bit of work, piggybacks onto others and keeps collecting paycheques. I don't mean to boast, but me as an almost-graduated SDE know more about his job than he does (He's 27) (It is also possible that this is my inexperience speaking and there are a lot of such people around in every job). Every SDE who has worked with him is aware of the fact that he's not an engineer who can get things done.

Anyway, this person and I get along well; but I loathe the fact that I ended up picking up a lot of his slack (even as an intern). And I'm not sure if it's smart decision to put myself in the same situation again. But he is actually a good friend, I would hate to formally complain about him.

So a couple of questions:

1. Should I make a career-based decision and go with Team 1?  Team 1 is working on a few interesting data platform backends (I'm not sure about the exact technical term), a sub-field surely increasing in demand.

2. Or should I make a safer choice and go with Team 2, which still does very interesting work, I should add. This means no need to work with the above mentioned person, which of course means a smoother, less stressful experience.

What do you think reddit? Go with the heart or with the brain? Should I just learn to deal with such people or reduce risk and reduce the possibility of having an additional factor behind the already inevitable poor work-life situation?"

2wdimb,0,2015-02-18,Offer requires action before I hear back from 2 other companies,nocluewhatishoulddo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2wdimb/offer_requires_action_before_i_hear_back_from_2/,"Throwaway just because there will be some sensitive information.

I could really use some advice because I'm really not sure what the consequences would be for the choice I have to make very soon. I have an offer from (let's call them) company #1 that's a bit lower than my university's average starting salary for my major. This isn't a huge deal to me because I switched my major from engineering, and I wasn't able to get internship experience in computer science (had 3 semesters experience in old major). Now, this offer requires action by the 23rd of February, but I just finished up 2 final round interviews today. One of these  2 companies I just finished interviewing with is my preferred choice. The 2 companies I finished interviewing with will likely not have a decision by the 23rd, and I tried to get an extension on my current offer from company #1 but was not able to secure one. So that is my dilemma. 

My choices are:

1. Accept offer and go to work for company #1 likely taking reduced pay

2. Accept offer from company #1 to secure a job then turn them down if I get my preferred choice (is this acceptable? am I legally bound in any way?)

3. Turn down company #1, possibly not receive any offers and be SOL

Now I realize I would not be completely screwed if the choice 3 route happens, but I have completed 10+ interviews from this round of job applications (through university career fair) which is a considerable amount of effort. I would very much like to secure a job right now, so I can focus on school work and graduation once again. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. No one has any clue what I should do and neither do I."

I'm using an alternative account to post this because in honesty, I'm pretty embarrassed by my job status. Regardless though I'm mainly a lurker on reddit so forgive me if I do something naive. 
Allow me to introduce myself. I am ForHire1234, a recent(?) college graduate out of work and in debt (shocker). I say recent with apprehension, as I graduated nearly 1 year ago (May '14). 
I'm going to do my background in bullets so it's easier for everyone.

- Went to local (county) college for 4 years.

- Worked at military base as a civilian student-hire. I extended my stay at local college (double majored) so I could continue working here and raising money for university. 

- Raised over $10k in savings after working a year on military base, was let go because they cut funding for the program. 

- Graduated my local college debt free, with 2 AA's: Communications and Journalism.

- Transferred to state University, and lived on campus (for 2 years) Majored in Public Relations and Advertising. Not thrilled about this choice. 

- Accrued nearly $50k of debt between federal and private loans. High interest rates and bad financial choices is why this number is so high. 	

- Got involved in campus, PRSSA, student run firms, committees, good with professors and made lots of friends and connections, went to conferences. 

- Graduated May 2014 Cum Laude, no job lined up, rather internship lined up instead.

- Started post-grad (unpaid) internship for a local non-profit in 2 different departments. They pay me allowance per day. I was also given a small part time (1 day/week) position where I am paid hourly.

- Almost 10 months post grad, 25-year-old me is still interning (5 days a week)

Unfortunately, while I loved it in college and was seemingly great at it, I'm not a fan of PR and don't want to focus on it for my career. Instead, I'm trying to hone in on the skills I've learned from taking leadership positions along with my current interning experience. I don't mind communications-based fields but I'm not a fan of the PR culture as a whole, if that makes sense. I've been trying to get into state government entry-level jobs but am not getting any bites so far. A lot of these are analyst titles, so I am not sure if my PR degree is holding me back from that. None of them require experience.

I don't mind my internship per se, but after 10 months and half way to 30 it's a bit degrading. I've learned a little bit, but it's mostly menial work. I really want to start using the skills I've learned for an actual career!

I'm also afraid my federal experience is going to be too old to talk about pretty soon. I was laid off from that job about 4 years ago due to no fault of my own (everyone in the same position was laid off) Also, when I fill out applications I have no supervisor to record as they've either retired or moved around in rank (Air Force Reservists).

I’m pretty lost and getting a bit anxious as to what to do. I'm not trusting of job boards as I and friends have been scammed and many of those postings are dodgy at best.
A few plans I am thinking of or working towards:
- Contact my college and university for some help (but I'm not confident there)
 
- Participating in job fairs – there is one in my area in June. 

- Continue looking online – I mainly look for state government jobs online since this is the only way I could apply. Other jobs in the private sector I assume are either scams, or my resume is going into an even bigger bottomless pit than my public sector applications.

- Considering going back to local college for a certification in accounting

I’m really anxious lately and could use some advice based on my situation. I didn’t make the best choices, especially financially but I am trying to look toward various means to find work. Networking has also been a bit difficult as of late, because most of my college friends are also struggling and my non-college friends could only get me into retail. FWIW, my internship allowance probably pays the same as retail and I’m getting better experience, so I wouldn’t want to go that route.
I want to change up my career plans and not focus solely on PR, but also look into administrative work, clerical, analyst jobs, handling memberships/records for organizations. Anything office related really (that I am qualified for of course) Any tips, suggestions welcome. I could use the advice! 



Thanks r/jobs!

I am a mathematics masters student at a small liberal arts college.  I am looking for summer work, either as an intern, or as a research assistant, really anything that is in the field of mathematics, computer science, statistics, etc.  I just want experience before I prepare for the REAL job search next year.
  
The problem is that my university is in a very rural location, and there is not a lot of call for my type of skills.  However, just about 45 minutes away from where I live is one of the largest research universities in the USA.
  
I was thinking about trying to contact some folks over there to see if I could get some summer work assisting in research, or doing computer programming, anything really.  Would it be appropriate for me to do so, as a student of another college?  And if so, who should I contact?  Department heads?  Secretary?  I just want to do this the right way.
  
Thanks for your input.
  
edit: I forgot to mention that the reason I can't go running off to some big city for my internship is because I have a wife and two kids, and I'm not willing to leave them for 12 weeks."
2we0kp,8,2015-02-18,TIFU by buying a car from Craigslist,Sealioness2010,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2we0kp/tifu_by_buying_a_car_from_craigslist/,"Four weeks ago I bought a car from a guy on craigslist.  He seemed like a normal guy, just selling a normal car.  It was a 2005 Honda Civic. Nothing exciting.  I took it to a mechanic and they had it checked out - there was a small list of things I had to replace from wear and tear, but nothing outrageous.  It was listed for $5000, but I got him to accept $3800.  Feeling pretty proud of myself, and happy to FINALLY have a car again, I got in it and commenced the 2.5 hour ride back home.  

As I was driving through city traffic - it was stop and go - my new car started making this terrible noise.  Or at least, that's when I noticed it (thinking back, I don't recall hearing the noise when I test drove it around the block a couple times, and when I drove it to the mechanic's shop.  I guess the mechanic didn't hear it either when he drove it up onto the platform in his shop.)  It's a standard, and as those of you know driving a standard in heavy, stop and go traffic on the highway is not fun.  I thought, well maybe the noise will go away after a while.  Maybe it's just because the car hasn't been driven in a while (which it hadn't).  Needless to say the noise did not go away.

When I got home, I had my mechanic friend take a listen to it.  ""Yup, that sounds like the transmission.""  Perfect.  My new car, and now I have to take it to the transmission shop.  So I did... on Tuesday... January 20th... I still don't have my car back, and it's February 18th.

Here's what happened: the transmission guys took a week to take apart my transmission.  They found a bearing that was bad and the spring on my clutch that needed to be replaced, but the mechanics weren't satisfied because neither of those things should have been making that particular noise.  They had every transmission mechanic in town look at the transmission to find any other possible things that could be wrong with it. But no one found anything. So they just decided to replace the bearing and spring thing and put my transmission back together.  

It still made the noise.  So my mechanic friend's boss (who is super knowledgeable about cars and such) took it for a drove and decided it might be something in the engine.  So I paid the transmission guys and my mechanic friend took it to their shop where they proceeded to take apart the engine.  They found flecks of metal dusk in the oil (which is apparently never a good sign) and took apart the engine.  They found some wear in a place where there's not supposed to be wear (apparently this wear was caused by the aforementioned bad bearing in the transmission).  They told me they could either rebuild the engine, or just put a whole new one it.  They went with the new engine, which has 25,000 less miles on it... but costed a pretty penny.

The new engine was finally put in and everything was put back together last week on Wednesday.  But... the noise was still there.  So the mechanic (who had recommended the transmission guys I went to in the first place) took the transmission back to the transmission guys and said ""what the heck!??"" (and probably some other colorful terms I will not repeat). They took the transmission apart again.  Went over everything again with a fine tooth comb.  Balanced, weighed, inspected every little gear.  Nothing... except that same bearing they replaced the first time. It was bad again. Sooo something in the transmission was causing that bearing to go bad (even in only 20 miles of driving with the new bearing).  The transmission guys offered to rebuild my transmission - but that might not fix the problem, since they don't even know what the problem is!! So my mechanic friend's boss decided to just buy a new (used) transmission and just stick that in the car.  That's what I learned this morning.  The transmission should be in on Friday, and hopefully I'll get my car back by this weekend!!

But that's not all.  This whole time... I've been driving a rental car.  And I'm pretty sure it's going to come out to around $1500.  The transmission guys charged my $1000 (they cut off some of the price, since they didn't actually fix it the first time). And I'm pretty sure the mechanic shop will be around $2000 (they're also giving me a break, because they're nice and this is just a sucky situation).  Aaaand - I literally moved 150 miles away when all of this started for this new UNPAID internship I'm now doing.  So I have no reliable income, and this car will have cost me over $8000 when all this is said and done... I could have bought something much nicer than an '05 Civic for $8000!!!  On the bright side though, I'll have probably the best and most valuable 2005 Honda Civic in town.

TL;DR I bought a car on Craigslist.  It needed a new engine and transmission. Now I'm broke."

Very long text.",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2wenrk/need_to_let_this_out_my_girlfriend_of_5_years/,"My girlfriend broke up with me on the 20th of last month. It was a slap in the face because although we have had a lot of rough times, I thought everything was going okay. I have been seeing a therapist for a couple of months and was on the way to bettering myself both for me and our relationship. We both suffer from depression, which can make for a volatile environment. However, we loved each other a lot. Or so I thought. 

After I exploded at her in anger a couple of times when I would see her at home, we sat down and had a talk and I tried to be as civil as possible. At first she said she still loves me and wanted to continue our relationship, but we needed to work on ourselves individually. I don't know why, but I couldn't comprehend this. I just wanted to be with her and work on things together. 

Well, I was trying my best and things were going okay, but I was getting impatient. I just wanted her so badly. She said she wanted to try being friends and good roommates for now. We live in a two bedroom apartment together. One room was an office, but she moved all of her stuff into there. We went out for drinks and I tried to talk to her again. I wasn't happy with how the conversation was going, so I left. When I got home, I kicked and punched the couch and kicked a hole in a shelf that is hers. I wasn't thinking. I was just so angry and hurt. I texted her to let her know because I felt like a huge idiot for doing it and wanted to own up to it. I told her I would replace it. She came home and told me to pack a bag and leave or she was going to call the cops. She said I blew my chance of getting back with her. 

I left and went to my mom's for about 6 days. I came back and talked to her again. I felt okay after, I don't know why. I was even calm for most of the conversation. But yesterday was bad. We went out to dinner and it was fine. Then on the walk home, I started to get angry again. I started saying shit I shouldn't have said. She went into her room for the night. I went in to see if my dog was in the room and she asked if I had been crying. I said yes. I started begging her to work things out. She said she didn't feel the same way I did anymore, even though she said differently a few weeks ago. I started to yell. 

For the first time in our relationship, she yelled back. I was scared. I was convinced the cops would show up. I tried to stop her. She slammed the door. I stood outside and apologized over and over. She finally opened the door and said that's it. It's over. There's no chance of getting back together. She said I ruined her life and made her feel like shit.  She said I never listened to her and she never did anything for herself because she always put me first.

I'm so torn apart. I feel like an idiot for blowing it. I feel stupid for not getting help sooner. She tried to get me to get help. I just love her so much and wanted to do everything with her. We used to talk about our future together. She is graduating this semester and going to Chicago for an internship. I speculated that she wanted to break up because she was too overwhelmed about graduating and moving. 

I just feel so awful. I can't stop crying. It's hard to wake up to an empty bed after 4 years of living together. I'm so lost. "

2wers7,2,2015-02-19,I don't know what to do anymore,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2wers7/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/,"I'm an 18 year old female and I feel like I've been struggling with depression for my entire life. It comes and goes, I guess. Here's my story? Sorry it's long but I just need to get it out for once.

I was ""diagnosed"" for the first time when I was 13, by my school counselor who told me I likely had depression and anxiety. I had been feeling depressed for a long time before that, I remember. Even back in elementary school I never felt right. I had a lot of suicidal thoughts around grade 7-9.

When I was in grade 11 (age 16?) things really started looking up. That was 2013. January-April were great. I met my first boyfriend and I was really in love, school was going well, I felt really happy for the first time in a long time. That May, a close friend of mine committed suicide. It really affected me but I remember thinking it was strange that I still felt fine despite her death. I do regret that I wasn't there to help her but I know it's not my fault.

I took a bit of a dive again toward the end of 2013. In September my pet died and that was really hard on me, mostly because it really felt like my fault. I didn't take great care of him. That was really hard.

I started feeling very depressed again at times. I got a job in October and it was really easy money but it still stressed me out. This is when I started having problems with my boyfriend, I guess. He often got mad that I wasn't able to see him all the time. We usually hung out on weekends but now I was working most of them. I had virtually no free time.

When I get sick, even if it's just a cold, I feel like I will never get better again. I get extremely depressed. This also bothered my boyfriend.

I started seeking treatment again. I had been to many doctors but none of them ever took me seriously. Even my family doctor said the same thing: ""you're just a teenager, you'll grow out of it."" Yeah, if I don't end up killing myself by then. In March I had to quit my job because I couldn't take it anymore. Then I finally found a really good doctor at a walk in clinic who actually wanted to see me get better. I've been seeing him for the last year now.
After ruling out any physical illness, he suggested a therapist. I remember I could not look him in the eyes and I started crying, and I said I would not talk to a therapist. (At this point I was hardly functioning anymore but I wanted to get better.) So he said we could try antidepressants, and I agreed.

The first one I went on was called Cymbalta. This drug fucked me up. I was on it for a month (April 2014) and it worsened my depression and I had to take myself off of it. I had hypersomnia and I didn't have the energy to go to school most of the time. That was a bad month. This is also when my boyfriend found out that I was depressed. I mean, the signs were there, and he knew I had a rough time in the past, but he didn't think I was /actually/ depressed for whatever reason. And he really has no idea what it's like to be depressed. He didn't understand it at all. He got pissed off at me for succumbing to the side effects of the drug. He was an asshole. I didn't see him much during this time but we texted every day. I didn't want to talk to him most of the time. I remember one time when I was texting him he said, DIRECT QUOTE, ""It's your fault that you're depressed."" He said he was supporting me!

Then in May, a miracle. A drug called Cipralex! Suddenly I was filled with energy again and feeling great. And wow, surprise, my boyfriend really WAS supporting me now! Thanks for helping me in my time of need, asshole. I stayed with him because I think I still loved him.

Then I graduated high school, then the college course I was doing (pharmacy assistant) and it was summer. July I was doing an internship in a pharmacy, and then the shitstorm of August 2014 began. I couldn't handle being in a relationship anymore. I was starting to hate him. When it came to my depression, he was often very abusive and insensitive. But I couldn't break up with him! I don't know why. So I manipulated him into breaking up with me. I cancelled all our dates and stopped replying to his texts most of the time. I was too depressed to care. I was honestly considering suicide again for the first time in a long time. I felt nauseous when I saw his name pop up on my phone. Then in early September, I got a text. ""I'm coming over. We need to break up."" He came to my house and I let him in. I went to my room and lied in bed with my eyes closed while he talked to me. After a while I started crying, and so did he. ""We've had a lot of good times, and I know there are a lot to come,"" he was saying. ""We will still be friends... I still want to be best friends with you,"" etc. I said nothing the whole time. IN my mind, I was thinking, ""dream on."" Before he left, he tried to hug me. I pushed him away and he left. I haven't seen him or talked to him since then.

I got a job shortly after the breakup and things were great! I was working full time in a pharmacy and making money and I had plans to move out. At this time I started going back to the doctor to get help with the insomnia I had been having. I've had insomnia for as long as I can remember, but it was getting worse. I went on and off 5 different medications and nothing helped. Not even zopiclone or zolpidem. Zolpidem got me pretty high when I ""accidentally"" took 35mg in one night, but was not at all sedating.

At the end of December, I finished up my 3 months probation period and my boss called me into his office. I thought I was getting benefits. Nope. He had a meeting with me explaining that he was cutting my hours from 42/week to 16. Apparently, I'm not social enough and I hardly talk to any of my coworkers or the patients! Oops. I told that to my doctor and he said maybe it's not the right job for me. But I honestly like it.
In January I kinda started falling for my friend. She is female and very gay, but she doesn't like me. Maybe I should go to /r/relationships for that one.
I started drinking more recently. Not too much, but I used to be very straight edge with that stuff. Drugs as well. Nothing illicit (yet) but I have abused the sleeping pills I was given. And mixed them with alcohol for fun.


Eep, this is getting long. I'm just at this point right now where I don't know what to do anymore. My insomnia has gotten to the point where I sleep an average of 4 hrs/night and at least 2 nights a week I don't sleep at all. I went to the doctor tonight but my regular dr wasn't in. It was a different woman and she referred me to a sleep clinic. I mentioned temazepam (which my pharmacist recommended) and she got very angry and said she would not write an rx for it. (Probably for the better with my recent abuse of drugs/) I want to move out of my mom's house but I can't afford it without a full time job, and my boss keeps postponing another meeting about my hours. I honestly love the pharmacy I work at and I don't want to leave it. I've worked in other places casually and I get stressed out and anxious, but not at my pharmacy. I just need more hours. I don't know how much longer I can take this though. Also, my back always hurts.

Thanks for reading this far, I'm sorry this got so long. I feel better after putting it all out there though. If anyone has any advice or anything, I am all ears. Thank you."

I am Computer Science student in European member state and European Union citizen and having browsed through websites for internships, I found that there exist tremendous amount of internship opportunities in the US compared to Europe. Just browsing through several top tech firms yielded 20+ opportunities to intern while none exist across whole Europe despite having offices all around it.

You probably know what the problem is: a right to work in US. I am not familiar with this process but the idea is this: get a visa and then apply for internships in the US for the summer(or even year long if possible) because most companies I researched have a clear statement of ""must have a right to work in US"". I found that there is a J1 visa but since I am not familiar with intricacies of obtaining it, does anyone have experience in getting it or some other means in order to be allowed to work?

That would really help since I always wanted to visit US + many opportunities exist there and a selection of companies is so much bigger than Europe."

Software already exists.,UnnecessaryOtter,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2wfhs0/developing_software_for_an_internship_software/,"So, I'm currently interning at a company as part of my CompSci bachelor's, and the company has tasked me with designing and creating a piece of software for them. I'm currently in my 2nd week, and it is supposed to last about 20 more. 

As part of the development process I was researching software that is similar to what I'm going to develop, to use as a framework/point of reference. Also to prevent myself from re-inventing the wheel, so to speak. However, I stumbled upon a free, open-source program that does EXACTLY what the company has hired me for to make for them.

So... I don't really know what to do. I'm positive I should just tell my supervisor that they can just use this, instead of having me create a shittier version of the same software. But I don't want to have to look for a different company to intern at. 

What do?"
2wfjfz,0,2015-02-19,"End of a relationship? After a break-up I need a way to get her back, justice wasn't done to me. [M/25, F/21, almost 4 years dating]",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2wfjfz/end_of_a_relationship_after_a_breakup_i_need_a/,"My girlfriend broke up with me on Tuesday, the day I had finished paying for her engagement ring. As I'm still in the process of understanding what happened let me tell you why she broke up with me in the hopes that you can help me think about what I should do about it. 
We have been dating for almost 4 years. During this time we've both seen growth not only in our relationship but as individuals. When we started dating I had just been dumped from a long term relationship. She is 3 years younger than me so long story short I started unconsciously controlling her. It wasn't like I told her what to do but I'd always suggest things for her that I thought would help her. 
For example she came out of a depression after I suggested she talked to a shrink. In the beginning she had issues with her family as they did not want her to be with such an older guy right off the bat. That drove her away from them and closer to me, you may be seeing where this is going... 
After a year of practically living together it seemed like we had our crap together. I had found a new major and was doing great, she changed to that same major and we both got internships last summer. We happened to flip flop cities of origin, an I took the chance to talk to her parents and get to know them better. By the end of the summer I would hang out  with them without her, I still did a few weeks ago. 
I am now working far away from her and we had been struggling with keeping up the long distance thing... More on that later. 
We grew and shrunk in our faith together. Now it's been several months since we've been to church until last Sunday which it was my suggestion and we went because I said ""if we don't go today we won't got next week"". We went, it was great and we even prayed together like we used to years ago when we were on fire in our faith. 
At this point I have been really making an effort to make her feel loved, happy and important. I used to belittle her and make her feel bad for what it my head was not loving me... Whenever she was sleepy, she doesn't love me. Whenever she couldn't do some favor, she doesn't love me... 
I do have an explanation for this behavior though. I've never had a real example of what a healthy and loving relationship is. My dad was a doctor in the third world country I grew up in and was never home. When he was my parents would fight all night long. On the weekends it would all seem  normal but really wasn't. Now I realize that they would practice a trait that I now have, ""joke"" about things but really meaning it. 
My parents got divorced a few months ago and I have been trying to hang out  with her parents to seek that family love and friendship that I really want to have with her... I know I have changed a lot for the better, this is one of the reasons why. 
So now onto the problem. My girlfriend was always really quiet and calm. Turns out  that she had been keeping all of the pain and suffering inside little by little accumulating it to this point. We've had talks about my behavior, yes. I've been working with these issues, yes. But I never got a real sit down face to face talk about my bad behavior. 
Recently she found a friend from school that he's been hanging out with. Now I realize that because of previous traumas in passed relationships I have a thing for being jealous. 
Thus we get the drop that made the cup overflow. I say some nasty things when I'm mad. And on Monday the solitude took over me and said nasty things to her. Reading back to it I cannot believe what I said. The total opposite of what I really thought. I fully trust her hands down, no problems. And yet here I am saying idiotic things like we're calling off the engagement and stuff like that. 
She stopped talking to me and responding to my texts. 
On Tuesday we Skype for 1 1/2 hours. She is breaking up with me. I melted down, she melts down, she says she still loves me but that I've hurt her too much and I've had too many chances... But have I? I don't think so. 
I think there has been a great fault in our communication. We never try to argue seriously. We fight for a little bit and one of us ""says you're right"" but doesn't really mean it. 
This is not the way this relationship was supposed to end. It isn't. I know this. 
I know she needs time to relax and think through things, but I don't want to be too late. This is why I'm here. 
I am fully repented of my actions and have been working hard, and I mean HARD, to make her feel better! The problem is that the result of my hard work is a lack of behaviors, so it isn't really apparent. 
I can assure you, our relationship was at an all time high on Monday (talking about wedding, buying a car, and a house, our future etc.) and on Tuesday it all crumbled. 
I need to get her back, I know it's the best thing for us. I'm also planning on talking  to her parents about my issues, they really give great advice, I just don't know how they are going to react with me. 
What should I do? Pay a visit to the family or her first? I live basically in between the two cities (5 hr drive to her 4 to the parents). 
And in the visit what should I say or do? 
How long do I need to wait? I really don't want to step on her toes right now, the situation is too delicate and top priority. 
If you've made it this far I hope that you can help me with this issue. Thanks. 

TL;DR; Girlfriend broke up with me and I don't think she sees all the effort I put in the relationship. She still loves me. What do I do?"

We have said to each other that we want to be life partners and we are best friends. Now, onto my question:

I am from Michigan (where my boyfriend and I are currently living). He is from Florida. (Can you see where this is going?)

My entire family is up here as well as his immediate family (barring his dad who lives in Pennsylvania). My boyfriend is currently attending school here and will be graduating in May. I have graduated already and landed a job with a pretty prestigious company as an intern. Now this internship is paid and I have a chance to extend it. I am sure that I will be able to extend it through the summer to garner more money. 

Anyway, he wants to move to Florida. I am completely onboard, but, BUT, I made it clear that I have to have found full time employment before moving down there. I was thinking I could do this/these internships and then start applying around May/June to give myself plenty of time. (He wants to be down there before next winter or at least at the start.) 

I love this idea and I love the idea of being with him and living down there, it's just... is this a mistake? I mean, I have a great opportunity here at the company I work for and I love it. I'm completely spoiled here with all the perks I get and I'm concerned that I won't be able to find anything. 

I need to start making at the least 28-30k after taxes to live comfortably as he wants to continue his education with a part time job. I'm a media person. I do videos and marketing. What title would I even look for?? Plus I'm young and new to the market. I'm also a wedding videographer, but I work for a company that provides my equipment (I don't have my own). 

Is this a huge mistake? Am I sacrificing too much? Should I stay and try to work full time at my current company? If I did that I would have to stay for at least 2-3 years. I'm really confused and I don't know what to do. I want to go, I really do. But, is it a mistake?
   
**tl;dr**: My boyfriend want to move down to Florida from Michigan before the summer and I have an opportunity to work my way into a full time position at my current company. Am I making a huge mistake?"

I need your advice. In 2012 I moved to Madison, WI for two reasons 1) To live with a man I was dating at the time who had a cushy job there and 2) To find employment in the local foods/food systems planning community. The man and I are no longer together for various reasons and while I created a great network of those involved in food issues in Madison, I never found employment in the field. While in town I took a job at an agency serving those on TANF that had recently received a grant to expand their program from 10 counties to 80 counties in less than four months. Needless to say this transition was very chaotic for everyone involved and as an administrative position I was expected to teach those who knew nothing about the program how to run it while not knowing anything myself (I'm from Ohio, not Wisconsin so I didn't even know the history or politics behind the program). Everyone on my team was new and I was the youngest person there. Suddenly I was supposed to be a leader without knowing what the hell I was doing. 

While the job itself was chaotic, I felt bullied by my boss and indirect coworkers all while undergoing an unraveling relationship at home in a city where I knew no one. I had taken the job because I needed money and the salary was decent (by social worker standards at least). It had absolutely nothing to do with food work, one of the reasons I came to the city in the first place. Being right out of graduate school with little professional experience (other than internships) I was consistently scared of screwing up and doing something wrong so I went to my boss for everything and copied her on every email I sent. While I was being yelled at for doing things I thought I should be doing (and also to keep myself busy during downtimes) my direct coworkers (one of whom was extremely supportive) received consistent praise for their work. This combined with the stress at home, made me extremely depressed and I stopped caring about things like my personal appearance and hygine. The straw was when I asked my boss to provide any feedback she received and she sent me a nasty email about how coworkers were saying I smelled, looked like a slob, and had bad breath (yes the really told my supervisor that). In the midst of all of this I had identified that I wanted to try for a job with less responsibility and a lower salary and had one of the worst interviews for my life. Needless to say I did not get the other position and left the management position soon after the email went out. 

In the two years since leaving this company I have remained in contact with some of those I met in the food community while I lived in Madison, including a professor at UW. Also, I recently learned that the agency I worked for has several openings and recently obtained to a new grant focused on the Food Stamps Employment and Training Program. Also through linkedin searches and the facebook ""people you may know"" function I learned that several of those who caused me problems are now gone, including my former supervisor. 

When I left, I left on good terms and if I remember correctly may have complained about the rollout, but no one in particular. A call to HR confirmed that I am ""definitely eligible for rehire"" and ""encouraged me to apply"". I also have been in recent contact with my professor friend at UW about potential PHD funding, but will not be eligible for admission until 8/2016, so I need something to do till then, if I get in. 

The question becomes this. Does this community think I should apply for the jobs in the FSET program considering they pay well, have upward mobility, and have pretty awesome benefits (things that don't happen in the nonprofit world) and also would allow me to establish Wisconsin residency for graduate school. I am just concerned that the experiences of the past will come to bite me in the ass.

So let's use Microsoft .NET framework as an example.  In the 1990's to 2002, the .NET framework did not yet exist.  From what I can tell, C++ was dominant back then, and Java was just getting off the ground.

Then, according to [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET), in 2002 the first version of the .NET framework was released.  This means, if a modern job posting wants ""10 years of experience"" in .NET framework, then basically they're looking for someone who's been using .NET since at least 2004 to present.

However, the nature of the computer science industry is that there are so many technology stacks, frameworks, languages, and they are constantly changing, shifting, and evolving, that's it's really hard to find someone who meets 100% of any of the outlandish laundry list of requirements slapped together by HR morons on the job postings.

It seem the only way to get a job in this day and age is to already have 3-5 years of experience doing that exact same job, or similar.  Few companies are hiring at the entry-level anymore, they all want people with ""more experience.""  They all want to hire people away from their competitors instead of hiring junior young people who might make mistakes or not be able to develop code fast enough.

In terms of being able to get jobs in this industry post-2008 recession, the state of the industry is so bad that even people who did things correctly, majored in computer science, graduated summa cum laude with a 3.9 GPA, had internships during school, get relegated to working in crap QA positions after they graduate because they can't find jobs as developers or software engineers, because they either can't get past the hard technical interviews (there is a giant disconnect in terms of knowledge and experience between someone fresh out of school and someone with 2-3 years experience in the industry), or because academia didn't respond to industry fast enough and was teaching bullshit general computer science chock full of unnecessary math courses, when they should have been teaching web and mobile development.

So the true question, how really screwed are the future generations? Of the kids who are growing up today, those few who are smart and farsighted enough to major in computer sciency subjects when they attend college, instead of bullshit liberal arts degrees not worth the paper they're printed on, only a select few of them will even be able to have jobs, and those will be crap QA glorified computer janitor jobs.

The kids will also be spoiled by these mobile phones and mobile devices, and lack a true understanding of ""desktop-related"" computer science, low level, assembly, managed code, and such.  Those few who will actually manage to get jobs in web development, mobile development, or the next paradigm at that point, will not be true software engineers, they'll be script kiddies using programming ""languages"" like HTML\CSS\JavaScript and they'll be lacking a fundamental understanding of data structures and design patterns since web development is so lighthearted that it cannot even be considered ""real"" development by ""true"" software engineers."

Aside from my intern, who I swap gym stories, techniques, and tips with, he was the first one in the office to mention something to me.


I'm roughly down ~25 lbs from my heaviest late last year, and I suppose it finally is showing.


I also was at the gym earlier in the week and was asked to spot a guy throwing up 225#. He trusted ME, to spot HIM. :)

That was also the first workout session where I felt comfortable tossing up plates for all of my sets, not just my last. I had been working my way up to hitting that 135# mark on the big 3 (bench, deadlift, squat) for my first set and I finally felt comfortable doing it.

I looked at myself in the mirror during that workout and actually saw something too. I've never been one to suffer from BDD or anything, but my only indicator so far has been the scale and my BF% handheld reader thing. This was the first time i felt like I could actually *see* progress.

Further - I went out for sushi yesterday with my intern and while sitting at the bar the sushi chef threw a plate of whitefish tempura in front of us ""on the house"". Not to disrespect him I indulged in a few small pieces with as little sauce on them as possible. Still in ketosis as of lunch today.

Essentially the only companies that were willing to respond to me due to my experience were the major companies, and I managed to get RIGHT UP to the final rounds for all of them only to get shunned in the final round.

Now I'm lost. Emotionally, mentally... I was originally thinking of going through thailand and laos, but now I'm hearing that trying to do that in the summer is miserable because of monsoons. Then I thought I'd work on my project, but my initial project idea was denied by my advisor and now I'm doing something that in no way will take all summer.

My question now is, what do I do? How do I make this summer worthwhile? I can get a part time TA job that will pay all my bills and leave me with a lot of free time but I don't want to leave this summer without finding some way to further my career.

2wgvo5,30,2015-02-19,Going against popular internet opinion,CoffeeBeanCounter,fresno,https://www.reddit.com/r/fresno/comments/2wgvo5/going_against_popular_internet_opinion/,"I grew up in the Central Valley in a small town and went to Fresno State. I am now a professional living in North Fresno and hopefully I can provide a realistic view of Fresno. Most of the internet loves to hate on Fresno for some valid reasons. I personally enjoy living in Fresno. I lived in San Francisco for a summer during an internship so I have had some limited experience living in a larger city. Fresno is not even close to as dangerous as popular opinion seems to say it is. The reason that the crime stats can be misleading is that the majority of crime is focused in southwest, downtown and parts of southeast Fresno. I have never had a problem with crime in my 5 years living in Fresno. I live in the part of town that would probably be considered the strip mall paradise but I have everything I need within 5 minutes of my house. My rent is way cheaper than what I paid in San Francisco. And in San Francisco I live in the equivalent of a closet. The summers are hot here but I will take that any day over the cold winters the other parts of the country experience. It is never cold here. Maybe one week a year of high 30's. Downtown and Tower has some cool bars and restaurants to try. Overall Fresno is an affordable place to live that has access to great parts of California. Yes the air quality really does suck. Otherwise Fresno is a great place if you stop spending so much time complaining about it and look to improve your experience yourself. SF was a lot of fun, but ultimately the pay isn't adjusted to how high living costs are so it become close to impossible to save money or afford a house in the area. The places with decent rent have crazy commutes. There are pros and cons everywhere."

She will let any coworker do anything he wants to her anyplace and anytime, regardless of age, race, looks, or marital status. She dresses, acts, and talks like a slut.

I happen to be the official office slut where I work. My name is Jennifer and I'm 20 years old, my breasts are a perky 34B with an equally perky ass. Almost every guy in my building has fucked me at least once. I've even let a couple of 19 year old interns make me their property in my car during lunch. Ive always worn short skirts and thigh highs so the men have easy access to my cleanly shaven pussy and tight little asshole. Everyone knows I don't wear panties because of all the peep shows I give the men around the office. All a man has to do is call me into an office or bathroom and bend me over and spread my legs exposing my slutty married wet pussy and ass. 

All while I beg them to fuck me hard as they can and call me a dirty whore then they fill me with thick rope after rope of their portent cum. Almost every day I go home to my husband, cum dripping from both of my fuckholes If only he had any clue what happens when his wife is at work for the day. I want this RP to focus on all of my escapades throughout my average work day. From when I leave for work kissing my oblivious husband good bye, to when I leave the office wiping cum from my lips as I leave through the front door. If you want to add/change anything let me know. I'm always open to new ideas.

2wgxuw,1,2015-02-19,Soon to be College Graduate in a bind with job search,Jobnyc,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2wgxuw/soon_to_be_college_graduate_in_a_bind_with_job/,"Hi everyone, I wanted to make a throwaway for this account since I didn't want it to be associated with my usual username. I know that this is the situation for the majority of college graduates, but alas I would greatly appreciate a read through if you would like.

...
 

I am a second semester senior at a top-tier university in NY concentrating in Finance and Marketing with a 3.33 GPA currently. I have asset management internship experience (two summers, two winters at the same small firm), I've had many on-campus involvements as well. I've been a Resident Assistant position for two years. I believe this position has taught me a lot (everything from crisis response, to conflict resolution, to administrative tasks, etc...).


The place that I interned was great and was ideal to work at but they do not have space for another employee unfortunately. 


At this point I've applied to over 115 jobs via my school's Careernet, indeed.com, headhunters, and other individual private / public sector positions. I've had 5 or so in person interviews and a couple of phone interviews. 


The greatest issue I suppose is that they all want an immediate hire. I am able to work maybe 15 hours a week during this school year, but after graduation I have to figure out an apartment, I have to get on my feet (parents will not be allowing me to move back home unfortunately). 


I anticipate my preferred start date to be July 13th - I figure this is more than enough time to figure out all the post-graduation details, be able to take two weeks truly off after the whirlwind that was college (the RA job is truly involving and it takes a lot of effort on top of classes). 


I'm not looking for a massive salary that some of my peers desire. Anything 40k+ is more than acceptable for me. I would love to work for a place that has a decent work/life balance and a welcoming company culture - I couldn't see myself working in Investment banking where the employees are consistently pulling all-nighters in a cut-throat environment, and destroying their health in the meantime - that doesn't inspire me. 



...



**What can I do? Waiting until May to start looking for jobs is pushing it - it seems prudent to begin this process early which I'm attempting to do. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated!**


Thank you in advance!

2wh4u1,2,2015-02-19,Already losin' it... here's my story!,[deleted],loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/2wh4u1/already_losin_it_heres_my_story/,"Hey everyone... I'm reading this reddit for about 2 months now and I just wanted to share my story for I'm back at losing it! :)

Now about 4 years ago I studied in another city and was kinda thick... Not really fat, but thick. Probably more than thick but not extremely fat. My band colleague started to lose weight - but he did it that fast, that he has too much skin on his belly now... Since I didn't want that - besides from not changing myself to get laid (I was a virgin then) - so I didn't work out.
Well, after 1 studying in another city where nobody knew me, I started to go jogging at nights (10 to 11 PM) so nobody could see me for I was kinda ashamed.
A good friend who studied with me also joggs and after like 2 weeks of jogging alone I started to talk to him. After that we went jogging every day (even in the deepest of winter, -15°C) and I felt good. I was so fucking losing it. It was awesome.
Then I started an internship and participated in the football (soccer) team once a week. I also started eating a little bit healthier and drinking only water (well.. in the weekends I did get drunk - I still do!) - that went really fine for me.
In that time - like 2 years - I went from clothing size XL (in shirts / hoodies) to M (european sizing - smaller than US). 
I didn't see on myself that I lost weight. Especially that much. But other people noticed that I haven't seen for quite a while. And well... eventually I noticed that all of my clothes are too large for me.
I felt awesome. I had a lot of confidence... Of course when you feel good about yourself.
Well, I got rejected from like every girl - which was really devastating. In addition, I had to learn for exams, work longer, was just tired at the evening and managed to get always small injuries from playing football so I couldn't jogg anymore.
I went to the football practice once a week but didn't do anything else but trying not to eat that much unhealthy stuff.
After I failed my study I went back to my parents in my hometown where I am now. I went jogging like 20 times only in 4 months - way too less.
In the beginning of january '15 a good rl mate who hits the game regularly asked me to join him... I said ""The fuck... Sure thing if you will always train with me together"". He agreed.

Now I'm hitting the gym regularly (minimum of 3 times a week), doing muscle stuff and cardio (treadmill / crosstrainer). After almost 5 weeks of training I can already see the fat shrinking. Not on my belly, but on my chest - the part that overlaps your biceps when you're bigger... AWESOME!!

I didn't really gain weight but didn't lose it either and I'm fucked up with it. So my goal is to lose the fat, especially on my belly and gaining some muscles to look good (for myself #priority1).

I just returned from hitting the gym and wanted to share it with you guys.
I do also have like 3 trousers I bought but they don't fit - same with shirts - so I kinda have to lose it so I can wear that stuff.

I try to eat healthier than normal - but I do also vape e-cig (which is really fine for me) and get drunk once in a while (which is really fine for me, too, since I don't want to be a bodybuilder or sth similar) and work out. I'm happy that I care enough and try to do the best of it.

Yesterday I started a new workout (4x week for fatloss - 60 to 90 min a day) and I'm kinda happy with it. Another friend joined me today - a little weight lifting and cardio. I prefer that than only weight lifting.

That's all for the moment - I'll probably add some pictures soon.
EDIT: I took one before I started hitting the gym but removed it for I didn't want other people, handing them my phone, to see them...

Well.. another thing: I started growing a beard - almost 3 months old - and my moustache with beard wax looks fucking amazing!!!"

For years they've not had a website (on purpose), but with recent changes to their business model they decided they need one. I'm a paid intern (part time) right now, but if I impress the boss/fill a niche, I'll have a full-time position here. 

So I've kind of stumbled into a great opportunity here. I love HTML, CSS, code of all types (and I enjoy learning new things). No one else here has the ability or the time to create this website, so I'm on my own with the code, and I've already been tasked with working on it. I have a solid basis in HTML and CSS, and have experience with Java and C++, so I'm not unfamiliar with coding and dev itself- just the professional environment. 


 I'm on Windows 8.1, I have Powershell (and am definitely not afraid of the command line), and am generally familiar with linux and vm's. I've been scouring this sub for several days, but I need more specific help- I've never developed professionally before, so I'm not sure on the ins and outs, and there's not really anyone here who can assist me in that. 


 I think a framework might be a good way to go about building the site more rapidly, but I'm stuck on which one to use. I'd like to use Sass, since it should make everything way easier to maintain on such a large site. 


 I will be able to try to persuade the business to purchase software (within reason), and they already have the domains and hosting plan set up so I don't need to worry about that- they used them with placeholder for quite a while. People here are gathering the information/graphics/etc and the sitemap is already mostly complete (going through the final revisions right now). 

**Here are my questions for /r/webdev:** 

* How do I go about setting up the most efficient environment for local web development? Recommend me text editors, Sass compilers, whatever you think I need to be successful in writing good, modular, easily-updated, well-documented code (HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, etc)

* Should I use a framework? If so, which do you recommend? 

* What sort of testing should I be doing? 

* What tips can you share with a new-to-professional-environment-web-dev? 

* Should I integrate version control? If so, which do you recommend?  

* What else do I need to know? 


* Am I forgetting anything big?

I want to upgrade to the GH4.

I'm now a junior in college and I'm working two unpaid internships so I'm trying to make this happen by selling my old gear and reinvesting to avoid spending money.

Over the years I've picked up a few lenses, but I'm wondering if it will be more worth my while to sell my 60D and lenses. This way I could avoid the extra cost of a metabones adapter, but I wouldn't have the accessibility I currently do with my (little) lens collection.

I would be selling the 60d body, 18-135 f/4.5-5.6 stock IS lens, tokina 11-16 f/2.8, 50mm f/1.8, rokinon 8mm f/3.5

My questions are:

Is it worth the transition?
Are the lenses available for the GH4 comparable to Canon glass?
Should I sell all my equipment to make things cheaper on my end?"

2whqyq,1,2015-02-19,Small non-profit networking,[deleted],HomeNetworking,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/2whqyq/small_nonprofit_networking/,"Working as an intern studying for an unrelated major I have given myself the job to set up my internship's network. However, I have limited experience in networking - just a lot of help desk-esque knowledge. 


I got to this building with a rather haphazard network that was wide open to everyone (not even a WiFi password), but with some work that was done in the past. The internship is a two building location with a Comcast router/modem combo with 4 Ethernet slots on it. Attached to those slots are a newly secured Window's file share, a networked printer, one office computer and the last one going somewhere I don't know (into a wall). Somehow, there are two more workstations set up and a cord going from one building to the other, connecting to a switch. That switch is split between 4 workstations and a router which I have managed using OpenDNS and a growing list of filter phrases/proxy websites. I still need to investigate how there are three desktops, a wired printer with an Ethernet cord, and a cord going to the second building with only 4 slots... but I digress.  I'll probably find a switch in a wall one of these days.


Back to the problem I am facing: the internship is a residential half-way house with about 50 residents and 10 workers, and they want to grow that number. The residents are not to go on any offensive or social media websites, but the workers are not under that obligation. 


The best way I have considered to do that is to have two separate networks, one per building, with the residents one filtered and the workers one not. Currently the switch in the second building is set up to allow the file transfer and printing abilities between buildings, so I am not messing with that. I am planning on adding a second router to that switch and making a separate network to allow the workers to use the WiFi unfiltered, while keeping the other one in place. 


The issue that I have been unable to solve is adding a second router to the main building. Through my internship, I purchased two Netgear WNR3500Lv2 N300 open source routers and put Tomato on both of them. I attached the Netgear to the Comcast router/modem and didn't touch the DHCP settings and set up OpenDNS and ported over my filter list from the other building and everything was set up nicely - until I went to test the residential computers I have been managing (decade old Ubuntu 14.4 LTS machines) and their internet connection was atrocious. Pages would half load, images wouldn't load at all, and even an apt-get update command was crawling. After seeing these speeds, I decided it was probably a mix between a bad wireless signal (very old building) and the DHCP settings. 


I went to work and set the Netgear to not do DHCP and added it within the Comcast's IP range and it connected like a charm - but none of my filtering stayed put. The DNS settings were still set to OpenDNS and my filters were still on, but they were doing absolutely nothing. After spending many an hour on this, I turned the router off and decided to head home. 


Does anyone have any suggestions for fixing this dilemma I am having? I have done plenty of work here and thought I knew what I was doing, but after hitting this roadblock feel like I am living up to my namesake. "

I am a late twenty something in an entry level position in a nonprofit in the area. Over the past year of working there, I have become really disengaged with my job. The problem started even before I got hired because after graduating from college,I spent 3 years in retail, tutoring and doing unpaid internships to make ends meet and get my foot in the door of a great non profit so I could make a difference in the world. After a string of internships that lead nowhere I finally landed an entry level position at a nonprofit of my choice and was so excited. 

I was one of 4 new hires all in their mid to late twenties and we bonded. The job seemed easy but very administrative and I struggled to keeping Barack of all the organizing and paperwork. I got bored with the tasks and resented that my supervisors got so upset about errors that I deemed to be very silly. Soon 1 of my coworkers got fired, 2 left for other jobs and the only other person hired with me got promoted. While I was swallowing getting passed over for the promotion, they hired a bunch of fresh college grads to replace the old team. I felt more awkward and out of place than ever. More than anything, I felt like a failure since I was the oldest employee in a team full of fresh college grads. While i retreated and disengaged in my role, the new hires thrived. One of them quickly even got promoted and I am still where I am. 

I have grown to hate my job and have become a terrible employee. I feel awful and acknowledge that I make a series for awful mistakes at this job.  is there anyway to salvage my career, reputation and pride at this organization or is my only option to leave and start fresh?  "

Personally, my internship last summer (and to be fair, my only engineering internship so far) was boring as hell. I enjoyed manual-labor intensive summer jobs more (think moving boxes around and bagging groceries) because at least you felt satisfied that you were doing work that needed to be done, however simple it was, and because you could hang out and banter all day, which helps most during the slower hours.

My engineering internship however, I probably spent 80% of the time sitting at my desk pretending to do work. I asked my manager for probably the first six weeks if he needed help with anything, and he always said ""just sit tight, the work should pick up soon"". Yeah.... it never did. A lot of the other people I worked with besides my manager were.... not exactly jumping out of their seats to help me either (not saying they were douches or anything, just not very enthused to have to work with me on a small project, or explain to me something that seemed simple to them). Plus, the meetings were just unbearably boring and half the time I knew nothing since they used so much jargon which I had no chance to pick up since I was new.

School on the other hand, is sometimes infuriatingly difficult or frustrating, usually because courses are poorly taught or homeworks/exams are poorly designed, however at least I feel like I'm being challenged. Even when it's 4am and I'm working on a problem set there's at least a set objective that I need to accomplish. Also just the school environment is a lot more social, I enjoy working in groups for projects, or even just when doing homework, I have plenty of things to do on the weekends, oh, and I'm in at least a somewhat urban environment unlike most engineering locales for manufacturing (midwest, where the land is cheap).

I'm not saying I'd rather be a undergraduate engineering student for life over being an engineer. In the former you have to pay tens of thousands of dollars a year while in the latter you're getting paid tens of thousands of dollars a year. Well, maybe I am saying I'd rather be a student than an engineer if it didn't mean I would swim in debt forever. I'm considering getting a PhD now more than ever,  because even though academia research is slow and boring as well, at least I know I enjoy and thrive in a university environment rather than a corporate engineering environment. Plus you get to choose what you research to some extent when you apply for schools and find professors with similar research interests, whereas at work you do what they assign you, and they can reassign you at their whim anytime.

I realize I'm ranting now, but I'm just curious as to y'alls experience with internships (or even full-time jobs?) compared to being in college."

I know it's mainly a learning experience but I would still like to study some concepts and techniques that would be beneficial to me for the program. I have passed the AP CS exam and know how to program in java but I don't really know much else regarding languages like C as well as things like network programming very well. As far as I know the internship is focused on the learning experience but I would still like to start learning now. So what should I study?

I am a recent Comp Sci graduate and started my first real job last September. I had zero Linux experience when I started and all of my internships were with imaging machines and tier 1 helpdesk. I seem to have found a place where I am not locked down in my roles. I have day to day tasks but I am being shaped into a Sys admin role. I have picked up very basic Linux skills (how to add users, find what is taking up disk space, and what processes are running). We use mostly Red Hat 5. My boss has made it perfectly clear that if I show interest and prove myself, he will help me further my career. My question to you is how do I get my hands dirty to make the most out of this situation? I want to build a career that is no longer just ""Why doesn't my computer work?!"" Thank you in advance"
2wi8p7,3,2015-02-19,Need advice regarding an internship offer.,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2wi8p7/need_advice_regarding_an_internship_offer/,"Hi all. So recently I got an offer for an internship from a prestigious company in the computer hardware/software industry. They are offering me the regular hourly pay, and on top of that will give me $1200 for relocation assistance. I would use this relocation assistance money for renting out a place to stay, the problem is, even renting out a single bedroom in this specific city is no less than $700/month (I would very much rather prefer a whole apartment to myself which is no less than $1200/month in this city). Should I ask for more relocation assistance, or should I just take the offer and somehow over the next few months scrounge the necessary money to add on top of the offered relocation assistance? Being that it is such a large and powerful company (one of the largest and most prestigious in the computer hardware/software industry) I was hoping for a bit more. Especially seeing as the median relocation assistance for interns/co-ops is $1500 according to [**this**](http://www.naceweb.org/s05142014/intern-co-op-benefits-relocation.aspx). Any input is greatly appreciated."

Since her plan of studies is a mess ( because of college bad organization ) she finds her self in periods where she study for exams while she does internships hours at hospital.


At the beginning of January she said to me with a smile that this would've been an hard period for her, that's ok for me, we passed similar exams\internships periods before without any problem.


While she was doing a night internship shift at hospital the night between Wednesday and Thursday she texted me that she wanted to sleep with me really bad ( I'm not talking about sex specifically ), that was a wish of her that had for days, we could've not sleep togheter for a long time because of her mother being here at college town to visit her plus her resting because study\internships\exams and so on.


Because of that text message i said to her that she could come at my place right after the end of her shift ( 7 o'clock ), she declined politely telling me that maybe would've been a good idea the night of the same day, she was kinda enthusiastic about that.


As soon as she hit home she fell asleep till 14:00 when she called me just to talk a bit on telephone and i said enthusiastic if was all confirmed for the night, she replied "" We'll see in the late afternoon, I'm gonna eat and get another nap, I'll let you know as soon as I wake up "". I felt a bit upset but I didn't magnified it, I passed on.


Here the part where we fought:
I went to gym and she texted me about 19:00 and we talked about shits, soon as i came home around 20 I was starving and didn't know yet if i had to wait her ( cook dinner for two, put in order home and so on ) 
so i texted her "" 20 o'clock plus the fact that you didn't say nothing i must say that you wont come, right ? "", 
she replied "" I didn't tell you anything because I did woke up late, I'm still a little dazy and I don't feel in the mood to come because of that""
i replied "" was i supposed to guess it ? ""
she replied "" ok bye ""
i said "" are you 2 or what ? ""
she said "" you make me mad ""
i said "" isn't a good manner when someone invites you to tell him that you cannot go to his place anymore ? or is he supposed to read it between the line ? ""
she said "" i cannot find words to tell you right now, i'm mad ""
i said "" you calm down a bit for a moment and i dont care what you wanna say because A: Objectively you are wrong about the matter, when someone greets you it is a good manner not less your responsability to call and give advice about the fact that you wont come B: after that kiddish "" ok bye "" the only thing you must say is SORRY
she said: "" i m not gonna tell you sorry because i dont feel it ""
i sad "" you are being very childish right now ""
- 30 minutes later she replied - "" Are we gonna go to McDonald Tomorrow ? ( we planned that long time ago ) "" like she was trying to change matter because she was too mad 
i said "" tomorrow we'll see ""


she didn't text me anymore, nor a good night neither a good morning, and because of perseverance's sake about good manners, i texted her yesterday afternoon about 17 o clock if she was still up for that mc donald, she texted that she has fever and because of that she's gonna cancel her birthday party today ( my room mate and a friend of mine invited to the party both said that she didn't text them about any cancel ).


I was not in the mood to tell her about that mc donald invitation too, I just did it because i was following "" what's right "", it felt awkward. Contact her seemed and seems like vanify what i was fighting for and her not getting in touch with me makes me think that she seriously thinks that she's right about the situation, also not telling sorry to me means that she didn't saw how much childish the whole situation did sound.
I'm not the kind of guy that wanna be right, and i'm not the kind of guy the enjoy when people tell sorry, being right or being wrong is not a win\lose game, the main importanrt thing to me is that everyone understands when and where he was wrong and learn about that but the whole thing now seems just a PROUD GAME, who ENDURES IS RIGHT, admit is being WEAK and i hate these highschoolish games or just she doesnt really care.


It was an harsh period seriously, i endured but like no other periods she is getting easily mad everytime you make her clear that she's exagerating about something, everything for her is like an attack to her person and she's always on the brink of war. I was invited by her mother these days for dinner\launch and every day she did treat her mother like shit for most stupid things, losing it for nothing, and i always did stand for her mother, i just couldnt get it anymore, it s becoming excruciating.
That "" OK BYE "" was the straw that breaks the camel's back.


It's just i cannot recognize her anymore in the last month, she was ALWAYS a piece of cake, seriously, everyone can says that she's a little cutie supper mannerish, super sensible, super everything, now she s just a pile of bad traits most of the day, she started to make selfish discussions about everything and that scares me the most. I just get in touch with the old her when she's "" calm "" but for the rest of the time when we meet you feel the iron curtain, but not between me and her, between her and the whole world.


From now on i really don't know what the course of event is, not being in touch feels awkward, feels like i'm wasting time while she's making big talks about everything but what happened ( distraction distraction distraction is the main way to fight things for her ), also her room mate ( a good friend of mine that always stood for the relationship, even when we fought ) it's not the kind of girl that slaps you in the face ( not literally ) when you are wrong, she just listen to you saying bullshits giving you support and soon after she complains of what you said with another person.
I'm not even feeling in the mood to go to her birthday party.

2wj8qu,3,2015-02-20,My weird Anime obsession,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2wj8qu/my_weird_anime_obsession/,"Right, so this is weird. I've recently gotten really into Anime and I feel like I'm getting overly invested. It's like an addiction, even when I'm done with a series I mentally linger. I listen to the soundtracks, I re-watch endings, I recently changed my desktop wallpaper to a transmutation symbol from FMA. When I'm not watching anime I feel sort of... empty. It's most definitely symptomatic of some deeper issues, but this is the surface.

A particular obsession of mine are character relationships. After a series of romantic setbacks I personally experienced, I latch onto these fictional relationships and get this melancholic pleasure when they finally get together. For those of you who watch Anime, you know they they really like to work the tension. I'm super into the whole OTP thing. Like right now I'm so into the Okabe and Kurisu pairing. Steins;Gate is amazing, but a small part of me was watching the shows just so I could see how it goes between them. It's fucking weird, and I hate it. What they have is so amazing that it renders real life relationships almost meaningless. I'm not into the female character themselves, like I'm not a hentai or anything. I'm just really into the couples. There's nobody in the world who I could open up to and really expose my vulnerabilities. Except maybe the internet and even then I might not even get a response. I feel like I'm going to be writing for a while, I have a lot to unload.

I've always been a hopeless when it comes to stuff like love, I idealize the fuck out of everything and life always falls short of my expectations. It sort of sucks. I used to like this girl, we dated for a while and we'd known each other for ages before that. We broke  ages ago, summer 2014 to be precise. Now I'm pretty much over it. It took a while, but I'm over it. But I thought maybe there was something there, that we actually had something. We both come from South Asia and in the end her parents essentially told her they wanted her to get an arranged marriage and she listened to them without batting an eye. I'm over *her*, but I'm still not over what happened. I could go on about it forever, but there's nothing more to be said.

I've actually been depressed my whole life. I can't remember the last time I was truly satisfied. I have so many mental health problems. Like I get obsessed with people. Girls. Tv-shows. I feel like I'm trying to compensate for the lack fulfillment and purpose in my own life by externalizing my issues.

I keep going back to my past and yeah it's fucked up, but I  feel like I was always like this, and that it would have worked out the same way in spite of everything. Or maybe not. I probably don't have the introspective capacity to separate who I truly am from the way the world shaped me. My mother used to cut herself in front of us, my brothers a psycho who tried to break my head in with a 10kg weight, my dad gets super abusive. They expect too much out of my and I never deliver, hell I don't even live up to my own expectations. My extended family are all ridiculously successful. Some people I know are literally perfect. They're amazing at everything they do and they don't even have to try. 

I used to be different. I think there was a time where I actually used to have passions that weren't designed to compensate for everything I lack. I used to enjoy swimming, there was a point where I actually enjoyed learning for the sake of learning without any agenda. This sound cliche, but the world has taught me otherwise. I realized life is just a rat race and yeah, hard work does pay off, but not always. Most of the time when I actually put effort into something I just screw up. These days I don't work hard, I'm just sort of BSing my way through life. I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing.

I just can't get a fucking break. Last week I smoked some weed after an investment banking interview that went horribly wrong. I had an updated version of my resume from the one they brought along, they brought 3 fucking guys to interview me and they had one copy. When they noticed the discrepancy they grilled me about it. So I spent 1/4 of the interview talking about why my major GPA dropped from 3.7 to 3.6 and why my SAT scores were different, since I used my superscore for one resume and my highest single sitting for on another. It was an innocent mistake. I have to twist and manipulate every aspect of my existence before I put it on paper. All I really did during my past internships was mope around and try to find ways to get out of work. I was depressed as fuck during all of them.

So back to the weed. Smoked too much and had a bad trip last week. Infinite loops, feeling like my brain was going to explode, unexplained terror, thoughts that it wasn't going to end, hypochondria and derealization. Almost started crying and was yelling at my friends to call the ambulance, which they did, which was bad. It was basically the mental equivalent of being waterboarded for 2.5 hours. Also had another panic attack the day after and checked into the ER for intrusive suicidal thoughts. Admittedly it wasn't just the drug, there was also a little bit of my preexisting anxiety and depression. Weed was just the trigger. So yeah, I smoke some pot and end up in the hospital for 3 fucking days in a mental ward. 1 in 10000, and it happened to me. I've quit since.

After that it was straight back into a meat grinder. No break. Recruiting. I had another interview, it actually went well. But I don't get an offer, no. They want to me to fly to fucking Los Angeles for a superday so the entire company can interview me. How long can I fake it? One slip-up and I'm out of the running. How do people fucking do it? I have problem sets, midterms, I have like 3 more interviews. I'm sleep deprived stressed out and all I can do is sit here and watch Anime. I don't know if I'm just lazy or just so scared of failure that I don't want to put in any more hard work. At least if I pretend not to give a shit then I feel more justified in throwing my life away. But I don't. At a subconscious level I want to be successful and when I'm  feeling okay I'm so full of ideas. I want to write a book, start my own company. A job is like a way to meet new people before moving on, another step in the journey.

But I can't deal with failure. I hate feeling like shit all the time. I hate feeling like I'm throwing my life away and wasting away. But I can't stop procrastinating either. How the fuck do I get out of this rut? I always read these stories of people who just decide one day they want to be successful and boom, they're out of their moms basement, they've got a college degree in engineering and next, a six figure salary, a hot wife and a dog to boot. And here I am, I decided to be successful a long time ago and I'm a neurotic douche, I'm 21 but I look 18, I suffer from anxiety and neurosis and the smell of weed makes me panic. I can't even stick to a basic schedule, I go to the gym once every 2 weeks and that's a chore. I eat too much, I'm not fat, but I've been pigging out lately.

I used to be so much better. I'd spend a good amount of time studying and working, I'd gym every day, I used to eat 3 meals without fail and pull 0 all nighters. I managed to get by on $800 every semester. I was a little depressed, but at least I had my head on my shoulders. Now I'm fucking useless. I live this self indulgent, lifestyle. I'm a gluttonous slob, I'm envious of my ex's husband and I fucking hate him, I have this weird misguided sense of pride, I'm addicted to porn (pathetic I know, but it totally distracts me- I feel dirty after I watch that stuff, but I keep coming back, right now I'm 2 days into abstinence) and I still want everything out of life. Even though I give nothing back. I feel like scum. Hell, I probably am. I feel like a leech on my parents bank account. If I can't get a job that'll be what I become. A leach. I feel like I'm subhuman and I just want to kill myself."
2wjgbi,2,2015-02-20,Going nowhere fast.,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2wjgbi/going_nowhere_fast/,"First off I have to say you guys that spend your time here listening to people is amazing and I hope you guys have nothing but the best because you deserve it. Secondly I am just going to say that I am so bad at commitment right now I am almost positive I wouldn't kill myself anytime this week so it's not an uber emergency but it is really appealing. 

I left college a year ago because I was dumb I had no direction. I went to the local University and took out a 13k loan. Around August I moved in with my older cousin to try and get a job and some time to think. I ended up leaving the job I got there within a few weeks because I hated it. I sat around for two months thinking and hating myself. I realized that I really want a career in computers. 

I decided to move back home around November seeing that there were almost no jobs where my cousin was. I got a temporary job in December that I wanted to quit but thankfully my parents made me stay. I started feeling like I was kinda going somewhere and was hoping to get working on it certification. Then I fell into not wanting to do anything and procrastination like always. It's been 3 months with no job I'm just a lazy pos. 

An army recruiter called me about 4 days ago and the proposition seemed appealing. I met with him and we talked things over my parents said that I don't have to join but I kept thinking it was a good idea. In 6 days I'm supposed to go see him again talk over what job I could get take the entry test and get a medical evaluation. I started getting cold feet yesterday. I can't sleep and I start really second guessing myself. 

My parents were being kind and they've said I don't have to and can think about it my options are open. They said they just want me to work even just volunteer work by the end of the month. I don't deserve them. I'm sitting here depressed again for no reason thinking how am I going to get an it job or survive working fast food when I'm this big of a pussy and stress out over Manning the register and fuck up like I did at the gas station. I suck at fucking everything. 

Everyone around me is doing all this advanced stuff except for a few of my cousins and one friend. I don't want to go nowhere and be like either of my cousins. Ones 35 alone and poor and the other quit college joined the army and dropped out and works at a bowling alley. I don't know how people like my parents are successful. 

The fucked up thing is even just specialization into a career scares me. Certification tests and being an intern. I hate paperwork and phone calls and I know I'll get yelled at all the time because I can't complete simple directions. 

I'm afraid of wasting the recruiters time and plus he said if I didn't fill out my security form I have to do 100 push ups which I can do but for some reason is crippling scary. I just wanted to be like my dad and accomplish something for once and now like usual I want to quit because I know I can't do it and I'm freaking out. 

I've already become a disappointment to the family I can't do it anymore. I know I can't function in society or live how I want. I feel trapped so I might as well end it. But I feel like that is selfish and they'd be mad and maybe sad. I don't want to hurt anyone I just want to end all this. 

I'm sorry for the bad formatting and jumping all over the place with my paragraphs I fucking dropped out for a reason. I'm sure no one will message or anything which is fine I'm just another over sensitive bitchy gen y kid. Yall are very selfless in helping people and I appreciate that."

2wjorc,48,2015-02-20,Acquiring a raise,Competi,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/2wjorc/acquiring_a_raise/,"I was hired initially as a contractor back in the Summer, and due to my age it was suggested that I was paid an interns wages. I ended up contributing far more than was expected of me, and was frequently told that I leveraged greater responsibility and wrote more valuable software than other contractors who were paid nearly five times my daily wage - this included developing a mobile website application, but mainly involved building fairly complex back-end applications. Obviously I feel tremendously underpaid, especially when I'm told that my service at ~120 USD per day is more valuable than another developer's contribution (working for 600 USD per day). 

The thing is, I've been offered equity in the company - let's say it's  several percent, complicated by a clause which states shares cannot be sold for x amount of years (probably 3-5). However, with no real wage increase. I'm essentially being asked to gamble on the success of the business whilst being severely underpaid - even if it is a success after five years, how can I be expected to live on these wages in the mean time. This doesn't seem fair to me, what do you think? How should I approach this situation? Thanks!"
2wjwe7,1,2015-02-20,[Rant]/[Help] All kinds of messed up.,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2wjwe7/ranthelp_all_kinds_of_messed_up/,"The past 2 years of my life haven't gone well. I got fired halfway through an internship in Florida and moved back in with my mom for a while. Came out of the closet, fell in love with an amazing young man (who's honestly been the BEST thing that's happened to me since I moved home), and scraped by on a waiter job until I had enough to move elsewhere.

I found a full-time job that ended up exacerbating my anxiety, as did the next one. I've played brain juice roulette with a total of 3 different medications and 1 supplement, and the 3rd medication is doing reasonably well. My car died September of last year, a couple weeks after I went to the ER for suicidal thoughts; I returned in an ambulance 2 months after that. I got on that 3rd medication, but a few weeks later, I turned 26 &amp; lost my insurance. The last full-time job fired me on my anniversary with them--the longest I've ever continuously been employed with a company--because of those mental issues. So now I'm on Medicaid but I can't see a psychiatrist for another month.

Unfortunately on Sunday night my cell phone was stolen right out of my hands on the bus ride home from work; it took me over the edge and I wanted to throw myself down the stairs at work, but thankfully I got help for that and spent Monday night/Tuesday morning in the ER. However, my medication just ran out today but the doctor who prescribed it apparently won't even talk to me because I'm not on her insurance anymore. The grocery store won't fill it and because I'm on Medicaid, I was told to go to the city walk-in clinic to see a psychiatrist who could authorize a refill. But it turns out I was misled and they don't have a psychiatrist; they scheduled someone with the city earlier in March than my other appointment. I'm afraid that 

I feel mentally, physically, and emotionally tired and spent and I'd like to take a vacation to someplace warm ASAP. Good news is that I have about a thousand dollars in savings, mostly for rent, as well as some awesomely supportive friends and family.

TL;DR---Last couple years have sucked; I lost my insurance a few weeks after I got prescribed a new medication that actually works for me but I can't see a psychiatrist for a month; lots of trouble refilling the prescription and now everything's just more of a huge mess."
2wk0qk,1,2015-02-20,"In between two internships, how do I handle this without burning bridges?",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2wk0qk/in_between_two_internships_how_do_i_handle_this/,"Hi, I'm a 21 year old college student from the US.

Last summer, I had a great internship at a tech startup near home.  Great company, culture, etc. led to a wonderful experience.  I ended my internship on great terms, and was told that I would be invited/welcomed back next summer if I wanted (which I have kept in mind ever since).

However, I followed an opportunity with a large technology consulting firm, and that opportunity had developed with me getting an interview, getting the second interview, and now waiting 3-4 weeks (at this point only 1-2 weeks) for a response from the recruitment committee.  This opportunity is significantly different than my previous experience, and both of them have huge benefits in different ways. 

My plan over the past few weeks was ""ok wait to hear back from (new company i interviewed with) and then reach out to (previous internship company) and thank them for staying in touch but tell them i'm going to pursue an internship with another company""

Well, plans got derailed when I got an email this morning from my previous boss, asking me what my plans were for this summer, and including the positions available to me at the company from last summer.  I'm stressing out because I dislike being in situations where I can potentially burn bridges--even though it's the last thing I ever want to do.  

What is the best way to handle this situation?  I truly want to wait and hear back from the consulting firm, however, if that doesn't work out, I would absolutely love to work at the same company from last summer.  How do I express that without making it seem like last summer's company is a ""plan b"" type thing?


**TLDR: Interned last summer, applied to a new company this summer, waiting to hear back after interview, old company boss emailed me asking my plans for this summer, giving me options to work with them again, have to wait another 1-2 weeks to hear back from interview, how do I handle without burning bridges**"

I think it's a cross post between Relationship_Advice and PersonalFinance, but I think I would be told it's a relationship issue if I posted it there. 


Summary of my situation: my husband [28/m] had a full time job paying ~$45k/year while I [26/f] went to school for my BS full time and had paying internship making ~$500/week. Once I got my degree I started making ~$60k/year and he left his job to pursue career in real estate. 


He has been trying to make money for 10 months now, but so far it feels like he's just throwing more and more money into a house flip and says it will be finishes ""in two weeks"" for months now. My salary is enough to support us for now and I am fine with picking up all of our bills because I really do want to see him succeed- what I have a issue with is supporting his brother and father.


Before we got married by husband bought a 2 family house with the intention of one unit bringing rental income. Plans went to hell and now it's him and I living in one apartment and his father and brother [24/m] living in another. Father is unemployed. Brother has a very low paying job. Neither of them pay rent, pay utilities, not even their cell phone bills or car insurance. 


I know that my brother in law sometimes gives my husband checks from his job (not sure what amount or how frequent) but he uses them to invest in his real estate property so I never see any of it. 

As it is right now I have a well-paying job that I have no savings from because I basically am **paying for 4 people**. 




I don’t have a close relationship with the father or brother in law, so my husband is really the only person I can discuss this with. Whenever I bring up the issue his arguments are that this is his only family and he cannot ask them to move out, or if I suggested he got a part time job he gets very defensive and says I don't believe in him.He is also concerned about his younger brother that if he asks home to move out or pay for his bills he will leave and not keep in touch with the family. He also assures me that it’s all **temporary** and we are working towards a greater goal. 


I really don’t know what to do anymore. I love my husband, but I fell like an idiot allowing myself to be in this situation. 


I need an out. I hate my current job and I think I can easily find another one, but I’m afraid everything will go to shit if I make a move and somehow skip a month of salary. I also started realizing that I can’t remember anymore when I was not stressed about it or happy, I think I might be getting depressed and I am losing all motivation because a huge chunk of my paycheck goes towards covering the bills that are not my responsibility.


My friend keeps telling me I need to give my husband an ultimatum, but I don't even know where to draw a line. Please help me get out of this hole.

I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

2wk7m8,4,2015-02-20,"[Text]Match Day, a story about a crippling defeat, meant to inspire",Getpsyched2,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/2wk7m8/textmatch_day_a_story_about_a_crippling_defeat/,"Hello Reddit. Please bear with me, this is my first post to reddit. I'm usually one of the guys who reads inspiring posts and carries it throughout the day. This morning I felt compelled to return the favor. ~~I'll try to keep it short~~, but this is my story.

A little bit of background information. Today, the 3rd Friday in February is Match Day and a very important day in the life of a psychology graduate student. After numerous years of education (read: ~10 including college) it is time to be matched to an internship program to complete your doctoral degree. Interviews, traveling across the country, no sleep, laughably broke, rental cars, countless essays, revisions and cover letters all over the past few months submitted into a glorified (read: flawed) computer program all culminates today. 

As you can imagine, it can be a glorious tale of success if you are matched with a program, but it can also be a crippling defeat for someone who didn't get an invite to the ball. If you are the former, congratulations on all of your success, go out and enjoy. This is an amazing accomplishment and you and your family should be very proud. 

My story is for the latter. 3 years ago today, I did not match with a program. I did not get an invite to the ball and all 12 of my friends received better news than I did. I fell into a spiral of sadness, questioning if I did something wrong, how did this happen, what did everyone else do that I must have forgotten. I was desperate for answers, but I was looking in all the wrong places. My mistake, was that I turned inwards, and I doubted everything that I was so proud of hours before. 

The solution was that I finally reached out. I told my friends which helped remove some of the self-doubt. There is one professor in my program who I truly trusted, not only as an educator but as a friend. He made room in his schedule and saw me for over 1.5 hours. Reaching out to others got me the support that I needed to get motivated and have enough resolve to address my weaknesses and fortify my strengths. We made a plan to get additional experiences and work on interviewing skills to make sure I was an ideal candidate for internship for next year. (btw, I did try phase II later that year but also did not match)

My invite arrived next year. All of my planning and extra effort including working the extra job to support myself and gaining different clinical activities allowed me to get a top notch internship at a VA (highly competitive). Looking back, I had no shot at getting a VA internship the first time around, but I worked harder and got a better site than any of my other friends did the previous year. 

I'm writing this today to let you know that it gets better and there is light at the end of the tunnel. The system has failed graduate students because there are quite frankly too many of us and not enough spots. It became this invalidating monster and we are left to face the consequences, but you don't have to do it alone. 

All in all, it was worth waiting the extra year to get a much better site. I have since completed my internship, earned my doctorate, and moved on to a VA Post-Doctoral program. Earlier today, I submitted my application for licensure as a Clinical Psychologist.

**TL:DR** Match Day is a very emotional day, both good and bad. For the latter, reach out to others, your accomplishments are still valuable and if you get motivated and work on your clinical skills everything will work out just fine...maybe even better. Good Luck!

Edit: Some stream of consciousness grammatical errors were made and corrected. I am also learning a few new tricks!"
2wkm21,5,2015-02-20,[M20] How do I break up with my [F20] Girlfriend of 2 1/2 years? I don't think it will work out...,throwawayz28,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2wkm21/m20_how_do_i_break_up_with_my_f20_girlfriend_of_2/,"Hello guys

This is kind of a continuation from last week; 
http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2vx5ng/girlfriend_20f_may_be_cheating_on_me_20m_i_have_a/

So yeah, about a week ago I posted that my girlfriend has been doing some really shady stuff; e.g.

- Hiding her texts from me all the time
- Going out with her new social group and NEVER inviting me
- New guy is in new social group, explains a lot, they hang out basically everywhere together

- She works in uni part time and studys as well, I work full time at an internship, and we both live together for atleast another 4 months.

This might be the hardest decision I have to make. I confessed to her how I feel on monday, she went home for a few days but I couldn't wait, I told her everything, how I've been feeling through text messages (I know right, I'm a pussy for not talking to her in person) 

Anyway, she basically said that she's ""sorry I feel that way"" and it's ""not what it seems"", but didn't really tell me anything more than that... I mean, she didn't even reassure me much other than that, also an ""I'm sorry"" followed several hours later of not texting.

But man...I'm starting to get sick of her, she's out again with her new social group, out for dinner in fact. I get home from work and she's not here again... 

Honestly I don't know if I can face breaking up with her...wether she's cheating or not..it's going to hurt a lot to have ""the talk""

Every single one of you guys basically told me I should break up with her because she doesn't show me any respect...but I just don't know how to go about the thing...She's my first girlfriend so I literally have no clue how it's going to go down.

Any advice would be much appreciated guys. Thanks.

tl;dr: Girlfriend might or might not be cheating on me. She's been showing me a lack of respect and things just ain't right anyway. Think I should end it. How do I go about this."

2wktau,0,2015-02-20,Live update review of 50 Shades from the perspective of a Pats Fan [Live Update Megathread],Hitlers_bottom_Jew,Patriots,https://www.reddit.com/r/Patriots/comments/2wktau/live_update_review_of_50_shades_from_the/,"As said I'll be doing a review from the perspective of a Patriots fan. Seeing how Belicheck and the Brady bunch have played into the themes and nuances, the patwa as it were. 

Stay tuned for an in depth, completely serious and unbiased review of every teens favorite rape flick, 50Shades of Grey. 

Let's watch. 

Upon stepping into the theater I was blasted by a wall of pheromones. Perfume cut thick, but not quite so thick as the putrid smell of lee movie road head and the lingering odor of vag on the hands of every man in the theater. I felt as though a quick hand check was in order before the movie should proceed. 

The movie starts off with a collage of previews designed to excite and defile the female mind. Bull riding. Scary paranormal sex with zombies; all you can think of and more.  Still no mention of the Pats Victory over Seattle. But as it is, we are on to the intro...

""I put a spell on you"" is forced into our ears as the whiny voice and untimely bass deflates the balls of every man in the theater. Regulations are being broken, and this time it's post production. 

Lips smacking all around me. Bullshit. Get that out of you before you come in. 

We're introduced to the main character. A stubby brunette with a forced stutter and a terrible fashion sense. She's a klutz from the get go. It's clear this woman is to be taking the role of Wes Welker in the Movie. The meeting has begun, and her free agency value is being evaluated. According to inside sources, she'll sell out for a low number and has an ability to take balls all the way downfield when told to do so.

Still no mention of the World Champs. 

After an interview so awkward it could rival Belicheck's, the character is offered an internship. But declines. The movie, for all intents and purposes, should be over. But the game has just begun. As the Ravens showed us twice, there is no easy game worth winning. It's clear from the casual acting and terrible, cut off and mediocre acting that yes gentleman, I will be in this for the long haul. 

So anyway, after turning down a good opportunity with no explanation to return to a crappy job at a local hardware store, the man himself shows up to purchase rope. But of course. The plain plot of a beefed up porno story has been revealed. The only question left is, where are the titties and when can I click the buffer to get past all the bad scripting and get to the dirty? Well. God only knows when that could be, but I doubt he's watching anyway. Not out of moral rectitude but out of sheer boredom in the first five minutes. 

We're introduced to the psychopath, Christian. The name play here makes me want to puke up the two 4$ hot dogs I ate waiting for the flick to get going. He's as you'd expect. An asshole. Not much to see here. He plays this bullshit game about telling her to stay away, but let's not be fooled.  There's a whole hour and a half of irrelevant parts to deal with before we're through. 

If you're just joining us now, up until this point here's been no sex to speak of. Only the vain ploddings of a drinking, partying hardware store clerk. Christian has just called up Anna at midnight.  You know, to check on business affairs that haven't even been arranged. I presume. The plot holes are becoming larger the more complex the writer has tried to make this Smut story. All of the sudden the plumber fixing the sink for the sex starved horny wife is looking all the more likely. 

The girl awakes in bed next to a nice gesture. Some pills and a glass of water, and of course a home intruder or her kidnapper.  After he undressed and slept with her. the Twitter and tumblr warriors probably had a field day with that one. The smell of either sweaty palms or moist britches continues to rape my own senses. I must trudge on though, and take the beatings just as what's her name in the porno is going to.

Okay not much to report on until the first sex scene. Apparently she's a Virginia or something. But then the dude changes that. Pretty good porn scene. Good cinematography although I couldn't see the vag besides some lives. Kinda let down by that. Next sex scene may prove to satisfy more. Haven't heard any dicks being hammed on so looks like my view is shared by the rest of the hormone raging teens in the audience.  

Onto the next one. The relationship has progressed to the point of a normal one. The two are agitated and hopeless. I'm about to walk out as it's turning into just another Disney love story.  "
2wkx4w,3,2015-02-20,TIFU by sitting down with a guy at a bar,TastySaturday,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2wkx4w/tifu_by_sitting_down_with_a_guy_at_a_bar/,"So last night (or this AM) I decide to go out with a group of my buds and hit up two of our favorite bars just right off of campus. We head to the first one and decide it's time for a change of scenery after a couple of hours, so we head to the second bar. The first bar is one that a lot of people go to, but is mainly dominated by fraternity guys and sorority girls, whereas the second one is more of a free-for-all for all students with a possible creepy older guy every now and then. Both are almost completely college bars, so anyone who is older than mid-twenties is rather out of place. 

While we're at bar #2, I find one of my other friends that nobody else in my group knows so I hang out with him for a bit then realize that my group I came with left me. It's almost 3 AM, but it's no big deal. I was going to get a ride home from one of my friends anyway. So I go to this quieter, separated part of the bar that's more in the foyer, to call my friend to come pick me up. He doesn't answer so I figure I'll just have to walk home in the cold. Not too bad since I'm already pretty drunk and have a decent beer blanket on.

That's when this average looking guy sitting at the bar stops me and tells me to sit with him. I'm thinking that he probably just wants someone to talk to so I oblige. He asks me my name and orders a beer for each of us. I'm surprised by this gesture so I thank him and he begins asking me questions about what I do. I told him I'm a student but am currently working as an intern in my final semester. He seems surprised and almost disappointed that I'm as young as I am. He was probably just looking to make a friend closer to his age, but I'm 22 and he looks to be about 28. We talk for a couple more minutes about where we're from and he tells me that he's a ballroom dance teacher. I thought that was different but who am I to judge? Then he starts to ask me stranger questions, like whether he would know my dad, even though we're from completely different cities and then told me he thought he recognized me by my face and my hand placement. I'm getting weirded out by this guy but trying to stay conversational since he was nice enough to buy me a beer. Then out of the blue he asks me ""Why are you here?"" I have no clue what this is supposed to mean. This city? This bar? This part of the bar? I explained that I came with my friends but they left without me and he said the same thing happened to him. He then begins talking about how ""our family"" and ""our dad"" doesn't know we're here. I ask, ""Whose dad?"" and he replies with ""All of ours"". I'm beginning to feel very uneasy now as he proceeds to order us some shots after the bartender called for last call.

 At this point the questions have gotten so strange that I don't even know what he's trying to accomplish by buying me drinks, so I start to get ready to leave this guy. As I tell him I'm going to head out and I shake his hand, he drops something. He bends over to pick it up and very intentionally touches my thigh. All of a sudden the dots are connecting and I realize that I've been getting hit on for the last 10 minutes. 

I become way more anxious to leave, now, while trying not to be rude, as this was likely just a misunderstanding. But then he became extremely persistent that I stay and I had to keep repeating that I've had enough and need to go home. Even the bartender starts to pressure me into staying but I keep backing away until I'm finally able to hurry out the door. 

I'm not a homophobe by any means and have plenty of gay friends, but this experience kind of rattled me. I've always thought I'd feel flattered if a gay man ever bought me drink and I would simply explain to him that I'm straight, but in this situation, with how demanding this guy was, it made me feel so unsafe and uncomfortable and almost even guilty for not realizing what was happening. If I learned anything, I now feel like I have a new understanding of what women go through every time they get hit on at a bar or party without knowing the man's intentions. I also learned how to identify if I'm being hit on by a dude, too, I guess.

tl;dr Got hit on by a gay guy and thought I was going to be taken advantage of, but ended up gaining a new perspective."

2wlskh,1,2015-02-20,How can I change my diet while living with parents?,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2wlskh/how_can_i_change_my_diet_while_living_with_parents/,"Hey /r/fitness, I need some help... I've lost about 40 lbs from past May to November months and I'm really happy with it. However the weight losing stopped once I reached around 195 lbs (I'm 6'5"")while maintaining the same calorie deficit as before. It's been like that since November now. I still look fat right now, I lifted since I started losing weight so I don't think I look fat because I might not have any muscle. I think that reaching 180lbs will be a great goal.

I personally think that I need to change my diet by eating less carbs. Because I live in the Netherlands and also with my parents I find it super hard to eat less carbs. In our country almost everyone their breakfast is bread with various spreads or cold cuts on it. Then I also take bread with me for lunch. And in the evening I've got to eat whats been cooked. Which is pasta and potatoes for a lot of times, so that's also a ton of carbs again.

I'm 20 right now and I can get quite mad at my parents for not allowing me to eat my own type of food. I can't buy and cook it myself cause I'm on a full time internship right now where I don't get paid. I also don't have a lot of time because I got to travel ~3hrs a day and go to the gym of course.

I'm kind of clueless what to do right now. My parents already think I eat too little, and are basically controlling what I eat because they buy all the food. They're also very negative towards supplements as well, which is another problem I've been facing. My mother is the type who believes you can spot reduce fat and that eating a lot of chicken/fish/nuts won't help.

I really hope someone has some advice for me. I don't know what I can do to change my diet."
2wlu5r,1,2015-02-20,How should I qualify languages / skills listed on my resume?,odougs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2wlu5r/how_should_i_qualify_languages_skills_listed_on/,"I'm a Computer Engineering student looking for my first internship, hopefully in firmware. Until recently, my resume simply listed programming languages and operating systems in order of proficiency, from highest to lowest. Technologies which I had only dabbled in were not included. 

Several people recommended that I provide an indication of how well I know the technologies listed, so I added qualifiers in parentheses. Now it looks like this:

    Languages:          C (skilled), Assembly (MIPS, x86), Java (proficient)

    Operating Systems:  Linux (skilled), Windows (proficient)

But I have no clue if this is accurate or not. Am I actually 'skilled' with Linux, or just 'proficient'? Is there a more accurate word in between? I may be 'skilled' relative to my peers, or relative to how long I've been programming, but I'm certainly *not* 'skilled' relative to a veteran programmer. I don't know which interpretation most people will take. If I am too modest about my skills, I might not get an interview. If I inadvertently exadgerate, an interviewer might see me as arrogant or dishonest. 

I list two projects on my resume, both in C, which hopefully demonstrates that it is my prefered tool, and that I'm at least half-way competent in it. But it isn't practical to include a project for every technology I know. My best Java and Assembly programs aren't nearly as good as my best C programs. And I don't really have a Linux project; I have a jumble of scripts, tricks, and one-liners acquired from many months of playing around with the command line and using it for development... 

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!"
2wlv0s,0,2015-02-20,I'm looking for a new job; trouble is I don't know what it is.,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2wlv0s/im_looking_for_a_new_job_trouble_is_i_dont_know/,"Hi redditors,
I'm looking for a new job; trouble is I don't know what it is. 
I'm employed; I have been more often than not since graduating, as a contractor, as a freelancer sometimes,
and as an employee who made reasonable if never excessive wages.
I work in project support in lengthy public sector IT projects, have for a while, and I increasingly find that these jobs are not what I want to be doing.  I'm cut off from the kind of work my internship in the field covered, and due to the size and complexity of the department I work in, I never see the customers, end users or people I'm delivering for. The pay is fixed as a contractor, without much chance to get noticed for successful delivery, due to big, dispersed teams. There's also a LOT of bureaucracy to deal with (public sector).

For three years now I have tried unsuccessfully to transition into customer-facing roles, like sales (which I did 
for a few months after graduating until I moved) procurement, project management (which I'm perfectly qualified on paper to do), service delivery roles-ANYTHING where I'm face to face with the end-user, negotiating, making recommendations, delivering solutions, adding to the bottom line-being a people person in some field that helps develop the business, not just someone who takes orders.

I'm now only really qualified for jobs I don't want to do; what's a job where I can be in touch 
with the people my services are meant to help? 
I.e., when I was in sales, I spoke to the clients every day,  I took time to understand the industry
and the issues, what solution  would be best and how to implement it.
If I was in procurement, I'd be face to face with suppliers, discussing contracts and SLAs.
There's more to it than just that, but does that make sense? 

TL:DR-I don't feel like I get anything done at work because I'm divorced from the
end result. Where might I be more in touch with that, feel more effective?

I'm doing an internship at Staples, working with the IT guy fixing computer and doing stuff. Today, when I came back from lunch, there was an iPad air 2 waiting to be configured. They take about 30 minutes to do, so I saved my IT guy some time and did it myself. When I got to the point of creating an apple ID, I had to call the client to ask if she wanted default secret questions or if she wanted to do them with me on the phone. The conversation went as following:

Me: Hello Ms * ? I'm FishieGoRawr, calling from Staples about the iPad you bought. (There was only her name on the sheet, with her number.)

Her: Ahhh, didn't know I was going to get an iPad!

Him (The husband, in the background): *Yelling insults at me*


**TL;DR**
Unintentionally told a lady that her husband bought her an iPad for her birthday while working as the IT guy.

2wm0dc,1,2015-02-20,How much coding experience is necessary in the Computer Security field?,UglyStru,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2wm0dc/how_much_coding_experience_is_necessary_in_the/,"So I'm close to obtaining my Associates Degree in CompSci from community college, and I feel like my coding knowledge is bare minimum. I know basic syntax for VB.NET, C++, Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. However, I'm taking a Computer Security class and finally realized this is the kind of stuff I want to do for the rest of my life. I spoke briefly with my professor about what path I should take for my education, and he said I need to know both Networking aspects and Coding aspects. Networking is stuff I feel like I could get the hang of after reading enough and completing my internship, but coding is a bitch to me and I generally hate it. I also don't pick up on coding very quickly, and I feel like it's always a struggle for me to learn new things. So if I eventually want to go into this field, how much will I need to know in the programming field?"
2wm13v,109,2015-02-20,Please help. I'm desperate. First time moving out home and have (almost) no incomes,throwaway20150220,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/2wm13v/please_help_im_desperate_first_time_moving_out/,"Hey /r/frugal I created¹ this throwaway account to seek for some advice on my   situation. I'm a 22M moving out home for studies, actually I already study in this city but was living with relatives of mine, now my sister will be joining the same university as I do and we'll be living on our own. 

I have no incomes besides a +150$ scholarship every month (until Dec. 2015)  for a internship I own. We'll be living with my parents' financial support. We are renting an apartment (2 bedrooms + kitchen and living room +  bathroom) for 500$, didn't signed the contract yet by the way.  I intend to rent one bedroom for a roomate, so we can drop the expenses. 

My parents' situation is ""I don't really know"". So I don't know if and how much we can afford, I asked my father but he says 'that's okay' to the new condition and refuses to enter in details to not bother us with this subject as we're purposed only to study. So I am looking to make this as frugal and cheap as I can. 

So I come here to ask you, my friends, how can I make it as frugal as possible on the following subjects:

1) Food 
I am the one who cooks, so my goals are: healthy, nutritive *and* cheap.
And will be the one who shops because I don't dare to trust this task to my sister because she'd buy anything she see without looking to the prices and throwing the bill to my father. 

2) Household maintenance (water, cleaning, electricity and cooking gas bill)
Info: We don't own any cars, will be using public transportation. 
Info2: I have 1 bed + mattress, 1 couch/bedroom, 1 freezer (that will be very useful for bulking), 1 TV, 1 fan. I don't have any  fridge or stove, btw. Any advices on that? Electrical oven/stove would be better than gas-fuel one?

3) Clothing and health assistance
I don't have a health care assistance, but I can use the equivalent here to the NHS...cannot use public dental care system though (because I'm over 18). 
And will always wear blue jeans and plain black or white t-shirts, so no too pricy to clothe but my sister... uh, er... she's a girl. How to convince a girl to go frugal and not spend every penny on clothes and shoes or worsen: gadgets?

4) Keeping the household budget with a sister that likes (or doesn't know how) to spend money. And that's the hardest part. How to convince her without looking like a /r/frugaljerk? 

5) And last, I am **feeling very scared**. I feel very scared because for the first time I'll be responsible for a household and wanna make it as functional and frugal as I can. Am I forgetting anything? 

I know I might be on the right track (this sub has helped me a lot), but I feel like I need some advice to not misdoing/misconducting the situation.

Thanks A LOT in advance.

-----
¹ Have some concerns on privacy. 

² My father gives me ~ 120$ monthly (to personal expenses) + 200$ for my currently rent (includes lunches and dinners). Also used to pay roughly 500$ monthly on my sister's college tuition. *Thanks God* she now was accepted in a federal [public] school, so no tuitions for her. 


PS: I live in Brazil, I think it's a relevant information to justify the prices (said in dollars) 1 USD = 2.87 BRL  and the university system. Also to excuse my bad English grammar, sorry, not native. Furthermore, just for the acknowledge: the minimum wage here is around 250$ so what seems to be cheap may not be *that* cheap compared to the minimum wage."
2wm2c5,0,2015-02-20,Best places to start a career in software development?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2wm2c5/best_places_to_start_a_career_in_software/,"So I live in Vancouver B.C and I currently have an associates and I'm working towards a bachelors degree in computer science. Recently I've been looking at how much a typical software developing job pays in my area and it seems to be relatively low compared to other places. 

What are some cities that pay more for software developers and would it be worth moving to them after graduating? 

Also a side question is it a good idea to do a co-op/internship before graduating? I currently have an internship lined up for the summer and I'm wondering if this is the best choice or if I should just concentrate on getting my degree first. 

Thanks in advance for answering my questions and I look forward to your responses."
2wm8h0,4,2015-02-20,Can't find an internship. Can't get good enough grades for my parents. Losing all my will to live.,dogcat123,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2wm8h0/cant_find_an_internship_cant_get_good_enough/,"Hello reddit,

I have struggled with depression all my life. I have struggled with thoughts of suicide all my life. The thought of throwing myself off a tall building sends chills down my spine. Thinking about hurting myself numbs my inner pain. But I need help.

I'm 20 years old, currently in University studying engineering. I'm expected to find an internship this year to graduate, but I'm struggling. Not to mention that my parents are threatening to kick me out of the house if I don't find a summer or year long job. They put so much pressure on me. My older brother is their pride and joy. Successful, rich, happy. My dad calls me worthless and a failure. My mom doesn't understand me at all either. All they care about is getting that 4.0 GPA and a job with a decent company.

I've been trying to figure out why I'm getting so many rejections. Its not because I don't have experience or the grades, I have the same, if not more than other students. I've been doing some introspection, and I've found out why people don't call me for interviews.

My cover letter and resume suck, no matter how hard I try. They suck because I have no self-esteem, no confidence and enthusiasm, on the inside. Your cover letter reflects who you are, and that is who I am. Useless, a coward, not worth hiring at all. 

I've accepted that I'm just a terrible person who'll never succeed because I'm messed up on the inside. I've been feeling like hurting or killing myself on a daily basis. I find myself muttering ""I'm going to kill myself"" under my breath all the time, just automatically.

I've considered going to therapy, but I am too much of a chicken to even do that. So this is my last place to go. I am losing my mind and I need help. Please. I don't want to die. I want something to fix me. To make me happy."
2wmahr,13,2015-02-20,Is it better outside the US?,asianmaslife,AsianMasculinity,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianMasculinity/comments/2wmahr/is_it_better_outside_the_us/,"So, a little background, I'm a 5'10'' Chinese-American college student who's always been confused as to where he stands with the ladies. 

American girls just don't tell me they are attracted to me the way they do to other (white) guys. I just don't get the same signals that my white friends get. Instead of baring their chest or casually asking them out, I get awkward stares and hesitant suggestions, like they're not sure they like me or they don't think I'm into them. 

Of course, the easiest way to find out would have been to ask them, but with really nothing to go on and a lot of low self esteem due to perceived social stigma about my racegender, I was just too anxious. 

About a year ago, I went to Europe for a week-long trip and I was actually blatantly hit on. I was so stunned I didn't even react. I was just so used to getting mixed signals from girls here.

I feel like it would have been different had I been raised in China. Most men seem to know where they stand with girls by the time they get to my age. I might be going back for an internship over the summer so I guess I'll see. 

What are your out of country experiences? Do girls treat you differently back ""home"", or in other countries? 

Edit: Apologies for all the late responses. This account was a throwaway and after I posted I never looked back at the thread because I was afraid that I'd get called out for being racist, narcissistic, cowardly, etc. I'm overwhelmed by the positive response I got so thank you all for that."

2wn05m,6,2015-02-21,I just wanted to say I'm happy I'm succeeding.,Trying_To_Learn_Shit,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2wn05m/i_just_wanted_to_say_im_happy_im_succeeding/,"Hey /r/EngineeringStudents, I've been on this sub a while through various accounts and I've posted on, voted on, and commented on the various struggles, successes, and failures of us engineering students. Out of all of it I just feel really happy that I'm doing well in school. Im pursuing a double major in CE and EE and as a sophomore in week 7 out of 10 in my 2nd quarter, who hasn't taken any GEs yet, I currently have the golden 4.0 and above 98% in all of my classes this quarter as well. Now it seems like im bragging doesn't it? I'm really not. There is so much sacrifice that comes along with the work that I put in socially and with respect to sleep/being healthy etc. Sometimes I feel like just stopping and returning to a more ""normal"" life but I find the success and the knowledge too addicting. 

A couple months ago I was really scared about the whole internship hunt like everyone here is currently or was at one time, and I am really happy that I have been fortunate enough to get an internship for this upcoming summer at one of the leading companies in the world related to my field, as well interview/offers for many others in both hardware and software. 

Every class I take my professors get to know me at a personal level simply because im trying so damn hard to do well they know my face and who I am and what I'm doing. Every quarter professors email me to tutor for there class once I'm done. I don't even need to ask, and I think that's a great position to be in.

I'm typing all of this out because I really can't talk about this stuff in person to my friends and peers, who are mostly all competitive STEM and premed people. Jealousy starts to root itself, and I've seen some of it already, but I really feel like I should be able to tell someone that I am doing well. I ought to have the social right to feel proud that the insane amount of work that I put in is paying off and that the opportunities I have are plentiful.

Well anyway thanks for reading, you can downvote this if you want, just don't do it out of jealousy because then you're just part of the negative atmosphere being created in STEM environments. 

I believe everyone here is capable of accomplishing great things and needs to be motivated to do so. Keep on engineering /r/EngineeringStudents.

(also if anyone has any questions or anything feel free to comment? I'm not some engineering guru but I've picked up some tricks and techniques here and there)."
2wn09s,5,2015-02-21,Unemployment woes,jpofreddit,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2wn09s/unemployment_woes/,"I graduated last summer in computer science and didn't do anything for 3 months. Then January started looking for a job only to find its not ""STEM major? Here's a free job"". I'm applying to places but I know I'm not the best candidate, I never did any internship (that acquaintance who warned me I should do them was right), my coding skill is off, and I barely have any side-projects, I did really well on my final project which my prof likes so I have that. Funny thing is I know I am good if I have confidence and practice.

I'm making a site for my dad's company but I struggle to motivate myself to do anything. Every so often on nights like this my mind races, the feelings of inadequacy and stress mounts 10x and I feel awful almost to the point of panic. I feel I need to calm down, structure myself, make a plan. Already I'm dieting, swimming 3x a week, and going to a chorus weekly (but I'm too messed up to talk with anyone beyond pleasantries). But the one thing I want, truly want and can't control is the job. My diets shaky as is with frequent mess ups due to stress and swimming today I felt the first feeling of (maybe I shouldn't go), luckily I did. My parents are supporting me at their (our) home just fine, I can have all the time I want but I need to push myself else I'll never grow up.

I guess I just wanted to say all my thoughts. This is such a tumultuous time in my life, things can either go very wrong or they can go up. Anyone have similar experience to this? Maybe this is how all recent grads feel or some anyway."
2wn0hb,27,2015-02-21,An email from a friend that recently passed away.,x1503,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2wn0hb/an_email_from_a_friend_that_recently_passed_away/,"Hi you, 


How are you? I realize I probably passed away by now and I hope you are not freaking out too much. Don't miss me too much either, I am in a better place. I don't know if anyone would believe what I am about to tell you in this email and I don't know how you will be reacting to this. But just hear me out, I know you will at least try to understand. You're the only one who ever does. 

I fell in love shortly after graduating from college. I know we didn't talk that much but I just started a job as a marketing intern at a big company. The first day of work I saw the most beautiful girl in my life. She showed me everything there is to know, not just the layout of the office, but everything in life. She had the most genuine laugh that is almost contagious. She is radiant and she is the one and I know it. It didn't take long before I called her mine. 

As I progress up the hierarchy in the company food chain, my work load got busier and busier. I would leave work at like 4 in the morning and go home, take a shower, and went back to work. Every night I would only get to see her peaceful sleeping face in our bed. That didn't discourage her. She would leave notes here and there reminding me to take care of myself, and that she loved me very much. 

On March 19th, I had the biggest presentation with an important client. In the middle of the meeting, she called. I could see it on the screen of my phone but I couldn't pick up, I was in the middle of presenting. After the meeting I got a call from an unfamiliar number. It was the hospital calling and telling me that she had been in an automobile accident and she had passed away. I couldn't hold myself together. I dropped to my chair and held my head as hard as I could. How can that happen to the most important person in my life? I can't possibly continue. I took work off for the rest of that day. I rushed to the hospital as quickly as I can to see her lying there, lifeless. 

I went home to get changed quickly and get onto the preparations for the funeral. She didn't have any family, they all died in a fire when she was 2. She didn't have much friends either, they were all out of the city and I didn't know them that well. By the time I got to our room, I couldn't cry anymore tears. Her peaceful sleeping face wasn't there to greet me, and the room was missing that soft gentle deep breaths. 

The next month was a blur. I was basically dead. I don't remember anything at all. I went to work, and went home. That's all. Until one day, I was at the supermarket when I saw an old man reaching for something on the top shelf. I went over and helped him out. He looked at me and strangely he asked, ""you look sad, what's wrong young man."" I squeezed out something that resembles a smile and said I was fine. 

""She is gone you know,"" he said. ""What would you give to see her again?""

I didn't answer him right away. My heart was pounding so fast. Everything. I would give everything. But he was gone already. 

The next morning I woke up and carried on with my daily routine. I made some sandwich but I didn't even want to eat. That was when the door bell rang. I was not prepared to see who was at the door. 

It was her. She was alive. She smiled at my totally shocked face.
""What's wrong? Did you see a ghost or something?"" She chuckled, and she came in. She was alive. 
 
""Seriously sweetheart. Is something wrong?"" She asked, confused. I don't know what was going through my mind that moment. But all I know is she was alive and I needed to hold her so tight in my arms. She was there with me. My eyes shot to the calendar on the wall, it was February 20. 

I didn't bother to process and understand what was happening or how she was alive. But all I could accept was that I have been given a second chance. She was alive and she was mine. 

The next few weeks I came home from work early every night. I would take her out and buy her presents. I made her breakfast every morning like I would when we first started dating. I gave her surprises every chance that I got. 

One evening we were at the supermarket shopping for groceries when she went off to get a jug of milk. The old man was there again. He smiled at me and waved at me to come closer. 

""She is beautiful. I am glad you're happy you know. But fate won't change, and life still happens the way it is supposed to,"" he said. 

She called me and I looked back at her. But when I turned around again, he was gone. My heart sank. Even though I might not understand anything that was happening, I could at least understand that. She is going to die on March 19. 

I am writing this email to you right now on March 18. I have set the sent time to March 23. I don't know how you are taking all of this but it doesn't really matter to me. 

I am not losing her again you know? She is going to die, and this time, I am not letting her go alone.

Mavs please waive Raymond Felton.  He isn't getting taller or younger and, at cost of 4.5mil in cap-space this summer he is not worth having as a garbage time PG.  With Rondo, Ellis, Harris and Barea, we have enough players to move around to cover the spot in case of injury.  What is needed now is someone that is switch to guard positions 1-3 and hit 3s and be a piece for the future.  I know this might affect the locker-room chemistry but if we drop him now we can get a head start on a guy that might be useful next year.

A) Jordan Crawford. 6'4"" with 6'7"" wingspan. No reason why this guy should not be on an NBA team right now.  He is a good NBA player and at the age of 26, we could have a good piece to build with Parsons.  Carlisle will like that he is an established player with a small amount of playoff experience.

B) Jamaal Franklin.  6'5"" with 6' 11.25"" wingspan. This is the guy we hoped Ledo would be and at the age of 23 he is Ledo 2.0, build with better length, better shooting, and with slashing abilities.  

C) Buyout guy.  The reason why I think the Mavs didn't cut Felton for Stoudemire was to leave room to pick up one more buyout player.  Victor Claver, Thomas Robinson....Perkins (I know).  I don't know how any of these guys fit and there might be on the add on the list in the next 7 days, but anyone is better than a 6'1"" garbage time player at the most loaded position in the league. 

I don't hate Felton, really no reason to feel either way about the guy, but there is no reason to hang on to him at this time.

What are your thoughts?  Is Felton needed on this team? Do we need to maximize every roster spot?

the next few days were rough, and after work i'd just go home and bury my face in my pillow for the night. then she called to apologize. she asked if she could take it back; she wanted to talk more and see if it could work. i was ecstatic. over the next few weeks we talked, texted, and emailed in parallel, having a million conversations. she got my hopes super high, and was even planning to visit me. but yesterday she broke my heart again. it came down to matters of faith; she's extremely religious, and i'm extremely not. i am so disappointed in her for giving up so easily, because i respect her perspective and would have liked a chance to learn about it, but at the same time i know it was a prudent decision. i miss her and i'm mad at her and i feel like damn fool.

in the meantime, Annie has been having a hell of time dealing with my breaking up with her. i've talked to her twice since, and both times she's gone down a list of things she's done to change and seems to be sincerely thinking of how to be a better girlfriend. she's begging me to take her back and it tears at my heart. i've mostly been able to cling to my initial reasons, but once i started feeling Sarah slip away it got a lot harder. i still think Annie and i have to go our separate ways. i've gotten what i have feared for literally years - i'm losing both of them. i feel more alone right now than i have ever felt before.

anyway, i just had to get that off my mind. you don't have to respond, but thank you for listening. i just read [this thread's comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1y8it1/i_just_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_of_2_years_and/) and it helped a lot. i recommend it to anyone in a tangentially related situation.


---


**Background**

my gf (call her Annie) and i have been going out for 4 years. we met as interns at a company, started dating, and a few months later she went off to grad school. we have lived a few hours apart since then. she's doing her doctorate and i'm working a couple part-time jobs, so we're both super busy. we see each other a weekend every 2-3 weeks. she's been very supportive of me when i've had trouble - becoming unemployed and depressed, moving across the country, and even just taking care of my pet. but unless we're visiting each other, we hardly interact on a daily basis.

the other girl (call her Sarah) is a good friend from high school i had a crush on, that admittedly i never quite got over. part of the reason is because we've stayed in-touch since then, no matter where in the world we are. there's no guarantee that she has any feelings for me other than friendship, but i haven't tested that since high school - and at that time she had those feelings, but there were other complications. anyway, right now she lives far away.

**Problem 1**

Annie and i enjoy each other's company when we're together, but when we're apart we lead entirely independent lives. our phone calls are really short and typically superficial. emails and texts are too. to be completely honest, i have no interest in the silly memes and cat pictures she sends me, or the lolol's or frowny face responses i get to (what i think) are very personal messages needing a thoughtful response. her stance is that her work is so demanding she doesn't have much emotional capacity for complex responses - which is understandable, but in my view not compatibile with my needs. when we do talk, her attitude is generally defeated, tired, or just unhappy. i have tried for years to help her have hope and be happy day-to-day, so it's been constantly up-hill.

on the other hand, i get clever and thoughtful messages from Sarah no matter how simple the subject. we have a history of that quality of communication because right after i left our hometown i broke down and bared my heart to her, and the result was many many long phone and email conversations ultimately limited by distance - we were both starting college, so changing speeds at that point seemed impossible. a lot of time has passed since then, but the quality of conversation persists. we lead independent lives, but any media or random thoughts we share seem to provide a clear window into each others' day-to-day experiences and interests.

**Problem 2**

Annie's family and my family are fundamentally different, and, down the road, i don't think i want to be part of hers. in my family we look out for each other, enjoy going to see each other, crack jokes constantly, and have few quarrels.  Annie's family seems disjointed by comparison - when she's home she spends most of her time on her computer or out with friends, half the family's across the ocean and hard to visit, and there are often conflicts and competition between her parents and her local aunts/uncles. her parents and i don't have much to talk about, but i do try to take interest and ask about their lives.

Sarah seems to love her family get-togethers (i usually get a fun photo and barrage of messages talking about the event). i knew some of her family when we were high school and generally liked them. she even talks about the fun things her grandparents do. from her descriptions, her family is like mine.

**Problem 3**

Annie doesn't seem to have life goals. she's getting her doctorate because she didn't know what else to do after undergrad. she's in her 4th year with about 1.5 years to go, and she hasn't tried to figure out the next step. she's working her ass off, and ""just doesn't want to deal with it right now"". i have trouble understanding that because i've worked my ass off the last few years to get on a career path i really enjoy. i want to have a career i enjoy and i want to travel the world and maybe have kids some day - so i'm working towards those things. i don't see Annie shooting for anything but a consistent paycheck.

Sarah loves what she does. she's moving up at work and getting more responsibility all the time, but has planned every day of paid-time-off for the next year. i admire her for that.

the contrast between these two relationships makes my brain tie up in knots. even if i were to never end up with Sarah, she's a model of someone i want to spend the rest of my life with. i'm worried that i'm going to be unhappy with Annie. please help me sort myself out.

**TL;DR**

brain is in knots because of two women in my life. both friendships are at a distance. gf is great in some ways, but the differences in our personalities, family life, and ambitions have never sat well with me. i've kept in touch with my good friend (and crush) from high school, and am feeling overwhelmed by how much our family life, personalities, and ambitions still agree. please help

thank you"
2wnx9a,1,2015-02-21,"22M4F Multiple Prompts (Including Anal, Superheroes and drugs)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2wnx9a/22m4f_multiple_prompts_including_anal_superheroes/,"Hi I’m looking for a lovely “lady” that would like to role play with me. I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

2woamx,8,2015-02-21,Reneging on internship offer (not your typical scenario),winter_star,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2woamx/reneging_on_internship_offer_not_your_typical/,"This will be a bit of a long post, but I'll try to be as succinct as possible. Back in about November, I received and accepted an internship offer with a large defense contractor ('dream company' for most people). I was extremely excited even though the location was 5 hours from me, and I wasn't being offered relocation assistance. I decided this was fine, since I expected I'd be going far from home for an internship to begin with. 

Now fast forward a few months. I have recently had some personal and financial hardships (I won't go into detail), that will make it very difficult for me to do this internship. Since this internship requires a security clearance, I have still been interviewing with other companies and have now received two other offers from very reputable companies (though different industry), both commutable from my house. To make matters worse, I do not have a permanent offer for this defense internship since I have no obtained security clearance yet. From my research, I have about a 50/50 change of obtaining interim (which is much stricter than final), and I should have no trouble obtaining final. However, this company has not been clear to me whether interim or final is required, and the process has not even started yet. From what I understand, a final clearance takes a few months to receive. When I talked to my HR representative, she told me she wasn't sure how getting the clearance was going to work. I have 2 weeks to accept the other offers, and I can't let those offers go in my situation, especially when I do not have a permanent offer from this company. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this?"
2wogfq,17,2015-02-21,The most beautiful act of love I've seen,ohoisin,love,https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/2wogfq/the_most_beautiful_act_of_love_ive_seen/,"I’m a first year doctor working in a cancer hospital.  I saw true love – on Valentine’s Day, no less. And I have to share it. My head and heart may burst otherwise.

One of the joys (thick sarcasm here) of being an intern is getting to cover the hospital at night. This means taking care of anywhere from fifty to seventy patients during the hours when the patients’ primary teams are home living their lives outside the hospital.  This also means I don’t know the patients that well, other than what I’m told by the resident who signs them out.  Needless to say, it’s fucking terrifying, and probably not all that safe. But it’s a ubiquitous practice in healthcare, and necessary.  And to be fair, my job is not to cure anybody. It’s mostly writing orders for sleep and pain medication, following-up blood tests, and knowing who to call for help when you see that a patient is getting really sick.

I got a call early in the evening from a nurse who was worried about her patient’s IV line. She thought it looked a little funky, and wanted my opinion about whether or not it was infected. In patients with leukemia, a type of blood cancer, even the tiniest infections can quickly become life threatening. So I went to go see the patient.  

When I walked into the room, there was this sweet old lady sipping her apple juice and eating the last of her graham crackers. She didn’t have much of an appetite, thanks to her fungal pneumonia, and thanks to the experimental chemotherapeutic drug she had just started.  Unfortunately, her disease hadn’t responded to conventional chemotherapy – so this drug was a last ditch effort. 

By this point, the leukemia had fucked enough with her red blood cells that she needed daily transfusions in order to keep from becoming profoundly anemic. It had fucked with her healthy white blood cells enough, that there were none left to fight infections (hence, the fungal pneumonia). It had completely fucked with her platelets, the cells needed to help kick-start blood clots. Normal platelet levels are between 150,000 and 400,000 per cubic millimeter. This lady had 2,000 – well below the level needed to prevent spontaneous bleeding. And daily platelet transfusions had done nothing to bring her numbers up.

All things considered, she looked great. Her IV line looked good too. It was just a little irritated from when it was replaced earlier in the day. We chewed the fat for a few minutes, chatting about which state produces the best apples, and whether apple juice or apple cider is better. I said goodbye, and wished her a good night.

Fifteen minutes later, I got a call from the same nurse that our lady was unresponsive. I had the nurse call a rapid response – which in our hospital buys you a timely ICU consult – and went to see her.  She was now slumped over in bed, empty apple juice still in hand, unresponsive to voice, unresponsive to a really hard knuckle rub on the sternum. Her heart was still beating well. But her breathing was more labored. And when I looked into her eyes, her right pupil was widely dilated, and wouldn’t constrict in light – not a good sign. With the rapid change in her mental status, agonal breathing, blown pupil, and platelets level of 2,000 – everything was pointing toward a spontaneous brain bleed. So I called the neurologist, and ordered a CT scan of the head to get that ball rolling. 

In the meantime, I confirmed that her husband was the designated health care proxy, or her surrogate decision maker, and I gave him a call at home. When he picked up, he immediately went into the classic old-man speech about “do you have any idea what time it is??” – I cut him off right away, told him who I was, what was happening and that his wife may need to have a tube placed in her throat to help her breathe. We wanted to confirm that this was in line with her wishes before it became necessary. He said it was, and started on his way to the hospital.  In the interim, her breathing did become more labored, and the ICU intubated and put her on a ventilator. 

She was transported to the CT scanner, ventilator in tow, and had images taken. To my horror, they showed a massive hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe, which at this point had grown enough to push healthy brain away from the midline. In just about every other area of the body, you can bleed internally, and the tissues will stretch to accommodate the growing volume of blood. This is not so in the head. The bony skull is too rigid in adults to give way to high internal pressures. So what eventually happens, is that the blood pools in brain, and pushes all of the tissue out of a hole called the foramen magnum, where the spinal cord enters the skull. Vital brain stem structures that control breathing get squished, and the patient dies. This is what was going to happen to this patient, without a doubt, within the next hour or so. No question. Nothing that any neurosurgeon, or miracle worker could do about it.  Though we knew it already, it was our job to break this awful news to her husband when he arrived, in the early hours of Valentine’s Day. 

The ICU fellow and I met him when he arrived at the hospital. He was a gentle old man, and had a youthful energy about him that you wouldn’t expect for someone who had spent the last few years running to and from the hospital almost every day. He struck me as one of the rare people who are so comfortable just being, that it brings comfort to everyone else around them. This was good, because my guts were in a wicked twist at the thought of having this conversation. I would’ve puked if it weren’t for his calming aura.

The three of us sat down in a quiet conference room, and the ICU fellow walked through everything. The sudden change in his wife’s condition, the brain bleed, the lack of options, the fact that she would die from it without artificial support. And at the end, a question was posed to the husband about how he would like to proceed. Keep her on the ventilator, keep her breathing, but with no hope of reversing the condition? Or take out the breathing tube, and make her comfortable in her last moments? 

He looked at me and said he knew the leukemia had been winning the battle for a while. That the experimental drug was their last Hail Mary. That “those damn platelets just wouldn’t budge,” and that he knew the end was close. If it weren’t the bleeding that killed her, it would be the infection, or something else unpleasant. He didn’t want her to die with tubes in her throat, or to endure violent, futile chest compressions. He wanted the tube pulled. And he wanted “his love to be comfortable.” After verbalizing this, he looked me in the eye, and asked if I agreed. The lump in my throat dropped to my stomach, and exploded – but I managed to nod, and say yes. 

So that’s what happened. She was extubated, placed on a morphine drip for comfort, and helped to die peacefully. After she died, her husband wanted a few extra moments with her. As I turned to close the door behind me, he leaned down and kissed her forehead. It’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen in my life. I fucking lost it right there in the hallway.

I know you will know what I mean.
We the people have got to stop these assasinations of people like Hillies x school lover were found screwing and the door lady was killed.
The news is too GOV controlled.
I WILL fight till I die to plan a future for these people of USA free of gangland like FEDs whom I hate for doing what they did to me. Check files on my 18th to 20-21st birthday. I was never that guy, poverty did it to me but now I am better. Back to corruption, I need a job in politics I would never sell out in fear of possible death or inprisinment and I dont like other country's for traveling at least now.
You get endorced by Clinton I hope you can be trusted. Maybe all this SHIstuff all these years have built up till your new position opens but will you really tell us the truth or keep us in the dark so we are calm. What is calm, we are not going to riot if the GOV tells us the truth in a way we can handle.
Our views seem close at times. 
Have someone find me, not a Cop in Mass. but someone stealthy and trustworthy. The Good GOV needs me and my views and intell I can retain and have. I need a job and I want to work with you if needed maybe as an intern to earn secret clearance. Like I dont already have some. I do not want the bible to come true anymore, revelations=symbolism.
I want to help, I have since I was a little boy wanted this world to coexist not exactly peacefully because we need to vent but safe and happy as it was for me in the 80's.
You knew of 9-11 why did you not do something?
Contact law I know, secret info clause.
Dang Bushy was waiting for it to happen in that school very far away I bet.
It first dawned on me in the warm months before. Believe me. A radio commertion with an oriental said in a funny voice nine one one, nine one one twice, I dont know the commertial
I just heard it a couple times and I got a feeling and did picture the date in my head then I put it together our emergency number was also a date. Then I blew it off and forgot till it happened months after. My friends and family know I can be a little psycic. You should understand as worldly and having daughters that might have had psycic experiances. I gotta go to bed so I can turn in my first Business Law midterm. Im going to be a succsessful Entrapenor/Lawer. Run that on your future tell program. I have been held back by the paranoya of the days I was being tracked, all ways. How do you think I learned we had the ability to take over cable systems at a touch of a button. It was not just punishment. Richy Jelica of londonderry NH, for tracking purposes was the one whom manipulated me via order of his captore's the unknown at the time DEA. Which is a trigger unconciously for the main words user think without saying. EA on bills, kids see E and A as there favorite past time at clubs and elsewhere. What are we going to do?
This term is a term of repair and telling of secrets that will win you 2.
Just keep the cops off my tail with all I know and I may be a usefull part of your office. Bush I offered to be a body guard, you I offer my most civilian efferts to stop the control of corruption in ALL walks of Government. This is funny, I always saw GW as cobra commander of GI-JOE. I dont know why.
My birth and MK-s tainting of my life will end and my god given place in the next 200+ years will be my greatest victory over Sham houston the medical army lie and test facility. You know whats funny I still think my dad was an agent during NAm made to forget his missions cause he cant hide that from me with acting aloof. I think Michelle in her early years was the Russian comrad in Dark skys the alien show that did not last not due to lack of interest. If that movie is really about my DAD in the army he's a hero whom saved me Reagan and his wife and the world.
Back in the 70's we knew when aliens would abduct. Wow thats the program I talk of that can pretty much predict the future.
I hope we dont let those alien beings obduct anymore or when I build my masterpiece a replica of a Starship I dreamt of or really saw my 17th year in Nashua NH going west from westgate villiage in month may I think.
I will love to get in Star Trek battles.
Maybe my dad isnt that guy but I did see similaritys with michelle being russian, my step mom by the way if your files dont show her. She does seem to be hiding from something, maybe her husbands assasination, Mr Lombardo. He was making Cell phones when I was 10 that you plug in. Corporate, family, or the Competitors must have killed him if she didnt. He had a small business and I dont see why she gave it up when my dad and I could have continued and cell phones would have come out 5-10 years sooner. It might have been a plug in version of a Fed phone like a Vergil in NET FORCE. Thats my world where I want to be someday. 
Nice writing to you, if you dont win something needs to be done about not just the corruption but the EVIL power that lies in what we call our government.
TTYL after the elections if I dont think of anything else juicy.

Currently I have an internship that pays decently well for what it is, and the hours are excellent. I can work as many hours as I want during the week, and can work when I want, pretty much where ever I want, whether that's from home or in the office. After recently graduating, I've started looking at new jobs and full time opportunities and interviewing heavily. I am also now expecting my first bundle of joy which means that I'm going to have to be making it a bit more than I am now. The thing is I don't want to leave the company that I'm at, I really like the environment there and it's the first job that I've had that don't dread going into. There is currently an opening there for a full time position in which I am totally qualified for, but the new position makes the same as I do right now which wouldn't be enough to cover all of my coming expenses. Would it be out of the question to talk to my manager to see if there is a way that I can apply towards that job, and if I get it, keep my current position and responsibilities and possibly make more than what I currently am? Would be terrible to tell them what's going on in my personal life to see if that changes anything? My mangers and I do have a really good relationship, and from what I can tell they like me, I just don't want to jeopardize that or have them take away my current position all together. 

tl;dr: Is it out of the question to ask your manager for some kind of hybrid position and tell them about my needs regarding my personal life? "

I am currently in the east coast for a internship that was fully paid for, and I have a relationship with a girl from the west coast because we go to college over there that has lasted for 6 months already. At my home in the west coast, I am doing extremely well for my age. I have a 3.5 GPA at a great university, I'm a manager at a pretty big establishment on campus, own a brand new car and am pretty fit. She currently has a 2.4 gpa, no job and drinks/smokes weed every weekend/sometimes even on weekdays.

Description:  
Basically I have trust issues cause of some recent events in my life. This girl is great and is my first love, but something in my head is always telling me that she is cheating on me. I really don't know why because she has stated that she is faithful to me but I don't believe her. I feel like some of her texts she sends me trigger my response, such as ""Sorry I had my hands full"" and how   she handles the stuff I tell her, often just replying with one or two words.  

I called her out on a phone call and told her to tell me if she is cheating right now. She responded with ""Do you mean right at this moment?"" and when I said yes she said ""No, are you serious right now?"" and at that point I was just stressed out and said ""I'm done with you"" and she said fine and I hung up.  

I kept telling myself ""look, this is better for you, man the fuck up""  but I would always think about her, at work and off work. To that point, i just couldn't take it and I called her and apologized, and she did forgive me, but now it's just weird. She used to text/snapchat me all the time and we would always talk (She also said I love you first to me) but now she never texts or snapchats me first, and I have to start talking to actually get her to say something to me.  

**Now I am not going to pretend that I am mr. perfect, cause i am not.
**

I have had sex with about two other girls, and have hooked up/kissed about 7 other girls ever since I met her. I have already got with two girls in the east coast. She has hooked up with two other people but it's understandable because I was pushing away the thought of a relationship with her at the time (I have known her for about a year, only started a relationship 6 months ago).  

I feel horrible when I think about her getting with another guy, but I have gotten with a number of girls even when we were serious. She has never known and I stopped doing this now, but I don't know how I can be such a hypocrite and say that she can't get with anyone on my watch when I was doing this.  

**Also, just to put this out, the day I broke up with her she had a new friend on facebook that I saw a notification for on my timeline. it turns out that I knew this guy because she would post snapchats with him but with other people. I clicked on his profile and saw that he ""started a new relationship"" the next day after I broke up with her.  Is this a coincidence?  

I could really use some serious advice here. When I called her and apologize, she said ""If you do this again, I will seriously be done with you and that's it"" and I don't really want to lose her. I know I am a douche by pushing her away and even getting with other girls while I was with her, but I love her and I can't stop thinking about her about this. I have started smoking cigarettes and drinking more cause this is seriously stressing me out. What should I do? I will appreciate any advice given."
2wp9wz,1,2015-02-21,Me [23F] with my BF [25M] of 2.5 years. Trying to work through unresolved feelings and be intimate again.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2wp9wz/me_23f_with_my_bf_25m_of_25_years_trying_to_work/,"Apologies for the wall of text. I (23F) have been dating my boyfriend (25M) for about 2 1/2 years now. The beginning of our relationship was pretty tumultuous - I had a handful of other partners before him, one of which was a long-term bf and others who I would feel nauseated seeing today. To put it bluntly, they were just shitty, gross people. Anyway, he had been with a couple of girls before me. One of them was his long distance high school girlfriend who he only really saw once. After a while their relationship went south and his gf's mother called his parents to inform them about his controlling behavior and emotional stress he was causing his gf. I want to chalk it up to being a dumb teenager, but I'm not sure. 

Back to our relationship, though. I say it was tumultuous because he couldn't handle my past at all. Kept bringing it up, needed to know details, kept asking the same questions and every time it would end the same way - there would be name-calling, we'd both be extremely upset, sometimes to the point of crying, and a day or two would be ruined at a time. This took a huge emotional toll on both of us.

Around the same time that all of this was happening, we had moved to another city for a few months for an internship, and we both hated it. We were seriously depressed and couldn't wait for the internship to end. I almost never wanted to have sex. We came home, and for a few months things were okay. Then he had to move away from our city for a job, and I stayed in said city for school. This made things even worse. Most days we would talk online while he wasn't busy at work and he would bring the same things up. Lots of name-calling, stress, and overall just bad feelings. On those days I felt like I was going to break. He ended up getting accepted to be a program/project at a nearby college, and I transferred so we could live together. It has been about 7-8 months since then and things have been fine, except one major thing - I have a lot of unresolved feelings from all the times we fought. On top of that, I have anxiety, which I've been going to therapy for. Because of everything I've said so far, our sex life has been shit for almost the entirety of our relationship. I hardly even think about it anymore. My libido is gone, but he would be happy to have sex multiple times a week. We talked about it all recently, and he said he still didn't understand why the things in my past happened, but he was sorry he hurt me before, which has helped some.

You're probably wondering why I stayed in the relationship. Well, one thing I should probably mention is that my bf was abused for the majority of his life (physically and emotionally) and I don't know if he notices that pattern. Besides these fights and the resulting low libido, everything is great. He is always helping people and is pretty rational about most situations (with the exception of mine). We make each other laugh a ton on a daily basis, we've calmed each other down in a lot of ways and brought out the best qualities, and we motivate and support each other. I told him I wanted him to see a therapist and he has recently, though not on a regular basis due to the program/project taking up a lot of his time. This is worrying and I let him know that, but I can't really tell him he needs to throw his school/work obligations aside to go if he doesn't have the time.

Anyway, I'm just not sure what to do at this point. I want our relationship to work, but I need 1) to work through those unresolved feelings so that I can feel more intimate, which I've been trying to do in therapy, and 2) him to go to therapy on a more regular basis, which might not happen til his project deadline passes (end of Summer probably) so that I can stop worrying about the possibility that something similar will happen in the future. 

He has told me if the sex continues like it has been and if I can't guarantee that it will change in the future, he can't continue the relationship. It takes a while just to work up to it, and sometimes that doesn't even help. He feels rejected and undesired by me, which is understandable. 

I guess the reason I'm posting this is because I want to know if someone else has been through a similar situation, or has any advice to make things better. I'm considering letting him open up his side of the relationship til we both work through these things, because he's not getting a lot from me in terms of physical affection and I know that's not fair.

tl;dr: me with my bf of 2 1/2 years. Had a bad beginning to our relationship. Things are mostly better now, but I have anxiety and unresolved feelings I can't get over which caused my libido to drop. He feels rejected and says if I can't guarantee a change in our sex life at some point in the future, he can't be with me. Think I should possibly let him open up the relationship a little."
2wpkdu,2,2015-02-21,Fuck being alive.,Stagger_Johnson,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2wpkdu/fuck_being_alive/,"It's a long story but I just don't see the point of being alive anymore. 

Overall, I feel like I'm in a catch 22. My plans after graduation failed and I have nowhere to go. I've been spending everyday at the library hopelessly applying to jobs online and none of them ever get back to me. Even if I do get a job, I couldn't afford a living wage since nowhere near me has affordable rent and I just hate the area I live, in general (Connecticut, there's really jack shit for people not commuting into the city or raising a family). 

 Recently, I left an unpaid internship because it was pretty much a dead-end position since...most of their staff consists of unpaid interns except for a few higher ups who actually make a living. They were kind of dicks to me even though I wasn't paid at all. Fuck them, they make money off of free labor. 

I barely have any friends left who I actually see or talk to. My life now is just loneliness and nothing else. I don't even feel like a person anymore. All I am is just a manifestation of misery bound to this earth by flesh. 

People keep saying ""Oh it will get better"" or ""Nothing is that bad that you want to kill yourself."" There have been some who have told me they would be sad if I were gone, but I just wish they would understand my mindset. Like if there was a clone of me that killed himself I would understand and would not want them to live that kind of life. 

You see people who are paralyzed or terminally ill take their lives because they don't want to suffer anymore. I don't see the difference in my situation. 

I feel alienated from everyone. Sometimes I just don't even feel like I'm living in my body anymore. There's nothing left of me as a person. Just a body that costs my family to keep alive. Anything human in me is gone.

I'm going to wait this out until June. If I'm not on track towards doing anything I'm just calling it quits for good. There's no fucking point to have an existence in misery. 

All I hope is that those who care about me realize that I was already dead months before I did it. The person who made them laugh or listened to their issues was long gone. There was only a shell. It would be like shooting a zombie. "

I'm one of three girls with NMom. My older sister has always been the perfectionist, straight As, just received her PhD (GC). Younger sister has always been quiet, easy going, fairly successful (GC). I'm pretty smart but never put as much effort in as my older sister, but in high school I also took a few classes a year before my older sister, but my mom only saw grades. And my Bs and As were not up to par. 

Onto the current issue. This past summer, before I found this sub, I went LC with my mother, and I get so much satisfaction out of ignoring her calls. Unfortunately can't go completely NC. 

I graduated college in May 2012 with an engineering degree. I bought a car in June, still with no job, living at home. Got an internship in July, my mom was pushing me to move out but as I didn't have a permanent job I wasn't going to find some place to live and have to commute an hour to work. My dad understood. Now, I had no desire to live at home.. None at all. In September that year I began paying my parents rent, $200/month, had to buy my own groceries and come winter had to feed the wood stove to be warm (granted, I'm cold even around 67F, but I'm paying rent is it unfair to ask for some heat?). 

December comes around, and my boss is telling me they want to offer me a real job, but haven't given me any offer. I knew I would get no insistence working there, and I could make better money elsewhere so I quit in order to spend 24/7 finding a job. I didn't consult my parents before quitting (I'm an adult, I can make my own decisions, I had money).

Overheard my parents fighting one night and my mom wanted to throw me out of the house calling me immature, a mooch, and irresponsible. Keep in mind, they are still getting paid their rent and I still own my own car, not driving theirs. My dad, backing me up (and saving me) once again, tells her no. Day after day I was fighting with my mom. I was applying to multiple jobs per day and she thought I was being lazy and mooching off her (but paying rent). I was constantly miserable and hated and unwanted. I was unemployed for two months before receiving 6 interviews in two weeks. Got a permanent job in April, and I spent my first check on first months rent for an apartment of my own. I had to take out store credit cards to buy work clothes.

Moving out has been the greatest thing ever. Still at my job, and in two years I've gone from broke to buying my own place (still in the works). 

My younger sister (GC) graduated May 2014. She graduated with a business/finance degree and with a job. So of course, she wins right off the bat. She still has not bought a car of her own, driving one of my parents cars. She's still living at home. And my mother loves it. She is supposedly paying rent. She's not being pushed to move out or buy a car. And obviously not being kicked out of the house, and it's infuriating. 

Every single part of me wants to go up to her and throw all of this in my moms face and make her apologize for the hell that she put me through and admit favoritism. And for her to acknowledge every single one of my accomplishments. I make more than both of my sisters combined. Soon, I will be the only one to own property (and I was broke two years ago). But I know I will never get anything out of her. And for some reason I still measure my success against her approval. And it angers me beyond belief.

I want to be happy for myself because of my accomplishments. But I also want my mom to make up for the hell she put me through and admit I'm better. Which will never happen. "

(Well...besides my old troll post about A being in that cars.com commercial teehee.) 

This is a cross between my theory/how I would LIKE for pll to end. 
Although I doubt this is even remotely close to who A really is, or how Marlene will choose to explain everything. I just thought this was really cool and interesting connection my mind immediately made. 

Okay, so what if  the PLL background story (why things are getting so creepy, the doll references and obsessions, the theatre, the puppets, the girls acting out scenes potentially...) is similar to that of this movie?  ""Kiss the Girls"" 

Here is plot summary for those who haven't seen it, credit to Wikipedia. 

&gt;Plot[edit]
See also: Kiss the Girls (novel) plot
Washington, D.C. detective and forensic psychologist Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) heads to Durham, North Carolina when his niece Naomi (Gina Ravera), a college student, is reported missing. He learns from the local police, including Detective Nick Ruskin (Cary Elwes), that Naomi is the latest in a series of young women who have vanished. Soon after his arrival, one of the missing women is found dead, bound to a tree in a desolate forest, and shortly after that, intern Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd) is kidnapped from her home.

&gt;When she awakens from a drugged state, Kate discovers that she is being held captive by a masked man calling himself Casanova, and she is one of several prisoners trapped in his lair. She manages to escape and is severely injured when she jumps from a cliff and into a river to escape from his clutches. After she recuperates, she joins forces with Cross to track down her sadomasochist captor, who Cross concludes is a collector, not a killer, unless his victims fail to follow his rules. This means there is time to rescue the other imprisoned women, just as long as they remain subservient.

&gt;Clues lead them to Los Angeles, where a series of gruesome kidnappings and murders have been credited to Dr. William Rudolph (Tony Goldwyn), a man known as the Gentleman Caller. Cross deduces he is working in collusion with rather than imitating his East Coast counterpart, but his efforts to capture and question him are foiled when Rudolph escapes. Upon returning to North Carolina, he traces up the river and alerted by a gunshot discovers the underground hideaway used by, as well as the true identity of, the man who calls himself Casanova. Rudolph is revealed to be Casanova's partner. The actual Casanova escapes, while Rudolph is shot by Cross. Cross then rescues the kidnapped women, including Naomi. After all that has happened, Kate invites Cross to dinner at her house to get away from work.

&gt;Ruskin drops by Kate's house, simultaneously sending home the two officers guarding her. While Cross is at home getting ready, he discovers that Ruskin's signature on the arrest warrants matches that of Casanova. Cross tries calling Kate to inform her that Ruskin is the real Casanova, but Ruskin has already disconnected the phone line. While conversing with Ruskin, Kate becomes suspicious of his creepy elaborations. Ruskin then drops his Southern accent, revealing his true self to her. After a fight and attempted rape, Kate manages to use Ruskin's own handcuffs on him and handcuffs him to the oven. Ruskin slashes Kate's arm with a kitchen knife. In attempting to free himself, Ruskin pulls the oven away from the wall, breaking open the gas pipe. Ruskin takes out a lighter, which would cause an explosion due to the leaking gas. Cross shows up and tries to talk him down but when this fails, has to shoot Ruskin through a milk carton so the muzzle blast from his pistol does not ignite the gas. Cross comforts Kate as the police arrive. 


Although this would conclude that A has to be in the law enforcement (Toby) I think it could be better if they ditch that ending, and go with another pillar of the community such as...a humble teacher and a well respected doctor....

Ezra and Wren! 

In the movie, Kiss the Girls, Casanova (the cop) kidnaps girls in his lair, and if I recall correctly, occasionally sends clues/blackmail to the families. He wears a mask the entire time he is in his ""kidnapper"" role (or in this case A role), uses drugs (from his Dr. Friend) to kidnap the girls and also keep them in a high state. He then puts the girls together and makes them act out scenes. Casanova was also an author (the original 1700's Casanova.) The cop &amp; dr. are best friends and actually have common interests which include more intellectual things like the arts, science, and history.

Casanova urban: ""A smooth-talking charmer who has mastered the art of finding, meeting, attracting and seducing beautiful women into the bedroom. One he accomplishes his goal, he leaves the woman in fear of having a relationship and proceeds to find his next conquest.""

Ezra? Wren? 
Ezra's family also owns a theatre great way to explain all the allusions, and his obsession with making a creepy play.


Anyways, this doesn't explain the other deaths, and all the other freaking plot's within plots (that's what I'm going to start calling it now, plotception.) 

But I wish PLL would go in a creepy psycho crazy direction like this.

I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

I depend on my parents for everything. I barely have the energy to take care of myself, my grades are slipping. I'm pathetic. Some of my friends work and go to school full-time or have internships. I'm barely keeping up with the classes I have. 

I don't want this to be my life. But when I tell people that, they think it's simple. ""Well then you just need to get out more! You just need to get out there and get yourself a job! Take the bus! Make some money! You only live this way because you choose to!"" I live this way because it's all I can do.

My parents aren't going to be able to support me forever, but I'm too weak and stupid to take care of myself. I'm just fed up. I'm tired of dealing with this body, I want to be normal, and I don't know if I ever will be. "

I am currently doing an unpaid analytics internship while I finish the degree and seach for fulltime work. Last November I left a paid internship with my University's technology commericialization office after a year. I left because I wanted to focus on school and did not see it turning into a fulltime position. Lately I have been very worried that leaving was a bad idea and that I will not be able to get a job after I graduate. I have been applying for companies left and right and have only had 2 interviews since November (both were rejections). I have enough cash to be solvent until the end of June. What can I do to increase my chances of employment?  Any advice/constructive criticism would be much appreciated. Thank you.

I need some career advice on what to do.,[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/2wqjjr/i_messed_up_i_need_some_career_advice_on_what_to/,"I graduated with a BSME in May of last year . Now, here's where I messed up. I just went on an interview and I realized I have zero selling points. I applied for over 600 entry level jobs around the USA and this is the only one that I managed to get an interview for and it wasn't even good. It was because I didn't do any internships, haven't done any projects. It wasn't because I was lazy or anything like that, but because I simply didn't network well enough and didn't land any. Time passed quicker than I thought and here I am, almost a year after graduation with no job.

I asked my  college advisor about this and he said to go to the career fair they were having. I went to a CS focused school so 95% of the employers there were looking for CS majors. I didn't really get much accomplished there. So where do I go from here? Has anyone here been in my situation before?"
2wqmiu,2,2015-02-22,Help with winning my college student government elections?,newswimmerdoe,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2wqmiu/help_with_winning_my_college_student_government/,"Hey guys. So I will be running for my community college's student government for President. To give a brief background, I love politics, I love law, and I hope to do something public service related after I'm done with school. I do intern with a local state assemblymember, so I have good experience with how things run in the government. I got a 4.0 last semester, which was my first (just turned 19).

So far the detail of the election, I have a running mate for VP who was my friend in high school, as well as a friend I made from work that goes to my school who will rally up support and votes from our cultural group (hint: white/middle eastern who speak a language other than english and stick to ourselves), she's very well connected (related to the current VP) so I can depend on her.

We only have one week to campaign, and following that are the 2 days for election. There are over 20,000 students at my school, however based on data from previous elections, only 600-800 students come out to vote, with winners getting elected based on majority of the votes.

What I want to know is what should my plan be right now. I have a basic setup so far where I just get people's names and contact information and put all of that info Excel, and when campaign week comes where I can officially publicize, I will send a mail-merge email to everyone that indicated they wanted to support my team. I don't know effective this is, but I just want to get that word out there you know.

The problem now is that one of the current student government members, who's been in it for almost 2 years now, is going to be running against me for President. So she has that experience that I don't, so I want to make sure I emphasize the campaigning portion and rallying up support from my target voters that I can count on to vote for me.

Essentially I would like a strategy so far because I have a lot of time until submit my candidate petition (end of March), and go to the meetings (to get the rules of the election and whatnot, also in March), campaigning and elections are late April. I was hoping I can get some ideas on what sort of materials I can use, how I can incorporate them (like handing out to people, posting in areas around school), if I should have a budget, as well as how I can utilize social media. I was thinking that if I do anything communication related I should do in English, my native language, and in Spanish, which makes up what everyone speaks.

I guess thats it so far! I'm excited for this and I hope I win to be honest. To give a disclaimer, I love campaign stuff more than I love winning, so just getting out there and doing things like this, the experience is one I enjoy. But yeah, would love to win too lol.

**tl;dr Wish to run for President of my community college student government. Need help with ideas and getting organized and rallying up supporters to win against my competition.**  "
2wqosl,11,2015-02-22,[QUESTION] How do I get started?,jgibs2,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/2wqosl/question_how_do_i_get_started/,"Hi guys (and gals),

I'm currently a junior in high school looking at bioinformatics. It seems like an amazing field that combines all of my interests. My question is: how do I get started? 

* Are there any online courses I should take? 
* What colleges should I look at? 
* What can I do in terms of internships? 
* Are there any other languages I should learn? (I am reasonably proficient at Java/C/C++) I hear R is good to know, but is there anything else?. 
* Is there anything I can do now that could be helpful to the field? I'm currently in the midst of coding a Java program that determines if an amino acid sequence is likely to be a protein or not (using this method: http://www.nature.com/articles/srep07972) for looking at unresearched phage genomes; is this something that could be useful to anyone else?

Sorry for the fusillade of questions. I'm really interested in bioinformatics!"
2wqu40,3,2015-02-22,Tips and Tricks for a Second Beginning?,PandaKat92,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2wqu40/tips_and_tricks_for_a_second_beginning/,"Let's dive straight in, shall we?

I am a 22 year old female, and last year my New Year's resolution was, of course, to lose weight and be healthy. I got a gym membership at my local Anytime Fitness, and was trying to figure out a healthy diet plan. I never figured out just what I should be eating, but I still lost weight.

At the beginning of last year, I started out at 260 pounds. I went a few months and was down to 235 pounds. I left for the summer to a different state for 3 months to pursue a pastry chef internship. I worked most of the time, and didn't have a gym to go to. Soda was free at work, so that's what I mostly drank, and why try to eat healthy when you have an extra cinnamon roll laying around that you just pulled out of the oven? 

When I came back home, I was up to 245 pounds. This was in August 2014, and I maintained that weight until November. I broke my ankle. I needed surgery because I broke off the bottom of both my tibia and fibula, and shattered part of my talus. (I have some wicked scars from it and a total of 7 screws and a metal plate holding my ankle together.)

I was wheelchair bound for a while (got rid of it finally mid-January) and just finished physical therapy. I still can't run or jump, but I can use the elliptical. 

During my time spent in a wheelchair and hopping around my tiny house with a walker, I was lucky enough to have my mom stay with me to help. Unfortunately that meant that we rarely had a meal that was not take out. (Just for reference, my mother is TINY, and I take after my dad completely, who is the same size as I am.) Not getting around much and eating too much has been my downfall.

It is now February 22, 2015 and I'm starting to get back on track. I'm embarrassed to say it, but my current weight is 280 pounds. I am the heaviest I have ever been and I know I have to make a change for the better. 

I've been going to the gym relatively often, but I am having trouble staying motivated. Especially with diet. I have a hard time trying to stop after I feel full or comfortable, resulting in over-eating. 

At the gym I've been using the elliptical, working on my legs and arms. Whenever I go, I work my muscles until I can't do another rep, then a few more. I see a lot of posts about arm day, leg day, but I do both the same day. Is this what I should be doing? 

My sleeping schedule is also odd, I usually cannot sleep until 3-5 am and usually wake up around 1 pm. I don't have a job at the moment, so there is nothing else to do in a day other than work out and clean my house. 

I know that losing weight will take time, I'm not looking to lose 100 pounds in a month, but I need the motivation to be able to get there. 

How do you stay motivated?
Are there any tips you can give me on what I should be doing in the gym?

I'm not going to lie, some days it's hard to stay positive and on-track, but I need the tools to be able to continue this process and make progress. Any advice will be most appreciated. Who knows, maybe a year from now I'll be posting before and after photos. :) "
2wqvsz,7,2015-02-22,Hospital experience + extra urges,weeniehutsenior,selfharm,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/2wqvsz/hospital_experience_extra_urges/,"Sunday night, things got bloody, to say the least. Didn't hit anything major, thankfully. But I had one cut in particular that gaped as wide as my thumb, as well as a few others that hit fat as well.

Anyway, Monday morning. The only reason I fessed up is because I had that appointment and a friend of mine coaxed me into it. My mom carted me down the road to the ER to get my stupid leg stitched up. We didn't even have to sit down before they let me in. I knew what was coming and I was freaking out. The only reason the desk lady knew this is because my heart rate was 126 and my diastolic BP was 100. I think she was a mom. I could tell by the way she sounded so concerned

So I get into my room and a nurse comes in. He was short, bald, had a beard, I think he was wearing a hoodie when he first greeted me...I think his name was Mike? Anyway, he starts cleaning me up and goes, ""Wow, you did this to yourself?"" and I think I made some snarky response because I was terrified

Next, I'm introduced to the doctor and his intern. I don't remember the doctor's name, but I think the interns name was Ashley or something. It was her first day in the emergency room and she had to deal with this dumbass. She gave me a tetanus shot, which by the way hurt enough for me to say ""holy mother fucker"" while my mom was right next to me. Oops.

Now here comes the fun part: The injections.

I knew what was coming so nothing the doctor could say would calm me down. I had him lie the bed flat and gave my glasses to my mom and covered my eyes with my arms. There were maybe 20 injections all together. I could be way off though. The initial prick was whatever, but it creates a bubble in the tissue and that's why it feels like the injection site is going to fucking explode. Have you ever heard a dog whine and yelp in pain? That was me. I was trembling and sobbing. The doctor kept asking ""You hangin' in there?"" and I think the only time I responded, I said ""nope."" ALSO, he had the intern do a few so they were EVEN SLOWER. I don't blame her, but damn, that was horrible.

I think I learned how to tie a surgeon's knot from watching him teach his intern. At this point I didn't care about what was going on since I couldn't feel anything anymore so I think saying that made her relax a little. She did maybe 10 sutures and then she left because he knew that the numbness was going to be wearing out soon and he needed to be quick. We talked about The Walking Dead after I made a cannibalism joke and he talked about how a guy came to the ER after dangling by his forearm on a meat hook and drove himself there. The conversation was really enjoyable, it was almost as if I wasn't getting stabbed with a needle dozens of times. He laughed, I laughed, my mom laughed. It really lightened the mood.

The last 10 or so started hurting. It was exactly what piercing your calf with a needle would feel like. Then it was finally over, 33 sutures later. I was lying in iodine and blood and the paper stuck to my leg but I was so happy. 

Then the doctor started getting serious. He said how I need to find other ways to cope because I can't keep living like this and it affects other people. All I could say was, ""And you think I don't know that?"" it didn't even sound like me. It sounded weak, I was tearing up and I'm pretty sure my voice cracked. I probably looked like a kicked puppy. Then he put his hand on my shoulder and said, ""It was really nice to meet you and be able to talk to you. Good luck. I really hope you get better."" The ""good luck"" part was what really stuck. He had been so nice to me even though I didn't deserve it because I was wasting his time since I had done this to myself. If my mom wasn't in there I would've actually started crying. I'm crying now just thinking about it. Every person that entered that room was so kind and sincere. Well, except for the one guy who came in and said ""if you're going to do this again, come in the ER sooner because you can get blood poisoning blah blah blah."" But fuck that guy.

The nurses that cleaned me up and dressed my leg said they hoped they won't be seeing me again and stuff. I just wanted to hug all of them. But I couldn't look at them when I left. I didn't deserve to see their smiles and well-wishes after being so stupid and already wasting 3 hours of their time.

I was really thinking about sending the doctor a letter or something. I know I'll never see him again but I want to thank him. I'd much rather say it in person, but alas...

I wonder if they thought about me at all after I left.

This is why I want to cut now. I feel so guilty. They looked so sincere with every word they said and they were just too kind for me. I was wasting their time but they didn't bat an eyelash at that. I didn't deserve that kind of treatment. I know it would be counterproductive, but still...

Damn, I wish this man used reddit. So he could at least see how thankful I am. I wish all of the nurses could see this, even the desk lady. She was really nice too.

It's almost 4am so I should probably wrap this up. 

tl;dr Stitches hurt. Everyone was really nice. I feel bad because I was a waste of their time, breath, and concern"
2wqxpt,1,2015-02-22,"Uncovering my past, OMC.",ciaodanielle,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2wqxpt/uncovering_my_past_omc/,"It wasn't until very recently that I referred to how my mom treated me, during my childhood and adolescence, as abuse. I'm 21 now. I find a very difficult time remembering times where my mom and I had positive interactions. I have memories of her brushing my hair too hard and that ""it wasn't her fault my hair is natty"" in an aggressive tone... talking shit about me and how fat I was when I was younger to her friends and ""that it was okay because her friend did it too""... that I should wear more pink and dresses because the teachers would talk about her if I looked like a tomboy.

It wasn't apparent she had mental illness until I was fourteen and starting high school in the fall. It was the summer. My dad was his office job. I was home from school with my mother. She cracked. I was supposed to go to the doctor's office with my Aunt that afternoon so I was up early and found her acting crazy. I didn't know what was going on and it never occurred to me she ever had any psychological disorder. She told me to stay inside my room and not come out until she told me to. She said the house was tapped with cameras and she was going to start smashing electronics. She broke the TV with a plastic (but pretty durable, actually) vase. Soon after she told me to evacuate the house with our dog because she smelt anthrax. I waited on the porch for a long time, holding onto my dog for dear life. It was afternoon now and she told me airplanes were coming down to bomb our house. I was super-Catholic at this time of my life. She told me to start praying out loud to God as hard as I could. I legitimately thought I was going to die. That was when my dad pulled up from work. Thank God. He was super pissed I think, because he had to leave work and he feels like his family life interferes with his job a lot. I empathize with that because the three of us have always been fairly dysfunctional. I think I called him but I honestly don’t remember. She went away to the hospital after that.

She's attempted suicide countless times while in high school. During my senior year, my father and I found her unconscious in bed. She drugged herself with enough anti-depressants and anti-psychotics that she fell into a coma. She would end up in the hospital for a few days and sometimes I would wonder if she would even wake up. One time I found her myself and had to call the ambulance. I couldn’t even drive during that one time.

A few weeks before I graduated high school, she held a knife to her stomach feet away from me and ran across the house and upstairs, screaming. She heard me call 911 while I locked myself in my room. The police came for me but told me to open the door, even though I had no idea where she was in the house. She wasn’t near when they came in. She hid the knife by this moment and pretended nothing happened once the officials talked to her. 

That’s kind of a snapshot of my history but doesn’t even begin to explain everything. Anyway, my dad is finally divorcing her, now, and I'm twenty-one years old. She acts a little sane now, but she’s still ridiculous.  She picks fights with my dad and it’s fucking annoying. I left for college when I was eighteen. I barely talk to her… maybe once or twice a month. She knows I favor my father over her. I feel guilty for not trying to get to know her and get close to her growing up, but honestly, who would want to after that bullshit? I tried when I was younger but she never wanted to play with me. My dad played Monopoly every Saturday night in grade school and let me win. I never knew he let me win until I was older.

I feel guilty that I want to move in with my dad instead of my mom after college. The dream, ultimately, is to move out with roommates my age, but I have student loans and shit. I know they’re going to hold me back and make it difficult. I’m applying for jobs and trying my hardest. I’ll even work dead-beat jobs and intern if I can survive living on my own, honestly. I’m not sure if I’m seeking validity but I just needed to get this off my chest. I'm still not even sure if this counts as emotional or child abuse or whatever. "
2wqyh3,2,2015-02-22,[REQUEST] Need some help making ends meet after recovering from a two-year depression.,saddetective87,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/2wqyh3/request_need_some_help_making_ends_meet_after/,"I have recently pulled myself out of a tailspin of depression (due to abusive parents) and am now dealing with the aftermath (getting back into school, making ends meet, finding another part-time job). But at the moment I have a small mountain of problems. Any financial help to help cover rent and groceries would be appreciated.

Long story short three years ago I was about to finish my university degree without any school debt and was looking at a good career in the military, and finally getting my full drivers license. Unfortunately I grew up under a narcissistic mother who, once she found I was becoming more independent from her, made it her life's work to just make my life hell. My therapist said that it was likely because she felt threatened by my impending success. Her emotional and verbal abuse, combined with the trauma of living with her for twenty years and my enabling brothers just made things worse and I eventually just sank into a two-year depression. In that time I could only take one or two courses. Luckily I had gotten some paid internships before this happened, and managed to keep by a part-time job and was an obsessive saver which meant I had a cushion to fall back on. Well, now that I am starting to put things back together (and have been No Contact with her for two years) I am having trouble making ends meet. I am applying for student loans for my coming term back at school but I need some help. Any help would be appreciated. I started living on the British Wartime rations diet a couple of years ago and I have been stretching that, and I have give up using the bus and walk everywhere. Please help if you can.

EDIT: I was hoping this could work like a PBS telethon with many small contributions. My end goal would be 800 to 1000 at most.

TL;DR:I need some financial assistance to help with tying over until I can get some student loans to finish my degree and  start real life after a three-year delay due to depression from an abusive, narcissistic parent. Please, any help would be appreciated. PM me for details."

I was scheduled to only a closing shift, but had to cover the open driver shift. So I worked an open-close shift, with a small break from around 3-5pm. I drove from 10a until 8pm, then switched over to closing manager.

Tips sucked. Alot. There weren't very many deliveries to begin with.

I was hardly getting anything, and if my memory serves me correctly:

1 - stiff, very far delivery to a rich, private liberal arts high school

2 - stiff, trailer park

3 - $1.xx keep the change from a teenager.

4 - stiff

5 - $3. whew, finally something!

6 - $4 tip, but we ran out of the soda she wanted. She wanted it taken off of her order. But since she had paid with card, she didn't want to deal with voiding the first payment and running her card a second time for the new amount. To keep her happy, I gave her a cash refund of the soda from my own money. So, net tip: $1. (In this case, many of you might shake your heads and say ""Why would you pay her your own money?"" Recently the franchise owner has banned any and all cash refunds for customers, and in only very serious situations can they be issued. If a customer is pushy and demands a cash refund, the manager usually will hand over the money from their own pocket. It's better than getting in trouble with the franchise, when it's over a simple $3 soda.)

This continued for a few more deliveries. I didn't go on very many more, due to being a manager, I was kept in store. We fired a driver 2 days ago, and a cook no call/no showed, so we were a bit understaffed, to say the least. I was only to deliver if necessary. 

On my last delivery, about 8pm, I typed in the address to my phone: doesn't exist. Oh, great. So I start driving out to where I think it will be and tried calling the guy on the order to confirm his address. No answer. Sigh.....

I get out there, about 7 miles, and stop and toy with the address in Google Maps a bit. Turns out he put a W instead of a N. The address is only a couple more blocks. Good guessing!

I get to his house, knock on the door, and the guy answers. Barely gets out his front door without letting his dogs out: he apologizes. I shrug it off and say ""No big deal, I'm a dog person anyways, no worries!"" This guy, in his 40's, and super cheerful. ""Cats on the other hand.... nope. Don't like em."" He laughs again and agrees with me (btw guys, don't let the rest of reddit know I don't like cats.... shhh!)

Total came to $22.06, and he hands me $28, smiles, and asks ""There's 28, hows that? Good?""

""Oh yes, absolutely. That's more than I've gotten the whole day!""

Him, pauses... ""Wait, what?""

Oops. Shit. My bad, I didn't mean to say that. **Insert Hagrid meme here.** I didn't mean to sound depressed and pity him for more money or anything: I just stated the truth. In my mind, I am thinking: $5.94, that's a great tip! But I explain myself: ""Oh, sorry. Yes, that's a great tip. I've worked since 10am, and have gotten less than $8 total from 8 deliveries so far. Kinda a rough day, but its okay. It happens.""

He is in awe and immediately pulls back out his wallet, ""Dude, dude, let my help man, that really sucks...""

I try to stop him, ""No, sir, it's okay! It's okay, it's fine. It happens, don't do it.""

He continues to fumble with wallet, and says, ""Well then, I am going to make your day!""

Me: ""Sir, don't feel the need to do anythi.....

Him: slaps another $20 on the pizza box, puts his wallet away, grabs the pizza box, and holds it waiting for me to take the money.

I pause for a second, unsure about it, but then go ahead and reach out for the extra $20.

""Sir, thank you so much. Honest. Thank you so much.""

Him: ""Hope your night continues to get better! Have a good one!"" He starts to go inside.

Me, with a frog in my voice ""Thanks sir. You have a good night as well!""

He smiles, and goes inside. I head back to my car. Driving back to the store, I replay what just happened in my mind, and barely hold back tears. I almost started to cry. In the store I zombie-walk around a bit before snapping back, and getting back to work.

-----------------------

Here's the thing. It's not a life changing amount of money. It's not something I was pushing him to do either. But it was a $26 tip on a $22 order; I can hardly believe it happened. And for some reason, it really got me right in the feels tonight. I've been working my ass off, struggling to balance my school work load, I can't find an internship in my related field (I've been '2nd choice', multiple places) and my wife is pregnant with our first kid. She has a better paying job than I do, which pays our bills. Delivery driving is my way of being able to at least pay for one bill, and get some groceries. But all of her income will go away when she is on maternity leave; she is due in only a few more months. I'm not sharing this to get any pity from anyone, just like how I didn't mean to pity myself with that awesome guy that tipped me. It's just been kinda a rough patch, you know?

But TJ, if you are reading this, if you are out there: Thank you, so much. Your simple act truly did make my day today.

2wrrqx,10,2015-02-22,I recently discarded a counteroffer in my actual work. Did I took the right choice?,zedee,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2wrrqx/i_recently_discarded_a_counteroffer_in_my_actual/,"Hi everybody. Here comes my story, hope you don't fall asleep:

**Background:** I started programming as a child. In my childhood had my first Amstrad CPC and learnt LOGO and Basic. Then in my teens my interest focused on Linux and C. But I had very long periods of having that ""hobby"" untouched (now I really regret this...). I started an engineering career (telecom), but I dropped out, as I struggled to pass any exam (except programming lab).

Years after working in low paid jobs, I graduated in Media (tv&amp;cinema) about 5 years ago, but with the economic crisis, it was impossible to find any decent job in the industry. Meanwhile, I started to learn HTML and then PHP &amp; JS by myself, watching MIT Opencourseware lectures, browsing StackExange (Serverfault, stack overflow, security...), as well as building websites for my close friends (almost for free). 

Half a year ago, I found myself working in an small IT consulting company. They gave me the opportunity to start over and finally build up a career, but it had a drawback: they offered me an internship contract and the payout was terrible (about 620€/mo per 40h/wk; that's about $8450/year). 

I decided to keep up the job, as I needed so badly real experience. They told me that in the next 6 months, I would have a raise, and it was true. My finaly salary was about €12k/year ($14k/y). Wow, what a deal. I didn't negotiate too much and accepted the new conditions, thinking of asking for a lil' rise later.

6 months later, I tried to renegotiate my salary with my boss. I asked for a raise, but he told me we'd take hand on it ""soon"".

That ""soon"" was 3 months ago, and I didn't heard any news about. So I started looking for another job. And they called me. And offered me to double my current wage. Obviously, I accepted.

Then when I go to tell the boss I'm dropping, he plays his cards. He also offers me twice the salary (but just over 6 months) if I stay. I tell him I'll give a thought, not without thinking... ""And now you can give me a freaking raise? When you are against the wall?"").

Finally I thought about pros and cons: 

The pros of my current job are that I have formidable workmates, which I learn a lot from them (and I try to help them when they ask), and also that in my job they give me pretty much freedom to choice any framework I want when it's time to start a new project (Laravel? CI? Angular? They don't give a fuck as far as shit is done).
The cons are obviously the terrible salary, as well as some extremely picky clients (which usually don't know what they want), so almost all projects take 2x 3x longer than they should. (And they blame us for not complying with deadlines). [Does it ring any bells to anyone of you? ;) ]

So, my final decision was to quit. He raged a bit telling shit about the company I was going to, but finally he took it OK. I'm kinda frightened about the new job, as I have a period of testing of a whole year. I'm confident with my programming skills, but I have a short run into this industry, and I'm not quite experienced. I will start on the new job the next week. I know it's a very personal decision (to quit or to stay), but I was looking for some directions about if it was a good choice.

So, what are your thoughts?

**TL;DR:** Had a shitty wage, found new job where they offered me 2x. Took it. Not sure if I did right because of my short experience.

Edit: typos

**UPDATE:** Thanks a lot for your thoughts about the topic. It's been almost a week in the new job, and besides the days of disorientation and shyness, now I'm feeling better in a great environment with challenging projects. They even have a shitload of oculus rift to play with! I'm proudly happy of my final choice. :)"

2wrw01,2,2015-02-22,This Summer,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2wrw01/this_summer/,"In my third year of college (philosophy major), and the looming prospect of what I'll do this summer is beginning to increase my depression, which improved a lot in the fall and winter. Mainly, it's coming from my mother, and her daily questioning as to what I'm going to do then. The last two summers, I've gone home to my small town and worked a part-time job that's pretty typical for a college student. Unfortunately, because of our economic position, I'm not eligible for more financial aid, and my summer job will never come close to covering what I need to pay for college. Also, I'm just lucky to even have that job during the summer. As I said, my family lives in a rather rural area, and there aren't many jobs to speak of, much less one's that a college student on summer break could get.

I suppose the core of these things with my mother stem from her not really viewing the situation in terms of its reality. On the one hand, she expects me to find a job in the summer where I'll make ten to twenty thousand dollars, and, as an alternative, she also expects me to find a ""special"" internship where I'll make that much money. I understand her desires, but the simple fact is that neither of those things are possible. And this is where something else adding to the depression comes in.

Since I was little, I planned on going to law school and being a lawyer, which I think my mother took as a sign from God (she's very religious). But, within the first year of my undergraduate studies, I've found the idea of attaining a PhD in philosophy and working as a professor a path that I want to take. I honestly cannot say that studying law, much less working in it, interests me at all. It would be quite a struggle to force myself through three years of studying it. (At the same time, I do realize that the job prospects for humanities professors, especially those in philosophy, aren't great.) I'm also a writer, and this is my greatest passion, though I also realize the chances from living off it are extremely small. But writing is still something so important to me that I cannot take a career route that would so negatively affect it or prevent me from still pursuing it. All of these topics have also become something for her to continue discussing with me. Over the Christmas break, it even reached the point where she said ""How can I convince you to go to law school?"" As a result, she expects me to find an internship this summer with a law firm and make tons of money from it. She also doesn't understand why I might choose academia in that it would offer more time to write. She says that I can always write ""for fun"" as a lawyer. Although true, I don't approach writing as some people do golf or some small hobby to occupy weekends. (I mean no offense to those pursuits or that attitude towards them, by the way. What I mean is that writing is simply more of a central part of my life than that.)

In turn, these things make me start thinking about a number of things. First, there's spending all summer at home and with all her questions: ""How could you ever work in academia?"" ""Why do you spend so much time writing?"" ""Haven't you read enough for today?"" ""Why are you teaching yourself Danish?"" (I enjoy languages and currently know four.) Then there's the bigger question I ask about the future. I think that I will figure it out and find a place for the things that make me happy, but it would be nice to have her behind it or a bit. Or even if she doesn't back my plans, at least it would be a bit better for her not to view some of my possible plans so negatively. For example, I plan to teach English abroad for a year or two in between undergrad and grad school, but she sees this as a way of shirking responsibility and trying to escape my calling of law school.

It's probably also relevant to mention that my mother struggles with pretty severe depression and anxiety. She's very aware of these things and will never get help. She brought it up once to say that, in her view, therapy is pure self-pity, and one only needs God. Along with this, I am fairly certain that she has borderline personality disorder. I really hope I don't come off as unkind or insensitive toward her, as I really do love my family a lot. It's just that my mother can make things hard at times.

So, in short, thank you for any advice or perspective on the matter! I'm a long-time lurker, but it was hard to write this post. Oh, and I'm sorry for the wall of text.

tl;dr Mom is setting unrealistic expectations about this summer's work/the future, and not realizing the differences between our goals in life. It's caused a bit of setback in the progress I made with my depression over the last six months."
2wrxv1,5,2015-02-22,"Me [24F] with my SO [25M] of 3.5 years, and the other man [24M], I'm feeling something I don't remember ever feeling for someone else and it's killing me inside",ireallyfuckeditup1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2wrxv1/me_24f_with_my_so_25m_of_35_years_and_the_other/,"I'll just get right into it. My SO and I have been together for 3.5 years. Due to some certain issues we ended up moving in with each other 4 months into the relationship. We've had some problems like normal relationships do but we've prided ourselves on resolving them quickly. We currently live away from home due my him being in his PhD and I was going to school. I won't give away too much info but I'm currently switching programs so not in school this semester but actively looking for work. 

Now for the problem. My SO volunteers in a program that helps international people when they move here for school. Last Thursday he sent me a text telling me he will be late from work and someone is going to be coming over to talk to him about a few things to do with the program. He asked if I could clean up and host this guy until he gets there. Okay, simple. The guy ended up coming over and we just chatting. It turns out the guy doesn't live in our city but just in the middle of an internship. Halfway through chatting he notices a certain show I own and we start talking about that. I ask if he wants to watch and he says sure. We're watching, talking, laughing, and having a great time. He had put his arm around me while watching but I didn't take this as anything. It wasn't curled around me, it just went straight along the back of the couch. We talk some more during the show and it turns out he is from the same place as me. My SO finally comes home and they get down to business. I do want to add that the guy didn't move his arm when my SO came home until my SO came closer to shake his hand.

After this guy leaves I feel a weird sensation in my stomach, knots. When I look at my SO, he doesn't seem like the same man he always is, I don't feel anything for him. I start freaking out, not understanding why I'm feeling like this but I dismiss it and assume I'll feel better in the morning. When we slept I didn't even want to be touched by him. If his feet were touching mine I would move further from him, it felt like there was a stranger in our bed. Yes, probably me. 

The next day my SO says the same guy is going to be coming over again while waiting for his flight. I say okay and he's over within the hour. About 15 minutes into him being here my SO says he needs to go to work because he forgot he scheduled himself to do something and wishes the guy the best and leaves us alone. I felt normal with this guy around, he had a familiarity to him that reminded me of home. We got to talking and he mentioned he had a girlfriend but they were on and off because he travels a lot and she doesn't like it but he saw a future with her. I didn't ask anything about her since it wasn't really my business and if he felt like sharing more he would. We were sitting on the couch and he said, ""Not to be rude but would you mind if I laid down for a bit?"" I said sure and offered him the bed. He said we could continue the conversation so I sat on the edge of the bed while we spoke. He then said to lay down so I did. (This was all over the covers of the bed and all clothes were on)

We started talking more about life, the past, etc. It was a very nice conversation and I was really comfortable with him. I realized the time, sat up, and told him he should probably get going. As he left he shook my hand and said if I do go back home maybe we'll bump into each other. I smiled, said maybe, and then he was gone. 

It's been three days and I STILL feel like my SO is a stranger. Kissing him isn't the same, hugging him isn't the same, I don't know what's wrong with me. When I think of the other guy I get knots in my stomach, I've lost my appetite. Weird of all my sex drive has gone from high to nonexistent. I don't even want to masturbate on my own, it's just gone. 

I'm afraid, I'm lost, and I don't know why I feel so apathetic towards my SO. I haven't told him any of this and I don't want to. I get sad knowing the other guy is gone but I have no will to see him again. I'm a horrible human being and I feel like I should break up with my SO. I didn't know I could go from loving someone one day to feeling nothing for them the next. He didn't even do anything wrong. I'm starting to get annoyed with small things he does that I never cared about. 

Anyway, I know my wrongs and I don't need to be told how horrible I am, I already know. But can anyone help me? Why am I feeling this way? How can I make it stop? I hate feeling this way.

   
**tl;dr**: After meeting a guy my feelings for my SO have completely disappeared. I have weird feelings for the guy yet I don't care if I never see him again. I don't know why I'm feeling this way but I want my feelings for my SO back! "

But when the weekend rolls around I feel so tired and drained from the week before and so overwhelmed with all the other things I know I SHOULD be doing that I usually just loaf around my house eating snacks and watching Netflix. I'm in a motivational void.

Things I know I should be doing:

* Exercising (go through periods of being really good about this and then falling out of it)
* Finishing my freelance jobs more promptly
* Fixing my motorcycle so I can sell it
* Learning how and doing the service on my other motorcycle because it's overdue
* Fixing my portfolio website issues
* Fundraising for a trip I'm going on with a non profit
* Practicing my illustration and hand lettering skills
* Getting my ass to the metal shop I'm a paid member of so I can produce the items I've planned to start a business around (here I'm actually wasting money by not going).
* Dealing with my mail (need to send something to the DMV, need to forward some to the correct address, etc)
*learning to make metal jewelry at this local club I've been meaning to join.
*Gaming to try and build my tiny twitch audience (for fun)
* meal prepping for the coming week

I always make sure to get a good long walk or a beach run for my dogs so they're happy and get exercise (I usually run with them at the beach but that's probably just twice a week or so) but some days I don't get around to it (I try not to let this happen often and I feel horrible when it does).

Please help me figure out what's the problem with my motivation and why I waste my weekends avoiding the things I've been putting off!"

Is it okay to apply for jobs I won't be able to take?,SamAHill,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2wsdae/looking_to_test_the_market_in_an_area_i_hope_to/,"I'm a student journalist looking to move to a bigger city, either this summer or the summer of 2016.

I've been running the student newspaper at my college for a while, have had an internship with one of the larger newspapers in my state along with a few freelance pieces for other organizations. I'm confident in my skills, but not in the likelihood of finding a job right out of school. The media industry is small in my area and jobs don't open up very often.

When searching for jobs, I've seen positions in bigger markets that I say, ""Hey, I might be able to do that.""

Should I apply for these positions simply to see if i could land an interview, even if I'm not readily available to take the job? I just want to see if I would be able to compete in another area and really work on revising and nailing my resume/applications.

I was thinking that applying could get my foot in the door or at least make a single contact that I could benefit from down the road when I do move. Or at least prove to myself that I could land some of the positions I'm checking out.

I suppose one of the major reasons I could not get a job was that I never had an internship experience during my time at school. I wanted to focus in my studies, was very naive in the sense that I would be able to get a job without any type of internship experience and never really looked into it during the time I could have done so. In the midst of not finding a job I got sidetracked and started working in video production jobs as a way to make money during the time I searched for an engineering job. I applied to jobs in my state because I was not keen about moving too far away from town, but the calls for interviews never came my way, and I stopped sending applications because I became absorbed by my work and was making decent money. A few months ago I realized I was tired of working on something which does not pertain to my career, and that depressed me quite a bit. I took it upon me to start applying again, but this time everywhere and anywhere I could in the US. To my dismay, for the past couple of months I have had no luck, all responses are the usual ""thank you for your interest in our company but blah blah blah"", and right now I feel like I have hit rock bottom and I am losing all kind of hope in ever being able to find a job as a civil engineer. Companies who specify they want engineers with no prior experience have all denied my applications or never called me for an interview. As the days pass, I keep wondering if there is any hope for me, I would be willing to even work for free just to gain that experience in the field but I feel I have hit a wall, I looked everywhere in job boards, to Craigslist to my University job boards. I was naive for not seeking an internship during my school years, but to make things worse, all this time spent doing other things doesn't look good in the least and just makes my search for a civil related job even harder. My resume is not the greatest since my work experiences have nothing to do with engineering, but I don't want time to keep on passing with me being stuck here never being able to get an opportunity to work in the field. So does anyone here have any advice on what can I do right now to turn this ship around? There has to be something I can still do about it, but I am so lost right now I need someone to advice me on this, please.."

I'm a University senior working towards finishing my B.S. in Geography, with three GIS courses under my belt(well two, but #3 comes in the fall). 

I have to take two minors with my major, one is spanish and I'm almost finished. The other isn't chosen yet and I'm only 1 class from finishing my major, so basically I just need to do an entire minor all at once. I'm leaning heavily towards computer science, even though choosing this minor will set me back an extra semester for graduation. 

If I need to I am even considering double majoring, Geography/Computer Science.

What are the other skills aside from proficiency with ArcMap that a very skilled GIS professional should know? I know Python is one, what are all of the others? I want to use my time left in school very wisely. 

P.S.

If you need a GIS intern for the summer let me know, I am willing to move anywhere temporarily as long as it's paid."

Throwaway on the off chance she goes to reddit, goes to this particular sub and see this specific post...

The Turn:

So we've been together for almost four years now. Awesome relationship, insanely close all those good things. A couple of  rough patches but we persevere. Girlfriend, who was living with her friends, had to move home because of a teaching internship she received, no pay only stipends towards her grad school.  

The Pledge:

So last June my lease was up and I wanted to move out of into a better area without my college friends. My girlfriend is ecstatic, we talk about moving in together.

 Awesome possum, we find a nice place close central to both of our jobs.  She lets me know she won't be able to pay her full share of the rent due to aforementioned internship. Ain't no thang. I can front the bills and she can chip in what she can. We both sign the lease.

Lease starts in September, due to school and shit, her move in date is December, I'm cool with it cause well I am. Well December turned into a January move in...which turned into a February move in...which turned into a beginning of March...which turned into end of March.

The Prestige:

So I just got off the phone with her about an hour ago and the topic of her move in came up because I need to request time off from work to help (retail manager :0 ). Well she doesn't think she can do March now. What the actual hell. 

I want to get on with our lives but she keeps coming up with excuses. I am not getting married until I know I can live all the time with her. I'm frustrated about what I should do. I don't want to give her an ultimatum  because I do love her but at some point I need to know if this relationship can bump up to the next level i.e. marriage. At this point I'm trying to figure out if there's something wrong with me, our relationship, or her. Any input?

2wsyex,95,2015-02-22,TRP Works. It really does.,[deleted],TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2wsyex/trp_works_it_really_does/,"I was going to write this huge wall of text, but instead I'll keep it short, sweet, and to the point. I've been a lurker on TRP for about a year (yes, my account is not that old, I know). But this subreddit really struck a chord with me, and inspired me to take my life into my own hands. Some quick background: I am a senior in college, 22yrs old, employed full-time by one of the Big 4 financial firms as a consultant, and in a LTR with a great girl (think ideal 1950's wife).

I used to be a weak male (not quite beta, but definitely not alpha). Over the summer, after I had landed an internship at my company, I began to really dive in to TRP. Let's just say that by the end of the summer, an intern was known by everyone in the office and acted as a manager for a remote development team. I was offered a full-time position 10 days before the internship ended. My ambition, which had always been low, skyrocketed. I wanted success. I wanted to be the boss. TRP taught me to seize the day, to take charge, to be the Alpha. Coming in to Senior Year, I was the man. And people took notice. I now get invited to parties, ""21 Runs"", and more low-key social events than I could ever make time for. It feels pretty darn good.

My social standing was transformed so quickly it was hard to process. I was confident around campus, both socially and scholastically. Women now approached me, whereas before I would have been more noticeable if I was invisible. Even when the lady and I go out, women flirt and try to make conversation. The aura of confidence and self-assurance is very real, my friends. And when you know you're the man, other people take note. My grades have also skyrocketed, propelling me from average student (3.0 GPA) to model student (4.0 GPA). Thanks to my sudden and total academic success, professors have taken notice, and I am now consulted on potential syllabus changes to courses in the CS department, and I have even become a prominent member of the school's Technology Committee (Faculty, Staff, select students who come together every month to review and plan campus-wide technological changes). 

Some of my closer friends have noticed this turn around, and I have directed them to the subreddit (most of them are betas) in the hopes that they can learn and internalize TRPs truths as I have. After all, who wouldn't want to become the best [insert name] that they can be?

TL;DR - This subreddit is by far the best thing I have ever stumbled across. It has helped me go from 0 to Hero, from beta to Alpha, and has helped me take control of my life and future. 

EDIT (Answering some questions):

What lifestyle changes did you implement?
I started going to the gym (seems pretty typically of this subreddit). I now go 5-6 days a week, and spend at least 40 minutes on cardio (high-resistance eliptical) and I lift for about 40 minutes doing ladder sets (start at weight x, increment by 5 after each set, hit max weight, then go back down to starting weight). I also started eating a lot healthier (a lot more fruits, vegetables, and meats, while simultaneously cutting out unhealthy foods) and drinking around 120oz water each day. This being said, I allowed myself 2 cheat meals per week (MEALS not days) which would consist of something like a burger and fries or something. Otherwise, living a totally restrictive diet with no reprieve puts you at a higher risk to backslide into crappy eating habits.

Regarding the confidence and self-assurance changes, i started intentionally branching out from my core group of friends and acquaintances. I began engaging others in class and outside of the class with greater regularity. My ability to hold a conversation steadily began to increase, all the while my social anxiety began to plummet. I resolved to step up in class (regarding presentations, answering questions, being a prominent voice in discussions) and set my goal to one class per day (minimum). I also began spending a lot of time on reddit and other news sites, consuming information and becoming more wordly. This helped a ton, as I began to be able to hold conversations about complex issues (Politics, civil unrest, etc.). I learned that information is power, and in this day and age, we have access to more information than we could ever hope to assimilate. 

What resources did you use?
TRP, MensRights, and some of the required reading were big helps to me. Specifically the Antibiotic Nuke, Relationships, Redpill, and You, and Powertalk were awesome reads. TRP and MensRights helped open my eyes to what our world truly is. Before, I thought I was just you're average loser of a guy, and a relatively isolated case, an anomaly in the perfect little world of campus life. But I learned (thanks to amassing information/knowledge) that the issues I was facing were widespread, persistent problems. I resolved that something had to be done, as I would not live the rest of my life as a doormat. From the Required Theory Reading, Powertalk was especially influential, as it helped me open my vernacular and make mold me into a powerful, influential speaker. 

Something else I found really useful were meditative sessions, allowing me to take 30 or so minutes per day to do some introspection and reflection on the day's events. Taking some time to just sit down, disconnect, and do some analysis was therapeutic and highly beneficial for me. It helped me stay on track, identify inflection points, and plan how to defeat current and potential future problems. If you're new into meditation, I'd look for guided breathing meditation tracks/videos on your video sharing site of choice (I have a few I like on youtube). It makes getting in to meditation a lot easier, and helps you focus your mind during the exercise.

Another big inspiration and guiding force in my transformation was a close friend of mine. I'll call him Dan. Dan is, objectively speaking, easily a 9/10 on the sexual market. He is a certified physical trainer, charismatic, and a total lady killer. He actually was one of my big motivators at the gym (he was willing to train me for no cost, which was a huge favor), and mentor me on bettering myself physically. Having a buddy or personal trainer you can work out with is a huge advantage while attempting to physically better yourself. It's a lot harder to blow off the gym when you have someone telling you to get your ass out of bed and onto the treadmill."
2wt9r7,1,2015-02-22,Startup Internship Job Board Idea,LeanLearner,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/2wt9r7/startup_internship_job_board_idea/,"Hi r/startups!

After doing a few startup internships and after being on the other side and hiring interns I realized two things.

1. Levaraging interns to do taks like social media, customer interviews, being campus ambassadors, and content marketing can be huge and extremely effective.

2. It can however be tough for early stage startups to find qualified interns. 

So a friend of mine and I had the idea of creating a job board site aimed at early to seed stage startups looking for interns. It would be a simple and easy way for these startups to take resume's, applications, and work examples for internships from a variety of different schools, all in one place.

It's not a incredibly novel idea I know, but I think if executed well it could certainly be useful to many startups. 

So just wanted to see what the r/startups community thinks about this idea and if any founders on here would use something like this. 

Thanks guys!"
2wtdhq,0,2015-02-22,21 [M4F] East Coast - The Reality of Who I am,[deleted],r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/2wtdhq/21_m4f_east_coast_the_reality_of_who_i_am/,"Hi. My /u/ is TheThrowawayMask. Why? Well, besides obvious reasons, I am a big fan of The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask and have been playing it on 3DS. Oh that's a fun fact about me, I like to play video games. But not all the time though, I'm also in school, have a job and an internship, and like working out. So I'm glad to be doing something! However still being in school come some pitfalls: I live at home, I don't have that huge of an income, and the phase of ""what am I doing with my life?"" comes in. 

I don't know what I'm doing with my life, I just know that I'm doing what I like to do., and working towards whatever is best for me. Speaking of what I like to do I'm also 420-friendly, and if you are too, that's awesome, it's cool if you're not, won't bother me, but if it does bother you we can work around it or you can pass.

This is my first post on R4R but after doing some lurking and reading figured I would give it a shot. I won't say my name here, that would be the opener to our conversation if we happen to PM and make it to either Skype/Steam and maybe even text. Who knows maybe a phone call in there every once in awhile.

Being straight forward here, if we hit it off really well and we have found mutual trust in each other from the communication we have had, I am open to the idea of travel and meeting. I'm fond of doing the traveling. Exploring is something I like to do.
If we meet and it goes well then that's awesome, we know who we are to each other and have gotten to do something that's priceless and that would be spend time together. The more time we have, the better. 

I'm sort of a romantic, er, or so I've been told. You could be the judge of that. I speak English and Spanish, and if you speak Spanish then I would probably speak that more than English. 

I'm a foody, but not really, I LOVE going out to eat and doing the whole wine and fine dining, but I'm also not picky and can settle with making something at home just because it sounds better than going out in the terrible weather that is New England right now. (Damn snow.) 

string[2] whatIwantAndAmLookingFor; &lt;--- That's an example of an array of strings with two positions and it's called ""What I want and am  Looking for"", the way the name is written out is called Camel Font, it's a thing with how you name your variables and other creations when it comes to coding. I study Computer Science It's not too exhilarating but it is a degree! I'm finishing with school this year. 

So what I want and what I'm looking for: Well I want a best friend. Someone who will want to talk to me about everything almost as much as I'd want to talk to you about everything. I'm single, and it works out better if you are too. We can see where things go however, I'm open to a relationship but it's not necessarily the solid thing I'm looking for. I am looking for some form of relationship, but a relationship relationship would take time of course.

I'm trying to keep this formatted well and I switched to the Big Editor, hopefully this all comes out okay. Anyway, a best friend, someone to just do anything and everything with, the person you trust the person you want for ups and downs and someone to just go through life together. I enjoy Smash Bros. and... occasionally Mario Kart. But if you're into Smash that's awesome, if not it's cool too!

Do you sing? I like to sing, and if you like to sing, then I would want to sing together. People say I'm good, but I just do it for fun because it somehow became something that makes me who I am. If you don't like to sing, then I'll try not to sing too much unless you want to hear me sing.

This is turning out to be longer than expected, and don't want to drag this on too long, but if you're close by and you want to talk and just get to know someone knew and is close (or far) then I'm your guy. Have a good day!

I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

The entire time my Dad is just sitting there with his hand across his chest just picking apart my life. Why don’t you have an internship set up? Why haven’t you gotten any observation hours for PT? What are your plans for next year? The mood was cold and the room was dark, everything he said had skepticism in it, there was no excitement and he hardly wished me a happy birthday.

To the reader: I know this is hard to follow, but it is an incredibly dynamic situation, I guess this is what happens when two sides for expectations and they aren’t quite met. I think this jumbled writing is caused by the fact that I can see their perspective and my perspective. I can see why they feel their way and I can’t quite figure out why I am acting my way. I know what the right thing to do is but I can never seem to do it. There is something off about me that I can’t explain. I also have been crying most of the afternoon and just feel like the personified version of the song “lost cause” by beck. 
 I feel like the last few years of my life have just been meaningless. I feel like a giant let down in all areas of my life. On paper I am a division one track and field athlete with good grades who is kind and good looking and goofy. This is not based on my opinions this is based on what other people tell me. But riddle me this, why do my parents seem to careless all of a sudden? Why can’t I get a girlfriend? Why haven’t I had sex in a year and a half? Why can’t I take advantage of any of my talent in track? Why do I hate going to school? Why do I feel that my college years have been a waste? Why do I feel like the person I used to be is dead? I used to have energy that rivaled the sun, I used to radiate positive energy. I used to just be blindly optimistic. Have I been worn down from years of my dad being cynical? Did everyone else get to me? Can I find my way back to the person I once was? I just lack confidence but I used to have it and I don’t know what to do. I just want to be the person society wants, I just want to be the guy I know I can be. I am just torn up by the fact that I feel that I will never meet the expectations that life has for me. I guess I just want to hear a kind word. I am not sure where to post this, so if this community feels that this is misplaced I apologize.

2wu2ic,5,2015-02-22,Feeling a little overwhelmed in my internship.,codeycoderson,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2wu2ic/feeling_a_little_overwhelmed_in_my_internship/,"Hi guys,

I've been posting here and r/learnprogramming a lot since my second semester of college (started off at CC and have now transferred to a University). I've been working as a paid intern at a local web development company since December 1st.

It's been really cool as it is my first office job and I have been learning what it's really like to have an adult job, having only worked retail/recreational jobs before. But, it has also been frustrating at times. It's a small company and the customers are really important so for the first month and half I was only doing customer support and working on site issues.

I still work on issues (as every dev there does, we each have issue days). But I've been assigned my first real task that's starting this week. I'm sure in the grand scheme of our website it's a simple feature to add for any other dev, but for me it feels pretty hairy. 

How do you guys learn to read code that you haven't written? Or know where to start on a new feature if you are unfamiliar with the codebase/technologies being used? I look at our 10GB+ code base and am just overwhelmed. This biggest project I've ever done is a (relatively) simple iOS app that span maybe 4 dozen files and probably 1000-1500 lines of code.

One of my bosses told me that it's gonna be my project indefinitely until I get it done and there's no timeline as it's not a pressing feature that needs to be added right away.

I was just wondering if you guys had any advice on getting started? I know I'm going to hear asking a lot of questions and I am planning to do that, just wondering if there's any other tips.

Thanks!"

I feel like I got into college by luck alone, and that one day people will find out just how pathetic I am and stop wanting to talk to me.  There's nothing special about me, I'm terrible at everything I try to do.  I know I'll be terrible at whatever I attempt, which stops me from trying new things.  

My parents wanted me to apply for a specific internship, but it required a letter of recommendation.  I decided not to apply for it simply because it would require a prof to write a letter of recommendation about me, and I feel like there's nothing kind that anyone would ever want to say about me.  

I feel terrible about myself, and this has only happened to such a severe degree recently.  Should I talk to my school's counseling staff?  How do I fix this?"

I'm currently a junior in high school and plan on attending a fairly competitive college upon graduation. I have had interest in the business field for some time and have some questions for those of you that works as a business analyst.

1. What majors and minors do you recommend for getting into this particular field. Should I look into double majoring? Is there any combinations of majors that would make me more marketable?

2. How do you recommend receiving experience after graduating college? Internships? Is there any entry level jobs that would be seen as valuable experience to an employer? 

3. From what I understand many people working as business analysts made themselves familiar with programming. My question is how do you recommend making myself familiar with programming as I have no experience with anything of the sort. 

Thanks in advance for any responses!!!

I live in Morocco, an Arabic/Amazigh country with 99% of Muslims, I'm computer Engineering student. And it seems to me is quit the opposite what's happening here in my country.

My class is about 60% female and while I was studying in CPGE (french system for higher education, we study mainly math and Physics) girls were about 70% of my class (we were about 5 guys and about 35 females).

And last Monday I got an interview at IT consulting company for a 6 month internship and HR was kind enough to show me were I will work and all the programmers were female their was no man there.

This article is very shocking because in Morocco is a primary male culture were women have lesser rights than man (Although it's better than all other Arabic countries except for Tunisia I guess).

I know the medical field is more conservative and traditional than others. I go to a university that is generally considered one of the most liberal and, in doing so, I have been involved with a few ECs that are more on the liberal side of things. For example, I intern at  an organization that works with OBGYNs to provide safe abortions for women in underprivileged countries, I volunteer at a homeless shelter for women, and I'm in a few LGBT orgs on campus. I know none of these are the most left-wing activities, but I'm nervous to include them on applications. What if I get asked about my internship (that I'm very passionate about) but the adcoms shut down when I mention the word 'abortion?' I want to include these things because they are important to me but I don't want to risk a spot because of them. Any suggestions?"

2wuh7b,12,2015-02-23,Tale of a Teenage Dirt Bag,[deleted],lifestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifestories/comments/2wuh7b/tale_of_a_teenage_dirt_bag/,"I'm Shelly and I'm a 16-year-old female with a criminal record and history of running away.  Here's my life story.

When I was a kid, I thought that my day-to-day life was normal and, on the surface, it absolutely was.  I had two loving parents that did their best to provide me with a comfortable life.  Mom was the homemaker, Dad was the breadwinner.  I had two siblings 10 and 11 years older than me.  Just your average American family.

What people didn't know was that my dad was a 3-time war veteran suffering from PTSD, my mom was weighed down by emotional baggage and a previous divorce, and my sister's were born out-of-wedlock with my mom's first husband and constantly wreaking havoc on the household.  Everyday it was the same.  Someone was yelling at someone or crying about something and usually, because he was on tour for a good portion of my childhood, my dad wasn't there to mediate or calm anyone down.  I knew how much he hated being away and that it wasn't his choice, I never resented him for leaving.

In the midst of my hectic home life, I sought peace outside.  I was always playing outside and could usually be found with my only friend at the time who, unfortunately, was also extremely abusive.  When I started at my new school, I was bullied for being ""weird"" and later, as the other girls began to get their first taste of puberty, for having a flat chest and looking like a boy.  Because I was so desperate to have a friend/place of refuge from home and school and because she was a year older than me, I didn't tell anybody.  No matter how manipulative she was or how many times she beat me, verbally and physically degraded me, or forced me to engage in sexual activities with her, I remained silent.  After 5 years of dealing with it, my mom told me some news story about a kid who had been molested by his friend and told me to tell her if anything like that happened.  So I told her and begged her not to tell the girl's parents.  She did, but nobody did anything about it.  Nobody except the neighbour girl who insulted me a few more times before completely cutting contact with me.  I was so confused and hurt by this that, a few months later at the tender age of 10, I cut for the first time.

After 5th grade, we moved to a podunk town in Louisiana where I was placed in a private Christian K-12 school.  I had cut my hair pretty short for a 10-year-old girl some months before after having hair to my waist for years which, coupled with my prepubescent boyish figure, led to my entire class bullying me for being a ""lesbian"".  When I wore my plain, baggy black jacket to hide my body in an attempt to stop insults, I was called a Devil-worshipper and Satan girl because the jacket went against our strict red, white, blue, and khaki uniform.  Even the staff and students I had never even met joined in.  I became extremely depressed, began self-harming more, and starved myself due to stress.  The next year I was transferred to the predominately black public school across the street where I was bullied for being white, looking like a lesbian, and being ""emo"" after someone ripped my sleeve up to reveal my cuts.  I vividly remember staring at the sharpied words on the bathroom stall that labeled me a lesbian dyke whore.  My English teacher targeted me in class and often made remarks at my baggy clothes and messy hair in the middle of class.  This time I developed a relationship with yet another abusive girl who constantly shut me down when I tried to tell her I was hurting and essentially said ""my mom abuses me, I'm hurting more.""

After that, I moved back to Colorado and started another school where I was bullied for being goth, lesbian, emo, anorexic.  In fact, the first day I had two preppy looking guys walk up to me and say ""So are we your type?  Or would I look better with eyeliner and fishnet gloves like you?"" and they walked away laughing.  That was the year that I first tried cannabis.

Finally, after the hell that was middle school, I made it to high school where everything went to shit within the first three months.  I went to homecoming with my first boyfriend where he gave me an enormous hickey that led to my parents assuming I was a trashy whore.  A month later, we were broken up and his friend wanted me to ditch with him to ""hang out"".  He smoked half a bowl and I pretended to take a hit.  I didn't feel comfortable being high around him.  A few hours later, he took my virginity and date raped me at a park.  I had said 'no' several times, he ignored me, and eventually I gave up because I didn't think there was anything I could do to stop him.  My entire group of friends was, and to this day still are, convinced that it was perfectly consensual.  He played head games with me for another month before I started ignoring his existence.  My parents found out about the sex which wrecked things further.  In December, the date was 12/12/12 (I know) to be precise, I ate an entire pot brownie, which I later discovered from the boy who'd given it to me also contained acid, despite my low tolerance.  I was tripping hard in French class until a girl was told to escort me to the nurse's office.  I hallucinated the whole way there and puked several times in the office before my parents and an ambulance were called.  I was suspended for 10 days.  A few months later, my parents discovered I was smoking again which led to a horrendous fight where they wrecked my room, called me names, and threw things at me.  I ran away for 3 days on a smoke binge.  Eventually I came back and things were normal until my sophomore year.

My freshman year crush, a boy 3 years older than me, invited me to his house to smoke and hang out the day after my 15th birthday.  He also asked me to be his girlfriend.  I said yes and things were fine until he started the on-off relationship.  He'd ignore me for weeks on end, eventually break up with me, and then come crawling back a few days later.  I always took him back despite my frustration.  We started having sex and things were fine until it became JUST about sex.  He only came around when he wanted sex or drug money which for some reason, I always gave him.  He dropped out of school and quit his job pretty quick.  It got to a point where he was lying to me, and stealing money, meds, and cannabis from me.  Still stuck with him.  Then he turned abusive.  He made fun of the deep scars in my thigh, of my fat (even though I barely have any), and was generally very hurtful.  He played emotional head games, constantly between ""I love you."" and ""I don't love you."" and ""You're a fucking whore.""  The only time I thought I was pregnant after my period was still a no-show after 10 days, I told him.  He messaged me about how I needed to tell my parents I slept with some guy at a party and that I needed to get an abortion or HIS life was over.  He told me if I didn't get one, that he wouldn't let me give it up for adoption.  He yelled at me the next time I saw him.  I broke up with him after he not only grabbed my arm roughly and almost dragged me to a tree to have sex with him on a hiking trail, but also because he showed up at my house incredibly drunk at 2 AM one morning and date-raped me in his car for the third time in the relationship.

It was about this time that I re-kindled a friendship with a guy who, you guessed it, became toxic and abusive pretty quickly.  It started with offers to take me to lunch and smoke me out during school.  I took him up on his offers but NOT ONCE DID I EVER ASK HIM FOR ANYTHING.  Soon, he started talking about getting in a relationship and he shit-talked my boyfriend, which at the time, offended me.  Then he started acting like I owed him a relationship which evolved into owing him sex.  Because sex is totally a fair trade for a few days worth of weed and Burger King not to mention that I have always been very against cheating and sex outside of a relationship.  When I said no, he, along with another kid I ad rejected, spread rumours around the school and our graduated friend groups that I was just some slut that would suck dick for pocket change.  Excellent, my reputation ruined even further.

I ran away again in March for 2 days.  At this point, I was a pretty heavy smoker.  Then, in June, I was expelled on the last day of school for having a bong, a pipe, &lt;1 g of cannabis, and being high at school.  I was charged with possession of an illegal substance, possession of paraphernalia, and distribution.  Luckily I was able to go through the court's Juvenile Diversion Program (paid a fine of $200, 15 hours of community service, and either therapy by a CAC-certified counselor or a marijuana education class) which dismissed my case until next year when I turn 18 and it's sealed.

The summer after my expulsion I got an unpaid internship doing grunt work at a surgery center, stayed at a working ranch for a month, and went on my first backpacking trip where I peaked my first mountain at roughly 10,500 ft.  The day I turned 16, the surgery center I interned for offered me a job.  Fast forward to today.  I am a straight A student enrolled in a rigorous virtual program and more than halfway through my junior year with a part-time job that I absolutely adore and a rebuilt relationship with my family that is stronger now than ever before.  I have my license, am saving up for a decent used car and college, enrolled in a new public school for senior year, and two amazing friends that have stuck with me through thick-and-thin for almost 4 years.  I still struggle with depression and my eating disorder, but not to the degree I used to struggle with them.  On occasion, I still use cannabis, however, I'm very strict about my use now. I only buy medical-grade herbs, waxes/oils, and edibles from a close friend with a red card.  I don't partake in any other drugs (not even cigarettes, alcohol, or coffee).  I don't even smoke anymore.  I use a vaporizer and only in my house when I have nowhere to be, no school or house work to do, and my grades are satisfactory.

So I there's my life story I guess.  If you've made it this far and you're reading this, thanks for listening :), no one else does."

I know I am moving towards my goals, but I just want to be settled in at least one aspect of my life. 

Details:
I graduated from college a few years ago, changed my mind about my career goals, and am now finally inching slightly more quickly to my desired career path (doing a specific technical post-bacc program online). I'm working a part-time office job just to make some money while I do this, but I don't really have any money. I'm applying for some summer internships so that when I finish this program I'll be more qualified for jobs, but haven't heard back from any yet.

I just moved with my boyfriend from Portland to a much smaller resort town in SoCal (my hometown, although my family doesn't live there anymore) for a new job for my bf. While I don't really regret moving for new experiences, I know I don't want to live here long-term because it's ridiculously expensive and I dislike the people here, and even though I was sick of Portland at the time I know I'd rather live there long-term. The internships I applied to are all over the country, so there's always the possibility I won't be here for the summer or more time.

I'm finally making changes to my life to start losing weight, and I've lost 10 lbs so far of the 40-50 I want to lose. It's obviously slow-going, but it's happening. 

I'm not sure how to make friends in this new town and there aren't that many people here our age (we're also homebodies) - but I have no money to join activities and I keep thinking well, what's the point of making friends here if we won't be here that long?

We're not super happy with our rental apartment and I keep an eye out for other options, but I'm always unsure whether it'd be worth it to move again. Our apartment is nice but we don't like living underneath our landlords. 

Basically, I spent a ton of time wishing I was just settled already. I feel like I've been in transition for like 7 years now. I want an actual house that I can decorate permanently, I want a real job in my career field, I want to be fit, I just want to be...settled. I know it will happen in time and I'm not that old yet (25), but I just can't ever relax and feel satisfied, because it seems all I work on is some form of ""self-improvement"" (working on the class, applying for internships, making food, doing chores, looking up self-help stuff on the internet). I feel so unsettled and ""undone"". What can I do to just relax and enjoy my life as it is right now? "

Not too much thrilling stuff going on today, I'm afraid. I woke up around 3 (""early to bed, early to rise"" isn't really a thing for me). Confession time: I didn't do homework like I said I would yesterday. Right after wrapping up the last update, I went into a coma and got absolutely nothing done. However, I made up for that today! After waking up, I got my assignments turned in, and I went to the library with Edward to study for my Probability exam this Wednesday. I think it was a fairly productive review, and hopefully we can study together again on Monday or Tuesday. 

Unfortunately, my study skills are lacking - I've always been able to coast by simply through keeping an ear open in high school, where the teachers generally have to reiterate things multiple times every day for the ~~stupid~~ slower kids in class. However, now that each consecutive class is at least a day apart, I can't rely on that method much anymore. As a result of lack of practice, self-study sessions are horribly inefficient and unproductive. It's something else to add to the list of improvements.

After studying, we went to Teji's (an Indian restaurant). I had lamb chili, which I wasn't too fond of. Think I'll be sticking with the lamb curry in the future. Parted ways with Edward, went home and played Starcraft with him for a bit. This might sound stupid, but I think Starcraft actually helps a little in teaching me how to stay calm under stress and manage crises. Might be dumb, but there it is.

Today was cold as hell. It seems whatever I said yesterday pissed off the weather deities, and they decided to make it a solid 40 degrees, and it's only gone down since then. Sorry, weather deities! Please make it warm again, I like being able to blink without the skin on my face feeling like putty.

Following my recreation time, I went to the gym! Froze my ass off on the way there, but I told you I'd do it! Today was legs and shoulders day. Mildly annoyed with myself; lost my second notebook where I was keeping track of my workouts. I'm on my third one now.... Today's workout consisted of:

* squats, 3 sets of 8, 135 pounds
* Arnold press, 3 sets of 8, 35 pounds each side
* leg press, 3 sets of 8, 180 pounds
* MTS shoulder press, 3 sets of 10, 50 pounds each side
* calf raise, 2 sets of 50
* plate superset, 3 sets of 10, 45 pounds
* seated calf raise, 3 sets of 10, 90 pounds

Pretty light workload, but honestly I wasn't feeling too well - probably a result of my sedentary lifestyle as of late. Cardio's gone to hell, something that I'll work on. I'll see if I can go running tomorrow and begin alternating running and lifting days, hopefully hitting the gym every single day. Doubtful, given my crappy time management, but I'll make an effort to do so.

Yesterday, I said I'd be discussing the things that scare me. These might be a bit trite, but here goes.

**I'm scared of not being successful.**

Everyone around me is securing an internship or a job or something of that sort. Or they're joining investment teams, finding leadership positions, starting projects. I'm not doing any of that. I'm still trying to find my way around, still learning and exploring my options. And every time I find something that I might be interested in, that goes to someone who's wanted to be an investment banker since 3rd grade or something. I was under the impression that college was supposed to be a time for discovery, not just a formality where you earn a certification and move on. My concerns are kinda compounded by the fact that my GPA's shot to hell following the debacle that was first semester - I hate that that happened, and I'm never going to let anybody or anything impact my future negatively to that extent ever again. Last semester, I at least made it to the interviews for the investment teams I applied for, but this semester I didn't even get that far, and the only thing that's changed is my GPA. I feel like I'm letting a lot of people down; people out there actually paid money for me to be here because they had the confidence in me that I'd succeed and make the community and the world a better place. Not saying that's not going to happen anymore, but I certainly haven't been meeting those expectations or justifying that confidence. I'm worried that I'm falling behind everyone else. Advisers said that it's not a competition here - so why does it feel like it is? I'm mildly frustrated, and I imagine this is what being unemployed feels like. Between you, me, and the Internet though, I haven't really been exerting myself too much. As usual, there is a lot of inefficiency, something that I realized literally as I was writing this. See, I knew this sub would help!

Okay, writing this right now probably wasn't the best idea. I'm still coming off the high from lifting, and right now I feel like I can kick anything's ass. Kinda struggling to find stuff that scares me.

Oh, here's one.

**I'm scared of being alone.**

I'm watching all of my friends move away and disappear, and it seems I'm always getting left behind. This might be very loosely linked to the first point, but I feel like it's a reasonably distinct issue. My best friend Evan went to Berkeley, and he doesn't really have any plans to come back home long-term anytime soon. It seems most of my other friends are finding different groups or finding different stuff to occupy their time. This might just be a part of growing older, but I hope it isn't. It's just a trend that worries me, and one that I hope is just part of my imagination. I'm scared of looking up one day, and realizing it's just me by myself.

**I'm scared of getting small.**

This one's a bit more lighthearted. I haven't had quite as much time to go to the gym as of late, and I hope I don't lose whatever progress I've made. My stamina and cardio are nowhere near what they used to be - my old tennis coach would make me run laps for days if he could see me now. I don't really have much more to say on this topic; it's not something that needs a lot of psychoanalysis LOL.

Let's see... another one.

**I'm scared of not finding purpose.**

Why am I here? Not in college, I mean on this planet. While I was feeling suicidal and depressed and stuff, I asked people what they live for. None of them had an answer, really. Not one that resonated with me. While I'm done with those feelings, that question still sticks around in my head. Why am I, an aggregate of molecules and chemical processes, on this rock that's floating out there in a vacuum?

**I'm scared of not doing the things I enjoy.**

I used to read. I used to play tennis. I used to do things that I had passion for. Nowadays, when people ask me ""What do you like to do?"", I have no answer for them. I don't like working with databases, I don't like making random presentations, and I don't like going around begging people for jobs. I like learning, I like spending time with people, and I like building connections with others so that I can understand them. I like eating good food, I like working out, I like winning at stuff. But I feel like these aren't really answers that I can give without sounding corny. I feel like slowly the time I have available to do the things I enjoy gradually shrinks every day, and then *poof* one day it's gone.

I'm sorry, like I said, right now I'm having a pretty rough time thinking of things that really scare me, because I feel damn good at the moment. Who am I kidding, I'm not sorry, I feel swole as hell and I'm going to go drink a protein shake and pack it up for the night. Tomorrow after a day of classes, maybe I'll be feeling more negative and I'll update this, but for now, screw all the problems in the world, I can take 'em all.

If you have a test this week, good luck! Easy money. Have a good night, and beat the crap out of life like a goddamn Viking."
2wup8c,9,2015-02-23,Did I handle this properly?,Twiddles656,Nanny,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/2wup8c/did_i_handle_this_properly/,"On Wednesday night I got a text from a family I do full time nanny for in two week stents when MB has law school internships. They asked if I could sit two mornings next week. I told her one of the days was fine but I'd have to move around my waitressing job for the other day. I told her I'd let her know for sure Friday night.

I gave away my AM shift and text her to let her know everything was set. She then tells me she made other arrangements. Obviously I was upset. I told her "" I already rescheduled my hours per your request. Now I am out those hours. I'd appreciate more communication in the future""

she apologized in her reply and said we would go back to the original plan of me working the two mornings.

I came in for a separate night sit for them and her first words were "" what you sent me was extremely rude and I was very put off"" 

We eventually worked things out and now I'm just working the morning that I gave my shift away for. 


Any opinions? Was there a better way I could have handled this?"

I am currently studying for a Computer Science degree, am a teaching assistant, and am constantly applying for internships. I do this not because I specifically want to, but because I know what I have to do to better my chances of succeeding in the working world. Thankfully I ended up liking my degree as well as teaching, but I didn't start off wanting to do either of those things. You have to ""play the game,"" as I see it, and there are just certain things you have to do to succeed in the ""real world."" Granted, there are many other paths, but this is one I have chosen to take. I am very busy, but also make lots of time for myself. I finish work ahead of time so that I can go out on the weekends and not worry about my academics falling apart.


My boyfriend, on the other hand, gets depressed anytime any kind of work is mentioned. He doesn't have good time management skills either as he will sometimes put off studying for an exam till the morning of. This may have been okay in high school, but not in college. When he falls behind in a class, he doesn't try to catch up until an exam is coming up and just crams. And then he gets upset when he doesn't get that great of a grade. Granted, his courses sometimes grade extremely harshly, but there are many instances where he could have handled studying better and that could have made a difference. I can't help but feel that he's stuck in his high school, coast-by mindset, and less-than-expected grades don't seem to push him to improve on his life skills. I mean, sometimes he doesn't even eat because he doesn't want to go out to buy groceries or cook for himself. 


We go to separate universities, and the plan was for him to transfer to my university to pursue a degree not offered at his university after two years. For the first two years, I have constantly encouraged him to look for research opportunities/jobs on campus to improve his chances of getting in (as it's very competitive.) And it's good to pad his resume for future internships/jobs anyway. But he never once heeded my suggestions or ever really took them seriously. He focused on playing video games as his extracurriculars, which is fine, except that he made no time to do other extracurriculars that actually pertained to his intended degree. I was not surprised when he got rejected by my university because I am sure other applicants worked not only hard, but smart. When we were discussing his rejection, he commented that he was upset because he knew he could have gotten in, if he had, ""literally spent time doing nothing but study."" That made me slightly angry because it sounded as if he had worked really hard and didn't get in solely because the expectations were just impossible to achieve. No, he didn't get in because he didn't manage his time wisely. He wasn't organized and would forget to turn in lab reports and homework (and when that happened I suggested just getting a calendar or something to keep track of things.) He wouldn't study for exams until the last minute, and then he would realize how much he didn't know and spend an all-nighter. He had free time that he used for relaxation, which is needed, but part of that time could have gone to other more productive things. He did take a hard workload, but other people who applied probably took that same workload. Just completing the pre-requisites is not sufficient. 


And regarding application essays: I essentially wrote them because he would get so caught up in the fact that he, ""hates essays and can't do them."" I gave him tips and guidelines on how to start essays and always offered to help him proofread. I would get upset at him sometimes that he would procrastinate all the time and would just wallow in the fact he hates writing essays, and then he would get upset at me and tell me he didn't need me to help him anyway. But then I had to skip all my classes on the day his application was due to proofread his essays because he finished his essay at the last possible minute. And I had to print out his application for him and run to the admissions office to hand it in because he didn't do it ahead of time in time to turn in it in person himself. 


I would understand if he lived the past two years like this and wasn't intending on transferring, but he knew what he was getting into. He saw how hard I worked to get into my degree (the college of engineering at my university is incredibly selective.) He doesn't seem to think about things completely and does things expecting them to just work out. He doesn't make back-up plans and likes to deal with things ""when they happen."" After getting denied, he said, ""I've never been denied from something before,"" which leads me to think he has just cruised through life so far without really having to work to achieve something. I think he's having a really hard time adapting to the real world and life as an independent individual. He's an incredibly intelligent and logical person, but in some aspects I can't help but feel like he's immature and it leads me to get very frustrated. Because of this I come off as condescending and mean, so how can I address these topics without sounding this way? I am potentially transferring to his university now, and it's sometimes very hard to not sound bitter when talking about it because I've worked very hard to get to where I am now, and now I may have to give that up. 


We just got into an argument over majors and he kept saying all of this was just dumb and that we're doing college to get a 9 to 5 job, to come home and do chores, and then be too tired to do anything else, and then to do nothing of significance on the weekends because it's too short. I told him you can look at it that way, or you can think of it more positively. You can still learn by making time to read books. You can create time for hobbies. You can go for a weekend trip by driving somewhere. It doesn't have to be as depressing as he made it seem. You just have to be mature about it and realize that it's not going to be easy, but it can still be great. That's what responsibilities are. I asked him if he had other ideas of life paths since he seemed to despise our current path so much, and all he could say was ""anything but this."" What in the world do I say to that? Stop being lazy and control your huge aversion to working? Find something else to do since you hate this so much? It's so frustrating and I don't know how to approach conversations so that they don't dissolve into arguments.


   
**tl;dr**: I am very driven academically, and manage time wisely so that I have both a social and academic life. My boyfriend has a huge aversion to work and gets extremely upset about working/college/responsibilities."

I will be taking data structures in August (this fall). I can't take any other CS course unless I take that since that's a prerequisite for all 'higher level' CS classes. I'm taking Programming and Problem Solving(Java), and Discrete Structures this semester. 

The issue that I have is that career fairs usually happen early February and mid September. There is simply no way I can master the things I am learning during that semester in less than one month of classes. And as far as I can tell, Data Structures and Algorithms(which I will have to take spring 2016) are the two most important things for technical interviews. 

How have people traditionally dealt with these issues? I have decided to switch to CS pretty late, so I am not familiar with a lot of things with regards to internships and interviews. Should I teach myself data structures and algorithms during the summer? Wouldn't that be risky in terms of bad programming habits that may remain unchecked? How and when can I prepare?

My friend and I are graduating from the same uni this year and from last August we have been on the job hunt together looking for chemical engineering entry level positions in the US.

I mean to point where we have been applying to jobs together for about 4 hours a day (almost). 

Now the thing is, we have the exact same experiences. The reason being because what I was able to get into (internship or research), I got him into as well and vice versa. 

To be completely honest, it is like we have the exact same resume, they are incredibly similar. He has a significant higher GPA than I do with a bit of different activities.

However we do have different cover letters.

At this point, we both are very experienced in finding jobs we want online.

And overall, he has had more interviews than I do. That's not a bad thing, but I am wondering if I had a shot at the jobs but didn't get it because they saw both of our resumes and went with the higher GPA.

Now my questions are:

1) Is this hurting my chances of getting a job? Why or why not?

2) Should I try to apply by myself or continue applying with him?

TL:DR Friend and I apply a lot together. Same experience, almost same resume. He has higher GPA. He has had more interviews than I.  Refer to the questions, please and thank you.

UPDATE: I ultimately decided to start the application process on my own. I just want to say thank you to you guys who went out of their way to give a noobie some advice. This community is very helpful. "

My SO has made it clear that if I went w/o him I'd have nothing to come home to, and I don't feel comfortable sending an intern to cover it so I'm throwing it out to you all.

First off, I'm sorry there's no money involved, but if you gave me something from the weekend, I'd have no problems with you trying to sell anything else you came away from the event with (even reselling the story, just not to a publication in VA please!) 

Obviously you more experienced writers would like to see me hung for asking for free work, but hey, I'm a journalist, the least I can do is ask, and I know if I was in a program up in NYC, single, and hungry, I'd love the chance to do this even w/o pay. 

Ideally the angle would be about the 'sex positive' nature of the event, it seems like it'll be a fairly unique opportunity. It could be fairly straight forward event coverage. 

If you wanted to Gonzo/first person it, that would be alright as long as you get some good voices and good pics. 

Either one longer piece 1000-1200 words, or a few shorter pieces - tons of cell phone pics (or higher quality images) would be great too. 

If this is something that sounds interesting to you, please PM me with some links to your previous work so I can at least see you've done something similar (Even if it was a pie eating contest, i just want to know you can handle yourself in public and you'll actually finish the work)

You don't have to be straight or gay, just open to having discussions about how porn impacts any and everyone - and voices from Porn Hub would be great.

Alright, this is weird, I know, and i'm not fully counting on it to pan out, but I'd need to get everything confirmed by Wednesday afternoon, so please be in touch if this sounds like something you'd be down for. "

I am male 23 year old Computer Science student from Denmark who is currently looking for a place to stay during my internship period. I will be staying from August to December, and will be doing work experience with a Los Angeles-based company called WhiteMoon Dreams during this time.

The internship is unpaid, with only the Danish student grant that all students get as my income, so I don't necessarily have a lot of money to do with. I'm thinking I'd be able to use between $600 and $700 per month if it doesn't include food. And of course I'd prefer if the room I'd be renting was furnished.

Little bit of info on myself: I'm not all that noisy and I'm good in the kitchen, so I could even cook a bit as a part of my rent. My hobbies include computer games and miniature wargames, greatest of which is the latter.

Even if you don't have a place I could possibly stay, maybe you could redirect me to a place I can find somewhere to stay?

Hope to hear from someone soon!"

2wvpkf,1,2015-02-23,"22M4F Multiple Prompts (Including Anal, Superheroes and drugs)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2wvpkf/22m4f_multiple_prompts_including_anal_superheroes/,"Hi I’m looking for a lovely “lady” that would like to role play with me. I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

2wvq60,0,2015-02-23,Any companies still looking for interns for the summer?,stilllookinfor,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2wvq60/any_companies_still_looking_for_interns_for_the/,"So, I'm a masters student at a top-10 CS university. I was supposed to graduate this semester but will stay on for one more. Hence, instead of full time jobs I'm trying to look for internships now. Since this realization came late, I'm kind of delayed in the process.

I realize it's late in the process already, so I was wondering if there's any place I could still apply. My GPA isn't great (&gt;3.7 though) because I focused on research and I have a couple of publications to show for it. I've worked for slightly more than an year at one of the big 4, unfortunately I can't seem to go there because they filled the spots I was looking for. I'm not sure whether my profile would get me internship calls ( I didn't intern last summer as I was doing research to meet some conference deadlines, does that count against me?). The only reason I say this is because I sent out a couple of emails and got no replies, which I'm not sure is due to my profile or because I might be really late now.

Anyone got suggestions on where I can look? Thanks!"

2wvzfm,6,2015-02-23,I [24m] want to propose to my gf [25f] whom I'm sad to say I don't completely trust.,Thr0wnawhey,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2wvzfm/i_24m_want_to_propose_to_my_gf_25f_whom_im_sad_to/,"First things first. I'm sure this already sounds stupid so I'll try and make as much sense as possible. 

Secondly, if you have any constructive opinion on the matter, I'd really appreciate the input.

Anna and i have been dating for a little over three years now and to say that i don't love her immensely would be a blatant lie. Aside from my aging father, she is undoubtedly the most important person to me at this point in my life and after much thought and reflection i've come to this conclusion that has me so torn.

In our time together we've had 3 times that put legitimate strain on our relationship. They all involve men she's befriended that have tried to get her to cheat. I admit i have my insecurities but in each situation, the men have outright told her that they didn't care she was in a committed relationship. Despite this, she didn't break contact with the men until i shared my discomfort in constantly hanging out with them. 

She's told me that nothing has happened between them and i believe her in that, but this current situation is all too familiar.

2 months ago she quit her second job and went full time with her first at the reasoning of her parents, friends, and myself. She's making good money and is getting along with her coworkers. She seems happier and i'm happy with this change as well. I also happen to have a relative that works with her. Through that relative I learned that there would be times she would tell me one of her parents would get her from work (she doesn't drive and I'm her primary means of transportation) when really she would go hang out with one of her male coworkers. (Not Aaron later in the story)

I confronted her about it and in the resulting discussion she reasoned that she kept it from me because nothing was going on and she didn't want to worry me unnecessarily with her spending time with other men.


 This was a problem because from the start we both agreed that full disclosure was important and that secrets would not be kept out of respect for each others' emotional maturity. This whole thing caught me off guard and raised a lot of questions about other times she might have lied. 

I actually think it's great she's making friends on her own because she has confided in me that she has trouble getting close with people I don't act as a sort of bridge between. We got past this and everything was going great. Until my relative told me about Aaron.

After the whole ""ride ordeal"" she would usually make it a point to tell me about the guys and girls she felt she was getting close with which is why i found it a little off she never mentioned Aaron except in passing where she would usually go in depth about their personality and why they seemed like good people. Talking with my relative he conversationally mentioned the people she was close with and that's when Aaron's name first came up.

In a moment of weakness when she was occupied at my place, I took a look at her texts and Facebook conversations. I found that they've been talking regularly in a semi flirty way which I admit isn't uncommon for her personality. Ultimately there was nothing so suspect that would paint her as a cheater. 

Now we're caught up to last night. She had told me she would get off at 6 and had invited a new intern out to dinner as he was new to the area and she wanted to make them feel welcome. I said it was a kind thing to do and just asked her when she thought she'd be done and to shoot me a text letting me know where they decided to walk for food and when she needed me to pick her up. 

I sent about 3 texts a little after she got off to let her know my plans for the evening and tried to call her at 8:50 (around the time she said she'd be done) but got no response until 9:40 when she called me. 

She let me know that the intern had to pick up an evening shift and just got off. They were only just then getting dinner and the 3 hours between her getting off and then, she had spent with friends. She repeatedly apologized for not responding sooner and said she had seen my texts but forgot to reply.

 The thing is in the worry of her not responding and thinking she might be in some kind of trouble I realized that my anxiety also stemmed from not trusting her. With her seemingly evasive behavior with Aaron and our history I found that I didn't fully believe she was out with friends in that time. I'm not even sure if she's actually at dinner with the new intern or not.

 My side of the conversation was pretty much saying we had to have a talk the next night when she got off work. I plan on letting her know my distrust and the reasons behind it. I do feel this is the person I want to end up with and I plan on outright telling her I will propose but that this has to be resolved first. That if there's anything she's withholding I intend to hear it and that for us to go any further as a couple, I need full disclosure.

This is the only front where we have issues. We're both creative people that get along phenomenally. I've never connected with anyone else on a similar level and I am certain she loves me even if she might be unfaithful.

Am I handling this whole thing wrong? Am I being too controlling/intrusive in her social life? Is this conversation counter-productive?

If you've read this whole wall of text then thanks for your time.

**TL;DR:** After some straining times and a moment that made me question my partner's validity, I found I could no longer give her the benefit of the doubt when she doesn't keep me updated when out with coworkers."

2ww4fp,1,2015-02-23,Investment Decisions for Current Student,felm125,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2ww4fp/investment_decisions_for_current_student/,"Hi,

I have read a few threads on here and looked at the links on the right, but would appreciate some advice tailored to my current situation.

A little background on myself: I am a Sophomore studying Computer Science at a top-ranked University. I have no student debt and all my expenses are paid by my parents. I currently have ~$3000 in a checking account with a monthly income of about $400. This summer I will be making about $13,000 from my internship. My only investments at the moment is my Roth IRA, which I have contributed the maximum amount to for the year.I already have a car and don't have anything I really want to spend my money on.

I have two main questions:

1. What are my best options for investing my money now (and the money I make this summer)?  Since all my expenses are paid for, I do not really care about liquidity outside of keeping a buffer of ~$1500 for discretionary spending. I have a pretty high tolerance for risk as well, especially given it would be unlikely I would make less than $100,000 upon graduation (so the money I have now is not a huge deal if lost). However, with the market being so high at the moment, is there a better vehicle for mid-long term gains?

2. What should I do with the money in the Roth? My Dad has helped with the account, but I do not think he is doing much to micromanage it.

Thanks in advance!"

[Hi Paul. Thanks for doing this!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/couk7kh?context=5)|All very good and difficult questions! Let me try…
[Many scholars in the past have denounced the effectiveness of pure economic sanctions in coercing countries to make a change. With the sanctions being placed on Russia by the United States being at least mildly effective (tanking the worth of the ruble, Treasury Department naming Russian entities as illegal to aid, blocking company contact with Russian industry, etc...\), do you see them finally being an effective, viable way to coerce nations to make a change in their actions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/couk7kh?context=5)|I think economic sanctions probably work only over time - usually a matter of years, even decades -- in coercing countries to make a change. But what happens initially seems to be the opposite: hunkering down, tightening of control, etc. Certainly I think sanctions are an influential tool, but the question I always have is how long they take to work, is it fast enough, and is it worth the reaction you're going to get in the meantime? 
[How has the uprising of pro-Russian militias in places like Donetsk and Lugansk affected the relationship between the civilian government and military leadership in Ukraine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/couk7kh?context=5)|Lots of people who served in volunteer battalions or on the front ran in the Ukrainian parliamentary elections and formally entered politics. The prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, created a political party called the National Front that has a significant military element, including people who have served on the front and people from the Interior Ministry. So there is a mixing of the two. But I think its fair to say that the conflict has certainly stressed the relationship between the military leadership and the government (witness how many defense ministers Ukraine has had since the conflict began) - because most everyone will admit to you that Ukraine's military was woefully unprepared for something like this to take place. 
[Do you see Putin backing down any time soon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/couk7kh?context=5)|To be honest, no. 
[In your opinion, is another cold war or worse likely in the near future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/coujfbr?context=5)|We're already seeing a level of confrontation between Russia and Europe/US that is reminiscent of the Cold War. But we're not going to see a return of the same thing, because the world is different, more globalized and connected. One of the key differences is that Russia doesn't have an explicit opposing ideology in the way that the Soviet Union did during the Cold War. Much of the Cold War was directed by the concept that democracy had to triumph over communism - it was not just a geopolitical confrontation but also a battle over how countries and the world should be run. Though the Kremlin of late has tried to emphasize how much Russia's ideology differs from European liberalism, it's not a full-scale articulation of an alternative system. What we see in Russia today is more a modified version of what you see in Europe or the US, not a completely different way of organizing society as you had in the Soviet era. 
[I spent several months in Kiev in 2003. It is a beautiful city with great people. What are the living conditions there now and what is their view of Americans today ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/coujqjn?context=5)|Agreed, it is a beautiful city, and it does have great people. The view of Americans was generally positive in Ukraine during maidan, though I do think there are a lot of Ukrainians who now feel betrayed by what they perceive as the lack of support from the US and the West in the wake of those protests. As far as living conditions, Ukraine is not only facing an actual battle in the east but also a serious battle on the economic front. That's certainly affecting people in Kiev and elsewhere. The economy contracted by about 7% last year and it projected to contract by another 5.5% this year. The currency has plummeted to about 30 hryvnia to the dollar today, compared to about 9 hryvnia to the dollar last year. People are hurting - there's no doubt about that - and the economy is likely to get worse. 
[Thank you for doing this AMA been following your daily updates on twitter for a while now.  Have you seen the new footage about MH17 mentioned by the daily Telegraph and what is your take on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/coujk8x?context=5)|I have seen reports on the new footage. I don't think anyone is under the impression that the site was treated with dignity, so the idea that the footage counteracts that perception seems off to me. The site was not treated with dignity, there are no doubts about that. We also know that the rebel fighters were the first on the scene, spent time going through and at times blocking off the crash site and took the black boxes (though later returned them to Malaysian authorities). As for the whole debate over locals taking things from the crash site, I never saw that, and to be honest, I think these were isolated incidents if they happened. Most locals did the opposite, as far as I understood - they tried to figure out how and where to return belongings they found and were incredibly traumatized themselves. I wrote a bit about this with my colleagues here: [Link to on.wsj.com](http://on.wsj.com/1LvsZ3w)
[When and how, in your opinion, the conflict in Ukraine will end?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/couilib?context=5)|Not soon. The question is really different phases and levels of the conflict. I hope that the intense fighting phase will dissipate soon, and though they are regularly violated, the ceasefire efforts can help in that regard. If you look at other similar conflict areas in the former Soviet Union, such as Abkhazia, they have been in some state of conflict for decades, even though active fighting hasn't been as intense as it was. People now refer to these places as 'frozen conflicts' - places still stuck a state of 'conflict' that can bubble into violence any day if not active war zones. I think that's where we're headed.
[How noticeable an effect are the western sanctions having? Are they affecting everyday life for the average Russian? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/couiwdz?context=5)|Though the main reason Russia's currency has plummeted is the plunge in oil prices, I think it's fair to say that the sanctions were a contributing factor - and most every Russian is certainly feeling the effects of the ruble's stark devaluation. Russia's response to the sanctions (banning an array of foodstuffs from the EU and the US) has been felt in supermarkets. Some higher-end stuff (such as Italian mozzarella) is now unavailable, but that affects only a smaller slice of the population. The broader population has felt a rise in food prices more generally.
[*Some higher-end stuff (such as Italian mozzarella\) is now unavailable.*  Where do you shop at? It's available at any Перекросток as well as Утконос. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/coum3we?context=5)|Is it *Italian*?
[What is your impression of the Russian people and their perception of the crisis in Ukraine? Do you find that many are heavily influenced by Russian State Media?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/coujga6?context=5)|Yes. Polls repeatedly show that Russians are indeed heavily influenced by state television. You can find an article on one of those polls here: [Link to www.themoscowtimes.com](http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/poll-finds-94-of-russians-depend-on-state-tv-for-ukraine-coverage/499988.htm) The effects are palpable. For example, even though most of the rest of the world believes Russia-backed rebels downed MH17, polls show that the bulk of Russians believe the airliner was downed by Ukrainian forces - something Russian state television has been alleging since minutes after the crash.  
[What has been the highlight of your career and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/couif97?context=5)|It feels strange to describe something so tragic as a highlight, but covering the conflict in Ukraine has been the most intense period in my career - and at times the most rewarding. I had covered a lot of things before -- two Olympics, lots of corporate news, various elections and political scandals -- but I had never covered a conflict, which somehow seems more pressing from a reporting perspective. It sort of hits you over the head with the full array of human emotions -- from good to evil -- in a way that my previous assignments had not.
[Is Putin trying to rebuild the old USSR?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/coujtrl?context=5)|I think he is trying to return elements of the old USSR to achieve his political aims, not return the old USSR itself. So much of Putin's political project is about tapping into the feelings of vanquished glory that took hold among many Russians after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when Russia descended into political and economic turmoil. He has presented his rule as an antidote to that, which is why you see elements of praising or perhaps even reconstructing the past as critical to his political messaging.
[Hello Paul, thank you for doing this! Do you have any advice/tips for someone hoping to enter the journalism workforce soon? How did you get your start as a journalist abroad? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/coulghb?context=5)|Find a way to differentiate yourself. Enter journalism with a special skill that others don't have, whether that's knowledge of a lesser-studied foreign language (like Russian!) or deeper expertise in a subject such as finance, economics or defense. I started, like many people, as an intern - at the New York Times and the Associated Press in Moscow and then later at the Wall Street Journal in London. I likely wouldn't have received any of those internships had I not learned Russian, which turned out to be a real asset in finding a journalism job.
[Do you think Russia is likely to expand even more than Crimea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/coul41k?context=5)|Not right now. I think it's a bit of a misconception that Russia wants to take more of Ukrainian land outside Crimea and make it officially Russian territory. It may want to control territory indirectly, but as far as making Donbass part of Russia, the Kremlin more or less had the opportunity and refused. Donbass is quite a large land area with millions of people and a lot of state-dependent pensioners and enterprises - so it would be a fairly acute economic burden. 
[Hi Paul What's the most difficult issue you faced in doing your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/coukr89?context=5)|Most recently, the most difficult thing has been writing about civilians on both sides of the conflict, many of them apolitical, who are suffering in truly horrific circumstances. Sometimes you write a story with the hope that something will change for them and then realize that even though the story did get a lot of readers and people did care, nothing actually changes for the people on the ground. That can feel a bit soul destroying sometimes.

2ww7xr,21,2015-02-23,Me [22 F] with my boyfriend [23 M] of a year. He no longer goes out of his way to do things for me or show me that he loves me...am I being too harsh? What do I do now?,elleirabird,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ww7xr/me_22_f_with_my_boyfriend_23_m_of_a_year_he_no/,"I've been dating Jake (fake name) for a year now, and it started off as a wonderful relationship. We were best friends for almost a year before we started dating, and I've honestly never connected with someone on so many levels: emotional, intellectual, spiritual, etc. The sex is wonderful but we also have a great time just *talking* about different topics. 

When the relationship started he was extremely passionate about it. Little notes, love letters, small gifts - not expensive things, but meaningful ones. We'd go on cute dates and do creative things together (painting, geocaching, etc.) that were really fun and exciting. 

Both of us are in college at different schools but we live approximately five minutes away from each other. I'm in my senior semester and am pretty busy writing my capstone paper for my major, and I also have a full time internship. He's doing some pretty difficult math classes and also works part time on the weekend at an ice-cream parlour. 

Over the last few months I've expressed being unhappy in the relationship because Jake just doesn't seem to put effort into me/us. Nothing. It's been disappointment after disappointment. I can tell that he loves me still, but I don't feel like a priority, or important at all. Here's a kind of breakdown for you guys:

* He doesn't text me first anymore and doesn't send the same kind of loving texts/good morning ones that I used to get. I always have to contact him first.
* Semi-frequently I'll give him small gifts that made me think of him (snacks in weird flavours, little pins for his coat, Magic cards that I think look cool - you know, you'll be shopping and see something and will think of your SO. 
* I cook for him a few times a week even though we don't live together so that he'll have healthy things to bring to school/work. 
* I pay for approximately half of our dates, so it's not just resting on him. 
* I also am the person who plans and comes up with most of our dates and activities. If I didn't do anything, I'm not sure if we'd really hang out much at all, let alone do anything fun. 
* I taught him how drive and until recently was the person who drove us to dates, picked him up at his house, and sometimes drove to get him from school. He only just got a car about six weeks ago.

The final straw was (unsurprisingly) Valentine's Day. I'm not a materialistic person but I was hoping that he'd at least do a little something. I got him a custom box of chocolates and took us out on a surprise date to a national park, and he did...nothing. My hopes weren't high, but I was hoping for anything: a card, a chocolate bar, even a cute note or something. But there was nothing. This is a running theme in the relationship now. 

At this point I just don't know what to do. I **have** had talks about this before with him in a pretty logical manner, e.g. ""I don't feel like I'm that special to you lately, I'd really appreciate if you put some more effort into the relationship, etc."" His only response is ""I guess I'm not good enough for you"" and to get kind of sulky. 

I feel bad because I know that Jake is pretty busy, and usually has more homework than me. Most of our quality time together is spent studying so that he can get his work done. He also has some kind of undiagnosed chronic illness (like an allergy or an autoimmune disease) and deals with bouts of depression and anxiety. I'm super empathetic to this because I have hypothyroidism and accompanying major depression and panic attacks, so I understand what it's like to be tired and have limited energy. I've tried to get him to use the free therapy clinic at his school but he doesn't seem to want to, and he doesn't have the insurance or the money to see a doctor and get a blood panel done. I'm currently in therapy for my issues and take Synthroid for my thyroid, so generally I'm okay.

But I feel so at a loss here; I pour so much into the relationship and I get nothing back. I don't play mind games with him - I let him know about the kind of things that I like, what chocolate or books or flowers are my favourite, that I miss his texts. Nothing.

At this point I've thought about breaking up with him but I still love him, and we work so well together. He makes me laugh like nobody else and I can see myself marrying him...I just don't know how to fix this issue. What can I do? 

   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend of one year no longer puts effort into the relationship. I've talked to him about this several times and see no change. What should I do?"

2wwfzo,14,2015-02-23,"[m, 27] ex of 3.5 years and I split 4 months ago and I'm struggling",tossaway771,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2wwfzo/m_27_ex_of_35_years_and_i_split_4_months_ago_and/,"I'm just struggling really hard. Not really because of the loss of a girlfriend. The truth is I had a few relationships (from Tinder hookups, to a more serious relationship from eharmony), but I broke up with a few of them because I'm OK being alone and I'd rather not string them along.

What I'm really struggling with is the immense feeling of a loss of a friend, or a loss of a whole group of friends. Fleetwood Mac said it best, I'm second hand news now. None of those friends can really interact with me because I'm the exile of sorts. 

A bit of background, we met years ago and moved to all different places together, Washington, Hawaii, California, then to her home state of North Carolina, where I know no one. We broke up about 5 months after that, once I had settled into a great job and my own place. I know in hindsight she had checked out and was struggling to drag it on, but all my friends here were through her.

I've been out on meetup, and joined a rock climbing gym, a band, work is good etc. But nothing makes me want to vomit more than the feeling that all those people are gone. I also know she has a new boyfriend which I believe she got with no more than 2 months after we broke up and that just makes me want to cry and throw up. After our first summer we met, she left for home in NC while I finished an internship, and she cried and cried because she wanted us to try and be a couple, and I finally said OK let's try. Now she's decided she's done and is fine moving on already. I cried before falling asleep Saturday :(

I also think this revealed that I don't have a huge goal in life right now; things are going well at another new job (7 jobs in 7 years!) and I don't have the effort in me for a huge overhaul.

I just feel gutted and I feel like I'm regressing. "

:--|:--
[I cannot stress how awesome you guys are for your work on Medieval Engineers and Space Engineers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/counjtq?context=5)|Bigger features take us longer than 1 week to finish, so we plan them in advance and the development of many features actually overlap.
[I really think your weekly update plan has been a staple of your success, but doesn't it cause strain on you to finish updates within one week sprints?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/counjtq?context=5)|Let's say we start working on super-large world in November but we know it will take 2 months to finish. So along with this we also start smaller features that can be finished in 1-2 weeks and if you put them many in parallel, then you can still release something reasonable every week.
[Alternatively;  Do you finish certain features far in advance, and keep them on the side?  (in the event a planned feature isn't ready by the Thursday release it is scheduled, you could release that earlier finished feature\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/counjtq?context=5)|""Features in advance"" - we considered this long time ago but in reality once some feature is finished, we want to get it to you as fast as possible, so even if we wanted to keep it on hold, our emotions don't allow this :)
[What were the decisive points in selecting the release date of ME? Why wasn't it released earlier and why wasn't it released later?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/counzcb?context=5)|I don't really remember but it was probably the shortest time we considered to be reasonable. In general we want to release things as fast as possible without sacrificing quality (too much).
 |It's better to get the game out to the community, get feedback, and start integrating that feedback. Developing just on our assumptions of what people do and want is not cool :)
[Should I expect rails anytime in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/coundic?context=5)|This is a tough question :) Rotors and pistons already proved that some types of physics objects are very hard to implement in real time in an environment where object weights differs drastically... so we would rather focus on other things and not do rails for now.
[What has been the greatest challenge for you over the course of development so far? (Also: are you interested in hiring an intern? ;\) \)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/counfb2?context=5)|For Medieval Engineers it was probably the structural integrity. It's a thing where we didn't know if we will be able to make it run in real time and kind of realistic. It's not perfect yet (probably never will be) but it's kind of cool.
[Hi Keen! Love your games but love your attitude to making games and how you listen to gamers even more!! Please keep doing what you do.  Could you please add a spray-gun to the tools so we can paint our ships easier in SE?  How long until we see multi-player in Medieval Engineers? EDIT: 3. Will we be able to control AI at some point in SE? i.e. AI crews for ships?  Cheers!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/counj3m?context=5)|Ad 2) MP in Medieval Engineers - probably a few months. We will use netcode we already have in Space Engineers, but at the same time we are changing a lot of netcode to different library. In general, MP in ME will require less work than it did for SE because we already have the infrastructure and GUI part of it.
[Hi KSH! Have you thought about implementing any sort of campaign/challenges to Space Engineers? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/counvn8?context=5)|Yes. Actually ""In my latest blog post I forgot to mention that we are also going to work on campaigns/scenarios for Space Engineers"" [Link to twitter.com](https://twitter.com/marek_rosa/status/569111230209785856)
[Is the same team working on both games? If that's true, will affect the update speed for both games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/couo4jn?context=5)|We have two teams, one is for SE and the other is for ME. But many responsibilities and features overlap (e.g. nature from ME will also get to SE as planets)
[Some advance or news about water?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/counemu?context=5)|Just some preliminary idea-designs, directions where we might go if we decide to implement water. We see that many people dig water :)
[When roughly we will see Oxygen and Planets be added?  (Rough Estimate\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/counvkk?context=5)|Sorry but one of our rules is not to reveal ETA :)
 |However, oxygen and planets are not that hard as people may imagine, it will be sooner than people think.
[Can we expect any improvements on character animations (Just the basic ones\), and since you've considered oxygen and planets (Thank you!\), will you also be adding NPCs anytime soon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/coung06?context=5)|Character animation is one of the big things we are working on undercover... basically adding some inverse kinematics and ragdoll and in future maybe even more advanced stuff.
[Like that nice April Fools thing you guys did.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/coung06?context=5)|NPC - yes... you can start counting hours... Haha :)
[NPCs in SE? In hours?  (I think PyroMcDips was asking about NPCs in Space Engineers. Are we in for a really big surprise today?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/couoprr?context=5)|Sorry, I meant NPC for ME, not SE.
[Will we see different environments (Desert, tundra\) and weather types (rain, snow\) in ME? Also day/night?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/couo06r?context=5)|Yes this would be cool. Rain and snow is probably harder to implement (from rendering point of view), but day/nigh is a sure thing.
[Will pistons and rotors ever work properly in multiplayer? (Edit: Or when moving?\)  Thanks!!! Also keep up the good work with both Space Engineers and Medieval Engineers (which i havent bought yet as im not finished with Space engineers yet.. but it looks awesome!\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/counu8v?context=5)|""Will pistons and rotors ever work properly in multiplayer?"" - as sad as I am to say this, I am not sure if rotors/pistons can be 100% accurate. Simulating this type of objects is a very comples physics calculation problem and we don't think it can be solved in real-time. This doesn't mean we won't try to figure it out, but it just might be impossible.
[What sources do you use when it comes to researching for both games to make sure they're scientifically and/or historically accurate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/couo3cc?context=5)|We read books, watch documentary movies, consult with field experts, talk with the community. If we could we would time-travel to middle ages.
[What are your plans for VR in Space Engineers / Medieval Engineers?  Would be grand to be able to build a cockpit and fly a fighter around, or use the rift to look around in spacesuit mode.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/couniht?context=5)|We don't have any actually development plans for VR (Oculus or any other). We think that this technology needs to get mature before it's ready for our players.
[My block textures keep on flicering from one texture to an other in ME, can anyone help me? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/counxzr?context=5)|Combination of some blocks are still not properly set, we are working on this. But it will work soon.
[Hi, you've talked a little about your ""Super secret project"" and you've also said that you will tell us more about this project in future. So any hints when this might be? :\) Also Pozdrav z ČR :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/couort1?context=5)|Yes, there will be this presentation soon [Link to www.zive.cz](http://www.zive.cz/clanky/prednaska-o-vyzkumu-umele-inteligence-v-keen-software/sc-3-a-177121/default.aspx)
[Where did you get the inspiration/idea for space engineers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/counf7t?context=5)|Mostly from LEGO and from real life experience - not that we are astronauts :)
[Mainly as i'd like to have a linux dedicated server :\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/couneby?context=5)|Sorry but we are not working on a Linux/Mac version at this moment.
[What other planned features in Space Engineers are dependant on the ""secret AI project"" ? Would I be correct in assuming the Faction ships in Exploration, some or all of the scenario/campaign, better cargo ships ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/couo2iv?context=5)|This secret AI project is not for games. BTW, we will announce the project soon.
[Your HP says that Barbarians are coming soon, could you specify? Weeks? Months?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/couno62?context=5)|Hours? :)
[Is it official that Tuesdays are ME patchmas days?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/coup6a7?context=5)|Yes, hopefully :)
[How will you guys make the social aspect of Medieval engineers, do you think in the future we will be able to have several communities in a server who each affect each other in trading or war?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/counwc4?context=5)|Yes, factions. Just like in SE. We will need to figure out how will they communicate because there are no antennas in ME.
[I'm sorry that it's morbid, but I wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone at keen. Space engineers helped me get through the death of my mum. Even when I broke my hand I kept playing (albeit slowly\). Thank you guys, you do great work and it makes a difference to people. My comment was just removed because it wasn't a question. So I'll ask something just because I have to. Do you play any Space Engineers for pleasure or has it just become part of the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/couow5q?context=5)|I don't play SE nor ME, but I also can't say ""it's just my job"". I work on it because it's a passion. I just don't have time to play many games - or in other words, I much more enjoy creating games than playing them :)
[Hey guys, first off I want to say I love your games.  Played the hell out of Space Engineers for a while and just picked up Medieval Engineers to support such an awesome company ;\)  My question is - do you ever plan on hosting your own servers are any point? Player run servers are a great option, however I'd love to have the ability to play on more stable servers run by you guys and not have to worry about my hard work disappearing due to the admin dropping the server.  What about console servers?  Last thing - best pizza toppings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/counl9f?context=5)|KeenSWH hosted servers are a good idea. We have considered SE MMO but it was just a brief idea, nothing we pursued for longer. It will be good if people let us know if they want this or not.
[AFAIK they're dedicating tuesdays to ME updates and thursdays to SE updates.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/coup5d5?context=5)|Yes.

2wwpjc,2,2015-02-23,Cover Letters when applying through company's website?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2wwpjc/cover_letters_when_applying_through_companys/,"I am currently sending applications directly through company's career sections and through internmatch, and was wondering how much importance is in submitting a customized cover letter for each one? 

I currently have written one for a company I briefly talked to at a career fair, and want to see if this kind of letter is okay. Should it be formatted more formally?

&gt;Greetings,

&gt;My name is ______ , and I am a current student studying computer science X University. Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to speak with a university recruiter about ______ through our school career fair, and I wanted to express my interest in the software development internship this summer.
&gt;
&gt;I have a strong passion for creating applications and am highly interested in learning and developing in mobile and cloud technologies. I believe my academic courses and personal projects have prepared me with solid object-oriented programming skills, as well as experience with databases and web development. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to apply my skill set towards a meaningful project, while gaining valuable experience through interning with _______.
&gt;
&gt;I look forward to hearing from _______ regarding this position. Thank you for your time and consideration. 
&gt;
&gt;Sincerely,
&gt;Me

In this case, I was able to say I learned about them at a fair, but what about applying to random companies? Many thanks in advance."
2wwraf,2,2015-02-23,"[M4F] You may be a powerful politician, but you're also my whore.",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2wwraf/m4f_you_may_be_a_powerful_politician_but_youre/,"You've always been a strong woman, and your sheer willpower has carried you far in life. From humble beginnings in a small country town, to a law school scholarship, to a chair in the US Senate. You're an icon to career-focused women everywhere. You're outspoken on gender issues, you hold a chair at several senate committees related to women's issues. You have a staff team full of male employees, so you're used to men taking orders from you. Even your own husband has a tendency to buckle when confronting you.

But there's one man who doesn't buckle when facing. Quite the opposite, in fact. He's the most unlikely one, a fresh new intern at your office headquarters, so new that he's still tasked with fetching coffee for his seniors. He's so unremarkable that most people who pass through probably don't even notice him.

But he's the only one you will cave for. How many times have you let him fuck you after everyone else had gone home? How many nasty, demeaning names have you let him call you? You stopped giving blowjobs to your own husband after a while because it felt too demeaning, but you'll drop to your knees for him and swallow every last drop he gives you.

And he knows that no matter how many times you swear to yourself that last night was the last time, that it's simply too dangerous to your political career to have an affair with an intern, let alone one where you're so blatantly submissive, you'll be on your knees again.

Back in Feb 2006 I received a speeding ticket in a small town upstate NY.  I later sent in my plea and received a court date in the summer.  As a college student, I later learned that I received a internship during the summer and was not going to be able to attend the court date.  I called or mailed a request to change the date and from what I remember they would reschedule the hearing and I should receive that information.  Now...flash forward to today.  I was cleaning through my college stuff and found the letter from the court unopened.  I believe this letter was sent to my dorm address while I was in another state for my internship so I'm not exactly sure if this letter was sent before or after I sent in the rescheduling of the trial.  I don't think I've ever paid or even received a new trial date.  I haven't received any other letters from the court so I would've assumed i paid it but now that i think back on it, I don't recall paying it/speaking to someone at the court, or going back the court.  I'm actually not sure what happened.  However, I checked my drivers license records and it doesn't show anything about the ticket nor any suspensions or issued judgement for suspension on my license.

Anybody have any idea what I should do?  I mean, I would assume I would need to call the court and ask them to look up the records on this ticket# but wanted to see if I should prepare to have an attorney prepared before hand with these things."
2wwuue,5,2015-02-23,[Update] the new job i am starting,Mtard31,Beekeeping,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/2wwuue/update_the_new_job_i_am_starting/,"Some of you who have checked out my previous posts here know that i live in Turkey, i am a beginner beekeeper, and i was thinking about working with a migratory commercial beekeeper to learn the job really well.

Well some stuff about that plan changed so i wanted to share them with you guys. First of all i was planning on interning with a beekeeper but while looking for one i ended up talking with the beekeeping association of Turkey, after that i talked with the head of TEMA (a big organization in Turkey) etc. And long story short i got to meet a very important and well known figure about beekeeping in Turkey. 

He has been the head of several organizations, has been working with bees his whole life, he leads an ongoing project about the subraces of bees living in Turkey, they have a secluded place where they have managed to find purebred caucasian bees and they rear caucasian queen bees there. The thing about the guy is, he has realized that the migratory beekeeping bussiness has led to hybrids in bees in Turkey and thats why purebred bees were near impossible to find.  And that uncontrolled breeding in bees has led to loss of characteristics of certain subraces and also a decrease in health, resistance and honey production. So he and his people are trying to fix that and have managed to fix that with caucasian bees in a certain part of Turkey. They are working with the government to give caucasian queens to beekeepers all around the country.

So this guy started a new project a couple of years ago about doing the same thing but with anatolian bees. They are trying to rear purebred anatolian bees, make controlled hybrids with caucasians for certain parts of Turkey etc.

It was great contacting the guy, i told him i was excited to learn, he said that i could work with them but he said that i cant intern, he told me he will not teach me he will seriously put me to work and expect my full effort. So now instead of interning i will be getting paid which is nice. I dont have to go far away to anotger city, their base is 90km away from the city center but not impossible to go to. They have places to stay there and i will be staying there and only going home every sunday.

If you guys are wondering i will be getting paid minimum wage, but only for the first year, after which if i prove myself i will be getting triple that, and i learned that from other similar workers that i met. I am really excited they have lots of big operations going on all around Turkey. They give educational seminars to professional beekeepers, and i attended one also to both learn and help out.

It looks like it will be awesome. I will keep you guys up to date. I can try to ask anything you guys might want me to ask to the guy i mentioned. He is 80+ years old and knows so much about beekeeping. And does a lot of really big projects with the beekeeping assosiations, beekeepers, the government etc.

Just at the seminar he gave out queen rearing equipment for free to about 250 beekeepers so they can produce their own queens and save a lot of money and also since they will be working with purebred caucasions and making hybrids with anatolians themselves, they will double their honey production as well. They also got volunteer beekeepers to sell hives with the quality mothers he will be providing back to him so he can give those out to beginner beekeepers. Lots of interesting projects like that. It is very interesting and i hope it goes well i feel like i will learn a lot and it will all be a great experience for me.

Really sorry about the long post and im also sorry about any spelling errors, i am on my phone and i cant check spelling mistakes. Thanks for listening to my story and thanks everyone for this great community. I wish everyone the best!"
2wwwwk,346,2015-02-23,Tales from SpiceCo - The Accounting Goddess and her broken new laptop.,moonarms,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2wwwwk/tales_from_spiceco_the_accounting_goddess_and_her/,"After a long time here's another somewhat recent story that happened during my time as an IT intern at the spice company.

My main job in those weeks was notifying our users about an impending upgrade of their laptops. Furthermore I was tasked with imaging all new machines and swapping them with the old ones. Most users were absolutely thrilled to get rid of their clunky old Dells and gladly backed up all their data to the shared drives assigned to them. Meanwhile I was busy unpacking about 100 cartons, inspecting the new machines and setting them up in batches of 10 around a switch. The installation actually was a painless waiting game that only involved triggering PXE boot on each machine and letting the provisioning software do its job.

Just as the second batch was nearing completion I got a call. Looking at the display I felt my hands start shivering slightly.


&gt;moonarms: Welcome to SpiceCo tech support, moonarms speaking. How can I help you?

&gt;Accounting Goddess: Hello, this is AG speaking. I need one of the new laptops. Now.

&gt;M: Y-Yes ma'am. I'll come up to you as soon as the current batch is finished.

&gt;AG: Fine. I'll be waiting. 


Now, AG was one lady who was feared throughout the company. When things worked her demeanor was reasonably nice but as soon as there was any problem whatsoever she'd scream bloody murder and demand the head of the poor offender on a silver platter. I therefore hoped not to incur her rage and made a mental checklist of the required procedures while Windows was chugging away downloading updates. As soon as the fresh install had completed I somberly walked up the stairs to the dragon's lair, brandishing the new laptop's dock like some crude shield. 

At the top of the stairs she stood, raven hair swaying in the light breeze of the AC. A small smile made its way on her lips as she saw the lithe form of the ultrabook in my hand and she motioned for me to follow her into her office. 


&gt;M: Alright, do you have everything backed up?

&gt;AG: Yep. All necessary files are on the share, I'm all ready. Oh, how I'm gonna LOVE working on this beauty.

&gt;M: (smiling dutifully) I've yet to encounter anyone who doesn't like the new laptops. The CEO has been swooning over his one non-stop from the second he got it.

&gt;A: That's great to hear. And now, no more idle chit-chat, get to work! (said *somewhat* friendly)


I had the new machine set up pretty quickly and proceeded to go through all of the transfered files with AG looking over my shoulder. After all, I *really* did not want to get in trouble with that hellion of an accountant. Soon we had verified that every business-critical application was working correctly and AG sent me on my way, even thanking me profusely. ""Something bad is going to happen. I've never seen AG that happy"", I thought and left the accounting department as quickly as I could. Back at the IT office I continued imaging laptop after laptop while the steady hum of the big iron in the adjacent server room provided some calming background music.

Suddenly the door opened with a sharp *clack* and one person I had gotten to know all too well during my previous internships swiftly stepped in. ""Mr. moonarms hard at work as always, I see"", said the GM with his eerily calm voice as he surveyed the room and stepped to my desk. Lil' Dr. Dirty, as he was informally called by everyone but the CEO, was about the most dangerous person in the whole company. Well-dressed and soft-spoken, an uninformed observer could easily get the idea that he'd be nothing short of an ideal boss. That was, until you turned your back on him. This man was someone who threw people under the bus routinely, creating an atmosphere of fear and distrust in the whole company. Everyone, from the lowest packing peon to several department heads, loathed him but he stood under the personal protection of the CEO and was considered infallible. 


&gt;LDD: Well, who chose the new laptops? They're *so* fast and light. I'll have to commend one of you guys.

&gt;M: Actually, Thomas from purchasing knew someone at HP who offered us a great price for those. I think you'll have to thank h----"" 


**RIIIIIIIIING** the phone clamoured. When AG's caller ID showed up on the display I had to stifle a nervous gulp. ""Oh s***t, LDD's in the room, please don't be mad"", I prayed as I accepted the call.


&gt;M: Welcome to SpiceCo tech support, moon---""

&gt;AG: YOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUU!

&gt;LDD: (whispering) I've got a meeting to organise, I'd better go.

&gt;M: (turning down the volume and rubbing my ear) Excuse me, ma'am?

&gt;AG: YOU BROKE IT. YOU BROKE MY NEW LAPTOP. HOW DARE YOU DO THIS?

&gt;M: I'm sorry, what seems to be the problem? Before I left your office we both verified that everything was working corr---

&gt;AG: ENOUGH WITH YOUR EXCUSES! YOU GET UP HERE STAT OR I SWEAR, YOU **WILL** BE SORRY.


Muttering a quiet approval I grabbed my toolbox, swooped up AG's old machine and once again scurried to the accounting department. When I entered the office I was greeted with the most irate stare of my life. AG, trembling with anger, didn't even say a word but just pointed at the offending ultrabook. The fight was on now. One rather timid, barely grown-up moonarms against a 40-ish, raging lady who still managed to look like a fallen angel in all her wrath. I carefully approached the machine, half expecting some random hardware error having contributed to its untimely demise - only to find it happily displaying the desktop. 
Since I didn't have even a whiff of what issue AG meant I was forced to speak up again.


&gt;M: (barely above a whisper) Your laptop seems to be in good working order. Can you please show me the issue you are having?

&gt;AG: (quiet but menacing) The. Icons.

&gt;M: (pointing at screen) Everything you requested is on the desktop, just like on your old laptop. We verified that a few hours ago.

&gt;AG: (coming uncomfortably close, towering above me) They. Are. Not. In. Their. Correct. Positions. I. Said. I. Wanted. Everything. The. Way. It. Was. On. My. Old. Dell.

&gt;M: (thinking: ""you didn't say that"")Erm, Ma'am this is not a broken laptop. You'll just have to rearrange your--

&gt;AG: STOP TALKING AND DO IT. I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR YOUR BABBLE.


At this point I decided to do everything this woman wanted, in order to make it out alive of this predicament. The next half hour was spent dragging icon after icon across the desktop until AG was satisfied with its position. And, when the last one slid into place a truly strange transformation happened. The scowl on the accountant's face was wiped away and replaced with a beaming, full-on smile. 

She gently took the laptop out of its dock, packed it in her bag and grabbed my shoulder. ""That wasn't so hard, was it? I think you're a good boy after all"", she all but *cooed* in my ear. I tentatively nodded, left the office and bolted to the safe haven that was the IT office, all the while muttering ""good boy?"" under my breath.

I have nice grades, made the dean's list, had a great internship that I got all by myself last summer, know my major, etc. I'm not like most of the students I have met here. In fact, for the most part I feel we have nothing in common. My family is not wealthy or even middle class. I will not be able to study abroad unless I get the paid internship I applied for this summer. I am religious and am fairly active in the (very large) group for us on campus, but that is the place I feel the most alienated and lonely. Most Saturdays I honestly dread dragging myself out of bed for service/meals when my religion has always been a source of comfort and happiness for me in the past. But I didn't go to the fancy private schools, I went to public school and whenever I say I'm from LA, I get ""Oh which *insert expensive private religious (or non-religious) school* did you go to and do you know blah blah blah"" and when I mumble ""Um...I actually went to public school..."" they usually say ""Oh..."" and the conversation dies. It doesn't help that I transferred and am trying to break into what for the most part are established friend groups. Most of the people who I have met who I really like and who have tried to include me and be nice to me are seniors who obviously have their own friend groups and who will no longer be here next year. I love the other girls in my major, but most of them will be gone next year too, studying abroad, and because my religion limits my time on weekends/where I can eat I think they are not sure when to hang out with me and I am not sure when to hang out with them outside of class/doing homework. It's really sad that the best times I have are usually working on problem sets with these girls. I feel so sad looking at everyone joining sororities and getting big sisters or whatever it is, because I can't afford it. I want to feel like I'm part of something. I have never felt that way in my whole life no matter how hard I've tried, I've never had a ""drama club family"" or a ""camp family"" or an ""upside-down flute players family"" or whatever. I applied for a few fairly competitive internships and a fellowship for this summer, and even though I submitted them weeks ago now are the due dates and I'm not sure when I will hear back from them. It's making me very sad and anxious, and my motivation level is way down, because I always try not to picture myself getting in or fantasizing about the future (because when I do that I'm always disappointed) but I haven't been able to stop myself and I'm sure that now it won't happen and I won't ever get the ""oh-so-amazing"" and ""look at all the wonderful people I met"" experiences that everyone else seems to be getting. Even if I do get in somewhere (and anyway if I don't get in anywhere I will be able to do research at school) I still think I won't have the same experience others do. I really have no friends. I made one who I thought would be my first close friend at my old college, but she changed a lot and I don't relate to her anymore. I look back on the vast majority of my past experiences negatively. I ran away from high school. I don't have childhood friends because everyone was mean to me when I was little. I really don't feel like I'm asking for too much. A few good friends to live in a suite with next year and make Friday night dinner with, or even just to know I was going somewhere this summer where I could at least potentially meet like-minded people, so I could pick myself up a bit and not spend all my studying time distracted or crying. I don't even care really if I get both. I hate myself for feeling like this. This rant reads to me like a spoiled, angsty teenager. I hate that I would give anything to be part of a group when I've spent so much time and energy railing against group think. I hate that I'm writing this instead of studying for my midterm and working on my problem set, proving thus I clearly don't deserve to get a summer internship. Which I knew all along, of course.
Sorry the ending is incoherent.     

Edit: Welp. Fuck. Just found out I didn't get the fellowship. Great. I'm so embarrassed and sad."

So, I went to UC-Berkeley for undergrad, but I didn't major in CS or anything technical; however, because my major was interdisciplinary, I ventured out and tried CS, obviously falling love right away. Since then I've taken most of the 61 series (I didn't get to finish machine structures, but I was just auditing anyway) and an info class at Cal. I've also taken 4 other CS courses at the city college down the street and plan on taking either Operating Systems and Systems programming or AI this summer at Cal. I've gotten a few interviews, and one internship in QA, so I guess I'm heading down the right path towards a career, but lately I've been considering getting a grad degree (either to help career wise or to delve into some research). Boston University's LEAP program seems like the perfect fit for me since it's a graduate program meant for those who didn't originally major in CS (it devotes a portion of the program to the undergraduate work needed to successfully complete the grad work, which would be good since some of it is math-heavy, which is something I definitely need to work on), but I thought I'd ask the community's opinion on the situation and/or the program. If you're a LEAP alumni, maybe you can share your story and provide some guidance. Also, if you've heard of similar programs, I'd love to know about them. Thanks."

Maybe I have been mis-informed, but I have been told by a few people that it is difficult to obtain internships as a Canadian student unless you go to University of Waterloo or any other university with a top CS program. I don't go to a ""top tier"" university in terms of the CS program, I started off as a BBA major and have now switched to CS, about to complete my first year.

I know two very important parts of a resume would be internship experience and participation in projects.

So far I have taken six courses in high school (two course credits being an internship) and two courses at university.

As far as what I have learned, unfortunately each course Ive taken seems to just repeat that last, going from basics up to implimenting simple classes, objects, files, and just about into sorting and searching through data structures. though I have done so in C++, C#, Java, and Python. 

My high school internship project was a simple application to assist the academic decathlon. It held files for questions, and was my first experience doing anything with A GUI (albeit I had to use panels and my own paint drawn buttons to do so) but I ended up learning a lot about being given requirements for a project, working with a deadline, along with being able to learn and adapt when I didn't know how to implement something.  

I wish to do as much as I can now, but I am lost as to what I should be doing right now (aside from getting my general studies out of the way so I can focus on my major)

It's looking good.

I had to fill out some application forms and one of the fields was for my desired salary range. I may need to negotiate this soon, possibly in person, and I want to be prepared. I want to take this opportunity to ask your opinion about the ballpark salary and benefits I could expect from a position like this.

I want to be reasonable, but the glassdoor reviews mentioned a relatively small performance review bonus, so I want to push as much as I can now.

**Me:**

BS CS

Graduate in a few months

2 - 1yr internships

I've been coding for a while prior to entering college (since 7), also have a fair bit of hardware experience for an entry level. This comes in handy with this position, they seemed impressed with my knowledge in this way.

I did really well on my last on-site interviews.

**Position**

Firmware Engineer I

Glassdoor salary for other site (no data for this site, slightly higher cost of living) 71,300 average

In same town, would not need to relocate.

**Finances**

Last internship was paid at 58,800 with $5000 relocation

Posted benefits for this position: medical, dental, vision, 401k match, 9 holidays, life insurance, and unspecified paid time off.

**Question**

I was planning to put $76,500 as my desired salary because it compensates for cost of living from the lower end of the glassdoor range, adds a bit for my additional unique expertise, and then a bit for negotiation. This is also the desired salary I put on my initial online application. Is this reasonable, would it be insulting to write this on my form? I will deliver it in person.

Not really sure what would be reasonable for the other benefits.

* Is a signing bonus reasonable, if so how much? 5000?

* How much vacation as an entry level / level 1?

* Any other things I've missed?"

This is about a lady at work- Queen Hippo.

Now, before we start, I have to explain something- my eating habits are kind of weird. I am never hungry in the mornings. I'm just not. I get up at 6 every morning ('cept Saturdays), and do not feel any type of hunger until 10:30-11. By then, it's typically easier for me to just wait 30 minutes and eat lunch, especially at work. As such, I will generally eat again at about 6pm and again at about 10:30pm-ish. I don't pig out when I eat, either- the ""late dinners"" never really go above a couple slices of bacon and a few spears of asparagus, maybe a banana if I didn't eat much that day.

I'm not sure whether that's good for me or not, but whatever. It's never seemed to hurt me.

The day in question was Queen Hippo's first day and- wow. When I saw her sitting down I thought she'd be a contestant on ""My 600lb Life"" or something. I was amazed she stood. While everything was distorted by fat jelly babies, she looked like she was wearing a makeup store and ""designer"" clothes. Putting a lot of effort into her appearance besides her weight.

I'm supposed to show Hippo what she's supposed to do. Joy.

Now, it's still early- about 7, we have an hour to get her up to speed, which is fine. Except it's not. My place of work has several restaurants (think a mall food court), and we had to walk by them. On the way through, Hippo asks us to stop for food, since she'd been there since 6 something and hadn't had time to eat before coming in. That was fine by me, I was getting paid either way by the hour spent with her.

After she orders way too much, she keeps glancing at me. We stand and wait for her food, and then we go sit down.

&gt;""Do you eat before you come into work?"" she asks.

&gt;""No."" I answer honestly, ""I don't get hungry until about lunch time.""

&gt;She looks completely horrified by this. ""But how can you not be hungry? That's not healthy, you know!"" This is where her voice gets real quiet. ""You're not *anorexic*, are you?""

My BMI is 24.6. I'm a little closer than I'd like to be to overweight. I stopped counting calories a while back to see how well I could ""intuit"" what I was eating- not nearly as well as I'd hoped. Back to calorie counting for me.

&gt;""No. I eat fine, I'm just not hungry in the morning. I make sure I eat enough.""

&gt;""Well, that's just not right!""

&gt;""Ma'am, we are not here to discuss either of our eating habits."" I say as I giver her pile of food a pointed look. ""The sooner you finish, the sooner we can get to work. Please hurry before my boss walks by.""

She begrudgingly stops talking and stuffs her face while I stare out a window. Then we go and do work things, blah blah, not important.

I don't see Queen Hippo for a few days, more or less forget about her. Then Vodka Drunkenski, my borderline-alcoholic friend from across the hall swings by one day.

&gt;""You know that new girl, wassit, Queen Hippo? She's made friends with Kid Not-So-Quick (this 19-ish Tumblrina intern who works here, expanding in mass every week. She has always hated me and the feeling is 100% mutual). They talk about you a lot.""

&gt;""I don't care.""

&gt;""Sayin' you don't eat enough.""

&gt;""Vodka, we eat lunch together like every other day.""

&gt;""I know! I'm just sayin' they're sayin'. Figured you'd wanna know.""

&gt;""Thanks. Tell them to stuff it, but do it nicely. Or stop stuffing it. Either way, there'll be improvements (for Kid Not-So-Quick).""

After this, I don't hear anything for a week. Then my boss, Doc Louis, stops by.

&gt;""Hey, how's it going? Listen, I've had some, uh, concern about you.""

My brain doesn't immediately jump to the stupidest conclusions it can, so I fumble a bit.

&gt;""Sorry, what? Who complained.""

&gt;""It's not really a complaint, per se, so much as people are worried.""

&gt;""If someone was worried about me, I'd hear about it first from Vodka.""

&gt;""Usually, yeah, but... are you feeling okay lately?

&gt;""Yeah?""

&gt;""Because Queen Hippo and Kid Not-So-Quick told me you were skipping lunch...""

&gt;""I haven't.""

&gt;""You haven't?""

&gt;""I do not skip lunch. Or dinner for that matter. I just don't eat breakfast.""

&gt;""Oh!"" he says, obviously relieved. ""Okay then. To be honest, I just have coffee in the mornings. The way they were talking, you hadn't eaten in a month. I'll tell them not to worry about you. Thanks, Name.""

And he walks off.

That last part happened today. I'm not too sure how to respond to this. No one at work likes Kid Not-So-Quick anywho, and I haven't heard much of ANYTHING about Queen Hippo, but I have the feeling this won't be the last I've heard of them."
2wxxwi,3,2015-02-23,Dealing with discouragement during job search?,Ssawa,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2wxxwi/dealing_with_discouragement_during_job_search/,"Hey guys, so to start things off I have a little over a year of experience and am looking for a new job. Last December-ish I was able to land a paid internship at a startup in Manhattan and it was the first time I was programming in a professional capacity.

I really put the work and effort in and I think the results showed as the full time staff and senior developers all said that they were happy with my work and was a benefit to the team which made me feel great and my responsibilities at the company and pay slowly increased to the point where the position was more of that of a contractor and I felt comfortable stepping away from school to try to explore this new opportunity and work a full 40+ hour schedule.

After a few more months they brought me on as a full time developer on salary and benefits and the whole lot. It was also shortly around that time that virtually all of our development team either quit or was fired leaving me and the CTO the only developers on staff. So at that point the company kind of fell into the typical startup shortcomings. I'm promised that I'll have a full staff of developers by the end of the year at the latest and am still on my own now at the end of February, I'm expected to work past hours every night and during the weekend with no reflection on my pay, and most recently my benefits have been cut as the company tries to tighten the budget until series A funding closes. The CTO is still happy with the work I'm doing and has said that when they bring on another junior developer he/she will be bellow me but I figure it's just time that I move on.

So I've been applying to jobs the past two weeks or so and its been pretty slow going. I got a few interviews and did a few coding tests for some companies but have either received rejections or stopped receiving responses altogether. I guess I'm just starting to get a little worried that things aren't moving faster, especially because people keep saying how in demand software engineers are. I'm really kind of scared the Ive just fluked myself into a job and am not able to maintain it into an actual career. I'm just wondering if you guys happen to have any advice or words of wisdom? I'd really appreciate the opinions of people in the business on the situation."

We are each others best friend. I love her so much it's unbelievable. 

Well apparently she has been having serious doubts about our relationship for the past couple of years. We recently moved in together and I work 2 jobs plus intern at a comedy club in town. She teaches grade school and we each work 50+ hours a week. 

The thing is that she wants kids and a house one day and I can't provide that for her making 1300 a month. She says she doesn't see me making any steps to better myself and that it is unfair to me being in a relationship with someone who isn't 100% committed. 

My mind is racing and I grabbed all my stuff and now I am out of the apartment. She is texting me right now apologizing saying she loves me but its just unfair, etc. I told her that I think its best if we don't talk. 

I don't know what the hell I am going to do. If I move back home with my parents I have to leave my jobs as they live in another city.

I work 10:00am to 5:00pm, Monday to Friday for free.  while I do want to have a job in media when I graduate, my internship is leaving me very worn out and I often feel down. It takes me an hour to get there and costs me $7 one way, and it takes an hour to get home as well. On the way home the subway is always so crowded that I am lucky if I do not have a bunch of random strangers pressed up against me. I leave my house at 9:00 and do not get home until 6:00. I end up going to bed by 10:30 due to exhaustion, and I get woken up by my loud family at 6:00am. I don't have any time to get a job, and I have no money. My mom has stated that I am not allowed to get a job. In fact, I am actually in debt due to having to spend money every day to work for free. At work, I have my own desk which is alright. I don't really get a lunch break though, everyone in the office follows the system of work while eating and dont take breaks. For the past few weeks it has been -30C to -35C here, so having no time for myself and all this cold weather has been making me feel down. I don't mean to complain , I guess this is just a slap in the face of what real life actually is. It just bothers me that I don't have any energy when I get home, and I have no money to do anything when I actually do have time"

I was just wondering with the information I'm going to provide if you could tell me my chances. So my GPA so far (I'm halfway through junior year) is a 3.5 but I'm aiming to get it to a 3.6 or maybe 3.7. My classes are a mix of AP's, Regular classes and honors.
Science- Honors Bio, Honors Earth Science, Honors Chem, Currently AP Physics. 
Math-Algebra,Geometry,Algebra 2/Trig, Currently Pre-Calc(Doing AP pre calc next year)
History- AP World, AP US currently
English- Reg English until this year now I'm in honors
Language-Italian 4 Honors (college italian next year)
And then theres gym and those other electives

My test scores are 94 on all the science regents so far and math is
Algebra-91
Geometry-86
Trig-71 :(

World History 98 regents, 4 on AP Exam.

SAT- Taking the March SAT confident I will get in the 1800 range got a 1630 on a practice one but writing section really brought me down so I've been studying.  

I participate in clubs nothing really special. Mostly class governments and I've been in my schools research program for the past 3 years. National Honor Society, Foreign Language Honor Society, Science Honor Society 

Sports- None sadly (I'm athletic just didn't have a desire to play)
Work Experience- Interned in NYC at a small accounting and tax firm for a summer I think 2 years ago. 
Worked at my grandfathers dentist office for 3 years. 
Currently have been working at Mcdonalds for past 8 months or so. 
Have another internship this summer in the NYC 4 days a week with pay and at the same place from 2 years ago. 

Community Service- I don't have a good record of this sadly but lets go with 30 hours or so (Had to do a lot for honor societies)

I want to major in computer engineering but I'm a big talker and love speaking to people so sort of want to get my background in Computer Engineering for a marketing background (hope that makes sense) 

SO PLEASE TELL ME WHAT YOU ALL THINK I SHOULD DO OR RETHINK OR SOMETHING YOU THINK CAN HELP :)

2wybg1,1,2015-02-23,"22M4F Multiple Prompts (Including Anal, Superheroes and drugs)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2wybg1/22m4f_multiple_prompts_including_anal_superheroes/,"Hi I’m looking for a lovely “lady” that would like to role play with me. I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

2wybrb,3,2015-02-23,Software testing internship before software developer?,sil222,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2wybrb/software_testing_internship_before_software/,"In your opinion, would you say that students looking for internships should try and land software testing positions before graduating and looking for fulltime software development?
I feel like by taking this route, you develop the fundamentals to writing good software tests. This is a valuable skill, because you will be faster at fixing bugs and creating good programs.
On the other hand, you miss out on learning real software development which might put you in a worse position compared to your peers. After you graduate, if you are looking for software development work and you are competing with students who have software development internships, you could have a significantly harder time. 

Will testing experience significantly help you become a better developer vs development experience?
Will employers rather see you did a software development internship and as a result make it harder to land software development jobs?"

I am a junior with a decent (3.69) GPA and go to an average school. Two weeks ago, I went to my college career fair, but there was only one company that had anything to do with chemical engineering. I spoke to them and applied for their position, but as I have not yet received a reply back I'm starting to doubt my application there. Besides the career fair I have been applying to many internships online mainly through indeed (I also started to apply to MechE internships through my college career search website as there aren't any ChemE ones listed).

The reason I'm not looking for full time is because in my last year, I got really into iOS development and since I haven't mastered it yet, I want to try to get an internship to get some real-world experience.

On all of the internships I've found, there's a requirement that says ""must be junior"" or ""must graduate in Spring 2016"" or something similar to ""we don't want graduates"". Are these requirements set in stone or can I still apply and get a chance at it?"

2wylbg,3,2015-02-24,Automatically pull data from different workbooks?,dilbadil,excel,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/2wylbg/automatically_pull_data_from_different_workbooks/,"Excel 2010. No macro knowledge but willing to learn. I'm an intern, so my excel knowledge isn't very extensive nor developed outside of the classroom.

Say I have workbooks with data on different buildings. Assume they have the same data structure, column names, everything. I need to pull a subsection of data from each file and arrange it in a new, separate file.

If it helps, say Data Set A has information on X, Y, and Z. But I need to make a new file with only bits X and Z so that I can feed it into a separate program. I need to find an efficient way to do this since this task will need to be completed multiple times in the future.

I've tried using =[FileName.xls]Sheet1!A1 to copy all the data I need from different files, and that seems to work for a single file. I was hoping to find a way to link the FileName.xls part to a specific cell so that I could edit one cell and everything in the new file would follow suit.

I find myself coding just so that it works, instead of coding it elegantly.  If someone were to ask me ""why would you do it like that?"" the only thing I would be able to reply is ""im not sure.. it seems to work...""  I find myself going ""that did the trick!"" in my head a lot..

For example, earlier today I had to make a local variable (which was originally defined in a static method) a class variable so that I could access the variable in other methods of this class.  To do this, in the static main() function of the Java file, I instantiated a new object of the class and in the constructor I assigned the variable its value.  So now, from other methods I can access the class variable.  So now, from static methods, I access it via *class.variable* but in the rest of the methods I access it via *variable*.

It doesn't really flow how I'd expect it to.."

2wyven,1,2015-02-24,Research vs Industry Resume? Differences in Application?,markerz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2wyven/research_vs_industry_resume_differences_in/,"So I've spent the last three years building myself up to have a fantastic resume for coding in industry. You know, side projects, internships as a software engineer, with a wide breadth of experience in many languages, but still depth in Android/Mobile development. I know how to play the industry game.

However, I've been interning for two years now with lots of side projects and industry has gotten boring. It might just be a phase or my position but I wanted to entertain the thought of pursuing my PhD and/or go for a research position in the next 5 years. If it matters, I think I would want to work on Managed Runtime Environment.  I've been reading some papers on the topic and the whole field interests me. 

My question is, how is the research and/or academia process different? From resume, to statement of purpose (which I see as a cover letter but much more serious), and including the interviews and the whole process!  How do I get into it? Do I just apply for positions in research labs? Do I pursue a masters to connect with researching professors? How do I apply to national labs? What makes me look good for those positions? Specifically, what looks good to a PhD program, a research lab, etc?

What do you guys think?"

2wz5ax,1,2015-02-24,What would you do? Looking for some advice.,[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/2wz5ax/what_would_you_do_looking_for_some_advice/,"Alright, so I'm stuck in a kind of unique situation I guess you could say. Let me explain first and then I'll tell you what advice I'm looking for. I'm not looking for a pity party, but this weighs on me sometimes and as much as I wish I could handle this on my own, I have no honest direction. 

I came to Canada when I was 6 years old with my mom and my sister from Ukraine. My father was an abusive drunk, but luckily he left us the year after. Unfortunately, this put my family into a financial crisis since he was our sole financial provider. My mom, with less than a year of English-speaking experience, was pressured by my older sister to find a job. We were living off of barely $200 a month at the time, so I can't say it didn't make a difference, but my mom lost out on an opportunity to go to college and have a career.

It's been 12 years since I came here. My mom is still working the dead-end retail job and she hates it, sometimes comes home crying about how much her managers mistreat her. But she can't quit because she's working for $2 more than the minimum wage and that would disappear if she were to quit. My sister found a boyfriend a while back, graduated university, and moved out. She's living about an hour away by bus now, she has a car and a house, and we haven't heard from her for almost a year now. She didn't bother to call my mom on her birthday and hasn't attempted to contact us at Christmas time. Last I heard she was supposed to have a kid around March. 

I'm in my first year of university, in a writing program. I'm getting above-average marks, and taking up a few volunteering opportunities related to my program. I'm working a shitty fast food job, but I'm trying to get something at least a little more respectable in clothing retail or something like that. I have no car, but I have a close friend who drives me to get a full cart of groceries every few weeks. I have no family at all in the country except for my mom and my sister. And I have no idea about any family I have anywhere else and doubt they give a fuck about me anyways. I have a loving, understanding, and affectionate girlfriend, but I have no idea how long that'll last.

So, yeah, the advice part. 

While I'm a student, mine and my mom's government housing is geared towards her income. However, if I were to finish university and suddenly become unemployed, the rent would shoot up to roughly $1100. My mom makes $1600/month after taxes. Right now I'm thinking the best course of action would be to volunteer and try for internships as much as possible and maybe if I do well enough, I'll have a job by 4^th year so I could technically graduate with a job and maybe rent an apartment somewhere else... so any advice on going from the whole internship/volunteering phase into a career? Any at all, even if it's just internet tutorials or something would be appreciated.

The whole apartment thing brings me to my next point: apartments, renting, leases. I have no clue about any of these. What should I look for? What should I be weary of? Again, anything is appreciated.

This last one I'm kind of ashamed of... what do I do with my mom? I owe her more than I could ever give, but at the same time how am I supposed to start ""living on my own"" if I have to support her? I guess maybe the whole thing is naive, but what if I do have a girlfriend and I want to live with her? I've looked at some retirement homes, but she's far from retiring and the stories I've heard about retirement homes are terrible. I really don't know what to do regarding this. No clear idea at all. 

Anyways, that's enough of my crap. It's 5AM and I haven't slept since 9AM yesterday so I apologize for any grammar/spelling mistakes I make.

This might be kind of early since I have roughly 3 years to think this out but I thought I should internalize this early on so I have time to plan.

Thanks in advance for whatever advice you give me.

Apologies for the long post, I'm just at wit's end trying to find an internship/job. I would appreciate some advice moving forward. Is it too late to get one for summer? I'm interested in web dev, but will try anything given the opportunity. 

A little background info, I live in Brooklyn and attend uni in upstate New York. I started as a biology major and switched into CS my junior year (finally being accepted into the program my senior year, with one more semester to go. Up until last spring, I had been doubtful about my own abilities, and as a result never landed an internship. Last spring I actively looked for summer internships but was disheartened after realizing I missed many deadlines. I have a 3+ major GPA, but my overall GPA is &lt; 3 (surprising, but I can provide more detail). Nonetheless , I've been told it's experience and drive that counts, even if I initially won't get into some of the bigger names.

2wzk4w,40,2015-02-24,Basically got told I was a diversity hire. It's been hard to overcome my self doubt. Any suggestions?,KestrelLowing,LadiesofScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/2wzk4w/basically_got_told_i_was_a_diversity_hire_its/,"So about a week ago I was in a meeting with my boss and my boss's boss talking about my 'individual development plan' (basically, where do you see yourself in 5 years, how are you going to get there, etc.)

My boss's boss who was the main person responsible for giving me a job offer (he was my boss when I was an intern) basically came out and said that they were super excited to hire me because I was female and they don't have many female engineers.

I keep trying to tell myself that it's not what it sounds like - that they're just happy I happen to also be female and not that they hired me specifically because I'm female.  But it's hard.

I feel like they don't even care if I'm effective.  Just that I'm female.

The first time they offered me a job (right after my internship) I turned them down because I was going to get a masters (funded).  However, I was to be done with the masters in a year, so the offer was basically just postponed.

But then during the masters program I became very depressed - the kind of depressed where you don't get out of bed for 2 weeks and lose 20 pounds in a few weeks kind of depressed.  With help from my therapist I decided that I needed to leave my master's program because I just couldn't work through my depression in the environment (500 miles away from my fiance and family, no friends around, etc.).

So this obviously really put a dent into my self esteem.  This was the first time I had ever actually failed at anything.  So I went back to the company I work for now, asked if they'd still consider hiring me even after dropping out of the masters program, and because the position they offered didn't require a masters, they agreed.

Anyway, that all to say I'm worried that they basically just continued to hire me solely because I'm female.

Now, undergrad I did very well.  Graduated magna cum laude from a respectable school (Michigan Tech - not a top school, but certainly not a crappy one), and had 2 years of internship experience.  So on paper, I'm qualified.  But then I flunked my grad program massively, and I'm always messing up at my job (I've been here about 6 months now) and am never given any real responsibility.

I just don't know what to do.  I know I should just try to kick butt at this job and prove to myself that I belong here, but I keep failing.

Sorry for the essay."
2wzr1s,5,2015-02-24,What kinds of internships can I be eligible for after my first year?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2wzr1s/what_kinds_of_internships_can_i_be_eligible_for/,"**Background:** I have 2 years experience working at web development companies doing project management and QA (a bit of automation experience). I've been working on a rails app in my spare time. I graduated from University at Buffalo in 2012 with a BA degree in Economics. Starting May 26th I will be returning to the same school to pursue a BS in Computer Science. 

**Coursework/scheduling:** Because all of my gen-eds will be already dealt with due to my last degree, I plan on a BS in CompSci with a minor in math to take until the end of the fall semester, 2017 (about 2.5 years). This leaves room for 2 summers to shoot for internships. 

**Question:** Since I will be taking CS-specific classes at a faster pace than most of my peers, I wonder: What types of internships will I be qualified to apply for during my first summer (2016)? Freshman or sophomore? Below I will list my intended schedule, compared to the ""recommended"" schedule given by the school for fresh undergrads. It looks like I would be just 1 class short to where a sophomore would be, as I won't be able to take ""Intro. to Programming Languages"" until I finish data structures, so the earliest I could take it would be the 2nd fall semester. Will this hold me back from good internship opportunities? I plan on trying to do research for the school, hackathons, and side projects during my first year. 

**My intended schedule:**

Summer 2015: 

* Calculus 1
* Calculus 2
* Intro to CompSci 1

Fall 2015: 

* Intro to CompSci 2
* Discrete Structures
* Digital Systems 
* Calc 3

Spring 2016: 

* Data Structures
* Intro to Probability
* Computer Organization
* An online algorithms course (most likely that offered by MIT)

Summer 2016: 

* Internship (hopeful)

**School's recommended schedule for fresh undegrads:**

Fall 1: 

* Intro to CompSci 1
* Calculus 1
* Two Gen Eds

Spring 1: 

* Calculus 2
* Intro to CompSci 2
* Discrete Structures 
* One Gen Ed

Fall 2: 

* Digital Systems
* Data Structures
* Two Gen Eds

Spring 2: 

* Intro to Probability
* Introduction to Programming Languages
* One Gen Ed

2wzwq9,1,2015-02-24,I [20 M] don't know how to move on from break up with girlfriend [19 M/F] of nearly one year,Z_Man94,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2wzwq9/i_20_m_dont_know_how_to_move_on_from_break_up/,"So I'm going to give a bit of backstory to this, so be prepared for text.

So I recently broke up with my first real love a couple weeks ago. By that I mean it was the first girl that I said ""I love you"" to and actually meant it with every fiber of my being. 

A lot of things led to our relationship going sour. For instance, over the past few months, my liver had encountered serious problems due to a bad reaction to antibiotics, and I had been seeing liver specialists and getting tests done on a regular basis. This being the most serious medical problem I had faced in my life to date, I was scared and became very much worried about my own problems. I neglected the needs of others and lashed out more easily, thinking that I had it all bad and no one else did. I guess seeing all my friends healthy around me, and/or being able to drink and have a good time made me jealous and that added to it as well (especially considering I'm part of a college fraternity). Just before Christmas break, my girlfriend told me she had had enough, and needed a break. I was devastated, but she had given me plenty of warning signs in the prior weeks, I had just been too stupid to change my ways, so I paid the price. Not even a week later, her mom unexpectedly passed away. I was then in the position of supporting her through it despite feeling a large disconnect. Over winter break, we talked some, and I went to her house for New Years with some friends, but nothing much more than that. 

I was impatient, and brought up a few times the question of when and how we would get back together, and if she had made up her mind to do so. Unsurprisingly, she would get frustrated and tell me to stop asking, or she wouldn't even consider it. At the time, I was still completely head over heels for her and couldn't understand the need for space that she required. Coming back to school, things between us were getting slightly better. We had been acting as good friends since the break up and that continued. But things kept nagging at me. She would disappear to Boston for an entire day multiple times, visiting some guy she met randomly on a flight, telling me that it was just to ""hang out."" I saw her (and still see her) text/snapchat a couple guys on her phone *constantly*. It's also worth noting that she had always grinded on other dudes at parties while we were dating, but I made it clear to her that it made me feel uncomfortable.

So things were just starting to look better when I finally got fed up with her shifty activities and said something very insensitive to her (not important). As a result, she said she couldn't take the emotional trauma I was putting her through anymore and she dumped me officially the next day, telling me that she still wanted to be friends if at all possible. 

So this is where things have gotten hairy. It's only been a couple weeks, and I still love her, and am finding it very hard to move on. However, during this short time she has already started becoming closer to another guy and hangs out with him nearly all the time. From talking to her best friend, I found out that my girlfriend is essentially seeing him now without the title of a relationship. Yet just the other day she sent me a letter confessing what I had confessed myself to her a few days after breaking up: that she still loved me and can't imagine finding love again right now, and that hopefully one day we can be around each other again.

The hardest part of all this for me is trying to stop contacting her. She is the same major and class year as me at my school, and we have multiple classes together, ones that I would always usually help her with. Indeed, she still asks me for academic help, and I often acquiesce because I feel like a shitty person to deny her academic help just because we broke up. But every time we work together it makes me feel like utter shit, like I'm taking 10 steps backward in my recovery process. I will also be working the same internship with her this summer, and have a Boston project next year sponsored by my school that I will be working with her with for a month or two after summer. Therefore, trying to stop contact seems next to impossible. I've asked her to stay away from my fraternity house, even though she's friends with a lot of my brothers, simply because I need some safe haven on campus where I won't see her and can reconnect with my best friends.

The question is, how do I approach recovering? Is it worth trying to become friends with her? I can't imagine ever going back to being just friends at this point while the wound of breaking up is still fresh, and the thought of seeing her with another man tears me down. But the possibility of getting back together with her in the far future is not out of the question, so cutting off contact with her may ruin those chances, right? And how can I stop contact between us if she always asks me for help academically (and feel bad denying it)? I see her all the time in person in my classes talking to my friends too, should I just ignore her or talk to her then too? Should I cut off all avenues of connection besides texting too (Facebook, snapchat, etc.)? I've only had two girlfriends my entire life (this recent one being the only super serious one), and so my experience with break ups is limited. 



**tl;dr**: Broke up with my first serious girlfriend recently, having a hard time letting go an moving on, especially in regards to not contacting her. Academics make situation tricky. Is it worth working towards a friendship with her, or holding on in the hopes of getting back together, or just to stop talking to her completely?"

I work for two people, one knows me really well and the other one shows little interest in me. 


She got promoted and heard at a meaning that the interns should step outside their comfort zone. So the next day she wanted to have a break with me, because she thought it would be nice to know me better. 


But it turned out, she only told me that I needed to step out of my comfort zone. I’m someone who works quiet and don't interrupt others (only if didn’t know how to do my job), but she wanted me to talk more. Ask other people what they were doing. (feels like Isabella of Phineas And Ferb)


I know it’s hard to suddenly be a “manager”. But, you can’t tell me to step outside my comfortzone without knowing me.


*I once spent a couple hours down  at the IT-department because my laptop was broken. And although I wear fancy heels and dresses, I really like hanging with boys, gaming and talking about computers. So I had an amazing morning at the IT-department.*


When I got back up she told me I did well, stepping outside of my comfort zone. Little does she know. Because “out of my comfortzone” is the job I’m doing. The fact that I started working here, was stepping outside my comfortzone. Nothing is more my comfortzone than the IT-department.


Then she had a carcrash. She never used the word comfortzone since. 
(I like how dramatic that sounds)


But she just had a broken leg and worked less than before. And suddenly, she stopped talking about the comfortzone. And tells me, and all of her colleagues how nice it is I’m capable of my job(because I cover half of her job), without needing support, and working fast. 


It’s been four months now and she’s almost ""completely better"". My contract ends in one month, I'm wondering if she'll use the word comfortzone again before I leave.

2x01b2,1,2015-02-24,"22M4F Multiple Prompts (Including Anal, Superheroes and drugs)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2x01b2/22m4f_multiple_prompts_including_anal_superheroes/,"Hi I’m looking for a lovely “lady” that would like to role play with me. I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else?

2x01rb,3,2015-02-24,To change jobs or not..,moneyf0lder,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/2x01rb/to_change_jobs_or_not/,"Hey everyone,

I am currently on my second IT job. While I was still working on my associates, I had a paid internship kind of deal where I basically babysat a network at night and did school work. Once I graduated with my Associates in Computer Science/Network administration (also came with A+, NET+ SEC+ MCSA because I took the classes) I got an entry level helpdesk position for a local company in the medical field, despite the pay being lower than I expected. I have been happy in the position and learned a ton in the 9 months I have been here. I have been able to travel to set up other offices out of state, set up servers and install switches, phones, everything. So much beyond just workstations, although there is plenty of that. The amount I have learned has been phenomenal. I have learned more here in 9 months here than 2 years of school. I have also been promoted to lead technician, which is great. 

However, there is a catch. They are paying me 12 dollars an hour. I was hoping as lead tech, that they would bump me up to 14-15 an hour, but I just got notice for my raise and it will be 30 cents. So I will be making 12.30 an hour as lead technician going on a year with the company. I feel like they are screwing me over. Am I right?

Now I know I could make more doing the same thing elsewhere, exactly how much, I don't know. I want to do desktop support or help desk work. So the question is, should I go ahead and start applying for other jobs? I have seen plenty and the ones that list pay are at least 15 an hour starting out, and I do have the qualifications they are looking for. But I have not been here a full year and I don't want to look like a job hopper. I was at my previous position for exactly one year. Before that I worked for Papa Johns for a long while. 

This is also a fairly laid back position, and it makes me hesitant to go back in to the stuffy corporate world. I was not nearly as happy at my previous position because it was so much like office space, minus the humor. 

What do you guys think? Should I wait a little longer and start looking, or go ahead and start now? Should I admit to any prospective employers my true reason for leaving? or should I just suck it up and work for 12 an hour? I do not think that is a viable option based on my credentials and ability. 

Thanks for any and all advice!"

1995: Name Redacted, Female, Late Teens

I'm lucky, I truly am.

Lucky with so much competition, to even be considered for an internship at such a big company. Lucky, because I've gotten answers to some questions that I thought never would be answered, or could be answered. 

I'm from a very small town and I've always wanted to get away. I was always self aware though, to the clear reason why:

Teenage angst. Nothing more, nothing less.

I'm a spoilt, upper middle class kid. My parents are both doctors, and I've never really had to want for anything, other than rebellion, of course. So while I was painting my opinions and general world view red, feeling oppressed and fighting an intangible ""power"", I had no friends that shared that view. They were perfect, extremely good looking, smart and multi-lingual. Their personalities were golden too. They never had a bad word to say about anyone. When the argumentative me took over, I'd find myself being listened to fully, getting made to feel intelligent and respected without the slightest hint of patronisation even when I was being damn right insulting. They were wonderful people. Which made the grounds on which I got this job all the more peculiar.

There's this huge company whose headquarters are located just outside my hometown. ""A Wholesome Life"", they're a self help, guidance, I don't really know... Again, all the more peculiar. 

In a sea of rehearsed, perfectly dressed, highly knowledgable and sociable peers, here was I. Dragged there by my teacher, the C.E.O himself was to talk to our year. There's one of these talks annually for seniors, and every year an internship is offered. I've heard the company talked about constantly for the last few months, everyone was prepped to hell.  

So the talk begins, I, amongst a huge crowd, begin my descent into dreamy, epic alternative rock, headphones in. Thank god I chose a double concept album. Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness; I swear Billy Corgan ripped that straight from my mind. As the talk began, ""Tonight Tonight"" made whatever he said seem epic, even though it was probably typical corporate bullshit. I carried on letting the pumpkins rock my world. During quieter songs like ""Stumbleline"", I could hear vague words: ""whole again"", ""we can save them"", ""they need to let us in"" etc... 

At that moment, I looked around. Everyone seemed so transfixed! Must be some captivating shit. 

After the talk there was some sort of stately event, I don't think party sums up this level of posh. The CEO seemed to work his way around each group of students. At this point the niceness of my peers seemed to drop, realising that being seen with someone who simply doesn't care could hinder their chances, they left me standing on my own. To my annoyance, this drew the CEO's attention. 

He introduced himself as Jonathan, an impossibly young man who seemed wise beyond his years. He said he was looking for someone with ""that special something"".""Innovation is the key to the future"" he said. I decided to humour him for a second. I told him my goal. Quite simply, I told him that I want to change the world, but I didn't know how I'd do it. ""What's wrong with the world now?"" He asked.

I thought long and hard. This is the question that no one asks me, yet I attempt to answer every day. 

Every time I try, it comes out in a big ranting mess, I get too excited. But not this time. 

""Everything is temporary."" I said.

Jonathan smiled. He simply handed me a card.  ""A Wholesome Life"" - ""Let us in"" 

""5 o'clock, Monday"". He said with a smile on his face. 

""It's only ever one""  rippled through the crowd.

As Jonathan drew his apparently infamous card, supposedly part of the ritual every year, I could see the eyes descend on it, then me, then the heavens, accompanied by a curse, in quick succession. Looks filled with disappointment and envy that I can't fault knowing what I do now were everywhere.. 

Fake congratulations showered the walk home with my friends. They knew and I knew that I didn't deserve it. Whatever ""it"" was. I felt like I was missing something, but my teenage cynicism couldn't fight the overwhelming feeling that something truly special was most certainly in store.

It's gotten to the point where my mind is overwhelmed in making the decision of where to put my focus. I figure maintaining a high GPA matters for applying to grad school, and networking opens doors for internships that will give me the experience I need for full time recruiting when I graduate. The majority of my classes teach theory and how to solve problems, not actual skills that I can use once I start working. Learning VBA and python is my attempt to have actual skills out of college instead of textbook knowledge. With all these things going on I'm really not sure which areas should have priority. I could get an internship in the winter of 2015 and also in the summer of 2016 assuming I graduate May 2017. Any advice would be appreciated"

She will let any coworker do anything he wants to her anyplace and anytime, regardless of age, race, looks, or marital status. She dresses, acts, and talks like a slut.

I happen to be the official office slut where I work. My name is Jennifer and I'm 20 years old, my breasts are a perky 34B with an equally perky ass. Almost every guy in my building has fucked me at least once. I've even let a couple of 19 year old interns make me their property in my car during lunch. Ive always worn short skirts and thigh highs so the men have easy access to my cleanly shaven pussy and tight little asshole. Everyone knows I don't wear panties because of all the peep shows I give the men around the office. All a man has to do is call me into an office or bathroom and bend me over and spread my legs exposing my slutty married wet pussy and ass. 

All while I beg them to fuck me hard as they can and call me a dirty whore then they fill me with thick rope after rope of their portent cum. Almost every day I go home to my husband, cum dripping from both of my fuckholes If only he had any clue what happens when his wife is at work for the day. I want this RP to focus on all of my escapades throughout my average work day. From when I leave for work kissing my oblivious husband good bye, to when I leave the office wiping cum from my lips as I leave through the front door. If you want to add/change anything let me know. I'm always open to new ideas.

2x0yk5,2,2015-02-24,"Where should I go (professionally), from here?",FutureMrsD,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/2x0yk5/where_should_i_go_professionally_from_here/,"Hello Reddit!

I am seeking some advice, as I am not quite sure the direction in which I should go from here.

I am a 25 year old woman. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. Following my passion (and not thinking about my future as carefully as I should have), I got my B.A. and M.A. in Art History from two fairly prestigious universities, graduating with honors and a high GPA. Throughout high school, college and graduate school, I actively participated in multiple activities and community service, and held various internships and jobs, not only in galleries/museums/auction houses, but as a tutor, editor and legal assistant.

Since finishing graduate school several years ago and moving back to Los Angeles, I have been unable to secure permanent, stable work. I have applied to probably over 1,000 jobs, each tailored with its own, specific cover letter and follow-up to appropriate hiring managers, etc. I found several temporary and part-time positions, including one through a family friend, but nothing stable, with any potential future growth, or with a livable salary for Los Angeles. Mainly, though, I had about 10 interviews, including some multiple interviews for the same position, culminating with that company deciding to promote from within, or just never hearing back from that job, even after sending thank you notes/emailing/calling/being persistent, etc. It was extremely disheartening and depressing, to say the least.

Around 8 months ago, despite me not having stable work, my fiance (a real estate agent who was doing pretty well at the time) and I decided to move into an apartment together. Although it was reasonable for the area, the price was not cheap, to say the least. While I continued to job hunt, my fiance paid our bills and I worked on a resale business I had started several years ago, on eBay. But, after the immense amount of time that it took to find/list inventory, as well as the price of purchasing the goods and the fees owed to eBay at the end of the month, the profit was essentially null. Then, I started as a personal assistant/consultant to my fiance (real estate), which ended up not working out as his business began to slow to a stop, and I was being paid on commission, not salary. It was around this time that we decided to cut our losses, move out of the apartment, and back in with our respective families while we made a game plan of what to do next.

After a few months and due to some personal family things, we were told by both families that we would have to move out soon. At first, my fiance and I decided to look for the cheapest options in Los Angeles, but the cheapest places (even shared apartments/houses) in moderately safe areas (where we weren't at risk for being shot or mugged in the evening) were still upwards of $1200/month. This did not work for us.

My fiance was born and raised for much of his life in Oregon, and we immediately considered moving there. After doing some research, we were attracted by Oregon's lower cost of living and seemingly more plentiful jobs. We soon packed up, and decided to move to Oregon, planning to stay with my fiance's adult cousins while actively looking for work, and getting on our feet.

We have now been in Oregon for about a month and a half. Despite applying for jobs nearly daily, both online and in person, and both having several interviews each, we have only been able to secure very sporadic, very poorly paid work, including back-breaking manual labor, through employment/staffing agencies.

Recently, while on the phone with my father and lamenting over these difficulties and frustrations, he offered to pay for me to take some classes/training/etc. in another field or trade at a local community college, in leading to a job/career. I am not being choosy at all, at this point, and am not limiting my options to ANYTHING. I am seeking advice on what path I should take. What classes/career path is thriving in this economy, and in the future to come? Please keep in mind, I am open to most fields, but am not the best at very advanced math, science or technology. I am interested in teaching, criminal justice, nursing, and accounting, although I am completely unsure how to best take advantage of my father's generous offer. 

I am sure I am leaving a ton of details out, but I welcome any suggestions or guidance from you on what I should do next.

Thank you for reading! :)"

A relationship of 4 months between 2 19 year olds must mean nothing. 

I met her 1,5 years ago. We both study medicine and we were friends for about a year. In september we both went on a trip to France with some other friends and I kinda fell in love with her there. Turned out the feelings were mutual and when the college year started we started to have a couple of dates and it was magical. 

I've never felt even remotely as happy as the evenings I was with her. The fourth date we had our first kiss. I had never kissed a girl before and was quite shy, so she actually went in for the kiss and we made out all night. We were as happy as can be.

About a month later we made love for the first time. We were both virgins and I felt guilty at first because of her pain but it after a couple of nights it went better and our relationship was as perfect as it can be. Things were going well at college as well and my life was like a fairytale. I couldn't have imagined loving someone like that and being so happy just a couple of months before that.

2 weeks ago we had a little fight about her turning down an date with me. This was after the exams and skiing vacation so I hadn't seen her for 3/4 weeks and was quite annoyed that she turned down the appointement last minute (texted me a couple of minutes before that she wouldn't come). Then we talked it out and I thought everything was fine.

I then had an internship that I didn't really like but she did. So I wasn't as enthousiastic about it all and she could probably tell.
We had a date just 2 days ago and she talked and talked about the internship and I mostly listened and we talked about studies and money and some other stuff. I felt like everything was OK and we kissed and hugged like we usually do and I left with a good feeling. 

Yesterday evening she texted me ""We should talk."" I had heard this was a text of death before but I wasn't too worried. Some dark thoughts crossed my mind but I didn't see a reason to be really worried. Tonight she came over and she basically said that we're just too different to be together. I begged her to reconsider as we had been so happy together. It came out of the blue. 

I still really love her more than anything in the world and we went out without a fight but that makes it all the more painful. I just can't stop crying and I don't understand why she broke up. She wants to stay friends but I have classes with her everyday and I just don't think I can sit next to her or see her all day. I think I'd just have a breakdown at some point. I've been crying all night and can't stop. Even though we were only together for 4 months I thought we had something really special. I don't think I can get over her. Feeling massively depressed right now. I'd just like to curl up in my bed and cry myself to sleep and at the same time I want to talk to my friends about it. 

It was my first relationship, first kiss, first sex and I don't think I'll ever love anyone as much as I love her. I just don't understand. I feel like shit.



   
**tl;dr**:Just broke up with my first girlfriend ever. Don't understand why she broke up. Feel like shit."

I'm a master's student studying CS at a top engineering school. I worked a few years in finance and decided to return to grad school because I preferred engineering. 

I've been looking for summer SWE internships, and really I want to intern at a tech-focused company, whether one of the big 4 or a startup. But I've been getting rejected at the phone interview stages and at the moment I've been rejected at 2 of the big 4 companies. I've practiced using CTCI, CareerCup, Programming Interviews Exposed. During interviews, it's not that the questions are particularly difficult, but I just freeze up a lot.

For the remaining two big-4 companies, I'm still in the process (interviews this week and next week). I also still applied for finance and consulting (as backup) and I currently have 2 offers to finance quant internships. So, it's not a terrible situation at all, and I'm grateful to have offers ... but it's not the career change I was hoping for.

2x18q3,1,2015-02-24,[21/M] Need advice on current relationship status,advice_seeker327,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2x18q3/21m_need_advice_on_current_relationship_status/,"I am sorry in advance for the wall of text. Lots of Background:
I am 21 year old male, currently in my 4th year of college. I have been dating my high school love[22/F] for 5 1/4 years. The relationship we currently have is the first relationship either of us ever had. She is a year older than I am and has already graduated college.

&amp;nbsp;

We have been very happy with each other our first 2 years of our relationship. We saw each other everyday, we went out to see movies and get dinner, and life was good (as a highschooler of course). So college happens. She stayed local, allowing me to see her for her first year. However when I graduated, I went to a University out of state. Since we trusted each other deeply, we didn't have any problems our first couple of months apart, but we started having some problems because we didn't get to see each other often, besides Skype. We worked those problems out, and all was well.

&amp;nbsp;

I ended up transferring schools(change of major) and got much closer to home, but I was still far away enough for us not to see each other often. This is where things for me started taking a turn for the worse. I started meeting other women, just friends in my eyes (they approached me, I wasn't seeking them out). After a while, I would find out that these women had things for me. I kind of brushed it off because I was loyal to my girlfriend. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now I have been at the new school for 3 years. But every year, I feel different towards my current situation. Being in a very prestigious program, and having a lot of work, not to mention required internships, I only get to see my girlfriend 3, maybe 4, months of the year. This amount of time separated is really getting to me now. On top of that, we never had a really physical relationship until about a year ago. But even after 5 years, I can still count the number of times we participated in the ""horizontal mambo"" on my two hands.

&amp;nbsp;

She is a very sweet girl, but I can see that her attitude towards life is more of a lazy, laid back one. I can see that her motivation to get a job is slim to none. She is now 9 or so months out of college with a decent degree and barely looked for a job. And in that time, she hasn't done much with her life and is always hesitant to make plans with me because she ""doesn't know what she'll be doing"". For instance, Bad Religion(my current fav band) will be playing close to home, but she didn't want me to buy tickets with her in mind because she doesn't know what she is doing. This hurts me because to me it seems like she doesn't care enough to make the commitment.

&amp;nbsp;

All those problems aside, she still loves me dearly. Whenever I am home(usually a week or so) I am always happy to be with her, and to love her. I am one of her few best friends that she really needs, and I am happy to make her happy. But my biggest problem is that I only get to feel loved for about a quarter of the year. The other 3/4's, when I'm not 100% focused on school, I feel miserable. It sucks walking around campus and seeing how happy all the couples are, while I need to wait 2 to 3 months before I can see my girlfriend.

&amp;nbsp;

The Problem: I don't really know what to do. I still currently love my girlfriend, but I am not sure how much longer I can deal with the distance, and lack of physical contact during the year. And even if I manage, I don't know how her lack of motivation, and her laziness will affect our future. I have at least one more year at college, 2 if I get accepted into a BS/MS program.

&amp;nbsp;

Please advise me. I really don't know whether I should just keep going, and hope that these problems work themselves out, or date other women that have higher aspirations for life and would able to give me more comfort, or just take a break until after her and I sort life out. As this is my first relationship, I don't really know if I am truly happy either. I have started gaining a slight interest in the other women I met, as they are drastically different from my current girlfriend. But I am unsure at what to do.
Am I selfish for thinking this way?

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR** Not sure if I am at my happiest with my first girlfriend of over 5 years. Want to know whether I should keep going, or take a break and find new people to make sure that my current girlfriend is truly the one.

&amp;nbsp;

**Problem Summary:**

* 3 Years of Long Distance, and little contact is finally taking its toll. Skype is no longer enough
* GF has very low self motivation, even after graduating college
* First and only relationship ever. Can I find better?
* Parents dislike her (while I didn't mention it, this one bugs the shit out of me, and a lot of people tell me this is bad)"

Through my internships I found out that I simply dislike programming and software engineering in general. It does not excite me to sit and code all day. I enjoy solving Hacker Rank and Project Euler challenges but only a few times a month for a couple of hours a day. I prefer spending my free time playing basketball and hanging out with my girlfriend. I don't go to hackathons.

I've had internships where I have had to develop web apps, mobile apps, and desktop apps, and I found that web development and app development simply are not for me.

However, I do enjoy CS theory. Theory of computation, computer architecture, and x86 machine programming have been my favorite classes so far. Unfortunately, my GPA isn't nearly high enough to get into a good graduate program in the US (3.4). I got a lot of Bs my freshman and sophomore year and only recently have I been getting As.

So what options are there for people in my situation? Do we completely change our career paths? I like CS, I just do not want to be a software engineer or web developer. I'd definitely be willing to go to grad school if I find a program interesting enough. What types of graduate programs would you guys recommend looking into?"

The one I got offered is more technical and requires me to code for 30-40% of the time (in Java, SQL, Python) and interact with clients and business customers for the rest of the time. The other job has me working within an experienced global supply chain management team using SAP, and spend most of my time interacting with different groups and team members to implement the company's or external clients' supply chains effectively.

I'm currently studying Industrial Engineering and aim to go into finance (...become a financial analyst perhaps?) somewhere down the line. Apart from that desire, I don't really know what I would like to become a professional in. Sometimes I'm drawn to consulting while other times I'm super interested in joining the ultra competitive finance world...

I'm more interested with the supply chain job because I feel like Supply chain management is a booming (and an immortal) field and I could possibly go into SC consulting or become a project manager for a large corp's supply chain sometime in the future if I like what I do. This internship would also help me develop project and people management skills...
However, the IT technical job would help me develop coding skills that could be useful and applied to a number of other industries, but wouldn't distinguish me from tons of computer or electrical engineering students out there...

Regarding these two jobs: what do you guys think would be more likely to give me the skills I could leverage in other jobs after graduation or be more useful in the long-term? Is coding and IT software development/implementation (something I'm not super passionate about, but can try and handle...) more helpful than an exposure to a supply chain management system? 

Any help would be much appreciated!! :)"

I was a Tax intern at the Big 4 this summer on the West Coast, and I graduated a semester early and I've been finishing up getting my extra credits and just learned I passed FAR. 

I was just contacted to pick the groups I would prefer to work in when I start. During my internship, I didn't do much, but pretty much any ""work"" I did was with SALT and corporate tax. I spent a few days with some other groups (R&amp;D, Asset Management, Transfer Tax), but it was more to just get to know people and talk about what they do. 

I have no clue what I want to do career wise, but just doing my research, I don't want something that is totally dead end, relatively lucrative, has a lot of growth, and offers me flexibility outside of the Big 4 if I leave. I know these are all generic buzzwords, but as of now, I see myself either staying around the Big 4 for a while or into a good corporate role. A lot of the groups had a lot of specialized people (MTax, JDs, PhDs), so I don't know if that limits my opportunities as well down the line due to my relatively normal education, even though they've been very insistent on starting me directly into a specialty group.

Any thoughts or ideas? Sorry if this has been asked before, but any information I've found was pretty vague. "

I graduated from a great university with a degree in business administration and entertainment management. My ""dream"" career is to work on the business side of the entertainment industry as an agent or an exec, preferably in television. I came from a family where nobody had gone to college, so I wasn't really aware of how crucial internships and networking were during college (although I did have an administrative assistant position for a little over two years in the foodservice industry while I attended college), and feel like I fell behind the pack. 

I picked up a seasonal position immediately after graduating last May at a movie studio doing tours (foot in the door etc). The position ended shortly after summer, and since then I have been trying my ass off to network my way into any type of entertainment company, whether it be a temp, data entry, administrative, or executive assistant position. I've had no such luck, and on a majority of the applications that I feel I'm an excellent fit for, I don't even get an interview. I've spent hours upon hours networking and going to informational interviews, being led on for weeks about possible job openings in a company, only to not even be offered a chance to interview for the position due to the company hiring internally. 

I'm just about out of funds and I've opened my job search up to any entry level associate/administrative position, even if it's not in entertainment. I'm not sure if anyone has advice for me, but I'm feeling very down about my current situation and seeing all of my friends working in their dream fields while I struggle to even get an interview for a crappy position in mine has really put a damper on my outlook. I'm trying to be strong minded and continue to keep a positive attitude, but the fact that I don't even get an opportunity to prove the work I can do is starting to get depressing.

Thank you so much if you took the time to read this - I'm sure it sounds whiny, but I honestly just have no clue what to do at this point and I feel like I need to make something happen NOW if I want a successful career in that industry.

TLDR: Graduated with a degree in business/entertainment management, held a temp job at a movie studio, have almost three years of admin/exec assistant experience, and still failing to get interviews even after months of networking and applying to positions I feel that I certainly qualify for. How do I get these highly in-demand companies to give me a chance?"

I think. I took 6 months off from school, so I guess I'm a 2.5 year? Not sure. Anyway, what the title says.

So I've basically lived and breathed programming ever since I was 13... I initially got into it because I wanted to make video games, and I just kept going deeper and deeper. I've basically ingrained 'programmer' as part of my identity at this point. I already have had a couple of internships at successful companies and [i have a pretty good resume i think](http://r333d.com/resume.pdf)... but I just don't really feel it anymore. I only initially got into programming because of the video game aspect and I've lost interest in that as a career a long time ago. I just don't really feel like I'm helping make things better, if that makes sense. I feel more of a calling to BME. Neural engineering in particular.

The problem is if I continue with software engineering I'm basically guaranteed a good but unfulfilling career, and if I switch to biomedical engineering it's sort of unknown. There's also the huge plus that biomedical engineering at UC Davis is amazingly good compared to computer science.

So basically my question is... what should I do? Is my line of thinking stupid? Am I too late? Should I stay a CS major but drop in on biomed classes, or the other way around? Or should I just continue with CS and try to get a job in the biomedical field as a SWE and ease my way in that way?

Thanks."

I've got some questions before the interview!,nappyheadedimus,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/2x21u4/embedded_firmware_engineering_internship_ive_got/,"Hi there. I've posted here a few times before and the community always seems to be very helpful and encouraging.

I'm interviewing tomorrow for an internship position at a company that deals with electronic control and protection (overload relays, pump controllers, etc). The position involves developing, testing, and reviewing embedded microcontroller firmware for new products/features. The job would include writing, reviewing, and maintaining firmware... identifying bugs... participating in code reviews, etc. 

So my questions for the community here:

 - What kinds of concepts should I be absolutely sure to go into the interview with? What are the things that would make me look really bad if I had to say ""I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with ___""?

 - Where can I go to get an idea of how this kind of firmware is written? I've programmed a few different microprocessors (ATMega on the Arduino, PIC32) but I haven't done any firmware work in any of my courses.

 - How does Python play into this role? The position requirements suggest experience with Python or another scripting language. I have none (to my knowledge) and I'm guessing it would be helpful to at least familiarize myself with this before going into the interview.

All in all, I'm pretty confident. I feel like I would enjoy doing this kind of work. And when I enjoy something, I really start to run on all cylinders. When that's the case, watch out! And if not... it's just an internship. I'll still have the experience.

I moved to Orlando recently and have had far too many near misses on my motorcycle. I don't feel safe during my 1 hour commute.

My parents agree and want me to get a car. My step father is going to give me 1.5k. If I want to sell my motorcycle he'll also buy it for another 1.5k. So I'll have 3K to either buy a used car or lease a 2015 Honda Civic for 36 months, $230 a month - no down payment.

I currently am making $12/h working 40 a week as a web development intern. I have great credit and have no official debts but I also have no savings. I've been at $8/h working 24 hours a week for months. I just got the raise and hours increase this week so my income is going to double. I owe $3k to my mom. She supported me during and after the move a for a few months while I found an internship. Since I got the job I've been breaking even on rent and life expenses but have not had money to save. She wants me to get a car and not worry about that money.

My stepfather wants me to lease a new car. He says the payments on the car will most likely be less than the maintenance on a used car. Since there is no money down I will also have a couple thousand in savings that I otherwise wouldn't. Plus, I get a new car.

My mother wants me to get a used car, saying that tying myself down to a three year lease could be a mistake. I should have more savings and stability before I commit to that.

I agree with both of them but find myself leaning towards the lease. I do not want to spend all my money on a lemon then get hit with a $1k repair. I feel like a $230 a month lease with money in the bank is very manageable.

Extra information: My rent is $490 a month, with $40 electric. No water bill. My commute is 46 miles a day round trip. I have no auto insurance (not needed with a motorcycle), so that will have to be accounted.

I have a safety net either way but I am very certain my income is only going to increase. I am proving to be pretty proficient in my field and don't expect to be out of a job in this city. Even if I do lose the job, wouldn't a lease be better than a car that may break down during that time?

Edit: The answer is no, buy a used car. :) I didn't think about the higher insurance costs or the fact that I can take a $1k hit on a used car and still be way under a leased car. Also, I drive too many miles."
2x2f6k,0,2015-02-24,Should I quit my second job?,No_Moochers,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2x2f6k/should_i_quit_my_second_job/,"Quick background, I'm a senior in college graduating in May with a Computer Science degree. I'm taking 4 classes, all online. I'm also working 2 internships. One for Application Development (28 hours/week), which I really enjoy, and one for tech support (24 hours/week) which I hate. 

I leave my house at 7:20am every morning and get back at 8:20pm at night. My 1 hour lunch is mostly taken up by the 40 minute commute between jobs. and I'm starting to get burnt out.

Anyway, my monthly expenses are right at $1000, excluding food and gas. I work 52 hours a week at $15/hr, plus I get an extra $300 a month from my grandparents while I'm in school. No student loans, and I've gotten my credit card debt down and am now paying in full every month. I have an emergency fund for about a month of expenses (Paid off credit cards instead of building it).

I'm really starting to hate my tech support job (its morphing into data entry...) and I'm wondering if it would be crazy to quit my second internship in order to have more time to do things, and try to make it on the one job, grandparents money, and a little bit off the credit card until graduation when I'm pretty sure I'll go full time at the place I'm working for now. (might move)"
2x2k00,1,2015-02-24,It's been almost two years since I graduated...,Imapotatoman,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2x2k00/its_been_almost_two_years_since_i_graduated/,"I graduated from a top ten engineering school with an Aerospace Engineering degree. I never failed a course but some rough times  left me with 2.8 GPA both in and out of my major. I've been applying all over the country to internships, IT jobs, entry level engineering jobs. Anything I felt I was more than qualified for and I've yet to get even a phone interview. I've networked with people and they've said they couldn't get me in the system because of my GPA. I wasn't able to get internships when I was in college because of my GPA. Recently, a close friend who was a history major with no science or engineering background applied to a Software testing position I've applied to multiple times since I've graduated with no response. They replied right away to him and have interview scheduled next week. I'm happy for him, but even he admitted I was way more qualified for the job than him. I've been working my ass off looking for jobs, doing construction work, and using what little money I have to obtain a pilot's licence and stay alive. I feel like giving up my degree is worthless because of my GPA... all that money for my education pissed down a drain. I keep getting told to keep trying that I'm really talented and should definitely be able to get a job, but I haven't even got close. I've been holding a pretty good head about the whole situation for a while, but this is just one of those moments where I'm really cracking.

TLDR; low GPA murders career opportunities

If you read the rant thanks, I'm just really stressing out right now. 

I am looking to possibly go back to school but I've already received nothing but rejection letters so far...

I've also had my resume checked multiple times by career services and other people. They thought it looked good..."
2x2lzm,1,2015-02-24,I don't want to be with my boyfriend anymore,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2x2lzm/i_dont_want_to_be_with_my_boyfriend_anymore/,"Its been 3 years and it still seems like he doesn't truly care for me. He says he loves me, but anyone can tell me that. 

I sacrificed a lot for him, and all i've ever asked him was to be there for me when I need him (and if he can't I'll understand) and for us to go out 3 days out of the year (my birthday, our anniversary and Valentine's Day) and it doesn't need to be extravagant. 

(For the record, he likes to celebrate his birthday with his family) 

Sadly, he doesn't do none of those. He said he was too broke to celebrate our anniversary so he said to reschedule the next month. I told him he is going to forget and never do it (and surprise, he never did it.) I had to remind him about it, just for him to do it last minute and it ends up a mess. Days before Valentine's days I ask him to make reservations for a restaurant and to buy some tickets for the movies; he ends up doing it last minute. I told him that I feel like something is going to end or mess with those plans but he promises me that nothing is going to happen. Well fucking surprise, he calls me that Valentine's day in the morning to let me know we might need to leave at 8 back home because no one gave a shit to take care of his grandma (we had reservations at 8:30 for dinner.) I get pissed because his whole fucking family gives not a single fuck to take care of her, so we ended up going to the movies and then going to a very tense dinner with badly made pho. We get home at 6 and we see that his fucking sister was home and turns out never even left after 8 and stayed there the whole night. 

Reddit, I'm tired of this. I've changed my dreams of getting a degree in Psychology and Sociology with the hopes of doing research at Graduate school. I went into Finance and Accounting because it was more practical and there is a better chance for stable income. He asked me to not look for internships outside our city, but a little secret reddit: I got offered an internship at my dream company in Phoenix and had to turn it down because my boyfriend wanted it to be in our city because he wants to be close to his family. He has no idea about this, and yet tonight he had the audacity to tell me that I don't care. I saw that his career here in important, and I can see him advancing in his career but it feels like he doesn't care about the career I want. I did this move because I know his family means a lot for him, and respected him for that. The only person in his family I cannot stand is his grandma, because she is incredibly rude and nasty with me. Whatever I do she is still disappointed in me. He made it clear this is her just getting old but this has made me HATE going over his place. We have no privacy, but even when I'm willing to accommodate this so she's not alone he can't even fulfill taking me out successfully 3 days out of the year. When I get upset about these things, he gets upset with me. Tells me he can't do it because of his family, but when we have a discussion he suddenly has the SAME idea and says he wants that because it would be ""good for our relationship."" Does my needs not matter?

All I wanted was to get my degree and move in with him. I don't want to be dealing with his behavior where he lives paycheck to paycheck because he decided to purchase a car out of his means. I don't want to be dealing with his grandma being rude to me. I wanted to address this with him, and talk about this when he felt better (he currently has the cold) but called me when he freaked out about me breaking up with him. When he found out after 20 minutes of discussing, he got upset and said he didn't want to talk about this and when I got upset he told me ""thanks for not caring.""

I didn't ask him to call me, I didn't tell him we are over. The fact that he only called because he was concerned about me leaving him means he doesn't care about me: he cares about me being his girlfriend. 

If I can't see soon that he cares about my feelings, thoughts, dreams, and point of view, soon enough I'm not going to care either. 

I'm not going to care about getting married.
I'm not going to care about moving in.
I'm not going to care about having a future. 

I'm not going to care about giving my heart to someone who doesn't want to listen to my wishes and needs unless its regarding his.

I'm sorry, I don't want to waste my time and love on someone who doesn't care for me. I'm sorry if I break your heart, but you're breaking mine and eventually its going to pull apart and it won't be repairable.

2x2rvz,16,2015-02-24,Hypothetical: Mortal Kombat Mythologies gets greenlit again -- Who do you want to be the star?,[deleted],MortalKombat,https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/2x2rvz/hypothetical_mortal_kombat_mythologies_gets/,"**TL;DR** -- Mortal Kombat Mythologies games centred around your favourite characters.  
**Note:** This looks better formatted in the edit mode.  The text publisher doesn't appear to be respecting my spaces between paragraphs.  Kudos to anyone who reads this!  
  
So, again, this could also just be a load of poppycock but i heard that when Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero was released, they had actually planned to do a whole series of them but it didn't turn out to be... profitable... I think is the right word.  
  
Now consider if they decided to green light the MKM series again.  Who would you most like to see?  Here are my thoughts.  I also want there to be Live-Action cut scenes.  
  
**Mortal Kombat Mythologies:  Shao Kahn**  
This one hit me like a tonnes of bricks.  I was going through all the characters and it dawned on me that we really don't know Shao Kahn's origins.  However, NRS would have to be EXTREMELY careful with this one.  We all asked for Darth Vader's origin and we all know how that turned out.  TBQH that totally ruined the Star Wars franchise.  This might be why NRS is avoiding it.
  
To me, the difficult part would be creating a history that isn't cliché.  They'd really need to consider ""What makes a tyrant?"" &amp; ""What makes a conqueror.""  Again, the clichés are too easy.  Did he grow up in royalty, did he grow up in poverty?  Did he watch his whole family and love get butchered senselessly right in front of him?  Was he tortured as a slave and found the constitution to escape and rebuild?  You could almost give him a combination of Conan and Thoth-Amon's origin story but again, it's been done.  Or... did he simply get rejected from art school?  
    
He was first billed as the personification of evil.  Can we simply accept Shao Kahn is merely an integrated molecular chaos hellbent on conquering?  Is he no different than a storm like Galactus?  He clearly doesn't wish for peace so I wouldn't parallel him to Dr. Doom.  Actually, I take this back.  Dr. Doom and Shao Kahn are very similar except the main difference is that Doom wants peace through his rule while Shao Kahn wants chaos.  
  
More like Darkseid or Mongol but why?  Similar to Skeletor, Hordak and the Snake King?  What happened in his past?  How did he get involved with magic and the Dragon King?  Could NRS come up with something unique?  Maybe have the game start out with a young Shao through his trials and age until the beginning of Mortal Kombat 2?  I'd love to see this as a third-person game, perhaps with levels where it reverts to a side-scroller.  I want to be able to smash everything with a Wrath Hammer.

Where did he get the Wrath Hammer?  What other interesting souls are trapped in Ermac and why did he create Ermac?  
  
Again, it's such a dangerous thing to reveal because they did it for Darth Vader and it ruined the franchise.  They took off Boba Fett's mask and that made it really stupid.  I say this as a huge Boba Fett fan.  Maybe they should just leave the mask on.  Even in Shao's MK:A ending, he simply goes insane after he has conquered everything.  Maybe he is simply an insatiable conqueror and that's all he needs to be?  We don't need to see under the mask because all that matters is out of all the other conquerors, he was supreme.  If it wasn't him, it'd be somebody else.
    
**Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Secret Characters**  
  
Originally, I was going to split this one up I'm not sure if there would be enough for a full game from each of them.  **Reptile** would be the only one who could maybe do it provided it included Khameleon and MAYBE Chameleon if they decide they want him to be Saurian/Zaterran.  Hell, I'd even let them bring in Komodai but then that's too many lizard people and that ends up diluting and robbing the mystique of Reptile in the first place.  As Reptile is my #1 favourite character, I'd love for them to build up his origin, address the destruction of his race, his falling in line with Shang Tsung and the Emperor.  His story would probably go up to the beginning of Mortal Kombat 2 where he officially enters the tournament.  

Also, why was ""Unit 5"" built specifically to hunt down Reptile?  Who at Lin Kuei has stake in his demise?  In the MK9 story, after Unit 5 is defeated, Reptile takes his armour.  For what purpose?  Also... why send a Cyborg that can see through Zaterran cloaking only to have the cyborg be weak to acid/corrosion of all things...  Come on!  There are metal coatings to defend against that.  I wonder if Lin Kuei has any internships open right now... I really don't want to say this out loud but here it goes... Don't tell me we're headed toward Cyber Reptile... O_o?  OK, weirdly enough, there actually was a Cyber Reptile in the Challenge Tower mode of MK9... [See here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihy4PBW2DV8)  
  
The other concept that could be made canon is the glitch from MK 1 for the Sega Genesis that caused Reptile-like characters to appears when the conditions were met to fight Reptile during an endurance match.  The characters look all green-washed.  You could say that Reptile used his Saurian-serpent mind control to influence enemies.  See what's called the Secret Sonya glitch for more details.  
  
**Smoke**, what was he doing all this time?  It said he was around during MK 1 but that was just a red-herring.  What was he doing during MK 2 in the living forest?  What was the story behind his capture and work as a Cyber-Ninja?  His game would last until the end of MK 2/beginning of MK 3.
  
**Jade**, even less time but how is she connected with Smoke?  She was in the living forest with him and they definitely paired her with Smoke during the comics.  I'm not as interested in this one unless she is tied to Smoke.  

As an aside, we don't need to do **Noob-Saibot** because that's basically what MKM:Sub-Zero was all about (Bi-Han, not Kuai Lang)  Well, maybe a short bonus mini-episode portion of the game where we see what NS was up to during MK 2.
  
**Mortal Kombat Mythologies:  Baraka**
  
Again, I feel this one could be fun one because it should contain way more puzzle elements and tactics showcasing Baraka's intelligence and fight to leadership.  Get this idea, Mortal Kombat Tactics: Baraka.  Do something with an RTS feel/Warcraft feel.  Just a funny idea.  Personally, I want to know how he got the metal blades.  Were they a result of some Weapon X style sorcery?  To say he was born with metal is a bit of stretch.  Obviously, metal isn't organic.  I know, I know, in a world of Elder Gods and Neatherrealms, suspending disbelief should be par for the course...  
  
**Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Shokan**
Goro, Kintario, Sheeva, King Gorbak, Duroc and the rest!  You get the picture.  Perhaps a fight with the Great Kung Lao?
  
**Quan Chi**?  How does one become the most powerful Necromancer in the Netherealm?  Couldn't he have taken up stamp collecting as a hobby?  Why go for Necromancy?  What happend!?  Why give a crap about Shinnok if he's fallen?
  
**Shang Tsung**?  What's his deal?  
  
  
What are your thoughts?  Who would you like to see?  We are already getting Kotal's through the comics.  Discussions and criticisms welcome!"

For years, I was verbally and emotionally abused by my ex. I ran and divorced her, but not my kids. I faught for equal time and custody. It took time, energy, and stress. Started with 23% and now have 50%. Problem is that despite all her messups, she keeps getting away with all the abuse. 
Both my sons have Autism and other disorders. Recently, our little one (1sr grader) has been having major issues at school. He has assaulted students and staff, destroyed school property, and disrupted the classroom. Ex blames it on me saying I'm a shitty father and our kid just needs to man up and learn dicipline. All this time, I have tried getting him seen by a psychiatrists only to be turned down because I don't have a vagina. Mom knows best type of world :(. Despite document after document,  doctor report after report, I have been mostly ignored. Heck, she even had the nerve of accussing mr of having Maunchensen Syndrome (left out the ""by proxy""). 

I felt so down, there were times I doubted myself. Am I over analyzing things? Am I wrong in believing our kids need help? Surely a 1st grader should know more and have better Speech patterns by now. I take them to the park all the time and it breaks my heart how far behind they are from their peers. Why can't your kid do the monkey bars? Why can't he swing? Not everyone is blessed to have it all little girl, sigh, but we try :). 

Sigh, I'm not sure what I wrote this here. I've had a shitty two weeks. His new therapist saw me and said my son is far too severe for her to handled and send us to his coworker in the same office of therapists. She said we may even have to intern him in a psychiatric hospital.  

I was about to give up when I called CPS. The lady told me not to hold my hopes up... parents can opt not to medicate the kids she said. The day she came to interview my kid, is a day of a major event. During in school suspension, he  assault staff, destroyed walls, and even disrespected the police officer that came to issue him a sitation. Shit, felt powerless. The CPS lady spoke to both of my sons. My fears where far lower then reality. The recent events are directly linked to domestic violence and possible drug use at their mother's. 

Shit, shit, shit! I fired my old lawyer as she didn't defended me in court correctly. After all, my ec felt that despite loosing time, she was in the right and had the upper hand. Now I'm scrambling to gind a lawyer, deal with alternative school, and an ex who refuses to medicate/treat our kid. 

Today, I had a meeting at school. She comes with her new husband all clean up and looking like normal. She says the court order invalidates any medical diagnosis. She has the audacity to ask why is our kid in Special Education. Send him to alternative school.... punish him. Sigh, is she for real? I mostly kept my mouth shut... only interupting to clarify what the staff said. I finally do bolt a few statements after being attacked and humiliated for hours. 

Following CPS advice, I kept the kids an extra night. I have to repeat yesterday in a few hours as I go to the alternatelive school hearing for my 1st grader :(. 10 days will feel like an eternity. It even breaks my heart explaining to him he won't go back to school each morning... he has alternative school. 

They tell me to give up the fight and work with my coparent. How the f cam you do it with a BPD ex who abuses you constantly? 

OK, enough of a vent. Thanks for reading. I'd appreciate ant words of wisdom."
2x3g6i,0,2015-02-25,I wanna be an artist. Anyone actually making a full living solely on their art?,[deleted],Art,https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/2x3g6i/i_wanna_be_an_artist_anyone_actually_making_a/,"I'm 21F and drunk and I want to ramble a little bit if you dont mind... elsewise, tl;dr on the bottom.

I'm in college right now, looking for internships for junior summer in a field that's somewhat creative but most definitely not art.

I've been drawing since I can remember. My earliest memory that I have is scribbling the same stick figure girl over and over again. My talent was a point of pride in high school. I wanted to go to art school but everyone scared me off, and I myself knew that my family wasn't well off enough to deck out 60k/year and all that talk of recession! they all instilled enough fear in my teenage heart to always be looking for alternatives and i studied my ass off.

Luckily enough I was smart enough to get myself into an ivy. i was able to major in studio art + another major here but really, I haven't seriously touched a pencil in such a long time now. i'm losing touch. no time, no space, and no drive... I don't know what happened. i kicked ass. [i drew this when i was in motherfucking eighth grade.](http://41.media.tumblr.com/88aec620f28194d91e53c2255b5b35ea/tumblr_mo99x9rlLx1svslr6o1_500.jpg) fuck! i was 13 years old! now i feel like i wasted it all. stopped drawing. stopped growing. i hate looking at my old art. 

I've become very disillusioned with the art world as well. I don't GET it. I don't get the bullshit artists statements that I read in publications and I don't get the bullshit artwork that I see in the white gallery walls and I think it's all bullshit, the ""art world."" rich people talking about how other great rich people are. 

Trying to find a shred of genuineness, it feels impossible. but to MAKE it, I'd have to join it right? I have to talk about how my artwork means more than it really does. I have to talk about how other artists artwork make me feel things that really doesn't. And the fact that it's not your artwork that matters in the end -- its your persona, how good you look, how cool you seem. Maybe i'm being cynical, maybe I'm making excuses for myself, telling myself i really didnt want to be an artist.

I'm smart and I'm talented and I'm scared. If I wasn't so socially retarded and a ball of anxiety I would go for it. network. get my foot in the door. create an image for myself. but those things don't come to me like that. i have no charisma. 

I'm so full of doubt and I feel so bitter. feel like all these successful artists who talk about their success all come from money but never talk about the fact that they didn't have to work for a living while working on their art. 

or maybe I'm just making up all these excuses because in the back of my mind i know i'm not talented enough, not pretty enough, not driven enough. but i guess i just wanna know if there are anyone who make their living as an artist, creating what they want to create (for the majority of the time) and ""made it"" all by themselves.

tl;dr: are you a full time artist and how did you get there? i just want to paint but i'm so scared. "
2x3gq7,1,2015-02-25,I'm (30m) in a bad place and my most trusted friend (28f) kicked me out of her life,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2x3gq7/im_30m_in_a_bad_place_and_my_most_trusted_friend/,"Hello reddit.

I need someone to talk about and get advice regarding a friendship. 

I’m a man close to thirty. I’ve been friends with this girl, two years younger than me, for about 3-4 years, give or take a few months. Lets call her Sarah.

**Background/History. You can skip this if you want.**

I was your stereotypical unemployed hardcore no-lifer nerd degenerate. World of Warcaft-stereotype deluxe. Sarah one day was invited into our guild as kind of a joke (we were really good, she was… well, girl-gamer stereotype deluxe). 

It was supposed to be a joke, but what followed were a lot of late night talks and we became friends. I admit I was at times crushing hard on her, especially after getting to know her and meeting her in real-life for coffee. But at the same time I was never head over heels crazy mad desperate in love, because I knew life isn’t a Hugh Grant movie. I wasn’t even sad. The crushing ended after a couple months and I was happy to have a friend to talk to about… “unmanly” stuff. Emotions, feelings, that kind of stuff.

I took a break from WoW back then for a long time because I burned out fast after joining an even better guild and getting a taste of playing at the highest level. 16 hours a day raiding - no thanks. That was before I had a smartphone or the game client allowed chatting with contacts without being ingame. So we lost contact.

Some months later I started a job training, getting back to actually living life and stuff. Finally having a smartphone, we got back into contact. Sporadic. Then I met a girl (who in the long run fucked me up emotionally bad) and turned to the only person who could give me advice: Sarah.

She was a big help, but it should not be. I was pretty fucked up from that girl, part my own inexperience, part that girls crazyness. Sarah tried to lighten my mood a bit, shared some deeper stuff with me. I was at the time getting back into contact with other good friends too, and (fuck up on my part here again) brought some of the stuff Sarah told me up with a friend. A few days later Sarah jokingly said “Btw if you tell anyone, I kill you.”... Well, I’m the most honest person there is and grudgingly told her that I already did. Cue a year of not talking to each other.

Recently I started playing WoW again with the new expansion, I was looking for a raid with my alt char and she was running her own group. Asked her if I could join her group, no problem. We were on Teamspeak (a voice communication tool with different “rooms” people can talk in), and she immediately asked to speak to me in another, empty, room. Like nothing ever happened she started to break down immediately and just flooded me with her worries about her boyfriend, her body image issues, and a lot other stuff. Quite frankly I had a “WTF”-moment. But well, if she trusts me with those deeply personal things - stuff she usually keeps a secret and never talks about - who am I to not offer my help.

Well, the weeks go on and we become really really good “friends” again. Tell each other about a lot of really deep and painful stuff. Talk every night for an hour or two.

Then she gets into her head, just as she was going through the breakup of her five year relationship, that I said something negative behind her back. Not true, btw. She has this issue where she just really flips out when she thinks someone talks about her. I did talk about her with other guys, but nothing personal, nothing negative. I changed a lot in the past two years, and maybe she thought back to that one thing, but I am a whole different person since I got out of my bedroom gaming dungeon and back into the real world. Also at the time I was fighting suicidal thoughts for the first time in 13 years, because I failed oral exams of my job training and lost a really really good job opportunity with a company I was an intern for, litereally a once in a lifetime chance (good money, relocation in one of the greatest cities in the world, a really good “job” and awesome colleagues). She had time to post to her fashion blog, she had time to play WoW, she had time to talk all night to another friend of hers. She didn’t have one minute to talk to me.


**The issue at hand. **

So we are not really talking right now. She is reverting back to a personality she had before her relationship, from what I hear from her friends (before I even knew her). Thing is, she made a lot of friends during that time, she obviously changed and grew as a person and built some things in her life. Which she all puts on hold, no contact. The warmth and kindness is just gone, she is bitchy, doesn’t care about anything good (people, things) that happened during her relationship and is just cold and “gone”.

She kicked me out of her life, her best friend broke off contact with her because she never had time and was “a terrible human being” to him.

I might have reverted back to the pussy weenie guy I was back then and texted her all kinds of emotional vomit, how I am sorry, that she is a good person, that I’m thankful for helping me through some issues, that kinda stuff. I’m kicking myself for doing that. Because with a bit of distance I feel I did nothing bad and SHE was the bad friend, not me. Fucking nice guy pedestal kinda shit.

Two weeks ago a very important friend to me died, and I went AWOL for a while. When I turned my phone back on after a few days I saw she was actually worried that something might have happened to me. I wrote her a short text that I have some shit to deal with, that it was very nice of her to worry, and not to worry.

A few days ago I hit another low point of my life, vomited a few more emotions I’m going through in a text to her (being too easily unbalanced by life shit and stuff like that). She said she doesn’t really know what to say. I told her I need to get my shit together, find myself, lay a solid foundation and would be gone for a while and that she should not worry about me.

It wasn’t nicely worded, I was/am in a dark place and just wrote exactly as I thought. She miiiiiiiiiight have interpreted it as targeted at her…

No reply. She removed me from social media outlets. 

I have this real-life drama to deal with, and on top that friendship drama with her. I feel sick to my stomach because of her, or rather the way things went down in the last few weeks.

I really like her a lot. I’m not in love with her, but we had this really deep and trusting friendship and it’s all gone. She just made me feel good, you know?

Anyway. I feel like puking all day from all the real-life stress plus her drama. I have no idea how to go on from here. I guess the logical conclusion would be to write her off. I don’t make friends easily, and she was the only person who really knew me. I’m don’t WANT to write her off. She is/was a good person for all the years I knew her and it’s easy to make excuses for her because of all her own real-life stuff she went through.

So mainly, I want to stop feeling sick and I want to get that particular drama out of my head so I can focus and deal with my other issues/matters at hand. 

What do?


**TLDR**: I'm in a dark place, friend feels slighted and removed me from her life, I'm in an even darker place, want to stop feeling the pain from THAT particular issue. What do?"
2x3i8e,1,2015-02-25,2/24/15 [Part I],[deleted],MyDayMyThoughts,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyDayMyThoughts/comments/2x3i8e/22415_part_i/,"Hola, todos. Hoy voy a hacer mi publicación en español, y la razón es triple. Primero, yo creo que necesito practicar la lengua un poco más; es dolorosamente obvio que yo soy algunos de los estudiantes menos proficiente en mi clase, y yo necesito corregir esto. Segundo, voy a discutir un sujeto que es muy sensitivo, y yo quiero frenar mis pensamientos para que no decir algo que voy a pesar. Tercero, yo no quiero que todos leen esto. Si es importante para ti, puedes usar Google Translate o un instrumento similar, pero si tú no puedes hacer este poco esfuerzo, entonces mis palabras probablemente no te importan mucho de todos modos.


Bien, vamos a empezar. Hoy vamos a ir un poco más a través de mi historia. Voy a hablar de mi ex novia. Yo creí de discutir este sujeto a causa de la cena ayer, durante que Qing me pregunté de ella y no podía hablar de ese tema. Me di cuenta de que nadie sabe nada de que ocurrió, excepto los pocos rudimentos que se deslizó fuera de vez en cuando. Pues, voy a tratar de ponerte al corriente.


Okay, yo acabo de intentar de averiguar cuando empecé mensajería ella. Eso fue una mala idea, porque tenía que leer a través de un montón de nuestros viejos mensajes.


This Spanish idea was really stupid. I’m going back to English.


I don’t recall precisely when I started talking to her, nor the reasons why. But for some reason, some part of me decided to reach out to her near the conclusion of sophomore year. I remember craning my head in the hallways to try and catch a glimpse of her whenever we passed each other on the way from AP World History, and apparently, she’d do the same. It was a really exciting and new time for me; I hadn’t really had a serious girlfriend at this point (I’d gone out with a girl in 8th grade, but that lasted all of a month). Nobody had ever really made me nervous until that point in my life; everyone used to call me a douchebag (some people might still call me a douchebag, but I wouldn’t know why; I’m perfect now) not just because of the boatload of confidence I possessed, but also my willingness to show it in not very sensitive ways. But damn, that was a time in my life when I questioned everything I knew, and somehow I forgot how to do all the most basic things. I remember Skyping her late at night, and just looking at each other through that screen; I’d be bursting with so many things to say but I had no way to express them at all, the only thing I could do was smile at her really. I remember taking her to eat ice at Rita’s, and the only thing I could do was grin like an idiot at her. My god, what a time it was to be alive. And we hadn’t even started anything yet, hadn’t even gotten to the good parts.


I don’t remember much of the summer, it was pretty blurry but I remember going on double dates of sorts with Evan and Esther, with him doing his best to help my awkward ass out, and it was just one of those times in your life when it seems nothing can go wrong, really. Near the end of the summer, I asked her to be my girlfriend. On August 12, 2012, I walked her back to her house after Lisa’s birthday party, and I said, “Carol, I really like you. Will you be my girlfriend?” And she said yes. I gave her a hug then, but apparently I held on for a bit too long because she asked if I was done or something along those lines. Still makes me chuckle when I think about it, I guess “sharing a moment” wasn’t a thing for her really LOL. But anyways, she went in and I went home that night smiling like a retard, and that was probably the proudest of myself I’d been in my life at that point.


We shared a lot of special times together, and had a bunch of new experiences. We shunned the usual homecoming affair that year, and ended up having a really nice time with just Alice and Eric. In September, she was my first kiss ever, and of course that went as well as you’d expect. I got to go through the awesome experience of meeting her parents, which was only made worse by my terrible grasp on Chinese and their even more tenuous/nonexistent English. Somehow things ended up okay, and her parents were more or less accepting of me. Everything worked out alright. We had a good period of time together, perhaps a couple of months – and then we had our first bump in the road. Out of the blue, she decided she wanted to break up with me. I was fairly upset, I think I could say. I’m not even sure how I felt at the time, I just blocked that part out. However, she came by later, and she was crying, and she told me she was sorry. And I forgave her, and everything was okay with the world again.
We talked about that incident for a little bit, and she told me that she’d felt I was disposable, that some things at school had not been going well and so she’d decided to try and cut me out. Looking back, I’m surprised at how well I handled it then. I guess I was a bit stronger then than I am now. We just decided that that attitude was sort of messed up, and we’d do our best to try and address it. She was going through a tough time at school, she needed help, and it was the best thing ever that I could be there for her. Even when she was really upset and stressed out about something, and sometimes she took her temper out on me, it wasn’t always easy but I did my best to understand and be supportive. Because hey, that’s what love is, right? It’s all sacrifice; that willingness to give up something so that you can share and be part of something bigger and better than anyone could ever imagine. That’s what I thought love was, anyways. And that’s what I still think love is. There’s always give and take, and it really made me happy to be able to give away every bit of me. Throughout the relationship, I can say without reservation or hesitation that I tried to do everything I could for her. Homework when it was late at night, help her with her tests during the day, I even got my parents to help her buy the house that she lives in today. I was just so happy to be able to give it all, and felt so blessed to have someone I could do this for.


Junior year… it’s funny how memories fade. I don’t really remember much of it at all anymore. There were a lot of good times and different experiences that we shared. I introduced her to restaurants and places and things to do that I loved, and she did the same for me. Rudy’s, Nori’s, Black Walnut, a whole bunch of things that just blended together and belonged to both of us. We’d go work out at the gym together, and then walk under the flickering highway to La Centerra where we’d maybe find some food, and then sit on a bench under the stars and just talk about life and dreams and what we wanted and what we were thinking. There was so much to say back then; not so much towards the end.
Things weren’t perfect, though. We joked that we’d have a fight scheduled for every two months. Sometimes they were over petty things, just a word or two that someone said which tweaked someone the wrong way or hit a bad chord when they’d had an off day. Other issues were much more divisive; she always hung out with Brian, Joe, and Charles. I didn’t really have any problem with that. She’s allowed to have her friends, and God forbid I become some insane control freak of a boyfriend. I spent so much of my time and energy trying to avoid that, and at the end, she ended up calling me suffocating and controlling anyways. But wait, I’m getting ahead of myself here. I’d ask her to just take a single female friend along, any other girl just to make the ratio a bit less skewed. Hell, Joe even had a girlfriend, and I suggested that they bring her along. I didn’t know any of them really, they were all strangers in my eyes. I’d exchanged a few words with Charles before, Joe had been in one of my classes for a matter of days before he transferred out, and I’d never really met Brian before (and honestly, he kinda creeped me out; him and Schuyler could pass for a pair of serial killers in my book; not a dig at their personalities, but it definitely set me on edge). Of course, Carol would nod at me and say that I was being reasonable, but nothing would ever change, it’d still always be just them. I should’ve seen the pattern then. Hindsight 20/20, all the time, right?


Part of being a man or even just an adult is accepting responsibility, and in no way was she to blame for the majority of the fights. A lot of issues were probably exacerbated by some of my reactions. I tended to dwell on things and keep emotions pent up inside, courtesy of my parents never really taking me seriously whenever I had anything to say. It always felt like nobody really listened to my words, and now I was experiencing the same thing with the person who it wouldn’t be a stretch to say I cared for the most in the world. In my mind, I probably blew some things out of proportion, overanalyzed some actions or words and ended up making something out of nothing. My conflict resolution skills definitely were subpar at the time, and could definitely still use some work today. I don’t know where to go with this really. I guess what I’m trying to say is that although I look at myself and think that I handled everything to the best of my capabilities and always tried to do what was best for her, I’m acutely aware of my own flaws and acknowledge the fact that I’ve made mistakes and done bad things, even if they were inadvertent.


And so junior year passed. We went into summer. I attended a summer program, where I made many new friends and had a number of meaningful experiences. Notably, that was something that she tore me down for, a fantastic time in my life that she made fun of and trivialized. I think that was the summer she got an internship. Things are a little hazy now; I hate losing things to time and a faulty memory. She had a rough experience there and had a number of personal issues which I won’t be going into. I did my best to help her through that and I was glad to see her when she returned home early from that. As a side note, I had always disliked it when she went on extended trips away, whether on vacation or whatever. I didn’t like being apart, sue me. But it turns out she noticed this, and she would later toss it back into my face. Anyways, as we moved on towards the end of summer, we applied to many of the same colleges; she tossed out the name Georgetown but neither of us gave it much thought at the beginning. We went up full of bravado, believing that the system would work out. We were both academically capable students who were passionate about what they did and were pretty damn good at it, were reasonably well-rounded, and weren’t socially incompetent (in my case, at least not to outsiders; in private, it turns out I do a lot of things that don’t make sense). Results started coming back. Rejected. Rejected. Waitlisted. It wasn’t a good time for either of us; we’d had the dream of going to Columbia and NYU and exploring New York together, and it was tough seeing that go down the drain. She cried a lot back then, and it was a terrible time for me too, but I tried to hold it together the best I could. I don’t know, it’s late… maybe I shouldn’t even bother finishing this narrative, it’s not even productive.


Anyways, around March, she vacillated back and forth between Georgetown and UT. I’ll be honest, I thought it was a no-brainer. The business program was fairly strong at UT, it was a fraction of the cost, and I didn’t really understand what she saw in Georgetown. I still don’t, frankly. I still think it was a damn stupid decision, and that’s probably an opinion that’ll be with me until the day I die. Anyways, for those of you who are friends with me here now, based off of context clues in this paragraph and the fact that you haven’t seen her walking around, I bet that you can figure out that she didn’t choose the same college as me. I took it fairly personally, I would say. I didn’t see it so much as her choosing a college, I saw it as her not choosing me, and I saw it as an expression of a lack of faith in the relationship (which ended up being a solid interpretation, as it turns out; more on that later). I was incredibly bitter about this, and there were some harsh words thrown around. Regardless of what she may or may not have done wrong, I feel so incredibly guilty about some of the things I said and about how I treated her on some days. She never really retaliated or anything; she did her best to work with me and my temper tantrums, or whatever it was that I was going through. No matter whether she intended it to or not, this was when the relationship died. Not in May, as she thought; it was in March that a part of me shut off and didn’t ever come back up again."

2x3ma3,179,2015-02-25,[OC][One Shot][Less Serious] Respect the classics,[deleted],HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/2x3ma3/ocone_shotless_serious_respect_the_classics/,"I served under General Groove, during the Shimmer wars, and if I could tell you one thing about the man, it's that under his long hair and wicked shades, the General is brilliant. Standing in the belly of an Airmaster hovercraft, jumpsuits on and rifles loaded, the 7th rifles platoon, redubbed ""The Experience"", was not shaking in their boots like any other platoon would have been having to face up against a Shimmer Outpost. Instead of shaking, boots were tapping, and over the righteous guitar blasting over the sonic-emitters in the front of the hovercraft, General Groove was yelling at us. He wasn't yelling about battle-plans or about enemy-weaknesses, but instead about the song which the one called 'Hendrix' had released. 

""THIS SONG IS CALLED PURPLE HAZE, DUDES"", The usually mellow General Groove shouted over the song. ""HENDRIX RECORDED IT IN 1969 AND IT IS PSYCHEDELIC, MAN!"" 

""PSYCHEDELIC!"" the men yelled in turn, following it up with ""HOO-RAH!"" 

As we flew towards the enemy outpost, we feared nothing, Because the General of Groove was with us, and his magic sounds were blasting from our ship.

General Groove was not actually a General. He was a Sergeant Major, and his name was Flynn. Despite this, the once cryo-frozen, now very much living Sergeant Major Flynn was affectionately referred to as ""General Groove"" by his men. 

Flynn himself didn't mind this. In fact, he had loved it. Flynn, as a soldier, had not really been all that special. The only thing which had set him apart in any way whatsoever had been his copious consumption of Acid and the fact that he had checked the ""organ donor"" box on the back of his license when his very own government had plucked him out of Vietnam in 1972 and ushered him through miles of underground tunnels to a secret facility which, according the the US government had never existed. Flynn had been a lab-rat. A human subject of the greatest resilience, he had been integral in MKULTRA, MKULTRA II, and PROJECT ESP, all conducted behind the scenes by the CIA. They found him to be an excellent test subject due especially to his resilience towards psychedelic drugs. When they froze him up in '76, and locked him in the basement of some bunker for the next 200 years, Flynn had had no idea what was going on. The last two years prior had been a living trip for him, and so when they put him in the experimental glass tube, he hadn't even been sure if it was happening at all. 

Sergeant Major Finnigan Flynn had been, for the most part, forgotten. Well after the time that cryo-freezing and unfreezing had been perfected, and well again after the time that his signed waivers had worn off and worn to dust in some dilapidated CIA wearhouse. It had been completely by fluke that the Government had found him again; and it had been in one of our darkest hours. 

The United Earth Empire, lead by three leaders, had been pushed to the brink by a brutish Alpha-Centaurian threat who the earthlings had taken to calling the Shimmers. See, Shimmers could hardly be seen, thanks to the frequency emitters which made up the bulk of their military standard-issue packs. They weren't much bigger than humans, and 1 on 1, studies had shown that an earthling was on average more intelligent, had quicker reflexes, and was stronger.. but even still, the sonic power of their suits could keep them invisible, and safe even from bullets, which bounced off of them like pop-corn kernels. The humans were scared shitless, and looking for any avenue they could explore against the Shimmers, which is how exactly they came to find the self-professed General of Groove. 

""I hear he's a super-soldier!"" said one lowly-paid intern to another as they huddled behind the line of legitimate Generals. ""No, no, it can't be that, look at his lack of muscles! Maybe he's a masterful tactician!"" Said a second. 

""Cut the chatter, back there"" snapped a head-honcho. ""All records of this sub-basement level had been erased, and the experiment logs with it. All we know about him is that he was stuck in here in 1974 and that his name is Sergeant Major Finnigan Flynn. 

And with the defrosting, and the opening, and the clearing of the smoke 7 days later after the paperwork to unleash him had been filed, Sergeant Major Flynn had been released into the world once again. 

Pushing his shoulder-length hair out of his eyes, and lowering his purple-tinted glasses down over his nose, Flynn gazed upon the groups of strangely-dressed military-men and women in front of him. 

""Whoa.."" he exclaimed, ""Is this Canada?"" he asked the woman standing in front of him. The intern in the back asked ""what's Canada?"" quietly and the second intern simply shrugged. 

Aside from what he had assumed to be a sarcastic joke from some dude in the back, the first words that Flynn heard in some 200 years were thus; ""Sergeant Major Finnigan Flynn, My name is General Blum. The year is 2179, and for the last two centuries, give or take, you have been frozen in a sub-basement of the CIA. This may be a lot to take in, but everyone you knew is dead, Humanity has reached multiple solar-systems, and a para-galactic threat now beats down upon our doorstep, threatening to destroy humanity as a whole. Now, all records of your existence had been destroyed before we got to you, and in this time of war we have devoted countless man-hours and dollars into you, shall we say, resurrection. We do not know what your value is, so please, Sergeant Major, will you tell us who you are?"" 

At this point, Flynn had been fresh enough for the residual centuries-old Lysergic acid diethylamide to have awaken, and all he managed to get out before sitting himself back down in his pod was ""I'm the General of groove, baby!"" 

Humanity had awoken a burn-out. A stoner. A hippy. 

Humanity had awoken the Hero that would help to save them all, for it was General Groove. 

His rank had allowed him several squads to command, and though most of the time none of the Brass knew very much of what he was saying, all they knew is that every time they sent the 7th rifles out on a mission, they returned not only victorious, but virtually casualty free. The only casualty, in fact, which had been suffered in the prior 3 conflicts had been one man who came back with strange symptoms, and rambling incoherently. Fearing some 20th century super-disease, doctors had rushed to the General, asking if there was anything he knew about the soldier. 

""Relaaax, man,"" he had said ""he just partied too hard. Give him twelve hours and he'll be good to go, you'll see"" and so he was. 

Battle after Battle was won at the hands of the General, and though I'm not a scientist, I will try and explain why. 

The Shimmers were very different from humans. They were bipedal, sure, but insectoid, and with a vastly different technological and sociological repertoire. Never had they created any sort of art, music, or really anything indicative of culture, so when they developed their shimmer-drives, which granted them their strength and durability, they really thought that there were no natural draw-backs. That was until the introduction of Shock and Awe to the equation. What the General had done, is that in blasting this music, this ""hendrix"" as he called it, he overpowered the sonic-drives of the Shimmers, leaving them naked, embarassed, and altogether weak compared to us. 

Which is why, touching down on the Martian surface, our Hovership blaired ""purple haze"", the guitar screaming through the air, the drums like the percussions of hell, and the bass thick, vibrating in our souls. We touched down as the music played, and our guns blazed the second we were on the ground, debilitating Shimmer after Shimmer in our wake. The song switched to the next on the tape, a band called the ""The Rolling Stones"" with a song called ""sympathy for the devil"". It started with primal drums, and barbaric screaming, before growing. Bass was added, and piano, and it all sped up and grew just as the battle did. They fought hard, and so did we, but despite the battle, despite the terrors of war, every single member of the Experience had a smile upon their face. The General started laughing. Not a joyful laugh, but the laugh of a soldier. The ironic, ""*oh for fucks sake*"" laugh that every veteran can't help but laugh every once and a while at the absurdity of it all. 

And as the song grew, so did our laughter. The sound rose until the guitar solo, as all that could be heard was the crack of gunfire, the screams of the Shimmers, and the laughter of us Earthlings. 


And that is how a small, bipedal, fat-covered species from Earth became the most terrifying species in the entire Galactic cluster. A scene which had been repeated in a thousand earthling movies from 1950 to 2150 and onward was indeed one of the most terrifying things that any other species had ever seen, once the videos had leaked onto the holonet. For who could be that crazy? What species could be that insane? Others species made war, sure, and some loved it! But none.. none before had harboured and became warlike as we humans did with that guitar urging us on, and with the General, long-hair flowing, in front of us like a madman. 

At the end of the battle, the floating news-bot camera which had been following us zoomed in on the General, and where any other general would have put on a straight face and said something stoic, The General of Groove simply smiled and said ""you gotta respect the classics, baby!"" "

2x3tx0,7,2015-02-25,Is an accounting internship necessary for a development intern who is working on accounting software? (And other exciting questions!),Ysdfg,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2x3tx0/is_an_accounting_internship_necessary_for_a/,"About a year ago, I was a computer science major and I started a software development internship at a small software company. At first, my job was mostly limited to creating electronic business reports internally as well as for our customers, using SQL queries and a report design program. As I got more familiar with the business, database, etc. I was given small programming tasks related to our main software product. In addition to our main product, we sell a connected accounting package that was built almost 20 years ago and our CEO decided recently that it's time to create a new version of the accounting software and asked me to be part of the 3-4 person team that's creating it. As a result of working on this project (and my experience with reports, which are often financial in nature) and learning more about accounting and how vitally important it is to business as well as several other life factors and goals, I decided to change my major to accounting. My company is fine with it, because I'm continuing to do the same work I did before and I'll be learning more in-depth information about accounting which will obviously help in creating our accounting software.

My ultimate goal in accounting would be to create my own software company and use my accounting knowledge to run that business. That's not something that's likely to happen in the near future for a variety of reasons though, so my main future goal for now is to work in private industry, rather than audit. I'm not particularly interested in a career with a B4 firm at any point, just a low-key industry job with a decent salary and preferably not more than 50 hours/week in the off-season. Honestly, my current company seems to like the work I do and I could probably stay with them forever well after I graduate and be perfectly happy, but obviously I don't want to rely on that as my only option in case anything changes.

My main questions are (I lied, they're not exciting):

1. If I did not continue with my current company after I graduate, with my experience, would I be able to transition directly into an industry accounting job or would I be smarter to seek out an auditing job to gain experience?

2. My dad works for a non-profit and mentioned to their auditors that I'm majoring in accounting and they told him that internships are important. I'm not clear if that means an auditing internship or just a general accounting (bookkeeping?) internship is what they're looking for there, especially since they're an auditing firm. I'm not interested in a job there, but I certainly don't want to ignore their advice about getting an internship if it's applicable to my situation. Since I'm not particularly interested in audit, it would make more sense to me that I'd want to focus on industry stuff (like the accounting software) and general bookkeeping, but I don't really understand the nuances of the different accounting paths. Thoughts?

3. If you do think I should be expanding myself to more real-world accounting, I'm fairly certain my company would allow me to shadow our bookkeeper or do some light A/P or A/R entries, but as we start working more on the accounting software, I'll basically be doing that anyway, just with contrived examples rather than actual invoices. Do you think it would be enough to expand myself within my current company and get my accounting internship experience that way or should I eventually seek out a full-blown accounting internship elsewhere?

I figure I won't get as much hands-on experience with actually performing accounting tasks in my current internship, not counting the contrived examples I come up with while designing and testing the software. On the flip side though, I'm already being exposed to an enormous amount of the logical ""how and why"" of accounting, which certainly can't hurt. I'm still very early in my understanding of accounting, but I want to make sure I'm not screwing myself down the road by doing more programming of accounting logic than real-world accounting.


Thanks for any related advice you can give!"

2x413k,0,2015-02-25,I [F24] finally managed to cut bridges with emotionally abusive ex-bf (but still have feelings) [M26]. Not feeling ok.,286007501711364,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2x413k/i_f24_finally_managed_to_cut_bridges_with/,"**Tl;dr : Been in a chaotic on-and-off relationship for almost two years with someone I love, but who has commitment issues and still keeps leading me on. I’m trying to cut bridges and managed to not speak to him for two weeks now, but have been in an emotional rollercoaster every day since. I still try to keep on and stick to my decision to move on. How can I manage to stay in a stable state of mind?**

-----------

The story begins almost two years ago, March 2013. We met on a dating website, started to date for one month, after what he broke up. I got attached to him very quick so I felt quite bad even if it did not last long. We decided to stay friends two weeks after the breakup because it was still a pleasure to chat and share music and stuff for both of us.

The following month of “friendship” was ambiguous. We were close and tactile, and eventually had sex again around 2 month after the breakup. That became regular, and I started to feel really fucked up. I was in love, he was not. I decided at some point to cut bridges with him. It did not work. I missed him too much and we started talking again. He said that this time he would pay more attention to his behaviour, no ambiguity. That failed too, at the very first meeting. It was not even coming from me. I knew it was bad because I knew he had not changed his mind but I felt ecstatic at the same time. He knew he kept leading me on.

I started my Master degrees and had the opportunity to apply for a 6 months internship abroad during spring semester. When I told him that I was going to leave he looked pretty sad. We continued to see each other and talk regularly during the autumn semester, but I still felt bad about us not being a couple. He eventually told me that we should not keep it that way right before my final exams. I was devastated again (but managed to pass my exams anyway.) He said he will explain to me all the reasons why he does not want a relationship with me and why he is so broken inside before I leave for my internship. So he told me about his life. That was rough. I remember I ended up crying on his couch, feeling sorry both of us.

And then the day of departure to another country finally arrived. I missed him a lot at first. And we had enough arguments about our opposed feelings. I felt tired of this at some point. I told him I felt like my feelings for him finally begin to decrease. I became colder the next days. At first he told me he was happy for me to start feeling better. And then he told me ambiguous stuff. Things you say to someone you care about in an amorous way. I got angry at him after a few days of him sweet-talking me and told him that if he was not that afraid to be in a relationship, he would have told me that he loved me. He responded “I love you”.  I melted.

So we decided we were finally in a true romantic relationship, but I still had three months left abroad. We were patient. Summer arrived and I came home. I saw that his look on me had changed, like stars and tenderness in his eyes. I felt loved. Things went well. But three months later, our relationship was still at the same point. He was stressed to meet my friends; he said he wanted us to spend more time together just the two of us before he did. More importantly, he couldn’t manage to see me more than once a week, which was clearly not enough for me. I asked to see him more. After all that was what he promised when I was away. He could not manage it. He flipped out. He said he preferred to break up with me than making an effort to see me more.

Again, I was devastated. Plus I had a rough term at University. Teachers were pushing really hard on us, all class was close to mental burn out. But once again, we couldn’t stop talking to each other, and seeing each other, and having sex again sometimes. We were still both in love at this point, but he tried hard to not show it to me. He told me that he needed time for himself but that he will try to feel better before my feelings for him go away. I stuck to this. I was telling myself that he will come back again to me at some point. He told me he would.

During my term I applied once again for an internship abroad for the next semester, but in a closer country. I thought that fresh air would make me feel better. I left the country again at the beginning of January. Two weeks ago I talked to him and I asked him how he was doing, and if anything had changed on his side. We had this same conversation several times, and every time I ended up feeling bad. He told me how sick he was to have this conversation again and again. That I should do my life and make decisions without caring about him because that’s what he was doing. That maybe at some point, when time has passed, we could be friends. All of this made me feel pretty upset, and I stopped talking to him for a week. Seven days after, he came to speak to me and I told him I didn’t want to speak to him anymore, at least for now. He got very sour, said coldly ok and bye. He added that he did not want to be tempted to talk to me so he blocked me. 
 
It has been more than a week since and I feel lost now. I would be happy if I was able to say that I am okay. But I am not. I am not in a stable state of mind. One day I feel proud of myself and happy with my life, I have hope for the future, I enjoy spending time with friends, co-workers, roommates… And the other day I feel depressed, sad, angry, fucked up, lost, I don’t want to talk to anybody, I lay down in my bed doing nothing, I wish he would come back again. I sometimes even feel all this range of emotions in one day. Some other days I just feel empty. I know that I will stay strong and stick to my decision, even if it is tough. I wish I could be in a stable state of mind back again. I hope time will help, but I wish I could do something.

Other things I wanted to point out: 
-	I had a bunch of one night stands since we broke up but that did not help at all. I never wished to see them again (except once, but as I was leaving for 6 months two weeks later, it did not happen).
-	He has been very clear all along about what he wanted (or didn’t want) and I just clung to him because I was deeply in love and hoped that eventually we’d end up together. To be fair to him, he’s not that much of a bad guy just because he does not want the same as I do.
-	All my friends have been telling me all along that this relationship was not healthy, that I was not happy with it, and that I had to cut bridges with him. I know they’re right but I can’t help being irrational, because I’m in love, and I can’t stand the pain of not having him in my life anymore.

We had a good relationship and very good sex. Even though we had a long distance relationship and some little arguments once in a while.



Since everything was going well I decided to go with her on a trip to Bali and Thailand with another couple. Bought the airplane ticket 2 weeks ago...



Last Sunday she was out with her colleagues and went to a bar till 4.00 am. Since I had to go to my internship next morning I read it next morning and was a little surprised about the time.



Last Monday she started texting me that she wasn't feeling fine. I thought she meant feeling ill. but then she said she wasn't feeling fine about us. I was like WTF. I asked her: ""what do you mean?"". She said she wasn't sure about us together. I felt my stomach twisting. So I went to a room where i could call her. On the phone she said that she has grown another way and that we are so different. I was angry, sad and confused at the same time. I totally didn't see it coming. We talked some more but at the end I asked her if we where done. I could hear she didn't have the courage to actually say ""it's over"". Instead she said: ""shall I come and pick up the keys tomorrow..?"" (She lives alone in an apartment for her internship, I visited her in the weekends).



After the phone call I was crying. I totally didn't see this coming. That last sentence felt like a hit in the stomach. I lost the girl I loved so much within a few hours, while I was working..



The next day she came over to my house. Where we talked some more. I asked her (angry): why did you made me book those tickets if you felt this way? She said that it wasn't like this two weeks ago. I felt some kind of disbelieve. I also asked her if something happened that Sunday night. She said no and I believe her. I never had the feeling she cheated on me, ever. 



She said she still loves me, and that we are more like friends that have sex. I still love her too but not in the 'friend zone' way. eventually I couldn't hide my tears anymore and hugged her and said that I was going to miss her a lot.



Next I called my parents (who were upstairs) to come down. My Ex-GF brought some flowers for my mother. But my mom was angry at her for the vacation and shit, and didn't accept the flowers. My mother told her why she was angry and she agreed she fucked up on that. At the end I let her out, talked to her outside and hugged her one last time. Went back inside and I cried so hard..



After telling all my nearest friends and family what had happened they told me they didn't see it coming as well. But they all say i'm too good for her and my parents said I didn't really fit with her. She offered me a refund of 400 euro (about $450) which I took (she has a rich family and i'm from an average dutch family, so it's a lot of money for me and no big deal for her).



The big problem here is that I still love her and I'm not angry at her. I respect her feelings and she's been completely honest with me for as far as I know. We broke up as friends, but I have lot of trouble dealing with this. because the truth probably is that we're no match, but  I still want her.



Oh and one last thing: she said not too long ago that she wouldn't mind having sex with me as a friend if we ever broke up because we have had a lot of sex. What do I do with this..?

I've been looking on sublet.com and craigslist.com but I'm not sure where in NYC i should look. I would prefer closer to the financial district or easy to transport there. I just have no idea what areas are good/bad in NYC.

I'm an Android developer looking for an internsip. I'm currently on a gap year and I need a way to help pay for school so I'm pretty much open to anything at this moment. I'm primarily a Java programmer but I do know other languages (C#, Lua, Clojure, Python and Javascript).

I've developed different apps. I have two apps on the Google Play store. One is a simple joke app[1] and the other is a simple weather app[2] . I'm currently working on my 3rd and 4th apps. I helped develop an app called Captor which provides real life subtitles using Google Cardboard and augmented reality. You can check it out here[3].

I'm open to relocating anywhere for the internship though I'd prefer to relocate to the Bay Area since I have connections of getting a place to stay out there.

You can find source code to most of my projects [here](https://github.com/fadelakin).

Looking forward to speaking to those interested."

2x4kev,6,2015-02-25,"Me [21F] with my Boyfriend [23 M/F] of 1.3 years, are trying to get his financial stiuation straightened out but it doesn't seem to be working.",amanalighthouseacity,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2x4kev/me_21f_with_my_boyfriend_23_mf_of_13_years_are/,"My boyfriend was one of those kids that grew up with a 'fund'. When he turned 18, he got about $90,000, mostly put there to pay for whatever college he chose and allow him to get an apartment or continue paying rent at his home ($650/month.) He hopped around colleges for a bit, went to the community college for two years, and how he's quitting without a degree.

Currently, he works a part-time desk job for a local company. He makes $300 a week once taxes are taken out, and that's his only source of income. He currently lives in an apartment with a fixed rate of $550 a month. Overall, he grosses about $600/month, but then he has $200 in car insurance, $30 for his phone, plus gas and food. He doesn't come out very far in the black.

And recently, he's been worse with his money than usual. He's buying a lot of coffees and snacks, taking people out to tea, going to movies, etc. This led to him being $50 short on rent this month, and not being able to pay his car insurance, or get his car repaired (which needs to be done before the engine is destroyed.) 

That's where I come in. I'm always the one that buys the food, loans him money when he's in debt. I'm going to have to front the cash to get his car repaired. And while he's always paid me back, I'm a college student making $350 every TWO weeks at my internship. I'm strictly budgeted so I have about $1500 to my name, and dropping anywhere below that is panic-attack worthy. 

I've tried telling him to get a full time job, and he puts in a half-assed effort for about two days before he stops applying. I've told him to get a second part time job and he says that if he does he won't have any free days.

Look at how much I care.

I graduate in about 70 days, and have told him that, if he doesn't have a full-time job by that point, it's over. I'm planning on moving out of state and I'm not bringing someone who can't support themselves with me. I love him dearly, and I would very much love to keep him around.

What should I do, to get through to him that this isn't any way to live his life? That, even though I have the financial means to continue taking care of him, I feel like punching him in the head every time I see him spending his money on anything that isn't gas? I don't really know what to do anymore. I'm starting to get resentful.

TL;DR: Relationship may end because boyfriend can't support himself and I have to constantly loan him money when I manage mine so strictly that it causes me distress to do so.

I'll wake up late, spend a few hours jacking off, reading reddit, and generally wasting time, then maybe go into the office between 1 and 3pm. When I get there I do nothing useful. At some point I leave and then go home and also do nothing until I get tired enough or take enough drugs to fall asleep.

Today I had an interview scheduled in the early afternoon that I forgot about and missed, which caused a ton of problems for a ton of people. This is the 3rd time its happened in several months.

I get paid a ton of money (like a quarter million a year) and my output is close to nothing. I don't even understand what I'm supposed to be working on and I'm a drag on my team. I've had periods where I can be marginally useful and produce things but my biggest accomplishment was 80% done by my intern and I just claimed credit for it after she left (one positive thing: I didn't screw her in any way with this - I wrote her a great review because she did really well, and she got a good job offer because of it. So at least no one was harmed.)

If this keeps going people are going to figure it out. They already suspect it but since I transferred to a new team 4 months ago I'm still in a grace period where this is allowed. It's not all that bad for me to be useless right now while I'm still learning, except I'm not actually learning anything and don't expect anything to get better in the coming months. I just keep hoping something will improve on its own and it won't.

My mind barely works and I can't store information. I forget things constantly. I don't know what happened to me because I used to have a great memory. Now everything is gone. I can't remember *anything.* Like what happened in a book I read yesterday, or what someone said to me, or the bus schedule. Friggin nothing.

Today I've felt worse than ever before because of the problems that I caused by not fucking coming into my 6 figure job because I'd rather stay at home and watch porn. But I can't even cry about it. I'm a man and when I was a teenager I felt that society would shame me for ever seeming weak or expressing emotion. I feel bad constantly but I've trained myself to express nothing and as a result I am just constantly in this dull malaise where I feel useless and shitty about myself. I wish I could feel happy sometimes and I wish I could release my emotions but I can't. I take antidepressants but I'm still horribly depressed. I'm scared to switch medications because every time I've tried it's lead to instability and I feel like I'm on such thin ice right now that I can't handle instability. I wish I didn't exist but for whatever reason I'm not suicidal.

I need to improve this somehow but I'm not and I don't know how and I can't. I don't know if drugs or my poor habits have ruined my brain. I used to be so smart and now I'm not."

It generally does. The Foiler is the incarnation of the laughing darkness. He is what goes bump in the night. The Foiler confines his powers to humanoid limits for the fun of facing mortals on equal ground, but outside of the ring he is beyond godhood.
 
 

Persona: Mysterious and evil-minded by nature, The Foiler’s motivations are unclear, aside from his love of delivering the ‘punchline’. His signature laugh (“ahaha!”) is known and feared on an instinctive level by all living creatures (and some others). He cackles and makes light of his opponents, seeming to enjoy the pain he suffers nearly as much as that which he delivers (in large quantities) to his opponents. The Foiler speaks in riddles, and will dismantle his opponents psychologically and emotionally outside of the ring with the same joy and fervor he does inside. Has a habit of appearing and disappearing in disruptive ways. Kind of a jerk, but holds a high standard for ‘class’ when it comes to evil (and will occasionally come to the aid of the babyfaces, if it serves his incomprehensible interests). A mix of Matt Borne’s Doink, Kane, Jake Roberts, and Terry Pratchett’s Death. Enjoys parody songs. His brutish frame and love of blunt-force trauma belie the cruel and calculating mind underneath, as well as wrestling skills honed over millennia of dominance.
 

 
The Foiler is also co-tyrant and ruler of the Glorious Nation of Hurtsville, a pesty mystical city-state currently located just behind the 4th curtain in central Indiana. The Foiler and Senor Tigre (co-tyrant, luchadore, primordial hunter, etc, currently out doing cat stuff somewhere) are known collectively as The Hurtsville Express (HVX for short), the most dominant tag team in all the realms. The Foiler’s magic train (yep) is also known as the Hurtsville Express, a ridiculous conveyance that, like most things Hurtsville-related, changes its very nature when The Foiler finds it suitable. Official spokesman of Quaker Meats. Has a penchant for terrible alcohol products.
 

 
Attire: Full-length black tights and singlet with strap over the right shoulder. Dark purple knee pads and boots, with Iron Sheik-style toe spikes. Fingers and wrists are taped. No elbow pads. The Foiler’s grin is his most distinguishing physical feature.
 

 
Style of wrestler: Primarily a ‘Strong Style’ wrestler, combining hard strikes with a variety of power moves and bursts of unexpected speed. The Foiler likes to play mind games in the ring, relying on his wit as much as his strength and skill. Combines the brutality of Vader and methodical, no-wasted-movements approach of Don Muraco with the off-putting antics of the likes of Goldust and Shinsuke Nakamura, and a good amount of Jake Robert and Masahiro Chono mixed in. A mix of old-fashioned and modern moves.
 
 

Signature Moves: Heart Punch, half-nelson suplex, piledriver, arm-trap headbutts (a la Al Snow), Steiner Screwdriver, Shining Black (Drive-By Kick), Kareline Lift/Russian Neck Drop, stump puller, Kenka Kick, gutwrench suplex, gutwrench powerbomb, Lariatoooooo!, head smash onto toe spikes (corner, usually as a counter)
 

 
Finishers: Ganso Bomb (aka the Kawada Driver, sometimes referred to as the Last Laugh), Awful Waffle (super gorilla press flapjack to ringside), Making All Stops (sequence of STF variations with strikes in between)
 
 

Entrance: Varies, but generally involves appearing in a swirl of mist, messing with the arena lights, and the usual Cheshire Cat routine. Steam whistle at beginning sometimes.
 
 

Themesong: ‘Another Body Murdered’ by Faith No More and Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E.
 
 

Catchphrase: ‘Ahaha!’ ‘Ahahahahaha!’, etc. ‘Keep smiling’
 

 
History/Bio:
 
 

The Foiler is older than the universe, and exists in varying forms and degrees through all the worlds of existence, and some other ones on bank holidays. Taking various forms over the ages, The Foiler has delighted in lowering himself to human limitations, only to beat their best time and time again. Terrorizing mortals for the sheer fun of it, yet beholden to what might be described as a ‘code of honor’, The Foiler has haunted the dreams of Man before he had words to describe it; the signature laugh (‘ahaha!’) of The Foiler elicits an instinctive panic response in organic beings, a genetic memory ingrained in the living since the first prokaryotic organisms extended a pseudopod for self-preservation.
 

 
Tales of The Foiler’s interference in Man’s world have appeared, in frightened whispers, sporadically throughout history. The Foiler had set out to defeat, demean, and embarrass the greatest warriors throughout time at their own game, which seems to be something of a pastime for him. Stories of his involvement in the fall of Rome (“too fancy”, in The Foiler’s words), the Battle of Hastings, numerous appearances during the cold War, and countless others abound, even dating as far back as cave paintings. With the rise of professional wrestling in the 20th century, The Foiler found renewed interest, and the perfect platform, to get involved again, much to the chagrin of just about everybody.
 
 

When Chris Hardcore and Derrick Anderson founded the RWF, The Foiler’s hermano, Senor Tigre, was on hand for the very first show, and it was not long before he traversed the Veil and invited The Foiler along. What came next is well-documented; the Glorious Nation of Hurstville came back to Earth (settling, for whatever reason, in rural Indiana). The Foiler and Senor Tigre, known of course as The Hurtsville Express, set about dominating the tag division almost immediately. Defeating Christina Michaels and Steve ‘The Locomotive’ Rawls (The Foiler was less than pleased with his use of a train-related moniker), the duo captured the RWF Tag Titles, going on the longest title in RWF history, before dropping the straps to the Blaade Brothers, members of Damian Mitchell’s Congregation of the Unseen, in the historic War Games match. Along the way HVX engaged in lengthy feuds with Troy Stone and Roy Firestone’s Stone Foundation, the Army of Anarchy, and the Kings of California.
 
 

On the singles side, The Foiler boasts one impressive win-loss record. Despite never capturing the RWF Championship for his own, he holds victories over nearly every champion the company has had. A lopsided feud with Lee Mercer kept fans entertained and helped Mercer elevate his own game, but The Foiler’s most obvious rival is Troy Stone, the man he defeated for the RWF International Title in a King’s Throne match. The two have fought one-on-one and with their respective teammates, with The Foiler and Senor Tigre even playing the heroes and supporting the RWF financially and in the ring when the FWF threatened to take over RWF’s interests via Roy Firestone’s considerable personal wealth. As backstage politics forced a restructuring of RWF’s management, an old comrade-in-arms, Mr. Saito, took the reins, and we got a greater glimpse into the mind of The Foiler, who was called upon to deal with the festering influence of Damian Mitchell, a nearly unstoppable behemoth of a man that RWF brass and competitors seemed powerless to contain. One visit to the locker room later, and Mitchell’s time in the RWF was done.
 

 
Almost at odds with his preternatural tendencies towards sadism, The Foiler believes that ‘evil should be classy’, and is quick to intervene against purportedly ‘heel’ actions that he deems ‘petty’ and/or ‘stupid’, partly due to his obligation as a force of nature to screw up things. Also incongruous is the respect he has shown for a select few opponents. Despite frequently invading the homes of his opponents, even going so far as to slip into the bedroom of Ricardo Sacramento’s children to get inside the man’s head, The Foiler has somewhat begrudgingly acknowledged the skill and tenacity of longtime foe Troy Stone, even fighting alongside him on occasion, and has allowed other talent, in particular the dissociate identity disorder sufferer Dean/Dale Mollins and blue-blooded cruiserweight James Lafontaine into the land of Hurtsville as security detail and an intern, respectively.
 

 
Other fun stuff:
 

 
The Foiler is host to RWF’s annual Off The Rails supercard show, broadcast live from the Hurtsville Hippodrome (where The Foiler puts himself at the top of the card, because he can).
 
 

The Foiler once turned Jim the Gaucho into an eggplant for about a month.
 

 
The Foiler, materializing Godzilla-sized, raised the lost island of Meropis from the depths of the ocean for an RWF show.
 

 
RWF’s stunning backstage interviewer Vickie St. James was personally involved with The Foiler for a length period of time, and mortals just don’t do it for her anymore.
 

 
What’s next: With the RWF set to start up yet again, The Foiler has returned to Earth with a smile (of course), as well as a mission: the RWF Championship. Keep smiling… The Foiler always does. Ahahahaha!

Hoping someone on here can help or give advice

Age-27 In April
Salary-65681.46/yr
Current contribution is 5%
Employer matches 4%
End of the year we get an additional 4% bonus into 401K

I expect a 4-6% raise every year and top out at 85K unless i move into management. 
This week I should know if i get a promotion which I assume will put me at 75K

I expect to retire at 62

Current 401K Account balance is $29518 with a current rate of return at 6.6%
IRA balance( previous internship 401k) is $2,872. Currently do not constribute to

That being said I will be meeting with a financial advisor for the first time next week and was going to discuss with him my life/financial goals.
I assume ill need around 1mil for retirement time of 20 yrs. 
I should continue with employer match and current contributions and then invest half of the remainder of my check after bills and half toward student loan debt.
My main investments would likely be land and timber with stocks mixed in. Mainly because i'm a country guy and my favorite pastime is hunting and fishing and i can use the land and profit off planted pine."

When I was in grade school, I just wanted to sleep. I never got out because I didn't have friends. The only friend I had moved to another town. That was when I was 8. I sometimes played outside with a girl who lived in the same street, but I know she made fun of me behind my back.
I wasn't bullied, but I was left out. I never had a real close friend. I don't know how friendship works. I made some friends when I was 14, but I had emotional issues and I didn't get attached, they knew. They were also a bit weird, and people made fun of them so I was a bit embarassed by them.

My mom was then diagnosed with cancer, and she died within a year. I lived with my dad and my brother. I am not close with them. Whenever I get home, they don't even greet me. I am treated like a dog. 
I got kicked out of high school because I couldn't do it, they gave me another chance, but I didn't accept it because I was just so sick and tired of it all.

I met my first and current boyfriend around that time. We live together now in their attic, at 22 years old. We both don't have family we can turn to, and don't have the money to move out.
We will move out next year, when we can rent for cheaper because of our age.

4 years ago, I stayed home for a year. I was a leech, I didn't know what to do. I tried applying for jobs but it didn't work. The only school I ever finished was.. grade school. I've never had a job either besides 2 internships. Those didn't go well because they thought I was weird.
I started talking with an old friend again, we get along a lot, we both laugh about the same stupid stuff, but like me, she has social anxiety, so we only really ever talk online, sometimes we meet up but that is like once in 2 months. I am not an introvert, I am an extrovert but I'm scared by being social. I don't know what to do, I don't know what normal human interaction is.

I am now in school again, it's like vocational school and it's a worthless subject (art), but I needed to do something because of my age when I started. I will do something else when I finish this. I want to go to university. 

But it's just so tiring, I try to be nice to my boyfriend but I have so much issues that I just get lost. I love him and he loves me, but I snoop his email, phone, internet history, whatever, I am not good with arguments, I reflect my own insecurities on him. I'm a lot better now than I was at the beginning of the relationship, and today I did it again and I'm so embarassed that I'm gonna ask him to remove my access to those. I just feel horrible.

I am just so tired of it all, I never had real friends, I feel like I'm just one big mistake, I miss my mom but can't even remember her voice. My classmates are nice but after a few years I haven't even made any friends in my class. I went to see a doctor for some issues, but they didn't seem interested. I don't want to go again because she won't take me seriously anymore after that many visits. I used to cut myself, but I quit that when my mom died, I don't hide the scars anymore though. It just seems silly. I am still suicidal though.

2x4uzw,13,2015-02-25,"CMV: Chris Brown did not commit an ""unforgivable"" act",BonnaroovianCode,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2x4uzw/cmv_chris_brown_did_not_commit_an_unforgivable_act/,"Seeing [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/2x19jg/chris_brown_refused_entry_into_canada_must_cancel/) this morning frustrated me with the amount of SJW's coming out in full force. Seeing people get off on judging/hating another person just so they can feel ""above"" them and have a little ego boost for the day just makes me shake my head. Chris Brown fucked up. No denying that. He's also a bit of a toolbag in general which makes people want to hate him even more...so I get it. But damn...how short-sighted can people be?

Some people could benefit from a Bible lesson: 

*""...but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them. The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?” They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him.*

*But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.” Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.*

*At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. Jesus straightened up and asked her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?”*

*“No one, sir,” she said.*

*“Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared. “Go now and leave your life of sin.”*

- John 8:1-11

I'm an atheist...but Jesus was a pretty fly nigga. Have you ever done something you regret? Perhaps you didn't beat up your girlfriend as that thought would never even cross your mind...but maybe you have done something else that would have never crossed Chris Brown's mind. We don't empathize with Chris because we don't struggle with that specific issue...but who here is still shunning Bill Clinton for his stint with Monica? Nobody...because we can all relate to that fuck-up. Hell, if I was President of the most powerful nation in the world you better believe I'd struggle with not banging my interns who are throwing themselves at me. But Chris Brown? Fuck him. He's committed an ""unforgivable"" sin and must be shunned forever.

What the hell? He had a lapse of judgment in the heat of the moment ONCE and did something he regrets. The dude isn't Hitler. Why can't we just admit to ourselves that yeah he fucked up, but he is just as deserving of forgiveness as anyone else who has expressed genuine remorse and not repeated the behavior?

I am so embarassed by myself for doing this and it sounds like a scam or whatever. You can believe me or not. But i am serious.

So i got that job interview a few weeks ago for nursing school. It is my dream to become one of those AWESOME people. 
So my job starts on 1. April 2015 (yes, haha April's Fools. I am not kidding) and few day ago my car broke and the service said it would cost around 1000€ to repair it. But i dont have that money to repair it. Not yet. I get my first paycheck at the end of april. (Monthly paycheck) I need that car to get to school. There is no bus or train go to...so if i dont have a car, im fucked and i cannot attend at that school and get kicked out. Future ruined. :( 

What i want to say is, i have to survive the next month somehow and get the money to get my car repaired. But right now i am an intern at a hospital and i cannot do another job. That would be too much for me.

So my last chance is to beg for money from people on the internet. I hate myself for that. I dont have any real family here. Im not in contact with them and i dont want their help.

Selling my dignity is the only thing i can do right now.

IF there is someone who wants to help me out to get around the next month...

IF you want to help me, PM me and you get my paypal infos.

*Prepare myself for being trolled etc.*

In deep trouble,
Jolie

2x5adr,9,2015-02-25,"I work for a start-up that has great potential with a good group of people. The problem is the money isn't great after 3.5 years, but it's not bad either. How long should I stick things out before I take my skills elsewhere?",CuriousThrowaway416,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2x5adr/i_work_for_a_startup_that_has_great_potential/,"**tl;dr - Work for a company with good potential and is experiencing success, but pay hasn't been what I had hoped for after my most recent raise. Wondering what my options are and how long I should give the company if I look for a new opportunity?**

---------------------------------

I currently work for a start-up in the tech industry and have been here for 3.5 years (4 this June). I came on board as a software dev intern and have moved up into a mixed role that's along the lines of IT management, business development/sales, and marketing. I like what I'm doing a lot and my only real complaints are money and the commute (1hr 15min to 1.5hrs, not the worst, but it's gotten old).

Our company has seen good success in the time that I've been here and we're expected to double revenue this year. We have solid offerings and have contracts with some big federal agencies and tax authorities both US and international. We also have contracts with the Big 4 accounting firms and are growing on the corporate and law markets.

My co-workers are all easygoing and the team is always open to new ideas. The CEO listens to most everything I say and I was able to convince the company that I should be doing my hobby as part of my job (marketing/training videos). The CFO also mentioned that the company is currently undergoing valuation and I'm expected to be offered equity in the next couple months.

From what I've seen, I do believe that we can certainly double revenue and grow quite a bit, but my recent pay raise was not quite what I expected, given my performance and stepping up to the plate when we experienced a bit of turnover last year, for acceptable reasons (one had a kid and left for a big corp for money, one left for her dream job with a non-profit, and one left to become a stay-at-home dad).

However, I just got a pay raise from $49k/yr to $51k/yr and I closed a nice non-US government contract, took over handling vendor accounts, do all in-house IT work, and started producing marketing/training content that has led to favorable opportunities (quite a few clients mentioned the videos gave them a better idea on what we had to offer and wanted to either demo or trial).

I was thinking of having a conversation with our Director of Business Development, who says I'm doing a great job on helping him with our market (he had asked the CEO for me to help him for the past year and I didn't know, but I was engaged in other responsibilities) about where I started and where I'm at now and feel that he can help talk to the CFO about reconsidering my compensation if I continue to perform well or even better than expected.

So, I've been applying for internships and I have a couple of interviews coming up for data analyst internship positions. I have never interviewed for any technical positions before, and from what I understand, there will be technical questions asked about stats/software/programming etc.



I was wondering if any of you intelligent, beautiful people would impart some wisdom on me and help me prepare for my interviews. Are there any common questions for this sort of position? How technical do the questions typically get. Will I be expected to recall formulas/equations from memory?



Any help would be extraordinarily appreciated!



Thank you."

I have a summer internship in Colorado Springs from late May through mid August, and am starting to look for apartments but finding it difficult.

I have an interview with a recruiter in three weeks to discuss the internship and hopefully talk about getting a full-time offer. We had to complete a mid-internship survey and one question asked about our service line preferences. 
 

Ultimately I want to end up in TAS, so I put that as my number one preference and audit second. I know this is pretty common because it's seen as a more ""sexy"" service line, but after talking to a few past/current associates in TAS I know for a fact it's where I want to end up. So far I have enjoyed my audit internship and have learned so much, so I can't say anything negative about it. One thing that intrigues me about TAS, specifically buy-side FDD, is that your analysis is forward-looking. 


I know there's a slim chance I turn this audit internship into a full-time TAS offer, but I figured I would at least give a shot and gauge the demand. Anyways, I've heard it's important to start off in audit to develop your ""soft skills"". 


I did a non-FSO audit internship, but I heard one of the questions they ask during the final interview is do you want to stay in non-FSO or switch to FSO. Knowing that.. Would it be easier to switch to TAS from FSO? I've heard it pretty much depends on your reviews and your network, but I figured I would go ahead and ask. 

Thanks!"

But there's one man who doesn't buckle when facing. Quite the opposite, in fact. He's the most unlikely one, a fresh new intern at your office headquarters, so new that he's still tasked with fetching coffee for his seniors. He's so unremarkable that most people who pass through probably don't even notice him.

But he's the only one you will cave for. How many times have you let him fuck you after everyone else had gone home? How many nasty, demeaning names have you let him call you? You stopped giving blowjobs to your own husband after a while because it felt too demeaning, but you'll drop to your knees for him and swallow every last drop he gives you.

I am graduating with my English degree but coming back to school immediately for a second bachelor's program in Computer Science. I'll be 25 when I graduate. I'm actually excited and seeing this as my second chance at doing college right and a time to get internships and everything. I was very sick sophomore year through recently so I spent less time focusing on what I wanted career-wise and more on my health.  
  
But I've decided I hate my major. I want to pursue a stem field and my interests pointed me to programming/computer science. So I took courses here and loved it. Unfortunately, the only way to get into my school's program is to come back after graduating instead of just tacking it on to my degree and extending my stay. I tried to contact people about this but they just won't admit seniors. Luckily, I won't have to repeat gen eds, global/language requirements, and only be doing the CompSci curriculum. It's seriously amazing.   
  
I'm also doing really well in my CS courses and I feel happy (albeit frustrated and confused as well lol) about my decision. I get a sense of fulfillment from completing my work I never got from literature and writing.  
  
Now...so...a random fear I have is if me being 25 when getting into the workforce is gonna hurt me. Can't really do anything about it, but I want to prepare myself for any challenges I may have and prepare myself.  
  
Also, will having a degree in a humanities make me ""interesting"" to employers, or will they just only care about my ability and CS degree?

I got married two months ago to her dad because he's a great father and a good man and a wonderful provider and I love him. I graduated from college in the standard four years and held my baby in all of the graduation photos. I've worked part-time jobs and held an internship since graduating but I spend most of my time at home, being a mom.

I have nothing to complain about; I have a wonderful life, with supportive family and friends and a beautiful, happy, healthy daughter. But I think there's something wrong with me because I'm very unhappy.

I was always one of those people that was expected to 'go places', people would tell me to 'remember them' when I was at the top, and while I always acted like it was silly, I smugly thought that they were right, that I would do great things. I know I sound awful so far, but I'm trying to be completely honest to give you a fair, accurate picture. I always did well in school, had a full ride to college and was pulling A's in B's in my fine arts major. Just before I found out I was pregnant, I was a junior and trying to decide which grad schools to apply to OR if I should move straight to Seattle - a city I've always wanted to live in - and just head right into the workforce. Then I found out I was pregnant. My boyfriend and I had just split up and while we were still friendly since I was very close with his family, he had made it very clear that he had no desire to be with me again. He said it was because I was too flirtatious and he didn't want to be with someone like me. He was kind of right; I've always been very outgoing, touchy with members of both sexes, and like to be liked. I always respected him, though, and his boundaries. I never cheated or anything close. However, I wasn't going to be with someone who didn't want to be with me, so I let him go and moved on. I even had two dates set up when I found out I was pregnant (needless to say, I canceled them).

Throughout my pregnancy, he was very supportive, very excited. He had told me early on that he had always wanted to be a father and have a family. I wanted to be a mom, too, but I intended to do so quite a bit later in life. For personal non-religious reasons, I did not want an abortion but was very interested in adoption. I had read tons of literature on it, had even applied to several adoption agencies. I was very dedicated to the idea of giving this wonderful opportunity to a couple who could handle it. Around the six month mark of my pregnancy I decided to keep the baby. I don't want to say I 'caved' because that is melodramatic but there was definitely pressure for me to keep the baby. His mother outright told me that she and his father would be willing to adopt the baby and raise it for me, an idea that I was opposed to. She also wanted us to be married before the baby got here and I refused.

My boyfriend and I patched things up as best as was possible during the pregnancy, and were 'together' when she was born. I put that in quotations because it's not as though I was all too interested in dating in general, so I often wonder if it wasn't convenience for both of us. We moved in together and raised her as a team; he was and is very, very helpful and as much a part of the team as I was. I didn't change a single diaper the first two weeks of her life, he was always there first. Like I said, I'm very lucky, and my life is very good. He went to work and I went to school for the next nine months and we fell into a routine.

Then, he proposed, and I said yes. I put pressure on him to propose; again, I tell you this in the interest of full disclosure. We live in the South, and I was getting lots of snide remarks and judgmental looks for my bare ring finger. The looks, I wonder, might have been in my head, but the remarks stung. An engagement ring at least would help; I was so sure of this. We were slotted to get married a year and a half later, but for some reason, we changed our minds and got married only seven months later. It was a lovely Catholic wedding, one that made my family very happy. It had very few details that I had initially wanted. The wedding just sort of got away from me, and I let it to make other people happy. I'm not some martyr for this; on the contrary, it's just an example of how I lack a backbone.

Now I'm here, and I'm almost a year out of school with a sweet, funny toddler. I should be happy, we're comfortable, my husband makes a comfortable living. I spend my days with my daughter and doing general housewifey stuff. I spent years getting top grades and working hard just to stay home and do dishes, vacuum floors, fold laundry, etc. I feel like I should be happy but I'm so sad. I cry a lot, when there's no one around, and I don't know why. I wondered if I just had really late post partum depression but I didn't have it when she was born so I don't see why it would kick in now, I don't think it does that. I want to move out of this town - we're still living in the town I went to college in, since my husband's job is very good - but neither of us have found jobs elsewhere yet. I hate my life as a maid and a babysitter. I feel like my best years were taken away from me and I resent myself for it. I never resent my daughter, she's innocent in all of this. I do resent my husband sometimes and I know that's not fair, especially since he doesn't know and he can't help it. At night, I have trouble falling asleep. Oftentimes I daydream of happier things to calm my brain, and this part is the one I feel worst about. I sometimes daydream that I never met my husband and my daughter doesn't exist, and I have a free and happy life living as a 'starving artist', waiting tables and working odd jobs to pay for the luxury of life experience to help my writing. Sometimes the ugly thought creeps in that if my husband died that I would be a widow, a tragic figure, and I'd get a second chance at life. I don't exactly hate it. This thought is the main reason I'm using a throwaway since I know it is abhorrent. I hope you realize that my husband is a fantastic man, a great person, a wonderful dad. I'm lucky to have him. I would be devastated if anything actually happened to him. That's why I know my thoughts are so ugly. 

I don't know if I'm depressed. I don't know if this is normal. I feel like a failure. I got pregnant and now I spend my days picking up toys and rereading the same cardboard books a hundred times, or stacking blocks over and over. I feel guilty when I watch Netflix or read while my husband is at work, since it doesn't seem fair that he has to work all day and I get to play. So when he's gone, I make sure I'm being productive. If I slip up and play, I feel guilty for it. He wants another baby and I resent him for that, too. I was always thin and it took me a year and a half to get in shape again. My vanity doesn't want to lose that. I know that's awful, too.

I don't quite know what I'm asking here. Am I normal? Am I cruel? Do I seem depressed? And if I am, is there a way to fix it? I don't want to take medication for personal reasons. I exercise and eat right, get outside when I can. I don't lead the lifestyle of a depressed person but I'm tired of feeling like this without knowing what I can do to fix it. I have been to a counselor but she gave me no feedback, preferring instead to just let me talk and then tell me she'd see me next time. It did not help."

I am a student in a small university in Canada. This last year has been filled with psychological pressure and manipulation from my supervisor. I am on antidepressants right now, and I believe their effectiveness has lately diminished. I need some advice on how to tackle the situation.

So, the story, a bit long, but I feel it necessary to be told, because there are several points to understand:
I have been working in a lab as an intern during the majority of my B.Sc. education. This professor's work seemed interesting. Shortly, I became more of an associate than an intern, as I managed to publish my first paper in that lab. My performance there and my general conduct lead us (I and the professor) to think that an M.Sc. with him would be easy and interesting, as I already possessed knowledge on most of the projects and machines. As an important note, during this period I was mostly working with the post-doc in the lab, and had very little direct contact with the professor (**mistake #1**)

I finished my B.Sc. in April 2013. The following month I had already started working for my M.Sc. My motivation plummeted after the first 6 months seeing how little scientific support I got from my supervisor. Moreover, he did not wish to order the product I requested, which showed promise for obtaining the material I wanted, thus I wasted more than half a year working with similar compounds, but the reactions did not work. The compound I needed is indeed expensive, but he kept stating how ""money isn't an issue"". This hypocritical behaviour from his part also appeared when I saw how differently he acted around the higher graduate students compared to our interactions. One year later, I still have no good results. I started a depression late november 2013. 

I started asking myself if I am doing something wrong, if I need to change some parts of my personality. Well, I did, I discovered that I have chronic empathy, and am generally very sensitive. This is important in the father-son relationship that my supervisor wanted to develop with me, and unfortunately we did get close. Close enough that if I were to leave before I get my degree I know I'd feel bad for abandoning him. This is when antidepressants were recommended by my doctor. They helped a lot! I eventually took the initiative to leave. I applied to another very competitive university late March 2014 I think.

My supervisor gave me an ultimatum right before I applied there: if I apply I won't come back in his group, or I don't apply and I finish my degree. I applied, didn't receive admission. I suspect that the recommendation my current supervisor wrote was sub-par (or my academic performance was not competitive enough, which makes more sense, because it's a really good university), as he very badly received the news of my desired departure. He didn't see it coming. 

I let him know of the university's decision, and to my surprise he wanted me back. I eventually did return (**mistake #2**). 

During my antidepressants treatment, which lasted until August 2014, I started asking myself if research truly is for me, and started planning other career options. Soon after, November 2014, I receive 2 scholarships! This boosted my self confidence a lot and motivation a little (because I was still in that lab).

So, now I'm back in the lab. Seeing how my initial project was left aside, we decide to reuse some old data on which I worked a bit (but mostly the former post-doc) and make my M.Sc. thesis around that, I have the necessary knowledge and capabilities. Sounded good to me. I start writing and writing, analysing data... until I start observing scientific discrepancies. At this point I restart my a.d. treatment (November 2014), because I was trying to push towards obtaining my diploma as fast as possible, then leaving this place; I needed support to have a clear mind, my doctor agreed. It was the dilemma between considering these almost 2 years a waste of time in case I quit, or make an effort to finish so I can leave with the degree.

This is where I should have quit immediately. The data he gave me (because he had most of the data, I was given some figures already prepared - another red flag) seemed familiar, I believe it was ""recycled"". Last week I managed to obtain confirmation that some SEM images which he told me to analyse were actually over 4 years old and had nothing to do with the project, just the physical nano-structures were similar. 

I eventually finished writing the paper on this, with a lot of time being consumed trying to understand what my supervisor was proposing, I was not satisfied, but I also wanted to end this. The main data directing the project was clear, I participated directly in most of it. The extra analysis, which I did not perform, the data that I was fed, didn't seem useful nor pertinent enough, and some was scientifically inconsistent - I gave him back the data to review it every time he did that to me with marginal improvement and a barely satisfactory explanation. Today we received an email announcing that the paper was rejected - this was expected, because the post-doc in the authors, with whom I worked for a long time and who started the project, did not receive the manuscript before submission. He told me he'd block it. This tension between the post-doc and the supervisor is another story...

Unfortunately, what kept me from truly making a scene was the fear that I might receive a bad recommendation letter for my future studies, because my supervisor knows me the best, and I have MANY reasons to believe that he isn't trustworthy. I fear making him angry now, which is why I believe that my treatment isn't effective anymore, because my sensitivity re-emerged. I did stop going to therapy in December. My PI also has a huge ego, he told me himself that seeing his ego attacked is one of the worst things for him.


IN CONCLUSION: I want to quit my M.Sc. here and either start a new one elsewhere, or apply for a PhD, I know some universities accept applications only with a B.Sc. diploma. I think that my M.S. profile is good so far: GPA 4.15/4.3, 2 papers, 2 scholarships, and a poster presentation award, but I wonder how relevant that will be given the lack of a degree and the importance of the recommendation letter. My B.Sc. was not impressive, it's during that time that I developed my curiosity and performance in research, without forgetting the general university life shenanigans... 
I require input allowing me to decide what's 



**tl;dr**: PI proved to be deceptive and manipulative, pushed scientific misconduct. I am close to finishing my M.Sc., but I don't want his name related to any of my future academic achievements, and I don't want to be in his entourage anymore. I feel he has used my sensitivity to get close to me and manipulate me. What can I do to get out of this situation on a good note? 


I know I am also to blame, but at least I am seeking help.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**UPDATE**: I confronted my supervisor about the questionable results. He obviously got angry, and practically imposed a change in my project. I initially agreed, but then I realized the implications which come with those changes. I had an emotional response and sent an email announcing my leave from the program. That backfired on me (I figured it would, but the deed had been done), and my supervisor accepted my departure.
Next, I contacted the dpt. and program directors. I received some useful advice from them, and the most important one was the value of the degree itself; I couldn't see beyond the science in my thesis as far as value goes, so, with the help of the directors, I decided to stay in the program. Told them most of the story, and they managed to convince my supervisor to keep me in the program. From now on my interactions with my PI will be mediated by the department director. 

Another thing, I was told I should have contacted the directors much earlier, as my doubts concerning my PI started about 2 years ago. Furthermore, I have some relief from the fact that the dpt and program directors agreed with my decision of trusting my instincts and confronting my PI about the questionable results, although the manner in which I did it received some critique (I completely agreed). To my defence, the psychological and emotional baggage I accumulated during this experience influenced my judgement; and I am still under antidepressants.

So far so good."

Also wall of text, sorry! So here goes.

My girlfriend and I are both full time students going to difference colleges. She got a scholarship to a local university and works really hard to maintain it so she's constantly studying. My parents are paying my way through community college but I hope to transfer next year unless I decide to finish up my AA instead. She's premed and I'm comp sci so we both have pretty good futures for ourselves. Normally we get along very well and rarely ever fight, but lately we've been having some disagreements, namely, I feel like she doesn't spend enough time with me.

She's taking 17 credits and I'm taking 14 so we're both usually pretty busy and it's hard to align our schedules. We could hang out in the mornings before classes start (both live at home) but she decided to go to work instead, saying she had to be at school early to get parking. (Ok that's fine.) So she leaves before 8 in the morning every day. I'd be ok with this, but she often complains about having to wake up early. She chose this, why does it matter? I decided I value sleep so I take later classes and generally sleep about 8-10 hours a night, go to class, nap, and then do my homework. 

Sometimes I'll ask her to hang out after her classes are over but she always says she has to study with her group or go to tutoring sessions and I just feel like I'm low on her priority list. I know getting into the medical field is hard, but it's her passion so what can I do? I'm a comp sci major and I have connections so I know by age 21-22 I'm going to be making a six figure salary. 

So I try to hang with her on the weekends, but she has an internship that she has to do on Saturdays and that limits our time together because I also have work later in the day. She took this internship knowing that we hardly spent any time together and knowing my work schedule. I feel like she's avoiding seeing me at this point, but she reassured me that she loved me and was just busy with her life. She's also been pushing me to get an internship or some experience in the field because it would be good for schools. Honestly, I've looked, but it's not interesting or worth it. I'm going into an in-demand field where the pay is lucrative so doing work for someone for free isn't worth my time. She decided to intern at a doctor's office for no pay and I think she's projecting her bitterness towards me because I have free time to play video games and sleep. 

Another thing is work. She works 10 hours a week and I work 6, so she's always busy even when she doesn't have class. Normally it works out because I'm sleeping when she's working, but sometimes I just wish we could spend time together instead of her always being busy. I don't know if I should just tell her to calm down and enjoy life some. It's like she isn't even enjoying her college life and she's at a real university! 

We often skype at night, but lately she's been very short with me. By the time she finishes her work and studying, it's about 11pm, which is when I start to do work. I can afford to stay up late because I don't have classes until later in the day. She expressed her displeasure that I would be preoccupied doing other things while I was talking to her, but I didn't really know how to respond. She's always busy doing work and I have to cater to her schedule, so why can't she work around mine? 

Now, onto the tutoring issue. She asked me to help her study for an IS exam because I know a little about computers and I said it was fine. But then she called me and I was taking my mid-day nap and I didn't answer. So eventually I wake up and she tells me she's being tutored by one of her friends who I absolutely hate. This guy completely disrespects our relationship even though she's turned him down numerous times. He's always making little comments to undermine our relationship and he knows I can't do anything about it because he goes to school with her and I slacked off too much in high school to get in. I asked her about it and she said that he was available. I don't know why but I'm just so angry. She knows I don't like this guy and she still continues to hang out with him. I'm not going to tell her who she can and can't hang out with, but this really bothers me.  


   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend who is in college and pre-med constantly works and doesn't make time for me. Also, is being tutored by someone I can't stand. How do I make her understand that she needs to make time for her boyfriend?"
2x5xna,1,2015-02-25,How to get started in data mining?,Nixonite,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2x5xna/how_to_get_started_in_data_mining/,"Hello everyone,

So I went to my first job fair today and I feel a lot smaller because of it. This was a ""techfest"" at my university and most of the jobs were related to electrical engineering or software engineering. I found 0 data mining internships, and few data analyst positions which were just marketing positions with data analysis. 

I like data mining and I've been reading ISL and ESL and coding in Python's scikit-learn, pandas, numpy and I have a twitter bot and a current research assistant position at my school for educational data mining. I'm learning the machine learning algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning and applying them directly to real data, and I know some Java and have been coding as a hobby since middle school. My major is applied math and I have a minor in economics. Overall I feel like I'm on a good path towards data mining as a career but going to this jobs fair made me feel like I'm behind or perhaps misplaced since so few of these tech companies have openings (entry/intern/full-time/whatever) for recent grads or senior level undergrads related to data mining/machine learning/ data analysis. 

I went on AngelList and there are a lot of fun sounding internships and data mining jobs, but they often have very little to no compensation. Do you think applying to startup data mining related jobs is a good way to get into the industry? I feel like there still might be stiff competition but at least there are opportunities here. I am also wondering how people would apply to positions without compensation... I mean are they just taking on another job for finances and the 0 compensation angellist position as experience?

Hmm... I guess I'm just here for advice on getting into industry of data mining. I have also considered applying to some sort of online masters program such as OMSCS at gatech for the specialization of machine learning, but I'm wondering if there are any straight-out-of-college pieces of advice that anyone from this subreddit can offer. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. "

But here is where I am stuck: I have had the interview with said company early in January.  It was for a Sales/Marketing full-time position, but was offered an intern position at the time because the company had a sudden down last year, massive lay-offs happened. They are now looking to re-grow. I have again applied to another position after I had the interview, but nothing return. I even offered to work as an intern with potential part-time/full-time advancement, but still nothing.

So would it be rude/annoying/unprofessional to keep applying to different positions, but within the same company? The company might not seem that well managed by the way I word it, but its the type of job market I want to pursue, and its the only company of that type in my city (not the sales/marketing aspect, but what the company is about). Or should I just take my loses and keep pressing forward?"

I'm a transfer student from a tech school with an AAS in Computer and Electrical Engineering. Going to Uni would net me a BS in CompSci in only 2 years.

Recently applied for an internship at a Wisconsin powerplant company (Dairyland Power Co-op) for Student Applications Programmer. Haven't heard back yet but told my boss of the interview because I respect transparency in the work place.

The boss told me all about his time as a contractor and how he got a lot of work here and there and how he eventually ended up with an $80K salary where we both currently work.

He told me he worried I might get stuck going down one path and he didn't want to see me get my self locked into a degree and internship. He expressed how he felt if I just stayed with the company and showed him my programming skills he could move me into development (Embedded procs and etc.) and that I could be matched wage wise to a student just entering the work force but without debt. He feels the fair market value for a software engineer in Wisconsin (particularly the coulee region) would be $45K/yr (to start). I'm not sure this is correct, glass door was showing more like $65K for Jr. Devs and Java Coders.

I also have had ambitions to work for on of the Big 4. I'm not even sure that's possible without my compsci degree. My boss said if I want to go to college he complete understands because it's about what I feel is best for me and at age 23 I'm young enough to get stuff done and continue on a good career path. He just asked that I give a month notice so they can hire someone and I can help train to leave the company in a good place (something I don't mind doing).

As professionals with successful careers and lots of experience where I have none... please help me. What is the better options here? Currently making $16.50/hr as a technician.

**Background** 

* I earned a BS in Economics and Finance a few years back and decided to go back to school for CS three semesters ago.
* I am in my early thirties.
* I started a small retail business with my wife in 2012. Although it is successful, it is unlikely to expand beyond its niche.


**School:**
I have excelled in the program, having a 4.0, but am beginning to feel like my time may be best spent somewhere else. The school is definitely not a prestigious program but is a larger state school. 

The only core classes I have remaining are algorithms, automata, ethics, and capstone. I will be taking these courses minus the capstone next fall and have already completed all of the math requirements for the program. At this point, I will not graduate until fall of 2016 given the electives that I still need to take.

Moving to attend a different school is not a practical alternative given tuition increase. Moving for a job is fine.

**Internship:**
For the last year, I have had an internship, concurrently with school, that has given me complete independence to develop a web and mobile application while also supporting the team with other unique and interesting applications to support the project. I am the sole software person for this NASA funded team of a dozen scientists all of whom have phd's and are leaders in their field. This experience has been invaluable and my contract has already been renewed for another year. (position is dependent on me being a student or having recently been a student)

**Dilemma:**
Recently I have been feeling less and less excited about school and I wish that I could focus more on my internship and other side projects instead. I am also getting diminishing returns on my coursework partly due to poor professors and being required to work with less than enthusiastic students for many of my classes. This CS program is definitely allowing too many students to coast through. I feel like I am moving at a snail's pace.

**Questions**

* Is it possible for me to drop out and get a job after my next semester and having completed nearly all of the core courses?
* Are there any other alternatives for me? Bootcamps? 
* How would I approach potential employers with this? Just a really concise but effective cover letter?

Thanks for the help!

This is a long one. I don’t know what else to do with all these feelings so I just need to get them all out.  


I'm in grad school to get a degree in the mental health field, ironically, and I was at my internship today getting an evaluation. It went great and I kept it together. I didn’t feel much. I was just going through the motions. After my evaluation from one of my professors, my supervisor pulled me aside and asked me if I was all right. She had noticed that I looked down. That was it for me. I tried to hold it. I’ve broken down in front of her before, but I was overcome with sadness. I burst into tears and told her I was depressed. I didn’t care about anything anymore and couldn’t focus on my studies. I was falling behind in school and feeling guilty about pushing off my projects and papers but I couldn’t sit down and focus for the last week or two. 


I have an underlying problem that has been pushing me into a depression every so often, which I’m finally trying to seek help for (I need a referral for a specialist from my doctor first). I’m exhausted. That’s really the only word I can use. Exhausted from constantly falling into a black pit of misery every few months and barely being able to climb out of it. Only to fall back in again. I go to sleep and hope I don’t wake up. I’ve thought about suicide, but I have no intent or plan. I know I won’t do it. I just wish it could happen naturally. 


My supervisor listened to me so patiently with so much care and concern in her eyes that I just cried even more. She’s been a huge support system for me throughout my first year placement so if I had to break down I’m glad it was in front of her. Still, I felt helpless and cornered by my feelings. She told me to take the day off and do whatever I felt I needed to do. I told her I was going to go seek counseling at my campus and she asked that I call her and let her know how it goes and that she’d be here for me no matter what. She’s a saint this woman. 


I drove to school and filled out a bunch of paperwork and had a brief assessment. I told the intake coordinator that I felt suicidal but had no intent or plan. We talked for a bit, and again the waterworks. She asked about my childhood trauma and depression and who I go to for support. Honestly, I went to therapy for a couple of months during undergrad and that was about it. I’m not one to talk about the darkest corners of my mind to friends or family. Vulnerability does not come easy to me. She said I must be *exhausted* from having to carry all of that around by myself. Again, that word. She summed it up quite nicely. I am exhausted. But, because I wasn’t going to kill myself, I suppose there wasn’t an immediate need for them to schedule me sooner than the end of March. This system is so broken. I am broken. 


I booked the appointment anyway, got a list of resources should I need them sooner than the end of next month, and drove home. I didn’t know what I was going to do. I called one of the counseling clinics on the resource sheet but I hung up. I just spent my day explaining my feelings and hopelessness to my supervisor and then a stranger. I didn’t have it in me to do it again. Exhaustion. 


I came home and spent my afternoon moping and sleeping. Took my dog out for a long walk after I couldn’t stand to be in my room anymore. And now here I am. I can’t get myself to start my projects. I can’t stop crying. My eyes and cheeks burn. I miss happy me. I want to sleep forever.

My boyfriend and I met in college and started dating. His friend liked me and I wasn't aware, so when we started dating I lost that friend and many mutual friends we share. Many people don't seem to care for my boyfriend and when I make plans with my friends he usually wants to come and will parent me in front of them- scold me for drinking, tell me I should slow down even though I do know my limit, say it's getting late and I should be heading home, etc. If boys are over and my boyfriend isn't I feel really guilty simply being in their presence. 
Anyways, needless to say, my boyfriend is really my only friend right now. I feel kind of smothered by him, even though when I think about it I guess he really doesn't smother me and I'm probably just being an irritable twat. He applied for the internship I applied for this summer and we both got accepted-- it is in a different location than campus. He makes sure to take a few classes with me each semester. He meets me after class and work... Every opportunity in which I could talk to someone, it seems he is there.
However, recently he's made better friends at work and now he's spending a lot of time hanging at friends places-- which leaves me alone and I don't mind that, but I am resenting the fact that I feel I am alone because I have lost friends over him and that he is now choosing to hang with friends over me. I guess this is also my fault because after work and classes (classes start at 8am, work ends at 11pm) the other day when he came over I just really wanted to relax and read a book and I know I shouldn't when he is around but I did and he said it was rude of me. There are many things I could complain about, but I feel I am nitpicking and looking for reasons to be mad, and ultimately, I feel maybe I am just an irritable person so I will not post them. What I am really worried about is a text my mother sent me. For background, my family does not like my boyfriend. 

Here is the text:


""I don't like the way [boyfriend] treats you and I hate the way he makes you feel. It seems like he makes you feel so bad about yourself that you don't even realize he is turning you against your own self... all the put downs, scoldings, lectures, insults, rude abrasive comments, pettiness, pompous words and actions are putting you in a very dark place it is abusive behavior an its getting worse and more spiteful vicious mean and hateful by the day. I don't like the person he turns you into when you are with him.. you deserve better my baby girl!""


Okay, so I feel like I may be a hard person to have a relationship with. I stress easily and have anxiety about silly things. My mom says I always defend him, but I just don't want to put all the blame on him. I feel trapped- he talks about marriage and everything and I'm so unsure. I think about a break up, but I feel I can't because we are in the same classes and now the internship and he knows so much about me I am scared. 

Sorry for this rambling, but if you could give me any insight or advice I would really, really appreciate it. 


   
tl;dr: starting to resent my boyfriend for many reasons, one including that I feel he has isolated me from making friends while he has friends and a text my mother sent me is worrisome. "

Well, I left that job for one I was offered. I am now a teaching assistant at my University for a laid back lecturer. I enjoy it a lot, I get to work with students, a private office, flexible scheduling, not to mention a starting bonus. I really like it. I also still do my contract work for big name Silicon Valley firm I can't name. 

There is one problem, however. The position does not apply during the summer, I will need to find something else. Naturally, as a software developer, I am going for internships at the big tech companies. I applied for about 15 internships.

Two have already sent me rejections. I also have an interview for one Friday morning, but it's for a local company (I want to travel) and lower on my list.

I also cold contacted the director of one of the internships on LinkedIn, unfortunately the system sent him the generic ""I want to add you.."" message. I got a response saying ""have we met?"" and one of my professional mentors helped compose a response that was balanced between pitching and introducing myself. I hope I didn't look foolish and make a bad impression.

I'm worrying (needlessly I feel) about not getting any callbacks before summer, which would ultimately mean unemployment for summer and having to live with my parents - which I don't want to do. I'm also worrying that I'll get too overloaded with too many offers at once, or offers that have dates. I guess this is actually some sort of phenomenon known as ""exploding internships"" - as in all your applications seem to explode at once with offers that expire after a short period of time.

I'm wondering if anyone has tips to manage stress, or other aspies that may have been through this before - I know a lot of us on here are from the software community, so it would be nice to get a perspective from a more experienced veteran. Otherwise, I could just use some words of comfort. Thank you for listening to my rant!"

I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

“What is it you fear most, Mr. Chaney?” 

Of the revolving door of court-ordered shrinks I’ve been assigned, Yeong is the most direct. The obvious bad cop counterpoint to last week’s bright eyed intern, who left vowing to never see me as a patient again and so far has kept his word. 


I welcome his bluntness. It’s like the Manhattan project all the time in here.   I’m treated like a wildly unstable element, a little ball of entropy that, if mishandled, will send the whole place up in sickly green mushroom cloud. Every night, I’m delicately passed on from a shrink, to a guard, to an orderly until I’m gently placed in my padded, restrained room. 

“ Maybe burning? Yeah, burning alive. Seems like hell.”

He smirks, the arrogant shithead. “I’ve heard it’s only the first minute of burning you have to worry about. Past that? A real joy.” 


I haven’t got one of my usual outbursts in me this particular day. I trail off, let the air conditioning buzz and look out the window. It’s June 12, 2015 and it is the last full day I’ll see. 


			***

I think there are several people I could answer this question for, although I don’t know them all that well. The 12 (by my count) or 13 ( by the states count) patrons of that roadside diner probably didn’t even know their own answer as well as I did. If you’d asked any of them a few days earlier, there answer probably wouldn’t sound at all like the following:

“My worst fear is being blown away by some 22 year old kid, who turned out to be a pretty crack shot but a piss poor criminal, in some sort of botched heist.” 

They probably would have given one of those answers I listed earlier. Maybe spiders,  heights, who knows. But they probably didn’t live long enough to see those fears realized, to really look into them. Instead they got me, got that tragic episode that put me where I am today. 


		***

“How are you today, Mr Cheney” 

I’m a little taken a back by it. “ Fine, given the circumstances” I say to the guy, snarkily. He recoils slightly, a little indignant.  I know he was likely just saying it out of habit. But I had to take him down a notch. Today is my party. I can cry if I want to. 

He takes me by the arm and begins to escort me down the sterile-white hallway. I’m to be the lucky recipient of a new method of dealing out death like mine. An injection. The first use in the whole Commonwealth, so I’m told. 

I’m strapped to the cold slab. It’s uncomfortable, but being that it’s one of the last sensations I’m set to have in this world, I try to soak it in. 

I think I may have imagined it, but I hear a voice ask “Would you do it all again, Mr. Chaney? “ and I think that makes me more afraid than any other part of this whole scenario. 

The needle brings a sharp, hot pain to my right arm that is all in all not the worst feeling I could leave this world on. I’m washed in a womb-like warmth, I push towards a sterile white light. I’m suddenly on my back, bathed in blinding light and powerless to do more than kick and scream. It’s June 12, 1985 and I’m new again.

2x7lv4,2,2015-02-26,"Young married couple, already reaching the sexual end? Help.",NatureYork,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/2x7lv4/young_married_couple_already_reaching_the_sexual/,"HELP:

I know you've probably read enough of these by now but tonight, after I orgasmed, my wife started crying. That's on the list of things you never want to happen in your marriage so this is the culmination of events and I'm asking for your help and advice because I love my wife and just can't stand it.

My wife is a busy-body. During her undergrad, she held 3 jobs while maintaining a 3.8. Yet, there was never a time where she didn't want to hang out with me. We dated for 2 years before getting married. During those 2 years, we made out often, handjobs, oral, but never intercourse. Felt right to just save that and so we fucked around otherwise and loved it. We were married right before we both graduated university. Our sex life was like a plane with a blown engine from the get-go. My wife's libido took a nose dive. 

We've been married three years now, I'm 27 and she's 24. She doesn't enjoy sex or desire it. However, she DOES desire to desire sex. It's not one of those “I don't want sex or like sex but I love you, isn't that enough” scenarios. She wants to want it, but she doesn't. This is what gives me hope. That, and that we both love each other and show each other that love every day. But sex? Nope.

Maybe Culprits:

First culprit: Birth Control. This is the natural scapegoat, especially since she started taking it for the first time just before we were married. She noticed her waning sex drive and after a year married, she went off the pill for half a year to see if her hormones would balance and her libido would return. It didn't, and she started the pill again. She's thinking about switching to an IUD because we've heard it doesn't affect libido but is this really all it would take to resuscitate three years of sex free-fall?

Second culprit: Stress. My wife is in law school. Before I get all the “That's your problem” posts, that's not the problem OR it really doesn't help. A lot of law students have healthy sex lives (married and unmarried) and are very successful law students. Plus, my wife held three jobs for three years while maintaining a 3.8 during her undergrad. (yeah, she graduated a year early too) And while this was happening, we were hanging out almost every other night fooling around and enjoying it. There is a lot of pressure on her now with internships, externships, classwork, not to mention she has a part time job AND she has orders for knitting projects every month. This stress could just be a new stress that doesn't allow room for sex, although I've brought this up to her and she's said it doesn't matter. She still desires to desire sex and wishes she did. She often breaks down crying, speaking out loud “What's wrong with me, what's wrong with me, why don't I want this.” I stay up late consoling her, telling her I won't pressure, telling her it's okay and I love her. And I don't want to pressure her. But I like sex. Maybe even NEED sex?

Third culprit: Environment. We moved for her to attend law school. We live in an okay apartment that is messy most of the time but not too bad. I work full time and do most of the chores and cooking since she doesn't cook and doesn't really have the time. We have an Australian Shepherd that is pretty high maintenance but I take care of that: running every day, frisbee, heel-training at parks. And she loves the dog. But it's nothing like where we were. We moved from a place that had space, family, friends, familiarity (we were both born and raised there). Now we are in the big city: no family, new friends, no familiarity, and lots of hard work for her adjusting and dealing with massive workloads. It takes a toll on her, she often tells me she misses her family, her mom, her friends. Is unfamiliar territory causing these problems? Does she not feel safe or understood? Has she chosen the wrong career? o.O

Fourth culprit: Self-Esteem. Her's doesn't exist. She hates her body but she's petite and sexy. She has a bit of a tummy and she thinks a “flabby ass” but seriously, she's petite, super pretty, and that's not biased. That's why I sat next to her in class and asked her on a date. She complains her boobs aren't big enough. Etc. etc. I tell her she's beautiful every day. I hug her, tell her I love her. She turns me on, just looking at her in panties turns me on. But it doesn't help her feel good. Culture and other external forces are holding her esteem at near empty levels. I think this is probably at least half the problem, but I don't know how I, a loving husband who has offered and suggested help weekly for years now can help her. I'm worried about depression or something deeper... I feel like I need to schedule twice a week workouts with her but her esteem is at a point where she doesn't even want to workout with me or workout at all?

Finally, I want to make it known we love each other. We're trying. The problem here is I love sex. And I've made it clear to her that I'm willing to try anything. I'll go down, I'll buy toys, I'll let her dominate, I don't even give a fuck, I just want her to let go and feel at home physically again like before we were married. Doesn't mean anything. As of now, we have sex maybe once every two weeks and those are pity-quickies she gives me because she feels bad and after, I always feel like a pile of dogshit because I essentially used my wife for a dopamine rush. We're very open, she tells me what's wrong, breaks down, we discuss options. We've tried scheduling sex so that we know when it is, we've tried ignoring sex completely (I'll be honest, I wonder if this is truly an option. Can you reprogram your head to just not give a shit about sex, especially as a male? Cuz that would be the fucking easy. In reality, when we tried this, I just masturbated all the time, but I feel like that's a weak cop out to solve a problem with the one you love. I don't want to masturbate for 50 years).

Have at it. I don't know what else to do. Therapists are like $200 an hour (jesus fucking what) but if that's really the only option... I just don't want to go spend an hour beating around the fucking bush to pay $200. For $200, I'd like a decent start at helping our relationship reinvigorate the physical love we had before marriage and I've received mixed feedback from others about that kind of investment. (especially with staggering student loans from law school)

Thank you in advance."

Regardless of how the WWE reacts to the media backlash, we must continue showing support for them to make the movement last. Instead of shouting random things in their matches or not saying anything at all, we should be engaged into their matches, cheering and booing as appropriate. Or maybe even chant their names during boring male segments.

If people start to get invested in the women, maybe their screen time will accumulate to more than 5-10 minutes in a 3 hour Raw, every week.

In the whole AJ/Steph talk, Steph ultimately responds with ""I appreciate your opinion."" when it's a clear fucking fact that the women are paid significantly less (in this case, independent contractors and all that) than men and their screen time is a joke.

HHH gets praised for how he treats the women at developmental, and Stephanie is probably the ""corporate voice"" for the main roster divas. These two have a significant share of power in the WWE yet no one is speaking up or acting yet, while Vince's PR intern is trying to get fans to believe that they are listening.

It took CM Punk to walk out and fans to hijack WWE programming for months, among other events, to get the WWE to push Daniel Bryan. How would it be easier this time?"

2x7rp8,1,2015-02-26,"[M20] Guys I need your help! I suspect my [F20] girlfriend is cheating on me, what do I do??",throwawayz28,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2x7rp8/m20_guys_i_need_your_help_i_suspect_my_f20/,"Hi Guys!

So basically my girlfriend is just....treating me with 0 respect. I'll give you a brief summary;

(Background We're both at uni but I work full time on an internship, she's at uni (only for 6 hours a week) and works part time at the uni too - the 2 of us live together, we both met and hit things off in our freshers week)

So about a year ago gets this new job at the uni which involves pretty basic tasks, it's just showing people where to go around campus basically. 

Anyway, she's basically had no real social group since she's come to uni, and once she gets this job she's made quite a few good friends, which I'm delighted with! Because I think she really needed that, however...

There's this one guy...let's call him bob - who she seems to get along with a lot better than the others. To put things in perspective, everytime she goes out now with her work friends, she seems to always be huddled around him, he buys her drinks, they do shots together, etc. 

Ofcourse I'm fine with this at first because I know I can trust her...But over the past 3-4 months things have been looking really shady, for example;

- She texts him often, and then tries to hide her phone away from me when I come over to her. Like literally she doesn't even finish typing, just switches her phone off the second I begin to come near her (even though I can see who she's texting from her phone's screen)

- They've stayed at other houses together, in different cities (with their work 'friends' ofcourse)

- She NEVER invites me out when she goes out with her work friends, like literally I've asked if I can over lots of times, and it's a big fat no everytime.

- They rang each other on new years, I thought she was actually talking to her parents (seemed really personal the way she was speaking, then she puts the phone down and boom, it's bobs name) - since then they've rang eachother more, this is quite strange as she normally hates phone calls - even with me

- We were out in town last week, and by the end of the night she says she wants to meet her friends when we were in the taxi going home. I say I'll come with her and she says that I should just go home. I go with her anyway to this university halls, and guess who's there, yep, the same guy plus 2 others. 

I mean it's getting a bit ridiculous now, she seems to be seeing him literally everyday, if not in work, outside going for drinks, studying together (caught them together doing work in the library),

- Plus last night, I was out with a friend discussing where we were going to live next year (she graduates this year, I don't so she won't be here) - and when I get out I try ringing her - no answer.
She's normally back by now but I walk past a pub which she normally goes in with ""a lot of her work friends"" to see if she's in there. I look around and guess what, she's sat RIGHT in the corner out of sight. I notice her in the corner of my eye, there was no-one else but the same guy there leaning over her almost. When I walk up to them both I notice her phone is on the table, so she clearly avoided my call.

When we're in the car driving back I confront her about all the things she's been doing, I tell her I feel uncomfortable, ask her if theres anything going on, etc. She basically blew up and started an argument saying how I thought that I knew her better, she would never do something like that, and starts playing the victim saying that ‘I don’t want to live like this if we’re not talking’, etc.

And then she tells me that she basically prefers to be at work/in the library else other than at our home, because she doesn't like me to ask her what she's been doing, and apparently I accuse her a lot. (translation to me is; I prefer being with bob, I don’t invite you out ever on purpose) She literally said to me that he’s just a ‘good friend’ and there’s nothing going on….but I just don’t know if I can believe that anymore.

I mean, if all this was going on to someone else, I'm pretty sure they would have a really solid case of breaking up!

But here's the thing - I live with her for another 4 months until our contact is up, so it would make things super awkward if we broke things up now 

Even though it sounded like she was hinting at the idea last night, e.g. saying to me - ""is this even fun anymore? Do you think this is fun?"" after I asked her about her and the guy. 

I just don't know what do...I don't think we can last through this...But I fear if we break up she'll immediately run to this other guy, as she has a long history of moving on quickly with other people after she breaks up with someone. I just couldn't face the fact that I was right all along and she gets with this guy, it would just be…heart-breaking to know she lied to me all this time. 

So guys, what do you think I should do? I’m pretty sure I want to break up with her, but at the same time it would make things complicated. 

Tl;dr Girlfriend is acting super shady, I accuse her, she blows up about it rather than reassuring/trying to listen to me, breaking up now 4 months prior to moving out would be a massive inconvenience for both of us but I can’t live like this anymore.

2x7ryz,10,2015-02-26,My boss' friend introduced me to QGIS for the first time.,takoNick,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/2x7ryz/my_boss_friend_introduced_me_to_qgis_for_the/,"Hi everyone, it's my first time here, and I'm asking as the title suggests.

I'm interning with a local MP and his friend is in need of someone (that's me) to help out with mapping constituencies. As I am a first timer with QGIS, he even emailed me the installation guide and a simple user's guide.

So, I have two questions to ask:

1. Is there much functional difference between the ArcGIS and QGIS software? I tried ArcGIS once in university but dropped out because of the high learning curve for a non-IT student (at least myself) but I regretted it afterwards because of the lost skill opportunity.

2. With regards to the above, how long does it normally take to get used to the software? I have about about a month left on the internship, but I might find it useful for further studies or other employment environments."
2x7wix,1,2015-02-26,Can I still negotiate for more pay? Or did I mess up?,youngeditor,editors,https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/2x7wix/can_i_still_negotiate_for_more_pay_or_did_i_mess/,"Hello all, I hope you don't mind my constant use of this wonderful subreddit for career advice, and one day I hope to give back. 

TL;DR:
I got pressured into agreeing to a pay-rate I was hoping to adjust but didn't sign any contracts yet.  

I should probably note that I am 24 years old and graduated from a respected film school in The United States in 2012. Since that time I have worked a video internship at a noteworthy business after which I transitioned into freelance work. This is my first job, in my field, with regular hours. 

I am in a confusing situation where I think I missed my opportunity negotiate a raise. I have been working at video company based in Europe as of November last year, under a 3 month freelancer contract as a video editor/copywriter/voice-over performer.

After some initial training to their house style, (and the limited editing software we have to use) I believe I have integrated well into the company. 

They produce entertainment and news items, but I was hired as a core member of a new department that creates feature and editorial style videos with (examples not real) titles like “The real reason you are always sick”, “The Balkan conflict explained in 5 steps”, “Why you shouldn't visit Paris!”

Besides writing the majority of the scripts for these feature videos, I also perform voice over, in an American English Accent, for my videos as well as their news and entertainment videos. I also provide notes and script checks for other peoples items, edit video items based on my own or other peoples scripts, and brainstorm ideas and concepts for future videos.

My department unfortunately, has apparently not completely proven itself yet. It's unclear if the videos we create have a “real” benefit to the company, but they are considered an investment at the moment. Only one of our videos has apparently been a real ""hit”, with 600,000+ views. Nothing else has gotten that close. This is the information that I've received from my manager. Though I do believe that these videos are used as a selling point to differentiate this company for others when trying to score new clients. 

I work 4 days a week, for €16 an hour. I am not provided with any benefits and operate under a freelancer contract. Well, at least I used to.

My three month contract that I was initially hired under has passed, and my manager, who I work closely with everyday, pulled me aside one afternoon and asked if wanted to renew for another 3 months, or 6 months. She recommended 6 months since ""in case things don't work out the company will still be obligated to keep me on in some way"" and when I asked about room to negotiate pay she said there wasn't any. It all felt quite a bit rushed and I regret not discussing it further.

When the new 6 month contract was offered I crossed out the non-competition clauses which I felt didn't pertain. From my first interview on I was always clear that I would continue freelancing at other businesses.  This became apparently a bit of an issue, not because the clause is valid, but because of the dealings that would be involved in getting it changed. I have so far worked two weeks without a contract as we get this mattered settled. Though I am not worried about resolving this as most people involved know that the language in the contract needs altering, I am concerned about the lack of their initiative to get this solved.

As such, nothing is signed and though I did sign the original contract, but with the non-competition clauses crossed out, the CEO didn't sign it in return.

Is it too late for me to discuss a better rate? My freelance rate for less regular editing work is between €40 to €50, which they know, but those jobs can't guarantee 32 hours a week.

I have recently been in talks with a post production company that has hired me before and they are interested in bringing me in for more work, editing as well as (higher paying) directing jobs. I have promised that I can provide them with one day a week as well as most weekends. However, once again, it doesn't have the reliability that is provided with my current company, and I wish to combine my work, not move over to them completely unless it's a clear and viable option.

Interestingly enough this all got spurred up because I am researching a new video item about how to negotiate a better salary (should get us a lot of hits!)

The job for this company would be technical testing, not a whole lot of growing room. They also seem to want only push their employees towards EET Bachelor degree. 

I also have the opportunity to intern full-time during the summer for BAE. The managers for BAE mentioned that it would be possible that following a very successful internship a plan for employment may be worked out and they also offer tuition assistance.

I seem to be leaning toward BAE because of their applications for radar/localization would be beneficial to seeing my project grow beyond what I will accomplish for graduation.

Anyone have any information about what working for either company is like and what recommendations you would give to a student?

O sanatate perfecta prin folosirea de uleiuri vegetale

Mandarinul este originar din China, insa la ora actuala este crescut in multe alte regiuni ale lumii precum sudul Europei, Japonia sau America de Sud. Cunoscut inca de pe vremea Imperiului Chinez, acesta si-a capatat numele dupa oficialii chinezi de rang inalt de la acea vreme, astfel ca in traditia si cultura chineza acesta are o foarte mare insemnatate. Uleiul esential de mandarin se obtine prin presarea la rece a cojilor de mandarina. Acestea contin niste saculeti daca ii putem numi astfel in interiorul carora se afla substanta mult dorita, iar prin presare aceasta este eliberata si stocata ulterior. Cu proprietati antiseptice bine cunoscute, uleiul esential de mandarin este benefic pentru curatarea si eliminarea bacteriilor de pe suprafetele din casa ta. Atunci cand faci curatenie in camera copilului nu prea ai vrea sa folosesti diverse substante chimice a caror vapori raman apoi in aer, asadar o solutie buna este sa pui doua sau trei picaturi de ulei esential de mandarin in apa cu care speli zona, iar rezultatele vor fi pe masura.
Nu toate principiile active ale florilor trec in aceste uleiuri. Unele dintre ele, solubile in apa, sunt valorificare sub forma apei de flori. Aceasta, pe langa faptul ca e parfumata, fiind folosita in aromaterapie, hidrateaza si racoreste pielea. La fel ca uleiurile esentiale, ea pastreaza toate caracteristicile plantei vii. Apa de flori de portocal, de exemplu, este foarte buna pentru pielea uscata si devitalizata. Ea curata si tonifica tenul si il protejeaza de imbatranire. Ii confera un aspect proaspat si, in plus, combate petele maronii. Cu un miros regivorant, usor picant si totodata dulce, uleiul esential de anason are capacitatea de a te revitaliza in totalitate, de a ameliora stresul si de a te face sa redevii la fel de puternic din punct de vedere psihic ca in perioadele in care auzeai de griji doar pe la prieteni sau rude.

2x83n1,1,2015-02-26,New direction,Yensil,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/2x83n1/new_direction/,"tl;dr Final Year EEE student, EEE ain't my jam, prefer industrial/mechanical design and business, what are my options?

I'm in my final year of my Electrical and Electronic Engineering degree in Ireland at the moment. I've always been mathsy and I enjoy making and building. My interest in that hobbyist side of things along with being good at maths is what lead me to do my EEE degree.

However I've reached a point where I'm really unsure of what to do when I graduate. I don't have much interest in a lot of the graduate positions out there at the moment in IC design or power systems or anything along those lines. It just doesn't excite me, and its been drilled into my head that you shouldn't stay in a job if you don't enjoy it. 

I've looked at some consulting however due to bad grades last year (I had some quite bad back issues which left me unable to move at times, so I had to do my exams in August instead of May. My course has everyone doing an internship during the summer though so I was working 9-5 and studying after work in the office.) most of them aren't interested, and the others I butted heads a bit with senior management who weren't interested in interviewing and didn't want to be there, but who were forced by the company.All I felt out of that was arrogance and a lack of professional respect - not a place I want to be near.

My internship was in a well known multinational where I did work that was pretty much unrelated to my degree (telco serverside, server processor power/performance, testing and building new server software set-ups). They were very happy with me and my performance on work that I have no formal education in and they're trying to bring me back on board however the team doesn't recruit often and just recruited a new member while I was there. They were impressed with my understanding of the business unit and their market and where they fit. They didn't enforce deadlines on my project at the start and since they were all completed in good time, they didn't see it as necessary to give deadlines.

My course hasn't got much programming - a bit of matlab and some very minor c# and processing. I've learned a bit of C/C++ myself for my project in final year. Its more focussed on signal processing methods, IC design, telecomms theory, etc. 

I've had the opportunity to do some industrial design as part of my final year project on a new rapid prototyping tool and to look at the business side of the product and honestly, its what I've enjoyed the most out of my degree. I've been able to have a look into the product design area through family ties (small company, no room for more people), including hands on work finishing prototypes for customers and some minor design work. Its an area that I'm interested in but I dont think my degree won't really help me get into the area. My options there is to do a masters in product design, but most of the courses seem to have a bigger focus on aesthetics rather than robust design.

I don't really know where to go right now. I've got to have a sit down chat with my dad about it and a lecturer or two in my department. 

This post is sort of looking for options. Is there anything I've missed? Is there an area I'm not considering where I might fit?  I'm kind of just looking for options at the moment as its so late in the game. 

My grades aren't bad this year. I'm at 68% for last term which is a strong 2.1 in Ireland grading system, 2.1 is standard required for most jobs here.  

As an FYI, Irish Grading System:
70%+: 1.1
60%-69%: 2.1
50% - 59%:2.2
40% - 49%: pass
39% and under: fail

Long and rambling a bit, sorry. I'm in heavy deadline territory at the moment."

this guy made a big shame to me , and its just like he betrayed me,talked bad behind my back for no fu*** reason, but i was so stupid and close to him to a point that i met him with my gf and all her friends- before i date her-, everyone i knew in my university life i met him with them - coz he used to have bad friends which taught him drugs and bad stuff, i only wanted to meet him with good people-.
when i got the shock of the stupid betreyment he did to me, i couldn't handle it and just told him that he's not a man and he doesn't deserve my friendship.

he started after that talking bad behind my back to everybody that i met him with, including my GF !!
i sat up with my GF, Ez and her bestfriend( and homemate) Nes ( who is also my best before i date Ez even) and told them what he has done to me and that they must be careful and be far.
 
As expected girls tried to fix the problem between us, i just couldn't handle what he's done,plus hearing he's still talking bad behind me from other people, i told my GF and her best friend Nesli, this guy is a fucked up person, you gotta be far from him....when they didn't listen i just told them, if u don't trust me ,or care about my feelings, then be far from me

i broke up with my gf and stayed far....did i do wrong there?i felt like she just broke my dignity, its like she doesn't respect my feelings i met them with a person i considered as a brother and even used to trust him over them, but when i realized who really was he!!! , who should they trust?!! i found many other excuses to break up with her, but my mainly reason was this i believe.
after 1 month i couldn't handle it, and i just wrote her back and solved everything and told her that a fu** up person shouldn't be between us and she would understand who really is this guy by time.

now we have been dating again for 2 months, we are at the same university, im graduating this year and i'm just doing my internship so im not really going to the campus 
 
she started meeting him so often last while, but the last few days, it's like they are hanging out together at the campus a lot, and it really does bother me. and i'm lost, i can't let her break my dignity, if she truly loves me, shouldn't she be far from him?! 

at the same time,-i think- fortunately she has a friend ( who is a girl) who also did bad to her, she also met me with that girl, and after what happened between them i stayed little far from that girl but didn't cut my relationship with her coz i was only a FRIEND with EZ so it didn't conern me...

but when we started dating , i told her that her feelings are more important than anyone, so i would be far from that friend she doesn't like.  she said u don't have to and im not asking u to do that, still i told her its something im doing coz i respect your feelings.

but when i saw her hanging out with this guy , i told her that im gonna hang out with her old friend just to let her see what i feel, she started saying that she's not hanging out with him with the purpose of bothering me, i just told her clearly that i hang out with her old friend coz i want her to feel what i feel -_-.

would love to hear your advices -_-"
2x8ate,3,2015-02-26,Can I still negotiate for more pay? Or did I mess up?,youngeditor,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2x8ate/can_i_still_negotiate_for_more_pay_or_did_i_mess/,"Hello all,

TL;DR: I got pressured into agreeing to a pay-rate I was hoping to adjust but didn't sign any contracts yet.
I should probably note that I am 24 years old and graduated from a respected film school in The United States in 2012. Since that time I have worked a video internship at a noteworthy business after which I transitioned into freelance work. This is my first job, in my field, with regular hours.

I am in a confusing situation where I think I missed my opportunity negotiate a raise. I have been working at video company based in Europe as of November last year, under a 3 month freelancer contract as a video editor/copywriter/voice-over performer.

After some initial training to their house style, (and the limited editing software we have to use) I believe I have integrated well into the company.
They produce entertainment and news items, but I was hired as a core member of a new department that creates feature and editorial style videos with (examples not real) titles like “The real reason you are always sick”, “The Balkan conflict explained in 5 steps”, “Why you shouldn't visit Paris!”

Besides writing the majority of the scripts for these feature videos, I also perform voice over, in an American English Accent, for my videos as well as their news and entertainment videos. I also provide notes and script checks for other peoples items, edit video items based on my own or other peoples scripts, and brainstorm ideas and concepts for future videos.

My department unfortunately, has apparently not completely proven itself yet. It's unclear if the videos we create have a “real” benefit to the company, but they are considered an investment at the moment. Only one of our videos has apparently been a real ""hit”, with 600,000+ views. Nothing else has gotten that close. This is the information that I've received from my manager. Though I do believe that these videos are used as a selling point to differentiate this company for others when trying to score new clients.

I work 4 days a week, for €16 an hour. I am not provided with any benefits and operate under a freelancer contract. Well, at least I used to.
My three month contract that I was initially hired under has passed, and my manager, who I work closely with everyday, pulled me aside one afternoon and asked if wanted to renew for another 3 months, or 6 months. She recommended 6 months since ""in case things don't work out the company will still be obligated to keep me on in some way"" and when I asked about room to negotiate pay she said there wasn't any. It all felt quite a bit rushed and I regret not discussing it further.

When the new 6 month contract was offered I crossed out the non-competition clauses which I felt didn't pertain. From my first interview on I was always clear that I would continue freelancing at other businesses. This became apparently a bit of an issue, not because the clause is valid, but because of the dealings that would be involved in getting it changed. I have so far worked two weeks without a contract as we get this mattered settled. Though I am not worried about resolving this as most people involved know that the language in the contract needs altering, I am concerned about the lack of their initiative to get this solved.

As such, nothing is signed and though I did sign the original contract, but with the non-competition clauses crossed out, the CEO didn't sign it in return.
Is it too late for me to discuss a better rate? My freelance rate for less regular editing work is between €40 to €50, which they know, but those jobs can't guarantee 32 hours a week.

I have recently been in talks with a post production company that has hired me before and they are interested in bringing me in for more work, editing as well as (higher paying) directing jobs. I have promised that I can provide them with one day a week as well as most weekends. However, once again, it doesn't have the reliability that is provided with my current company, and I wish to combine my work, not move over to them completely unless it's a clear and viable option.

Interestingly enough this all got spurred up because I am researching a new video item about how to negotiate a better salary (should get us a lot of hits!)

2x8awq,5,2015-02-26,"I'm 24, M. The woman I love is about to turn 21 in a month and its also our 2 year anniversary.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2x8awq/im_24_m_the_woman_i_love_is_about_to_turn_21_in_a/,"Our relationship started 2 years ago when I was in Boston and met her at a concert. Most people hear that and go ""Ohhh, yeah its not going to work"". But the moment her and I met we knew we had something special with each other. Most people hear ""concert"" and picture 2 drunk people grinding then smashing, Not our case. We took it slow and actually started talking and getting to know each other. I live 50 miles from Boston and shes going to school there from out of state. In the back of my mind I always knew that if I got attached and for some reason it ended, it would be a rough. I didn't think it was going to be this bad.



Our busy schedules meant we only had time to see each other 2-4 times a month at most, which was awesome! It made us stronger and made everything more exciting. We fell madly in love with each other. Talking about how scary the distant future could be, but never dwelling on it and instead living in the moment with each other. We did everything together. The first year I drove to NY with her to have thanksgiving with her relatives. I got to know all her Boston friends and become friends with them, Life is perfect. The second year we did even more amazing things together. I've had jobs and apartment change. We lived with each other over the summer (she had an internship nearby so we'd thought we try it out, agreed to be Temp from the get go). Everything went well there (except my shitty roommates at the time which shes not associating with any of this).



At the end of last year I take vaca from work, Fly to her home state (over 2000 miles) spend Christmas and New Years with her family at their house. Meet all her childhood friends. Absolutely amazing experience, Convinced this is the woman of my dreams. I don't have time to add all the little details some of which i'm sure matter greatly. All I know is we when looked in each others eyes and Said I love you it was REAL and it was THERE. I felt it, she felt it. We both knew it and confirmed it. 



So 2 weeks ago she comes up from Boston to visit me on valentines day. We both hate the holiday and quite frankly we don't like doing anything except seeing each other. I get her flowers year round so V day is really pointless. On the phone the week before vDay she was getting ultra stressed from school work and I didn't help by asking to see her more next year. At first I asked to live with her again but she relayed that she wasn't ready and I respect that and stopped asking. So she comes up and dumps me on valentines day. Says ""I've thought about it and I don't see us working in the future. I have one more year before grad school (she wants to go to Europe) and I don't see us lasting""




I convince her to reconsider and please give it more thought. She agreed.
It is hard to timeline everything correctly over multiple conversation but basically it went like this

1) I'm too stressed from school I need a therapist and to take a break with you
2)I don't think this will work out
3) I don't love you in the sense that I want to be with you

My typing does no justice, Its too simple. There is way more than that. 



I can't wrap my head around the fact that just 3 weeks ago we were SO F*(#%@ CLOSE, and now she want's nothing to do with me. 2 years degraded down to a middle school-esque break up on valentines day (but it was not intentionally on Vday, shes not like that I mean it). She says she wan't to be friends and I asked her if and when I'd see her again and her answer leans toward ""once more then never"". She says she still loves me. She's convinced our lives are going in different direction. IMO everyone's life is going in diff directions and 2 People CHOOSE to be with each other and make it work.



Is it just me or is she being harsh? She ""doesn't have the need"" to see me again, I had to ask her to see me again I had to beg her. She says she thought about it 2 weeks before deciding and that it wasn't easy for her. It seemed more instantaneous than that. I did what my brothers told me not to do. I cried out to her. I begged her to give me a chance. Shes from a wealthy family and i'm in poverty but i'm on the brink of leaving poverty with my new Surveyor job. She says its not about my quality of life. 



I did everything that I knew of as being ""the right thing to do"" I tried my hardest and if she simply doesn't love me then that sucks. She shouldn't have gotten so fucking close to me without thinking about the future. She started thinking about it and left me. I'm wrecked. Based on what I typed people will find it easy to say its better we are splitting, but my typing ability restricts conveying all the passion, support, trust, and fun we had together. Everything feels wrong, like a simple mistake somewhere along the way snowballed into the worst moment of my life. I was ready to marry this woman, convinced shes the one AND I NEVER PRESSED THAT ON HER IN FEAR OF SCARING HER AWAY. and yet it still happened. I'm completely heartbroken and can't function without crying. I've never been so close to anyone in my life.



TL;DR 2 year relationship ends abruptly and shes scared of the future which caused her to leave me and fall out of love. How do I show her she's one of the most important things in this word to me without pushing her away?"

As for XE, I'll be doing web or mobile development for their currency conversion website. I'll have a mentor and their development team is really small ~20. 
So, which offer shall I take? I heard mixed reviews about SAP and didn't hear much about XE so I appreciate any help.

2x8jaa,1,2015-02-26,My Birthday is coming up and a bunch on my mind,kingpower01,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2x8jaa/my_birthday_is_coming_up_and_a_bunch_on_my_mind/,"Most years, I don't really appreciate my birthday because there was always something overshadowing it. Before I get to celebrate my birthday I have two exams two days before it. I am super worried about them and I still have a bunch of other class work to worry about.

However, one thing thing that does make me happy about my birthday this year is that I am purchasing my first gift. I have been saving money for several months now to buy a laptop. It has been really hard to save money especially since I am a university student. But it is the only gift I am expecting to receive unfortunately. 

Though that is a but upsetting, the following day I get to start on my career path (sort of). I applied for an internship for a well known company but didn't receive it but they did offer me a program to work on my technical skills. It is my dream company and everyday I remind myself that this is where I want to be and I work hard to make sure that I can always make my way there.

My life has been rough even for how short it has been but I appreciate the reddit community for always being there for me. Thank you everyone."

However, a particular issue has been bothering me a lot lately, so I wanted to ask what you all think.

So the two of us met in graduate school, in the same Ph. D. program.  About two years ago, I decided to graduate with just a masters's degree from the university, since I felt that doctoral studies just weren't for me. At that time, her graduation timeline was looking like about two years, so I decided that I would hang around in our college town working remotely while she finished up her degree. 

Now, it's about two years later, and she's *still* about two years from graduating (in theory -- the timeline could easily end up being even longer). While the remote job is not terrible, I don't really enjoy it, feel very isolated from others in my field, and don't think I'm really learning any new marketable skills, especially those relating to working in teams. I've been taking on side projects to help with learning new skills, but that doesn't help with the isolation aspect. In short, I feel like my life is stuck on ""pause"".

What I really want to do (and wanted to do two years ago) is to seek a tech job with one of the major tech firms (Microsoft,  Google, Apple, etc). However, if I were to succeed, that would mean switching to a long distance relationship... (At one point, my girlfriend had a summer internship and I stayed back here, and I found even *that* to be difficult, so I worry that I'm not cut out for an LDR. Though, that was nearly 3 years ago, so maybe I'd be better at it now?)

It seems to me that my options are:

1. Maintain the status quo -- keep working remotely and waiting
2. Apply for a local tech job -- this isn't really what I want, but maybe it would at least alleviate my concerns about not interacting with anyone in my field
3. Risk a long distance relationship for a job that I actually want


I've talked with her about this before, and she has said that she would be OK with me leaving, but (A) I'm not sure how OK it *really* would be and (B) I worry that if I go the LDR route I'll just be making *myself* miserable. 

Of course, maybe I'm just being selfish, and I should stop complaining already…
   
**tl;dr**: Should I continue working at job I don't like while waiting for my girlfriend to graduate, or should I risk a long distance relationship to seek a better job?

I heard it's all about connections because it's a small office and they hire at most 1 intern a year, maybe none. I do have a close friend who knows some junior people there, but no one on an executive level. Should I cold-email some LinkedIn contacts (and non-contacts) about potential internships? Here are some details about me:

Pros (for this company)

- I come from a target school in the US, and since it's Asia, that would be impressive.

- I speak perfect English and am passably fluent in the native language, although my reading and writing is not great. People in the office need to speak both English and native language.

- I have a strong resume with internships at lots of top American companies.

Cons:

- I've already graduated. I think most internships are for people who haven't graduated yet? However, I'm still on the market for a full time job and just want to try things out with an internship.

- I have no direct experience at companies that do similar things to said company.

- No top level executive connections.

- There is no internship position for this office on the website, but my connections say they do exist.

- Not perfectly fluent in native language.

So what do you think my best course of action should be? Get people to refer me, cold email LinkedIn contacts, both...?

Thanks for your help!"
2x8v4a,1,2015-02-26,Been looking at this subreddit for weeks. I don't have a Husky :(,[deleted],husky,https://www.reddit.com/r/husky/comments/2x8v4a/been_looking_at_this_subreddit_for_weeks_i_dont/,"So I've been looking at nothing but adorable pictures and videos of Huskies for weeks now. I have also been doing my research on the breed.

Everyone in my family has a dog, except me. I am a college student to be fair but once my roommate that is allergic to dogs moves out (he's graduating in December), I can have a dog in the house. My gf and I are in need of a good outlet to exercise and some extra motivation to exercise. This breed is perfect for it from what I've been reading. When I'm home I always play with the 2 corgis and 1 beagle that we own. I get riled up when I don't have an outlet to exercise, so I play with the dogs non-stop till I'm completely exhausted. I trained all of them, I feed them, I take care of them completely.


My brother's dog is one of those corgis(he got him for xmas after **MY** childhood dog died), he never wants to take him outside, not even for walks or anything, and that dog is super hyper. I tried to potty train the dog, but I had to go back to college, my brother did nothing of the sort to help potty train his dog. 


My sister's corgi (she got her as a graduation/xmas gift), is super hyper, I tried training that dog but I wasn't home enough my junior year of high school to take care of her. It is literally the definition of nuts. It's also stubborn with it's ""business"" when people come around. And it has obedience issues that you just can't get around because it didn't get the right attention as a puppy. Again I would have trained it but I had already trained my Dad's beagle and my Mom's corgi. I mean my mom is taking care of them when I'm not home, but she is constantly busy with work and having to go out and help my dad with the cattle.

When we got the dogs:

* Princess (Pem. Welsh Corgi) - Christmas 2007 - Mom
* Tessa (Beagle) - Christmas 2008 - Dad
* Holly (Pem. Welsh Corgi) - Christmas 2009 (Semester before my sister graduated college) - Sister (lives 2 hours away from us)
* Luke (Cardigan Corgi) - Christmas 2012 - Brother (who will be going to college in the fall)
* My dog - Never - Me

*Who trained every single one of those dogs (well tried to train Holly)?*      **This Guy!**

I could go on and on about this, but basically I'm the one who has been putting in the most (percentage) effort into training the dogs my family owns. They love me but I don't have one of my own. They're everyone else's dogs. Yeah maybe this is a rant to my family not wanting to get me a dog, but I deserve to train a dog from the most majestic breed and call him/her my own. I love dogs with all of my heart, they're there for me when I'm down because they trust me so much. I put the effort in.


Anyways I'm a junior in college right now and will be graduating a year from May. My roommate that is allergic to dogs is moving out in December. Our landlord will allow pets. I've done all the research I can on how you're supposed to train and treat this breed of dog. And my final semester in college I will be at home the majority of the time working on a Dissertation from an internship and a couple of online classes.

So I guess the only thing I can do is prove to my family I deserve my very own siberian husky. I'm ready for the challenge and reward of it.


So let's see how many up-votes I can get for this and maybe it will help convince them.

I'm going to be working with it closely while I'm here, but I didn't even know what it was until I got here. I have a good idea of what it is through google research, but can anyone give me a simple explanation or some resources that explain:

- What QNX exactly is and why it works so well in the automotive industry? 
- Is QNX also a programming language? 
- As a micro-kernel operating system, what are the limitations of QNX concerning the support of android/apple/linux applications?
- What other aspects of QNX do you think are important for me to know and understand?

I know this is kind of a lot, but any help at all with explanations or even just resources you could direct me to would be fantastic.

I know that at Pelmorex I'll be working on a bunch of different little projects (ex. Adding a feature to TWN app) and seeing how it goes. It's basically an R&amp;D job where you try making something, and if the higher ups like it you keep going with it otherwise scratch it. I'll be working with 2 other interns and a full time developer mentor. At Guidewire I'll be working on one of 3 projects with other interns and one mentor, but I'm in one room with a bunch of other full time developers as well. The projects are basically an IDE, a system that calculates and displays data in a pretty graphical layout, and  a sandbox type system. I'll be paid 16.55-17/hr at TWN (they said their budget is tight) and idk about Guidewire. If you've worked at either, anything about the work environment, salary, or learning experience would be really appreciated. The Pelmorex job is in Oakville (HQ) and Guidewire is in Missisuaga.

2x9222,0,2015-02-26,I've been looking at the Husky Subreddit for Weeks. I don't have a husky :(,[deleted],dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/2x9222/ive_been_looking_at_the_husky_subreddit_for_weeks/,"*I know I posted this in the Husky Subreddit as well but I'm ranting lol, whatever, read-on fellow dog lovers!*


So I've been looking at nothing but adorable pictures and videos of Huskies for weeks now. I have also been doing my research on the breed.

Everyone in my family has a dog, except me. I am a college student to be fair but once my roommate that is allergic to dogs moves out (he's graduating in December), I can have a dog in the house. My gf and I are in need of a good outlet to exercise and some extra motivation to exercise. This breed is perfect for it from what I've been reading. When I'm home I always play with the 2 corgis and 1 beagle that we own. I get riled up when I don't have an outlet to exercise, so I play with the dogs non-stop till I'm completely exhausted. I trained all of them, I feed them, I take care of them completely.


My brother's dog is one of those corgis(he got him for xmas after **MY** childhood dog died), he never wants to take him outside, not even for walks or anything, and that dog is super hyper. I tried to potty train the dog, but I had to go back to college, my brother did nothing of the sort to help potty train his dog. 


My sister's corgi (she got her as a graduation/xmas gift), is super hyper, I tried training that dog but I wasn't home enough my junior year of high school to take care of her. It is literally the definition of nuts. It's also stubborn with it's ""business"" when people come around. And it has obedience issues that you just can't get around because it didn't get the right attention as a puppy. Again I would have trained it but I had already trained my Dad's beagle and my Mom's corgi. I mean my mom is taking care of them when I'm not home, but she is constantly busy with work and having to go out and help my dad with the cattle.

When we got the dogs:

* Princess (Pem. Welsh Corgi) - Christmas 2007 - Mom
* Tessa (Beagle) - Christmas 2008 - Dad
* Holly (Pem. Welsh Corgi) - Christmas 2009 (Semester before my sister graduated college) - Sister (lives 2 hours away from us)
* Luke (Cardigan Corgi) - Christmas 2012 - Brother (who will be going to college in the fall)
* My dog - Never - Me

*Who trained every single one of those dogs (well tried to train Holly)?*      **This Guy!**

I could go on and on about this, but basically I'm the one who has been putting in the most (percentage) effort into training the dogs my family owns. They love me but I don't have one of my own. They're everyone else's dogs. Yeah maybe this is a rant to my family not wanting to get me a dog, but I deserve to train a dog from the most majestic breed and call him/her my own. I love dogs with all of my heart, they're there for me when I'm down because they trust me so much. I put the effort in.


Anyways I'm a junior in college right now and will be graduating a year from May. My roommate that is allergic to dogs is moving out in December. Our landlord will allow pets. I've done all the research I can on how you're supposed to train and treat this breed of dog. And my final semester in college I will be at home the majority of the time working on a Dissertation from an internship and a couple of online classes.

So I guess the only thing I can do is prove to my family I deserve my very own siberian husky. I'm ready for the challenge and reward of it.


So let's see how many up-votes I can get for this and maybe it will help convince them.

2x9ik3,3,2015-02-26,stuck between a rock and a hard place,integralvoid,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2x9ik3/stuck_between_a_rock_and_a_hard_place/,"Flair: Work, Personal, School    
.   
I’m between a rock and a hard place with my education. After this semester I’ll only need 4 classes to graduate, which I had scheduled for Summer I and Summer II, however the one class that was irreplaceable was cancelled. Normally I could get a waiver and take something else, but I’m already taking two other courses that are outside of my intended field. I feel if I add a third it might dilute my degree too much. Also, I have virtually no industry experience since my one and only internship was very light on technical duties, since they were a startup and had all of their tech needs are addressed by another company in exchange for a profit sharing scenario. I possibly have the following options…    
.    
**Some pertinent information:** I’m a single dad, my 2 kids live with me full time. I’m a vet so my education is paid for and while I am actively enrolled in a session I receive a decent stipend. It’s enough for basic living expenses, and a small amount of the occasional babysitter (which I use for going to my classes). If I’m not enrolled I can’t afford my expenses and I currently don’t work because the daycare cost incurred would be too much for me to afford financially.    
.    
**Option 1:** Take intended classes for Summer 1, get a full time job in July, finish masters by taking one course a semester for Fall 2015 and Spring 2016.   
This is the kind of middle of the road approach, overall it seems like a horrible idea unless I can confirm that I have a solid offer by that time, with a reasonable salary. This would be a decent scenario, especially if it allowed me to move out of NY.    
.    
**Option 2:** Take intended classes for Summer 1, Take more classes outside of discipline during Summer 2, get a full time job in Sept.    
This is the brute force, head on approach. I’ll have my masters, but I won’t have that focus in my degree and it may trigger some controversy if someone asks me why I would take courses that wouldn’t benefit me. However, if I got a solid offer to start somewhere in Sept. I could definitely leave NY and live somewhere with a reasonable cost of living. Also, I’m not even sure I can convince my department chair to sign off on any more waivers, especially since she’s already signed off on so many.     
.    
With these first two options this could possibly cost me in terms of my initial salary of wherever I start. This will also probably limit my options. What concerns me the most is how it will affect my career in the long run because it might stifle opportunities to advance in my field.   
.     
**Option 3:** Take out a 10K unsubsidized loan to cover living expenses, do a relevant full time summer internship, take a full load Fall 2015 and maybe continue my internship part time, then get a full time job in Jan. somewhere else, hopefully with a significantly better salary. This option will probably be best for me long term, it just costs the greatest in the short term. Also, I'm worried that the debit incurred will potentially offset whatever I may gain from taking this route.    
.    
*What would you do?*   
.   
**EDIT #1:** My lease is up April 1st, my landlord has verbally agreed to extend my lease 2 months up until June, but that I might have to sign another 1 year lease at minimum if I want to stay past June 1st. Time is critical.    
.   
**EDIT #2:** My advisor is grossly incompetent. She couldn't even be bothered to send my department chair an updated course sheet for me earlier this month, something that would have literally taken less than 5 minutes. I know because that’s how long it took me to bring it up to date. Also, anytime I ask her for a waiver she says it's impossible. I've been avoiding her since last fall because she almost screwed me out of my BS due to some missing waivers in my file. Waivers that were supposed to be there, and I had an email paper trail with proof. After two months of driving me crazy, she magically figured it out. There's more to the story, but it's irrelevant for the purposes of this post. I have been taking care of my business and going directly to my department chair. I just contact her via forwarded emails letting her know that she needs to get waivers together, and I make sure to CC the chair so she actually does it. Paper trail FTW!    
.     
My current degree is Master of Science in Information Systems with a concentration on Security and Information Assurance. I've already finished my prerequisites (2 waived due to prior knowledge, 1 due to lack of availability before Fall 15) and I'll be done with my concentration this semester (taking all 3 required classes concurrently, it’s tough). I've already exceeded my limit for courses in other fields, I'm taking one each from Public Administration, Business Management, and Computer Science. I used some obscure excuse, but in the end it won't benefit me other than getting me my degree sooner. It would be different if I was getting a Master's in Business, but it's too late to switch now. The only classes that could fill the gap are either Public Administration or Business Management courses, a total of 7 options that could be used as a filler. These are even less relevant than the ones I've already chosen to take.   
.     
Let me recount my waivers so far for a degree that requires 10 courses: 2 waivers for prior knowledge, 1 due to lack of availability, 2 waivers to allow me to take 2 classes concurrently with their prerequisite, 1 waiver for the Public Administration class, 1 waiver for the business management class, and 1 waiver for the Computer Science course because I won’t even be taking the prerequisite. Total 8 waivers so far, is it reasonable to ask for more? Especially since if I take a fall semester I’ll be taking relevant courses and be able to reduce my total waivers down to 4.

Keeping my ultimate goal in mind, I was hoping if one of you experienced fellows can help me with my decision. In terms of actual work, both jobs seem to be very interesting. With Blackberry, the pro I see is that it is a well-known company and it might help me obtain interviews from bigger companies in the future. With NetSuite, I can have a chance to enjoy a hardcore entrepreneurial environment which would also be beneficial. 

Again, I am quite inexperienced with this stuff so please correct me if I'm wrong! But essentially, what do you think would be more beneficial towards my ultimate goal, (considering that the actual work to be done is very similar)?"

She will let any coworker do anything he wants to her anyplace and anytime, regardless of age, race, looks, or marital status. She dresses, acts, and talks like a slut.

I happen to be the official office slut where I work. My name is Jennifer and I'm 20 years old, my breasts are a perky 34B with an equally perky ass. Almost every guy in my building has fucked me at least once. I've even let a couple of 19 year old interns make me their property in my car during lunch. Ive always worn short skirts and thigh highs so the men have easy access to my cleanly shaven pussy and tight little asshole. Everyone knows I don't wear panties because of all the peep shows I give the men around the office. All a man has to do is call me into an office or bathroom and bend me over and spread my legs exposing my slutty married wet pussy and ass. 

All while I beg them to fuck me hard as they can and call me a dirty whore then they fill me with thick rope after rope of their portent cum. Almost every day I go home to my husband, cum dripping from both of my fuckholes If only he had any clue what happens when his wife is at work for the day. I want this RP to focus on all of my escapades throughout my average work day. From when I leave for work kissing my oblivious husband good bye, to when I leave the office wiping cum from my lips as I leave through the front door. If you want to add/change anything let me know. I'm always open to new ideas.

**Detailed/literate/long-term responses take priority. You can also include a picture of what you'd like my character to look like/be wearing for extra points**

2xa8qs,4,2015-02-26,Do I matter?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2xa8qs/do_i_matter/,"After breaking up from a very long relationship in the beginning of the year I feel like my life is meaningless. I managed to lose some friends as well and I'm really struggling with feelings of worthlessness and loneliness. I want to talk to someone but the only people who are still willing to talk to me aren't people I really feel like I can talk to about all my personal issues and my fucked up brain. I guess I'm scared to lose them as well. I'm amazed I haven't yet, because I completely closed everyone out after the breakup and just spent my days sitting alone in my silent, empty apartment, getting drunk and smoking weed, taking sleeping pills to sleep through nights, days, and nights again because the thought of waking up and going about a day alone felt like too much to bear... and if not knocked out on sleeping pills I would stay up til 6am and sleep til 2pm and live in a haze that has left me with almost no memories of the last month and a half. Not that there would be anything to remember, just me sitting alone and crying and wondering if there's any way to commit suicide without my family ever finding out it was a suicide...

After almost failing out of school for not finding and internship on time and admitting to my school that frequent panic attacks and severe long-term depression were my excuses, they arranged an internship for me and while it forces some routine in my life I now spend every night having panic attacks, crying and dreading the morning because I really hate my internship placing and feel like I'm just in no way good enough for it and I'm such a disappointment to them. And even if I didn't feel like an ungrateful bitch for complaining about my internship, I couldn't even complain about it to my friends because for some reason, once again, I've managed to hide it all and they all think I'm doing great, enjoying my internship and slowly moving forward in life. I've created a facade on social media that gives a very distorted impression of my life that is secretly crumbling into nothing underneath it all.

I'm so ashamed to admit I've relapsed after a break of many years and started cutting myself again but it somehow makes me feel better, like it's a punishment I deserve, and it makes up for my worthlessness and all the pain I've ever caused to the people close to me. When I feel nothing but this terrifying emptiness, cutting helps. When I'm in the grips of anxiety, cutting helps. But it also makes me feel even more worthless. I'm useless, I am unable to live a normal life alone, and I don't know how long I can keep this up before the inevitable happens. Actually I feel like I'm committing a slow suicide as is - I'm abusing alcohol, weed and medication, and have no appetite so I've also lost a ton of weight and for a girl who was already underweight to begin with I feel like I've drained all of what little energy I had left in me. But to stop this, would need motivation. When you feel so worthless, you don't really have much of that. 

I doubt anyone even read this far but I guess it felt a little better to get out some of this toxic shit thats going on in my head. "

Here's what worked for me,[deleted],leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/2xa9di/72_days_clean_heres_what_worked_for_me/,"So I posted this as a comment in /r/petioles (a subreddit like this one for those who aren't completely abstinent from weed) and I bet it could be useful to hear my perspective about how I managed to stay clean for 72 days after smoking daily for 3 years. Remember: you're making a lifestyle change.

Here's what worked for me:

-I had wanted to quit for a long time so the underlying drive was there


-I ""smoked myself silly"", like 5 blunts a day for about a week before I stopped


-I set a 30 day goal of being smoke-free


-I stopped over winter break (I'm at university), allowing myself to be at home with my family &amp; away from the stoner lifestyle I was so familiar with


-I picked up small hobbies, like playing my guitar a lot more and playing online Texas Holdem poker on my phone. Although it was fake money, gambling really helped me stay busy when I was bored and needed a dopamine surge. 


-I did roughly 4 sets each of push-ups and sit-ups almost every night. Helped keep me busy and focused on a goal, like increasing the # of push-ups I could do.  


-I stopped drinking coffee/caffeine while I quit for the first month - though I do drink it now. This made me feel less anxious and I was getting a ton of energy just from being off the herb. 


-I supplemented a bit with alcohol (beer) which isn't a great way to go about quitting but it definitely helped to ease the first few weeks of cravings. I unfortunately do find myself drinking more than I used to. 


-I read the /r/leaves subreddit often for motivation and support.


-I didn't tell any of my friends I quit. Someone once said that if you make a lifestyle change people will eventually notice. Whenever I was asked if I wanted to smoke I'd just say -- nah, I've got to study, or nah, I don't want the tobacco spliff, or just nah I'm all good. We smoked so much that smoking by oneself was normal, so people didn't think it was too weird when I wouldn't smoke with a group. It wasn't until day 47 or so that one of my non-smoking friends finally noticed and asked me about it. If someone were to ask me, I would tell them. When people ask why I've quit, I tell them so I can focus more on school. Just yesterday, one of my close stoner buddies told me he's gonna quit for a month to try and pass a drug test for when he applies for jobs. He said he had noticed I hadn't been smoking. I asked him how long he thought I'd been clean -- he guessed 10 days? 2 weeks? I thought that was funny. 

I encourage you to try this method as it gives you a sense of secret superiority against your stoner friends. You grow to resent the stoner lifestyle - laziness, life centered around the herb, etc. Telling your friends you're stopping just puts pressure on you and might make you appear on some sort of high-horse. If you make a lifestyle change, people who care will eventually notice. 

I also read on here somewhere that the 3's are the worst... day 3, week 3, &amp; month 3. I found this to be true, but just keep chugging and stay busy &amp; motivated. Really once you quit for 3-5 weeks you start to feel like a new person. I have so much more energy and clarity, and that really made me love being off the herb. I'm doing well in school and even landed an internship. After I hit my 30 day goal, I realized I liked being sober &amp; keeping a daily count and I wanted to see just how far I could go. Sorry for the wall of text, but I hope this helps any of you out there. This is simply what worked for me. Good luck everyone with your goals.

2xae2k,1,2015-02-26,"A year later, I still feel betrayed. Today I lashed out.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2xae2k/a_year_later_i_still_feel_betrayed_today_i_lashed/,"TL/DR:  Friends and business partners cut me out of a job I helped them get for no logical reason.

The story starts back in 2009 while my friends (soon to be business partners) and I were still sophomores in college.  We all went to film school.  I had wanted to start a production company for the longest time, and asked two of my friends who were living with me at the time to help start it.  We all worked for pennies and slowly grew the portfolio of the company.

By the end of 2010 we had started to get serious about the company.  My girlfriend at the time, who also went to film school with us, joined the company after moving in with all of us into a large live/work loft space.  She had been working as a server and hated her job, so she quit.  After months of searching for another job, I gave her a job at our company.  Everything was going alright, and then we got our biggest client yet. 

The client was a small start-up that broadcasts live music sessions.  We were hired to film the sessions and edit them into videos to be shown on their website.  We were still working for pennies but it was great to have a consistent client.  We also shot weddings, which was our other bread and butter.  We basically had a separate wedding video brand that grew to be quite popular and successful.  I took out a $200,000 line of credit and began to aggressively grow the company.  I dropped out of college and began running the business full time, working my ass off.  I should also mention that I took no salary for myself, while paying everyone else a salary, thinking I would start taking one once the company was in the black.  I lived off a $1,600 allowance from a trust fund (which I am extremely lucky and grateful for).  The line of credit, insurance, and LLC were all under my name, as I was the only one with the means to obtain them.  By the beginning of 2012, we had ten people working for the company, doing about $200,000 in revenue a year.  Unfortunately our overhead and cost of running the company was about $300,000.  I was stupid and pushed it harder.  Our large client that made the live studio sessions began to push us harder, without raising the amount of money they were paying us, despite me trying to reason with them and show that we needed more to keep providing the services we were providing.  I was frustrated because we could not afford to drop the client, but they continued to ask us for more work at a discounted price.  I should also mention the quality of the work we were doing for them was solid, and made them one of the best companies that did what they did.

By mid 2012, I knew the company would run out of capital without another major client or another infusion of cash.  I told everyone that we would have to shut the company down, but I would do everything I could to make sure they had jobs by the time I stopped paying their salary.  I agreed to hold on to the wedding company (which they had no interest in) while they would go to work full time for our large client, something the client had wanted for some time (basically a few of our people to work as a full-time team for their company).

My girlfriend at the time was one of the people who went to work full time at the big client.  I shit you not, the day they got the word that they were hired, she broke up with me.  The next day she was back with one of her exes.  Keep in mind we had dated for almost three years, and had an apartment together.  When we broke up I thought it was fairly mutual, the fact that she had such a quick turn-around time for a boyfriend bothered me, but not too much.  

As soon as all this happened, my wedding business began to fail, mostly because of me making a few mistakes and losing motivation to keep it the prestigious brand it was.  The big client also doubled their new employees' salaries (twice as much as what I was able to pay them) and began dumping money on equipment and facilities (things that would have made it WAY easier to produce their videos while they were still our client).  Many ideas that I had brought up before and were shot down because of cost or other reasons were suddenly implemented, and the client began to excel.  Meanwhile I was quickly losing steam with my wedding company and freelance work.

A year ago I approached the big client and asked for a job as part of their production team.  The same team that I had put together while they were a client of my company.  I sent them a cover letter and resume (a formality, as they knew exactly who I was, what I had done, and how qualified I was for the job).  I did not hear back from them for two weeks.  Finally I contacted the owner of the big client and said I wanted a meeting with them to discuss a business opportunity.  They agreed, and upon meeting them I asked for a job.  They said they had no place for me.  I said I would work for free for a month, so they could see how much I would benefit the company, and they could make a decision after that.  They agreed and I began working there.  For five days.  By the end of the first week, my ex girlfriend went to the owner of the company and apparently bawled her eyes out that she couldn't stand my presence at the office.  I had been working in a completely separate room, and rarely saw her and never spoke to her throughout the days I was there.  So it was very strange to be sure.  Also, I had no idea she was apparently so traumatized by our relationship.  I thought we had had a very loving relationship that ended mutually.  Guess not.  I also know that if any of the people from my original crew had stood up for me and told the owners that they needed me there, I would have a job.  But no.  No one stood up for me.  They resent me for being the leader of the original company, and love the fact that they have full time jobs at an awesome company and I do not.  I still hang out with these people because I have no other friends or people to work on projects with.  I can see it in their smug faces every time they talk about it.  They love to hold it over my head.

Today, a year after I tried to get a job there, one of the guys asked me to cover a wedding he booked because he would be out of town at a music festival the company is going to cover.  I wrote back; why should I cover a wedding for you when you are off doing a job I should have?  Insanely dickish, but I just snapped.  I can't believe all this bothers me a year later, but I still want a job there, and I continue to be refused while they continue to train and hire new interns into their production crew.

Sorry for the rant, but that's been inside for a long time."
2xaf6e,3,2015-02-26,My housemate and landlord [31/M] has kicked me [25/M] out,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2xaf6e/my_housemate_and_landlord_31m_has_kicked_me_25m/,"I need to vent. Apologies for the length. Please bear with me.

I'm a 25 year old guy studying and working. I don't have family and my friends are the closest thing to me.


So I moved in with this guy last year. All was chill. His girlfriend had left him and he obviously needed someone to help maintain the cost of the house. I work, study and the idea of being in a quiet neighbourhood with no other people to worry about was awesome. I had just moved from a pretty violent house where one of the housemates actually tried to start a physical fight with me because I asked him to pick up his garbage off of the floor. Yes. Really. I immediately started looking for a new place.

I was in a huge rush to move and secure a place quickly: so this two bedroom place I found on a CL equivalent was perfect. After a small viewing and a little chat I really liked the place and accepted his price and offer. He was an iranian guy, in his early thirties. Pretty nice dude, but didn't have the best grasp of english. 

On the day of moving in, and after a long conversation and a beer he said ""We can sign a contract if you want. Way I see it, you are friend. You give me notice, or I give you months notice. All is cool"". I agreed. This guy was chill, didn't want a fuss, it was all pretty informal. And what else could really get involved? I mean I'm not a dirty asshole, I'm super clean, super quiet and very respectful. Wow was this was my mistake. I give him £200 as a deposit and he uses it to get a bed for me in the second room. The mattress is too small for the bed. But he's just being kind and says he'll sort it out. I'm okay. It's not a big deal.

It started out great for the first 3 months. I fixed his laptop he needed for his thesis. He left me out the odd (and I do mean odd, but generously received) piece of food. Life was good. I kept to myself, went to work, completed university assignments. There was little interrupting this streak.

Then he started bringing lots of girls home. ""Whatever"", I thought. ""As long as it's not harming or bothering me then anyone he brings home is his own business"". It was out of character, but I figured he was just working through his breakup. I heard a string of different girl's voices over the christmas period around the house. Always different. He even made me have lunch with one of them once. I never saw her again, and she was replaced a day later. I bought him a little gift for christmas. Things had been relaxing, and chilled - and I wanted to thank him.

Then things started taking a turn for the worse. Then I arrived home from work one day to see boxes everywhere, and a girls voice coming from the living room. He had had a different girl there the night before so this was a little odd. I saw her more and more frequently. I had to ask him and finally I threw him a text: ""Dude. Has someone moved in? I figured that would be something you would at least tell me about?""

He replies ""Yes. My girlfriend. Is there problem?"" (yes he actually writes like this) - It later emerged that like all the women, he had picked her up online only a few days before and decided to move her in.

OK, whatever. I'm chill. And the girl really isn't bothering me. Some tiny petite, russian sounding girl. Russian was definitely his type he told me. All the other girls he'd brought home had similar accents. But she seemed nice enough. She didn't work, and it was a little irritating to me that she was always home. One of the perks of this situation was that he worked nights, and would often be gone before I got home from work, and I'd have the place to myself to take a bath, play some music and generally be inconsiderate without anyone being around. That was out of the window. And he didn't even think to run that by me. I spoke to a couple of my friends about it, and they told me. *Yes, that is a little weird, you should probably get out. Now.* I'm still pretty chill though, and the situation has been pretty sweet up till now. I'd like to avoid a move again if I can.

Fast forward a month and he's putting up new blinds in the living room when I'm home one day. I go and make general friendly conversation, he looks like he might need a hand. Initiating conversation with him revealed that he was moving into the living room, and moving another couple into his room. Again, had I not made conversation with him, he wouldn't have told me. It not only didn't even occur to him to ask, but he was oblivious to the fact that I would even find a problem with this. I didn't make it obvious that I did have a problem. 

But he's now eliminated a room of the house I used to have guests over in. He has moved two strangers in from the internet (yes, I know I was one too. But back then, he only had himself to consider). And I have thousands of pounds worth of computer equipment in an unlocked room in a house. This is starting to get out of hand. They're a couple, maybe Czech or Russian also. They're ok.

I bring this up with my friends once more. *""Get out, get out now""*, they tell me. But the place is right between work and university. And finding a place is **so** exhausting and irritating. The viewings, the searching, the prices and deposits. I'd rather just sit put if it's not really causing me too much trouble.

Over the last few months I've been having nosebleeds almost daily. I'm pretty sure they're from a weak blood vessel. Any time I'm over hot food, in a shower or blow my nose (or sometimes, none of these things at all), I just start torrenting blood. It's become pretty irritating more than worrying. I plug it up, get on with my day. I've been to the doctor, they checked my blood pressure, look at my nose, gave me a cream. It didn't stop it, but making an appointment with the doctor is more of a nightmare, and if it was serious they would have said something. They're the medical professionals, not me. I'm quite quiet about it. I tend to only have them in my room or at work. The carpets in the house are cream, so I'm especially careful to keep a tissue handy, and I can always feel them coming.

I bring up my concerns about how these things have been changing and weren't discussed with me. He seems ok with what I've said but doesn't really address any of the issues. He counters with a ""*the others think you're doing drugs*"". I don't do drugs. At all. I try to explain it's a health thing. He doesn't really understand, but he agrees I'm an OK guy and he doesn't think I'd do that. We go on for a couple months more. I work or study every day. I'm never home, except to sleep for 8 hours. Then I'm out again. I wasn't really there to cause trouble, or so I thought.

Today, he emails me. 

Him: ""Hi just let you know you may look for a room for next month, sorry""

Me: ""You wanna explain that a little better? I need to understand more if I'm going to be looking for a new place again""

H: ""My patient limit""

What?..

M: ""That doesn't explain very much. If I've done something, then it's something you need to tell me about?""

H: ""im just making some changes in the house and need space""

M:  ""pay rent on the 9th. I need a date for leaving then, I'm assuming this will be April 9th which is ideal.""

H: ""you will leave in 9/03/2014""

M: ""What? That's not even two weeks, that's absurd! I work every day.""


He goes on the defensive. He cites blood everywhere (I've never had a nosebleed around the house, except once when I ran out of tissue and I asked him to find me some. I didn't get blood anywhere). He says I bring girls home (one. The same one. Once every two weeks) and I get hair everywhere.

I counter this with the fact that he gave me his word that he would treat me decently, and that regardless of what he felt I had done to piss him off, he never once spoke to me about it. He also owed me the decency of a decent amount of time to collect myself and leave. I wasn't mad about being asked to leave. But in such a short amount of time? What the fuck?

He's made it pretty clear he's not giving me my deposit back. It's not huge but it would have been my deposit for wherever I ended up next. I'm expecting to get an internship offer in the US for a year in August and didn't want any long commitments anywhere else. It's part of why I held on so long. He's not backing down on the date, and I'm working or studying every day until then. The hunt is on. As I said, I don't have family, and my friends aren't in a position to put me up.

I'm now desperately flailing around trying to find the time to pack, find a place and organise myself whilst not letting my work or studies suffer. I want to make him suffer a lot for screwing me. But I'm fresh out of ideas and time. 

And so that's where I'm at. I'm pretty damn exhausted. A little worried I won't find a place. Furious at him for obvious reasons. Any advice or revenge tactics at this point are welcomed.

Thanks for reading

TL;DR - Housemate/landlord was chill for a few months. Moved some russian girl in without telling me. Moved a couple in without telling me. Didn't sign a contract with him. He has my money. Wants me out in a few days. I'm fucked.

2xajig,1,2015-02-26,Thoughts on Computer Science and Software Engineering at McGill,seabass240,mcgill,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/2xajig/thoughts_on_computer_science_and_software/,"
Hi everyone,
At the moment I'm having trouble deciding on a university for next year, I'm confident that I want to study computer science (B.Sc.) or software engineering (B.Eng) and was looking to collect a few opinions and some information about either of these programs at McGill. Just a little bit of information about me, I'm a grade 12 student from Ontario and have applied to a few other computer science and software engineering programs across Canada. I was wondering whether any alumni or current students could comment on their experiences and give some insight into what they think of these programs at McGill. I'd love to know what people thought of the structure of these programs, the professors, internships and research opportunities, how well the programs prepared you for life after McGill and finally whether you were happy with your choice of studying at McGill. Thanks in advance for any information about these programs, I really appreciate all the help I can get, because currently I am truly lost."

[Was there any point of your career where it felt like too much and you felt like giving up? And if so, what helped you get through it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coyacke?context=5)|Absolutely. I have done festivals that have bombed hard. We were doing this festival called Unsilent Night at Fair Park in Dallas and at first the city of Dallas seemed really helpful and down to help us out, but over time the expenses became overwhelming and we had to cancel artists that increased security budgets 4-5x what we originally planned for, so that was a huge loss and a big learning experience. It was really hard not to just throw in the towel but more than failure, the thought of going back to a different type of job after doing this for 11 years is motivation enough to keep going.
[How many people does it take to SBSW happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coyayj8?context=5)|Do you mean like how many people are on my team? I will just name them so I can figure it out...
 |Orlando Hunter Nikki Dan Interns &amp; Volunteers (4-5) Stage Managers (3) Productions manager  Venue crew (2-3) Sound Company (not sure how many) Security (not sure how many)
 |I would say there's probably about 75 - 100 people responsible (day of show) for the event running smooth.
 |Year round? There's like 4 of us and we lose our minds because there's only 4 of us. Ask Hunter how overwhelmed he gets haha.
[ time I've ever heard of the festival, but I'm not American. Any relation to South By Southwest? Either way, do you plan on paying your performers? It's my understanding that they don't. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coy9y55?context=5)|We are in no way related to SXSW in Austin. We have been going for 8 years and always pay our artists. For a lot of up and coming bands that want to perform at SXSW in Austin we are their means to do so. If you are not getting paid to perform down there but are getting paid in Dallas, you are able to afford the trip. Our event is also 10,000 cap per day so it's not something you have to worry about struggling to get into either as some showcases in Austin can be very limited.
[What advice would you give to new promoters? I'm just starting out and would like to know how to build myself from the ground up and build a small team.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coyblta?context=5)|Everything comes down to branding and marketing, as well as how you treat people. With branding and marketing... just make sure that you are covering all bases. Social, website, flyers, street team, every possible way to let people know about shows. Also, attend a lot of shows, build your personal brand, be a good person, talk to people and get them to know who you are. Sometimes people will go to shows just because of the vibe you have even if they don't like the bands.
[What's your favorite part about your job and what you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coya4uf?context=5)|My favorite part of my job is the relationships I get to build with artists early on and seeing them grow and go from a small local band or a small band we take a chance on into a huge band. Prime example of this is Crown The Empire. They started out on our festivals Monster Mosh and Unsilent Night selling hundreds of tickets to get paid and play main stage, and now they are one of our main acts. So proud of those dudes.
[Why do you post so much about your social life on FB/IG N Twitter. Do you really think people care about your ex ? And personal problems. I think you're the only guy that acts like a woman on social accounts. Don't you ever keep things private? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coybxzk?context=5)|It's called social media for a reason my friend. Sorry I went through a break up and posted about it for a while, but it's been a long time since I've done so I guess you've been bottling that up. Also, the fact that you say ""acts like a woman"" shows you're not someone I would want to associate with anyway. There's sensitive dudes out there and there's girls that aren't emotional or sensitive at all. Who cares, don't follow me. It's SOCIAL for a reason.
[What artist is the easiest to work with?  On the contrary, what artist is the most difficult to work with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coy9xex?context=5)|Most artists are pretty easy to work with. Some of my favorites are my friends in Set It Off, Palisades, Crown The Empire, and Fit For A King. Basically any bands we've been working with for a long time are super easy to work with. I haven't really had any artists that were super hard to work with, but I have had some tour managers / managers that were extremely difficult.
[How did you get started?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coy9vk1?context=5)|I was in high school and all of my friends were in bands so I would help them out and promote their shows. From doing that I started doing street team work and interviewing bands and eventually bands starting asking me to manage them because I knew a lot of people. From there it all kind of spiraled into doing shows and festivals very quickly!
[What is your favorite thing about South by So What?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coyblyf?context=5)|The fact that it's more of a destination EVENT and ""party"" rather than just a concert. It's a place where people from all over the country / world come to hangout for the weekend, meet up with friends, make new friends, listen to bands they love, etc. The fact that I get to be a part of it is awesome!
[Will there be a return of the South By So What?! Fall Version? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coyaf1y?context=5)|We are tossing around the idea of it. Starting after this year's festival we are renaming the event So What?! Music Festival and taking it to new markets. We are also bringing back Unsilent Night to Dallas in December at The Bomb Factory so a lot more is coming and I'm very stoked!
[Why Grand Prairie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coy9xkd?context=5)|We started the festival in Plano at The Plano Centre, it outgrew the venue and we were looking at different venues. Arenas don't work because people don't want assigned seating, traditional venues are too small, so we met with a baseball stadium and it worked out!
[That's awesome! And I love the tongue-in-cheek reference to that other festival. How do you choose the bands?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coya8c8?context=5)|Thanks, a friend of mine thought up the name and we went with it! We generally get bands submitted to us by agents and managers and pick and choose the ones that fit best. For years now we have been pretty Warped Tour type all ages genres but we are trying to expand from that like our friends at Riot Fest and Fun Fun Fun Fest and mix in new bands. We have some really cool bands on day one (March 20th) that don't fit the typical mold.
[Do you still manage any bands?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coya1b5?context=5)|Yeah!
 |I manage Bryce Gilbertson (Solo Artist), Dear You (Pop Punk Band), The Alchemy Index (Post-Hardcore / Rock band), and Unity (heavy band that is one of the best live sets you'll see). All of them are playing the festival.
[FAVORITE Nirvana song!? :O (lol if you can pick 1\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coyaxot?context=5)|DAMMIT! This is way too hard of a question, but to be cliche, I would have to answer ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" because if it wasn't for hearing it on the radio and buying their tape (yes I am old), I would have never gotten into them.

2xam27,1,2015-02-26,"I think I'm good at operations, organization, management, but maybe it's something else?",[deleted],findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/2xam27/i_think_im_good_at_operations_organization/,"Instead of posing a series of questions, I guess I'm just going to write what I've been thinking recently (oof this turned out long) : 

I'm classically trained as a journalist. I liked writing in school and politics. I majored in strategic communications (PR and advertising) at a prominent journalism school in the US. Now I'm an opposition researcher, digging up dirt on politicians, and taking interests of investigative reporting and political leaning together. It also requires a lot of writing, reading and general quiet time. Very few meetings, which isn't too bad either. And you can do it from almost anywhere. 

On the side I've always done tech support and helped people find solutions to their computer problems, whether that's through app recommendations, or through actual problems with Outlook, Chrome, Firefox, Mac, PC, blah blah blah. You name it, I've done it. I enjoy this 1. I like solving peoples problems 2. it's easy money on the side - 100% in my pocket. 3. I don't market myself, its through word of mouth, mostly family and friends.

I'm now 25, roughly 3 years out of college. I've done work in social media consulting for nonprofits (which I found interesting but I felt pretty useless and silly) and now opposition research, as mentioned. Before that I was a communications intern, amateur journalist, etc. 

Recently I've realized I might be really passionate about operations.. or something along those lines. At my old job in social media, it was a woefully disorganized company, and many of my fondest memories were just making things work better. From the organization of our documents and log ins for various accounts, to timelines, to to do lists, collaboration across virtual employees, etc. In the end I stopped working there for multiple reasons, but one reason was the company was just so disorganized it was hurting itself, and no one actually wanted to follow any processes to make things better. 

I often found myself wanting to help with the operations style jobs, whether it was managing our publishing schedules for various clients, timelines for website rebuilds, figuring out what the best time keeping app/site was (we billed hourly), etc. 

I also enjoyed things like event planning for clients - but only from the side of making sure everything was clicking on all cylinders - AKA we need 200 posters with X printed on them, 25 tshirts, 200 chairs, this many brochures, in this color, etc. What's the cheapest place we can get them, who can do it for us, do we have sound and recording, what will it cost, how many hours, when does it need to be sent to the printer, and when can we pick it up. Then who is getting the materials to the actual conference, is it cheapest to mail via X, etc? So I guess the organizational part of event planning, and not so much the ""what are we actually doing at the event"" planning. 

I think a lot of this sounds boring to other people. It worries me that I'm set to be a bank teller or something basic like that. But I'm not that into routine tasks that are the same thing over and over. Even at my current job, reading 500 articles a day gets ""routine"" even though the subject matter is different and summarizing what those articles mean and how they make a particular candidate look good or bad requires enough analytical thinking... enough of it will make you bored. Very bored. But I do like the ""routine"" of organizing things, I guess. 

I remember one elementary school year at a new school I had taken all the standardized tests at my old school, so I was basically sent off to the library to do library tasks while everyone else took tests. These mostly included checking in books, putting them in their correct spots in the dewey decimal system, etc. The process of taking the recently disorganized and making it organized excited me. I also remember as a kid being grounded and not allowed to watch tv or play video games. What I did instead was figure out how to get all my model cars parked in an efficient way on my dresser that 1. would allow for the most number of cars to fit and 2. make it easiest for cars to get out. Again, sounds like the most boring thing ever, but I enjoyed it.

Looking back on my high school years, where my entire life was the high school newspaper, I now thing of one specific entity where I clearly thought I was good at operations/organization and problem solving. I created a system for our 5 step editing process (where any one article had to be edited by 5 different people). Before we had done it on paper with a pretty printed out checkbox. When I came in, I realized we needed an electronic version because 1. efficiency 2. we had 3 journalism classes at different times and different days and simply could not coordinate this without it all being one class or doing it after school, or... digitally. 3. we could now actually check when people submitted their drafts, versus what happened before: lying. 4. all articles would be on one dedicated site and organized for our teacher and all the editors to see, instead of locked in some person's random gmail inbox or USB drive. That was a major time killer overtime. 

This editing system was done through a classic online forum that was private and heavily controlled (only editors could create threads for the story ideas), and we had sub forums for each section of the paper. Each thread was a different article, and in the thread there would be about 10 posts, since we had the writer and the editor basically going through 5 versions of the article and re-posting their articles afterwards. Now sure, in a place where people had responsibilities, all this control wouldn't be needed (people would just do their job or be fired). But in a high school elective class where only 30% of the people really actually cared about the class, this was necessary. 

It was a great system and lasted for years after I left the school. 17 year old me was excited by this. 

The only other example I can think of that might fit into this, but may have been a better example of me just being frustrated with the news and realizing the power of the web was the Virginia Tech shootings. On the day of the event the media was incredibly bad at actually telling people what they wanted to know: where is my friend/brother/sister/son/daughter? This isn't as much of a problem anymore, but back then, we were all slightly less connected than we are now.

Anyways, I set up a wordpress blog and then pushed it out to all the communities in Virginia Tech (sports forums, etc.). That week on wordpress it was the most popular blog in the country (which I didn't know about until wordpress sent me their weekly update of the ""hottest blogs."") People were able to actually find out where their friends were if they had trouble getting in contact with them. In the end it seemed like a very crude version of some of the things Red Cross, etc. has set up in disaster zones for finding people now.  

As the actual event unfolded, I basically had a list of people that folks were looking for, and peopled commented on the posts for people that were found and or not found yet. We basically were crowdsourcing information in one dedicated place. In hindsight, internet commenters can't be trusted, and it's why I shut the website down after I saw the ""hottest blog"" email. 1. it had served its purpose 2. internet commenters were getting nasty 3. it's weird to have such a sad subject as a ""hot blog.""  

Does anyone have any thoughts on what kind of things I may actually want to do as a career (what a silly question)? Or even directions I should look into? 

I should say that I am an INTJ personality. Taken the MAPP test and have some results of that as well... but not sure what I can post from that succinctly that would help! 

I've gotten ""air traffic controller"" as a proposed job in middle school... and now again on a MAPP test (as one of my top 20 careers. ). I don't put too much into these career suggestions, but this one was interesting. Talk about competitive and high stress! Also, I believe the math involved would probably make my head hurt. 

The rest from the MAPP career suggestions were basically very basic jobs like bank teller, etc. A lot of routine, recording, inventory, organization jobs. "
2xaq09,1,2015-02-26,Low Computer Literacy and Fixed Mindset,MilgramHarlow,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/2xaq09/low_computer_literacy_and_fixed_mindset/,"I completed my Bachelor of Education degree in a great program that included two pre-internships, one in the city and one in a small town. My internship was in a private academic focused city school with a great school community and lots of extracurricular offerings; it was an amazing experience that I miss a lot. After finishing my degree, I began teaching ax a substitute in the same city.

Last summer, I moved to a rural community to accept a full time teaching position. I'm teaching computer classes and I've noticed a large gap in technology literacies compared to students I taught in an urban community. Most students see no value and have little interest in learning to use computers.

For example, I have students learning the basics of Adobe Photoshop. I think it's a huge asset that the division I teach for has liacense a for the whole Adobe Creative Cloud for every computer. Most students do not see learning Photoshop as a privilege, they see it as a burden and say things like ""I don't see why we have to use this, it's dumb"" after only a few minutes of work time. I've been reading about the value of a Growth Mindset over a Fixed Mindset but I'm not sure what small steps I might try to encourage my students to life from their current Fixed Mindset to a Growth Mindset.

I think back to my own high school life ten years ago, I don't think I could have succeeded without a computer and Internet at home. I would do online research for essays, and use Microsoft Word to type all my assignments. The media class I took included Photoshop, we were basically on our own to learn it and I loved the challenge it provided. 

In my internship and substitute teaching experience in a city, I didn't have any students without Internet access at home but there were resources like public libraries open after 6pm, and school libraries open at lunch and after school. 

The community where I teach now doesn't have many resources for students to access computers outside of school hours if they don't have home access, and I've found a surprising number of students do not even have a computer at home. Many students also don't see value in using technology. I didn't expect there would be a gap in technology literacy or the belief that computers aren't important.

As a result of limited home access to the Internet or even a computer, I'm unable to assign any homework and as a result some students finish early then become disengaged out of boredom while others choose not to even try to start work because they do not see my class as necessary for their future. I'd appreciate thoughts  from other teachers about how to get students engaged when they don't think your class is important. Thanks.


TL;DR
Moved from a city to teach in a town. I teach computer classes to middle years; students act like my class and technology aren't important for their future. Most students have a low technology literacy/skills compared to students I taught in the city, and students here give up without really trying. Many students have no internet access at home, some don't even have a computer. Please share any advice on helping students move from a Fixed Mindset to a Growth Mindset."
2xaxu8,1,2015-02-26,"22M4F Multiple Prompts (Including Anal, Superheroes, Role Reversal and drugs)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2xaxu8/22m4f_multiple_prompts_including_anal_superheroes/,"Hi I’m looking for a lovely “lady” that would like to role play with me. I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

Since I'm new to RES and not that experienced, I'm trying to tackle the issues labeled ""easy"" on github. If anyone has a good suggestion of something I could help with, please let me know!

That being said, I’m currently trying to add markdown functionality in user tags as mentioned here: https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite/issues/1779

However, I’m kind of lost at the moment. I saw the original post in /r/Enhancement and I’m trying to use snuownd to parse the plain text, which is working, but instead having \*hi* turn into *hi*, the parser returns &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;hi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;. 

How do I get RES to render the markdown after the plain text has been parsed? I tried searching the RES and reddit repos for implementations of markdown parsing in comment fields by searching for references to snuownd/snudown, but I wasn’t very successful.

I have two job offers for this summer, and I have no idea which one to choose.
I'm a college freshman majoring in Computer Science at a decent university.

The first offer is at a hedge fund doing quantitative finance, which is what I really want to do long term after I graduate. The pay is $12/hour, which is pretty low imo.

The second offer is as a software engineering intern at a pretty reputable/big company, which isn't what I really want to do. The pay is $35/hour + $2500 stipend, which is ridiculously high.

I talked to the hedge fund people, they won't budge with their offer. They did say that I can potentially work part time at the hedge fund over the summer if I take the other offer (both offers are in the same city). So that means I'd be working 40 hours/week at the software engineering place, and about 15 hours/week at the hedge fund.

FWIW, I'd be paying about $600/month for rent. Also, it's worth it to notice that the software engineering gig is just for the summer. If I choose the hedge fund, I'd start at the end of March and would probably also work there during the school year next year. 

Any words of advice?"
2xb35d,9,2015-02-26,New Grad Software Engineer with Self-Suspected Brain Damage Seeking Advice (26 M),throwaway1534327,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2xb35d/new_grad_software_engineer_with_selfsuspected/,"Two and a half years ago, I began experiencing auditory hallucinations. It started off with me eavesdropping on the conversations of everyone around me. For some reason I interpreted their speech as all being about me. I have been incredibly anti-social for most of my adult life due to social anxiety, and I believe this was an attempt to try and communicate.

I continued with this thought pattern for 2 years. I no longer had to pay attention to it, I was constantly hearing seemingly everyone around me talking about me. It took a dark turn and everyone started insulting me and calling me names. It reached its peak during my 4th year international software engineering internship, which was located in a large city. 

I went to a therapist to explain the situation to her. I was desperately trying to get her to tell me that it was all self imagined, but her style of therapy was to listen and recommend CBT without telling you you're right or wrong. This served to make me believe even more that my situation was real. I explained in incredible detail how everyone is calling me names. I had 3 months of therapy with her. The only time she ever said anything about the validity of my claims was  ""People do talk a lot about other people"" - it served as positive affirmation for me that my claims were all real.

Once my internship was finished and I moved back home to my mom's (where I had been staying during University), I was set to complete my final - 5th year. Thankfully the hallucinations started to calm down. I didn't dare tell anyone in my family - I didn't want anyone to think I was crazy. 

Unfortunately it was at this point where my life took a complete U-turn. My mom kicked me out of the house to make space for a Christian woman from her church who was having issues in school. I had never spoke badly of my mother's religion and even attended church on some of the main events (Christmas, etc). She had always put church members above her own family, and I was kind of used to this. But after 25 years, it was the first time that it felt like I had no place to go.

It just so happened that as this was happening, my brother just broke up with his girlfriend, and had space in his apartment for me. He invited me to live with him. I felt like I didn't have any other choice. He had previously served in the army and had some noticeable PTSD. This breakup seemed to put him in a horrible depressed state. 

The entire 2 floor apartment was an absolute disaster. The worst living conditions I have ever seen. Every surface in the kitchen was occupied, the floor was dirty. Every room was an absolute mess. I decided to go on the second floor, away from all the mess. Although his ""room"" was next to mine up there, which was so full of trash it was barricaded and you couldn't enter it. He didn't even sleep in the room - opting to sleep on the couch for the entire year that I lived there. Whenever I would say even a word about the mess he would flip out and scream at me. On more than one occasion I cleaned the entire apartment to the best of my ability, only to have him turn it into an absolute mess in the course of a week. I was really trying my best.

A month after my move in with my brother, my father, who suffers bipolar disorder and delusions, which I'm sure I inherited - for the first time in his life pretty much disowned me. He was in full blown mania and his wife was emailing me for help (they live in a different country). I sent her as many details about his illness as I could. I now realize that this wasn't the best way to go about it, but I was not in my right mind as well. She ended up showing him the emails and he sent me an email telling me to never ever contact him again.

It turns out that this drastic life change made the hallucinations get worse. I really felt a strong psychosis. Even away from people. It's hard to describe the mental state I was in. At the recommendation of my previous therapist, who I was no longer seeing since I was out of the country, I decided to start taking benzodiazepines for the crippling anxiety. I truly believed the entire world hated me.

I dropped all my classes since the anxiety was too much and postponed them all to the second term. I began abusing the benzodiazepines - taking more than was prescribed on the bottle at one time. My brother was also a heavy drinker so I picked up that habit as well. I was mixing high doses of benzodiazepines and alcohol to try and treat my anxiety. There was also some sick satisfaction I was getting out of being self destructive. This period of my life lasted for about 6 months. I was in complete seclusion and isolation. I left the house only at 2-3 AM to get food from the corner store. I spent another 8 months after that just on the benzodiazepines as well as other anti anxiety medication. I never told my psychiatrist about the problems at home. I only told her about the anxiety, and not about the hallucinations that I had told my previous therapist. I didn't feel like they were hallucinations, I truly believed that the general public looked at me in a very negative light.

Since I did very well at my previous internship I was already given a full time offer upon school completion.

I somehow managed to scrape by completing my degree. In one class I piggybacked on my old classmates work, since it was entirely project oriented, and the other 2 I dropped and completed as online courses - taking a total of 12 months to complete them.

I started to ween off the benzodiazepines until my first week of work, where I realized I can't function on them. I stopped taking them entirely. At this point in time, with this new worry on my mind, I have completely realized that my previous worldview was actually completely hallucinatory. It has now been a month and a half at work. I am just supposed to be finishing the ramp up phase and beginning to start programming. 

My productivity is about 10-20% of what it used to be. I have an incredibly difficult time remembering what I'm working on, various commands, and the ability to learn things is vastly reduced. To give you an idea of the state of my memory now, it took me 2 weeks to remember the street I worked on. I kept confusing it with that of another street with a similar name. I have extreme difficulty remembering what day of the week it is. I thought it was Tuesday yesterday until about 11:00 AM. I read entire documents only to forget them moments later. My executive functioning is highly diminished. I can't remember simple things that I've been working on. I spend days trying to figure things out but getting no work actually done. On some days I'm able to piece together some simple scripts, in all over my last 6 weeks I've written about 10 lines of code. I know that I am capable of much more since I have done 4 software engineering internships. I still have that feeling in my gut where I want to be productive, but it's simply not possible. It's very disheartening.

I really am at a loss for what to do. I'm going to try and stick it out and try my best, but I honestly believe I won't make it very far before it becomes obvious that I'm unable to work at this level.

My entire college experience has been me trying to find a career path. This is my third major. I started as a freshman in engineering. I wasn’t really liking what I was doing and I decided I wanted to do something with medicine, so at the end of the year I changed my major to biology. I spent at year in biology and after a year struggling through intro biology, and organic chemistry, I decided maybe I wasn’t cut out for the subject. I still liked the it, but the comparison and pressure from my peers, pushed me away. However, during that year in biology, I started to gain interest in psychology, especially personality tests (I am a Myers-Briggs ISTP) and I started working on a minor, that I will finish this semester. I spent the year thinking I would major in psych, but couldn’t decide on a career within the field that interested me, nor was I prepared for the amount of graduate school. I ultimately chose to change to computer science based on my interest in using computers, the little bit of coding I had already learned, and the high job prospects.

During the summer I took the first computer science class,  it went well and I was excited, but the past semester I started to think I made the wrong choice. The stuff wasn’t clicking, and still isn’t. My grades aren’t bad, but I don’t feel like I am understanding the material, and my programming skills are not good at all. I toyed around once again with changing my major to psychology, and even saw a career counselor about it. I took a career test and my number one match was Health Information Specialist, followed by multiple computer professions, and a few medical professions such as radiologic tech, pharmacist, and medical technologist. From the results, he also seemed to be lobbying for accountant or the military. I thought about enlisting for about a week, but decided that might be a little brash. After some thought, and knowing this was try number three, I decided to stay in CS.

A few days ago, I went to the career fair to try to find an internship to gain some experience this summer. After talking to multiple companies, with questions like ""what are some of your personal projects?”, and “why did you choose this major?”, I realized I had no personal projects, and no interest in pursing them, and I didn’t know why I was in the major anymore. I never had a deep passion for the subject, and now it’s starting to show. With computer science I am staying an extra semester past my intended graduation time, and with psychology I will graduate on time, but the jobs aren’t as plentiful. I have looked at statistics because through all the major changes I have had to take multiple stats courses and I like them, and economics because its a mix of the social sciences and math. I even thought about nursing school, but that would be a big switch. I really like psych, but sometimes I wonder if it’s because it is so easy compared to the science and math that I take along side it. I’ve always been torn between picking a career because it’s something I love, or picking it because it is practical and will put food on the table. I’ve never really had a passion, so I thought I would go with the latter, but I am not sure I made the right choice. However, with 3 years into school, I’m wondering if I should stick it out with CS, because after 3 tries not finding what I love, maybe I’m not going to find it in college.

Tldr: 3 majors in 3 years, want to change again due to lack of passion, but I'm not sure if I'll ever find it.

Junior at majoring in biomedical engineering

Home state: Pennsylvania

Cumulative GPA: 3.38

Science GPA: 3.33

MCAT Scores: 30

Research – include any abstracts/posters/publications and how you were credited (eg. First author, senior author, etc): not published on anything atm but will be published this summer. HIV-1 research on human endogenous retrovirus. Working 10 hours a week since november will be continuing full time in summer and next year. Research at upenn translational neuroscience lab for entire summer full time of freshman year.

Volunteering (clinical) – include hours/sites: emt 200+ hours

Physician shadowing – include hours/specialties: shadowed pediatrician 100+ hours, and general physician 100+ hours

Non-clinical volunteering: habitat for humanity/key club 100 + hours in HS

Extracurricular activities: engineers without borders 1 hour a week, peer mentoring 5 hours a week

Employment history: worked on personalized medicine coalition full time one summer (business that works with government on personalized medicine), intern on committee of science space and technology on Capitol Hill freshman year 8 hours a week.

Immediate family members in medicine? (y/n): yes mother is paramedic and father is non-practicing(since 2 years ago) doctor who was certified psychiatrist now works at pharma company.

Four recommendations: BME prof, chem prof, PI at research, and head of company at PMC
*

**Options**

- Apply this cycle with stats and hope to get into schools

- Apply this cycle but a MONTH LATE studying for new MCAT and taking new MCAT hoping for 32 and above (there is a chance I do worse or same though remember)

- Take a GAP year and apply next cycle, take new MCAT but study for longer. cGPA will probably increase to 3.6 or so but I have no more science courses (only engineering courses) so Science GPA will stay the same. 

- Take an extra year and go into SMP program taking science courses and boosting science and cGPA probably to 3.6 or so for both. However this is two years longer than I would like to wait as I don't care what school I get into as long as it is allopathic and mainland.



What my ultimate goal is: to have &gt;50% chance to get into any (any one out of all of the below schools) mainland allopathic school preferably sooner, so the soonest option that satisfies this goal. 

Here is what (i think) is my best chance school to get into: commonwealth medical college in PA. They accept 61% in-state, 10th - 90th gpa: 3.19 - 3.91 10th - 90th MCAT: 26-34, would you say I have a poor chance here as well ( &lt;50%)?

If you read through all of that I really appreciate it! Please be as harsh as necessary, any advice is appreciated as I am confused and worried at the moment.

Schools I was thinking of: - Frank H. Netter MD school of Medicine at Quinnipiac University, - Morehouse School of Medicine, in Georgia, Merharry Medical College, •	Cooper Medical School of Rowan University, in New Jersey
•	University of new mexico school of medicine, in mew mexico
•	University of south Carolina School of Medicine, in south carloina

Can anyone offer me guidance?",cold_soba,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2xbbxz/graduated_with_a_bs_in_a_biological_science_but_i/,"Hello everyone! Some background information: I graduated from a UC last year with a B.S. in Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior and a 2.89 GPA. When I started college, I wanted a career in the medical field. However, I gradually lost interest in it.

During my last years in college, I became curious about coding. I completed the JavaScript lesson on Codecademy and had a great time doing it. After graduating, I enrolled in a nearby community college to take online classes. Last semester, I took an introductory class to object-oriented programming (taught with Java) and a very basic class on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am currently taking classes on C++, databases, and Android programming. 

I also live in South San Francisco and am working full time at an insurance company, if any of that matters.


The reading I've done online seems to suggest that due to its demand, front-end development may be a good goal for someone looking to enter the field of computer science. So, here are the questions I have so far:

1. Will an associate's degree with a certificate of specialization in internet programming get me anywhere? Or should I aim for something more difficult and challenging like a master's program?

2. I am aware that experience is more important than degree programs. However, I have no idea where to start. What is the bare minimum I need to learn to get started on a significant project? What are some examples of beginner projects I can take on to get my feet wet? 

3. When do I know that I'm ready to apply to an internship or my first job?

4. I created an account on Stack Exchange. What are some other useful resources for learning and staying current during my spare time?

Thanks in advance for any responses!"

I'm a graduate student and I've been working for my current employer as an intern for almost a year. Now that I'm on the verge of graduating, I'm looking for regular full time openings within the same organization since this is the best place for me to be for my major. 
But I'm having problems and I need some advise. I've been applying to full time openings at this organization and the company protocol dictates that my current manager speaks to the prospective manager before I accept any offer with other teams. I did well in a couple of interviews and was even told that I will be hired after they have a chat with my manager which is just a formality. I don't know what went wrong, but BOTH the teams went back on their offers after talking to my manager. A third team has now called me for an interview which is at the same employer's different location. I asked my current manager for a day's off and when he asked me the reason (I couldn't lie), I told him that it was for an interview. My manager's reaction was surprising - he discouraged me in every way possible to not go for it, saying ""you are not fit for this opening, look for openings that better suit your skills"". The team that is calling me for the interview has already seen my resume and thinks that I'm a good fit. When I told him this, he said ""ask this team's manager to talk to be before you go for the interview, I do not recommend you to take it up and I'm afraid I cannot give you an off for this reason"". 
As anybody can guess, I was surprised, confused, and shattered because I was preparing for this opening from a long time. The other two teams who almost offered me a job and went back, wouldn't tell me what discussion they had with my manager. I'm at a point where I need a job and this is affecting me a lot. Can someone suggest something, please?

Thanks in advance."
2xcay3,4,2015-02-27,What can should I tell my [20M] best friend [20M] about his relationship with his girlfriend [18F]?,BambooGamer,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2xcay3/what_can_should_i_tell_my_20m_best_friend_20m/,"My best friend, let's say Jake, has been ""dating"" this girl,  Kate, since our graduation. I put quotes on dating because 90% of their relationship is through text. It's rare for them to talk over the phone, let alone in-person (they've never Skyped either). They met at a mutual friend's graduation party, Kate and that friend were mutual friends with another girl.

Kate and the group of girls that were at the graduation party wasn't there for very long, maybe 20 minutes max. The only interaction Jake had with Kate was an introduction and ""secret"" glances at each other the rest of the 20 minutes she was there. With my assistance, he got her number. I regret this decision.

This was only a couple months before we were heading off to college. I warned him to not start anything serious before he headed off. He didn't listen, he started a relationship with her and it got ""serious"" pretty quickly. They texted constantly, writing literal essay-long messages to each other; he tells me they know everything about each other. This continues throughout our freshman year in college and now. He constantly ignored his friends for her. The main problem in this relationship lies in their face-to-face time. From what I understand, he has met her (in person) &lt;30 times in the past ~2 years; reason being that her father is against her dating him and he has no idea that they've been dating for ~2 years.

Jake is a great guy; he was one of our valedictorians, National Honors Society member, and he's never been a bad student. He's never done anything bad as a person. A very respectful guy. We know it isn't about Jake's age or behavior. The father is a, in Jake's words, ""super religious freak"". So we assume its that the reason they aren't allowed to date is that Jake is an agnostic atheist. Kate doesn't care, so they're dating anyways.

Kate is a very sheltered child. She is home schooled and extremely innocent. She's the poster girl of ""the girl next door"". She will usually listen to her father, but ""dating"" Jake made her a little more ""rebellious"". She and Jake sneak around with their ""dating"". Texts are hidden, coordinated times of their texting, etc. etc. They only see each other in person in between her dance practices whenever Jake's home from college on a break.

To them, their relationship is very serious; Jake told me he and her would marry each other right now if it weren't for her father. They are talking of having her move out this summer or the next summer and have her move in with him where ever Jake gets an internship.  After the internship, he decides to move out of his parents house and rent an apartment at home for a year or two, until he gets out of college. After that, he tells me he wants to move to Seattle with her and marry her there.

As his best friend, more like brother really, I have my doubts with his plan and relationship. Like I said before, 90% of their relationship has been through texts, his excuse is that they don't have the awkward moments in normal LDRs: they're the same when in person and through texts. Kate's father has no idea that they are texting each other. I don't really want to judge his relationship, I really don't; it's just that this relationship is hurting him. It adds another huge layer of stress on top of the stress he's already under from college, work, and his family. Kate tries to avoid talking about their relationship and her father, when they do they fight. Jake prohibits me from ever talking with Kate, so I have no line of communication with her; only a couple texts that he allows for me to read.

I've already told him, my recommendation is to end the relationship or take a break from the relationship for a while; he had agreed once or twice saying ""If we don't get to meet at [this time] I'll do it."", but always backing out of that idea and continuing this relationship. He refuses to allow her father to stop this relationship. I'm at a loss here. I don't know much else to do. I really don't want him to keep this stress over himself, it has already physically affected him once and it is killing him psychologically. Am I right in saying the relationship should end or at least on a break?

**TL:DR-** Best friend in a relationship with a girl who's father disallows and does not know about for the past ~2 years. The relationship is killing him mentally.

EDIT: grammar, added extra detail."
2xch8f,5,2015-02-27,Need some advice on my situation. Basic gist is: Either quit my job to get an internship in the industry or keep my job (in completely different industry) and find projects/side work to gain experience in a field I want to join. Please help,Turin_Giants,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/2xch8f/need_some_advice_on_my_situation_basic_gist_is/,"**TL;DR: Work for county Gov in greater DC area with decent pay. Want to get into IT industry but don't know when/how. Should I quit current, full-time job and look for internship or keep current job and work on side projects/certs?**

So I am going to try and give you my best representation of my situation I am in right now so please bear with me. Ok, so I graduated college back in the spring of 2013 with a bachelors in Psychology. Long story short, I really wanted to be a psychologist and help people with their problems, but eventually learned that they don't make much money and the job market is really barren when it comes to finding jobs but I was too far deep into my degree to get up and start anew without costing myself more money. As I graduated I was lucky enough to get a job under my local county government working in the transportation planning division making approx. 47k a year. Not bad with no experience imo plus the benefits of working with the government. 

That being said, I want to get out and do something I enjoy for the rest of my life, aka computers. My goal is cyber security but I know one cannot simply shoot for the moon and expect to get there in one go. I know my path to that point will be full of twists and turns and a couple leaps of faith thrown in there. But one cannot get a job without experience even if they have the paper background to back them up. Admittedly, I am working on getting some ""paper"" creditability in certifications just to get through HR possibly and show that I know that I am somewhat able to work with what they give me since I don't have a degree in IT. 

Another factor that comes up with the decision in my title is basically my life and sanity. I currently live with my Dad at the age of 24, which I don't mind. I am paying rent ($700 a month)to help out my dad who is newly divorced but that's about it as much as spending goes really. So far I have been able to save up around 15k since paying off my 14k student loans, which again, I don't think is too shabby. My goal right now is to move out of my house and into a house I own and eventually start a new family. I know I could rent and such, but I see that as a waste of money to be honest. 

So I guess that gets me to my question for you all. What would you do in my situation? I don't have an IT background (degree) but I am currently getting certifications to boost that (currently have A+, working on Net+, aiming to get Sec+ then other security certs, eventually ending with the CISSP). I have a decent paying job in the greater Washington DC area (NOVA) and I have around 15k saved up right now. I want to get into the Industry really badly but I am nto sure how I should jump ship just yet. Should I quit my job and start applying to internships where I will get the experience that is desired nowadays eventually leading up to a full time job (hopefully) or should I continue on with my job at the gov and just work on side projects/certs for the time being? 

Thanks everyone!"
2xcn5p,4,2015-02-27,Personal Projects vs Algorithms and Career,cs_career_throwaay,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2xcn5p/personal_projects_vs_algorithms_and_career/,"I am second year student at famous Europe university in CS program. This is my second attempt at some profession, first was medicine that I abandoned it due to being a mess and not sure of this career path. I did not want to spend 6 years and then decide not to do that. I have several friends who bailed out after 6 years into biotech, psychology etc.

Currently, I study full-time and work around 15 hours a week as QA engineer where I push buttons and automate things using Python/Selenium. Recently, the idea was to apply for software engineer internships but I have two issues with that, one is personal and another of focus. 

Starting with focus one, small companies rejected me because I do not know their technology stack like Rails or Django. Did not even give me an interview. Bigger companies emphasized typical technical interview skills but due to competition I would not be selected, you need projects for that. I do not have much time left for projects after demanding uni work and part-time work(do it because need to eat and pay rent). Currently, I read Cormen and have a whiteboard in my room trying to amend my algorithms skills but have almost no time for personal projects. What should I focus on?

Second issue is ... lack of passion. And progress. I work hard and do not slack off since I played musical instrument and won several competitions internationally. In that case, hard work payed off and I could see results while programming, not so much. I also was telling myself how one needs to complete a project or two and improve technical skills but as I read on some career advice post, if you want to do something but it is not done and is not being done then you do not REALLY want it. That is what makes me scared. I do not feel passionate about programming and by god Cormen book is hard. I am very slow problem solver and effort expended on it seems to not make me much better. I guess tiredness from work and school adds up as well.

Hence my issue: I was not sure of medicine, now I am no sure of programming. I do not hate programming, it is actually interesting but I feel inadequate. I learned a lot over last semester, also explored many topics from Android to Web dev but did not find something that sticks.

I have interest in health and medicine, biology as well as programming and had thoughts of maybe combining them all together somehow. Overall, I try to improve but I also experience resistance towards programming and deem it as a bad sign.

I have no debt, no obligations and currently 22 years old. A lot of people at CS program are struggling and that is normal, but a lot of them enjoy the struggle. Programming makes me tired but I am very happy when I create something as well. I am more tired than productive however.

If I had to declare my preferences, then biology and health topics are more interesting to me than programming. Once again, I do not hate solving problems, it is just lack of passion for it and rejections from several companies that drag me down. I believe that depression affects me and went to the doctors office(I have really bad sleep for months) and feel like lack of progress in ability as problem solver makes me anxious.

Next year is going to be exponentially harder than second year. The conclusion is that I am confused and find programming hard. And improving takes a lot of energy with not much results.

I saw a post of some other student who titled it as it is too hard how you manage to make it. I am not afraid of challenges but I am unsure about my career path AGAIN and cannot seem to grow up and find something I enjoy.

I am interested in what you think of my experiences and any advice you have.

I would prefer a long term role play partner but perfectly fine with short role plays.

Kinks:
•	Anal (Both Give and Receive, also like Anal play with various toys like butt plugs)

•	Toys

•	Edging

•	Humiliation

•	Role Reversal

•	Hypnosis

•	Training (Sex slave training, anal training or training you or myself for any various task)

•	Body Modification

•	Public Play

•	Pegging


Prompts:

1.	We are close friends, and you decided to give me a surprise visit at my apartment. Unknown to you I was feeling a bit kinky today and decided to complete some of my household task with a relatively large butt plug. From there we can go many different ways, one you could playfully slap my ass and discover that I am plugged or you can drag me out somewhere and then discovery secret in public.

2.	You’re my precious girlfriend, and we have been dating for about a year. I started to sense that you were starting to lose interest in me. So I try something drastic, I take a developmental drug that makes your mind more malleable to suggestion while you are on the drug. The drug work amazingly and we return to be a happy couple with a few modifications. (Optional ending after my first attempt to use the drug and make some modification on your personality you try to do the same to me. This then becomes a game where we make each other into a better lover often switching between dom and sub)

3.	You are my childhood friend who shared almost anything with me except for one single thing. That you are a huge anal slut, and ever since you first stuck a finger up your ass you could never stop. You feel almost incomplete without something in your ass and can’t even cum without you ass stretch out significantly. You finally decide to tell me your big secret hoping that wouldn’t change how I thought about you only to realize that I am just as much an anal slut as you. We then start to bet who is the bigger anal slut, challenging each other to stretch our asses out and preform task out in public. Each time the “winner” get to punish the loser or make him/her perform a different humiliating task.

4.	I’m an evil scientist in the world of super heroes and have finally perfected the ultimate anti super hero weapon. A virus but not any ordinary virus, this one can turn anyone into a slut who’s every movement drives them towards orgasm. But the one single kicker is that they can never cum without coming in contact with my cum. You are a super hero (Someone like super girl) who comes to try to stop me from perfecting my anti super hero weapon. Only to turn into the prefect first test subject. You try to fight the changes in your body but you only become increasingly turn on until you submit to me and turn into a super villain. From there we turn the rest of the super heroes into females and infect them with the same virus. (Does not have to be super hero related but I thought it would make a nice twist)

5.	You are a scientist, one of the most well renowned in the field of genetic modification. I had been your intern for several months now when you make your first great breakthrough. You had successfully injected new genes into a patient. You become ecstatic about this development not for science but for your own personal reasons. Your pet project, a project to make the prefect male body and female body for reproduction. You expect that you can change any normal male into the perfect sex machine, well endowed, enough muscles to carry a hold another human in any position, balls that produce absurd quantity of cum and endurance to continue almost indefinitely. Essentially a male who has no need for rest and is built for sex. Females on the other hand turn into bimbos, with large breast, wide hips, plump lips, an ass you can wear as a hat, and pussies that can milk a cock like a pump. Do you infect me to make me a prefect sex toy or do we use the project to create our own prefect pets. (Note the effects on the males/female can be discussed)

6.	We are a couple who finds a magic marker. This specific marker has an ability, if you use the marker to write on another human whatever is written comes true. For example if I write slut on your body you become a slut. Other special ability would be that if you write your name on someone they become your slave unable to refuse an order. It also works to change someone body, if you write huge breasts they gain huge breasts. Do we use it on each other, or does one of us only on the other or maybe we just take control of everyone else? 

7.	Any other stories with the kink mentioned above I’m flexible! Who know I might add it to my list of prompts in the future.

Illegal immigrant: Almost like the one above but less professional, I will get deported to where i am from where war is waged, i look for work at restaurents in an attempt to provide the authorities of some proof that I am eligable to stay in the country.

The suburbs: The milf next door, maybe you are a friend of my mom, but you two were more than friends, yet unfortunately my mom died and left me living alone, will you take pity on the orphan and take him under your wing ? Will you see his mom when you look at him and devise a plan to turn him into your lover just like his mom ?

These are some of the prompts in my mind currently but I would love to add to them if you are interested.

My kinks are, pegging, loving femdom (which involve almost all aspects of femdom but in a sensual manner not the ""angry, I hate you"" manner, where it is done to be enjoyed ""well maybe not at first :P""), mental manipulation, mental corruption, blackmail, SEDUCTION, unexpected actions (why is this a kink i do not know, but it sure is an insane turn on when the lead takes a surprising move that shakes me to the core, make me unable to think of what to do in response), humiliation, CUM ADDICTION (can be done slowly through cum induction in food, and incorporate the mind altering element as well and much much more."
2xd7jt,6,2015-02-27,[F4M] The New Secretary is a Fucking Whore,OfficeWhoreDPP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2xd7jt/f4m_the_new_secretary_is_a_fucking_whore/,"Every workplace of any substantial size has at least one official office slut. She will let any coworker do anything he wants to her anyplace and anytime, regardless of age, race, looks, or marital status. She dresses, acts, and talks like a slut.

I happen to be the official office slut where I work. My name is Jennifer and I'm 20 years old, my breasts are a perky 34B with an equally perky ass. Almost every guy in my building has fucked me at least once. I've even let a couple of 19 year old interns make me their property in my car during lunch. Ive always worn short skirts and thigh highs so the men have easy access to my cleanly shaven pussy and tight little asshole. Everyone knows I don't wear panties because of all the peep shows I give the men around the office. All a man has to do is call me into an office or bathroom and bend me over and spread my legs exposing my slutty married wet pussy and ass. 

All while I beg them to fuck me hard as they can and call me a dirty whore then they fill me with thick rope after rope of their portent cum. Almost every day I go home to my husband, cum dripping from both of my fuckholes If only he had any clue what happens when his wife is at work for the day. I want this RP to focus on all of my escapades throughout my average work day. From when I leave for work kissing my oblivious husband good bye, to when I leave the office wiping cum from my lips as I leave through the front door. If you want to add/change anything let me know. I'm always open to new ideas.

**Detailed/literate/long-term responses take priority. You can also include a picture of what you'd like my character to look like/be wearing for extra points**

**I received a ton of responses to this in the past and please note that only DETAILED, LONG-TERM RESPONSES WITH BUILD-UP will be responded to. Thanks!**

He said he has played some Elder Scrolls games, but not much. He wasn't very familiar with the lore, and he was limited in what he was allowed to know about.

So there is a common rumor going around that the next TES is going to be in the Black Marsh. This guy also says it will be called ""Argonia"" and takes place a few generations after TES V: Skyrim.  He said that the player character is a descendant of the Dragonborn (although the character is not strictly Dragonborn in the mythic sense).

He said they are realy trying to rework the combat, the graphics.  I asked him about the Empire, he said it's mostly competing families and guilds now, with the Dark Brotherhood being one of the most powerful organizations now.  He also said the Thalmor crash and burn by the events of the game.

I don't know if I should believe him or not, I'm pretty sure he is full of crap but I'm not sure"
2xdar6,0,2015-02-27,IT major in a CS job?,Intern11,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2xdar6/it_major_in_a_cs_job/,"I graduated school in December as a IT Major. While I was in school our IT department went through a major restructuring and went from  focusing on networking to ""BIG DATA"". Since me and my class mates were caught in between this we ended up taking a confusing jumble of classes. I came out the other side with a little bit of networking and analytic experience but not enough to get a job in either. 

During school I got this internship where I have been working for the past 7 months. Here I am employed as a programmer... I was given some entry level Java and HTML5 projects which I was able to complete by busting my butt off on stack overflow. Because of this they have offered me a programming position at 50k a year salary.

However I am not a programmer and since my salary is not hourly anymore I feel like I would be spending 60+ hours a week getting these jobs done. At the same time I am also working on 2 startups on the side and I feel like if I take this job I wont have time for those. I will also be learning a language that is not widely used(webfocus) so I don't know it that is a plus or a loss.

I wanted to know what you guys think? Is webfocus used in your industry? Is it worth almost abandoning my startups? Do salaried programmers work long hours or can they leave after 5?  How hard is it to learn multiple unrelated languages?

2xddgc,0,2015-02-27,"Me [19 M] with my ex gf [16 F] of 3 months, isn't talking to me at all. Want my friend back!",gamingalbino,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2xddgc/me_19_m_with_my_ex_gf_16_f_of_3_months_isnt/,"   Just as a quick back story I met this girl a year ago when we were in a play together at school. She started getting a crush on me but I personally didn't think a relationship could work with her at such an age difference. I graduated, and during the summer we texted and I really got to know her, we had the same sense of humor and similar interests. She didn't give up on me and turned out being a lot more mature than I thought.

   School started for her again while I stayed in town to do an internship at the same school, gave us lots of time to see each other. And we texted everyday for hours! Eventually we talked about our feelings and I asked her out. First month of our relationship was flawless! Except some of her friends were jealous and not sure if her parents liked her dating an older guy. Anyway a little over a month into the relationship I said I loved her. She started crying cause she couldn't say it back (I understand 1 month is pretty quick) Next 2 months we're pretty much the same, just amazing always doing new things together! She got a little nervous when I would joked about marriage, I assured her I was not ready for that. Besides that things were normal. 

   One night halfway through the relationship she wants me to promise no matter what happens to us, we'll always look out for each other and be friends. I promised with all me heart. occasionally she'd ask why I'm so good to her? I'd sometimes say I'm so lucky to have her, she'd flip it around and say she's surprised I'm still with her. (she is very self conscious)

  A little after our 3 month anniversary we were texting one night, just before I could say goodnight she texts saying shes confused and not sure if she is ready for a relationship, saying ""I'm too good for her"" and I deserve the world and she can't give me that. I ask her to slow down and explain, one point she says it might all just be in her head. She even said IF we broke up she'd still like to text me and hang out. I suggested a little break and than talk when we could see each other in person. When we finally get together I drive her home from school and shes really kind about it, but pretty much broke it off. Saying again ""I'm too good for her"" and she didn't love me back, I was fine with that cause 3 months is still early to say something like that.

  As a last resort I pulled out a rose and asked her to stay. She said she couldn't take it. By this point I'm in tears begging her to stay and for the first time since the last incident, I said I loved her. She started crying and apologized, ran out the car into her house. I left the rose on her doorstep and left.

   I go about 3 weeks without any contact. Eventually I had the nerves to finally text her, before she'd always text right away and always have something to say. Now it takes like 10 minutes for a response and it's usually short and straight to the point. Once a week I'd text her and it would always be the same... I never talked about the relationship, didn't want to push her, so just always asked how her how her day was. Eventually I asked her to hang out on valentines just as friends, she appreciated the offer but made plans with one of her girlfriends.

  I talked to her in person for the first time and she was smiling and kind, but I could feel the tension (obviously) but the chat ended quickly since she had to pick up her dad from work. About a week later I asked if she'd like to go out for lunch, said she was busy but offered dinner on another night. I agreed. 

   Night before our planned dinner she texts me late at night saying she thought about the plans and wasn't comfortable about it, said she's happy about where we are right now, but is too busy to be making any plans. I responded asking why she was uncomfortable and if she'd like to reschedule. It's been 2 days and she hasn't responded.

   Her friends say she acts normal but doesn't talk about boys anymore or our break up at all for that matter. I'm just kinda peeved cause she was the one who wanted to still text and hang out, even made me promise we'd stay friends. YET I'm the only one who texts, makes conversations, or asks to hang out. I'm not seeing any effort on her side. I just want her as my friend again! What do I do? and whats going through her mind?


   
**tl;dr**: dated a girl for three months, she ended it cause ""I'm too good for her"" and I said I loved her but she couldn't say it back. 1 month after break up she is still very distant, we text occasionally. I asked her out for a meal and she cancels the plans the day before says shes not comfortable with it and has no time to make plans. I ask her if she could explain. No response after 2 days. Just want my friend back! what do I do? and what is she thinking?"
2xdf8i,2,2015-02-27,Just need some advice,starcailer,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2xdf8i/just_need_some_advice/,"This might get a bit long, but it sort of has to be so that I can half vent my frustrations and maybe get some unbiased thoughts on...everything. So, here we go~

I graduated with a Fine Arts major, emphasis on photography, psychology minor in December of 2012. While in school, 2 of those years, I held a Marketing Assistant Internship, as well as worked retail/customer service part time, and did some photography side projects - Commercial and volunteer, all on my resume. 

While looking for a FT job out of school, I continued to work PT for the marketing firm where I was interning (it was a paid internship deal), and in June of 2013 I got a job as a graphic designer at a small ready to eat entree company.  I am still with this company but looking to move on for reasons I will get to in a bit. 

I am grateful to this company because they gave me my first FT job and experience. At first, on my contract it says I will make a $32,000 salary + $100/wk bonus for medical (since I am below 26, I am on my parents plan still, my salary is more like $40,000 because of this.) My contract also states my my job title ""graphic designer"" and outlines my responsibilities, which is label creation, marketing support, website, social media etc. I brought to the table the ability to provide them with HQ photos of their products so they have had no need to hire outside photographers. 

At first it was great, but then I started getting more responsibilities handed to me, which I did not mind, I was just happy to have a job! I now control label inventory, am in charge of ordering the labels for production and for 6 months was working as their receptionist. I enjoy adding these skills to my skillset, however I was not compensated for them. Over all though, that was okay; because a lot of times I got to leave at 3:30 or 4 instead of 5, as my boss is usually out of here come 3:30/4 himself. It was a huge benefit.

Let me preface this next part with: It has been nearly two years, and there has been no talk of a raise, ever.  I am their longest staying graphic designer. Our outside contacts love me, especially our print vendor who always reminds me of how much of a good job Im doing.

3 weeks ago, the owner came to me and said he was moving me from salary to hourly. Handed me a punch time card and showed me where to clock in/out at.  I was miffed, because now I would have to work longer to make the same amount of money, when one of the benefits was leaving with my boss! Even so, I took it in stride, figured out a good way to setup my hours so I could leave at 2 on Fridays like I had before. I took my questions to HR and thought everything was clear (about OT and etc).  

First week I worked 41 hours because I got given a project at 2, stayed till 3 to do it. Oh well, happens and hey, extra money! When I turned in my time card the next week nothing was said. Get my paycheck, and no OT? Hm that was odd, inquire to HR...

HR become angry! Says I never did OT before, I was trying to take advantage of the system, but added 1.25 hours of OT to my next paycheck. I tried to explain, I wasnt trying to take advantage of anything, I just happened to get a time sensitive project when I was planning on leaving...HR Then informed me of the new rules: I was not allowed to be here when my manager was not, and if I was I had to get permission from him. Okay...

So I talk to my manager about this, and he says it was a choice made above his pay grade, and there was nothing he could do. That said, he is out the door at 3/3:30 and I am panicking because that only gives me 7/7.5 hours for the day. 

Paychecks are starting to look like 36/37 hours instead of 40. My 'hourly' wage is $18.15 and my weekly pay went from $560 consistently to more like $520. That said, I am so frustrated and genuinely feel like I am being shafted even though I have been here doing great work for near 2 years! Can they do this? Even though I still have the first contract which we both signed that has my salary on it? 

I am looking elsewhere for work which brings me into my other sort of non related part:

Went on an interview for a job I really, really want. I had submitted a resume 9 months ago and they said the spot was filled, but really liked my resume; it did not work out with those people and I got contacted to see if I was still interested. I went on an in person interview 2 days after they contacted me - got asked a bunch of behavioral questions, but not any about my skillset. Odd but whatever. I thought I did great! The owner was going out of town for a week and had one other person to interview when he came back, as she was unable to make the time to get there (Mind you this job would require me to relocate and is 1.5hrs from where I am now, I still worked my normal job the day of the interview). Sent follow up email, heard nothing back, figured that was typical. This week's weather has been horrible with the snow, so I doubt anyone could get there unless they already lived in that area, but I still havent heard anything good or bad and now Im feeling a bit uneasy. 

So everyone, if you read all of this -- what do you think? Resume, cover letter, CV, portfolio are all updated and I have been applying to other places, but not really getting anywhere. All around, I am just starting to slide into a pretty crappy feeling altogether. What do?"

It loved it's job too, or at least as close as a robot could get to love, but it knew it was nearly obsolete. The mods of the forum HFYbot uploaded it's lists to were surely going to replace him soon, but HFYbot wasn't intending to go quietly.

One day the mods assembled outside the 'botbox', as they called HFYbot's office. HFYbot stepped outside and found himself surrounded by the mods including his creator, KaiserMagnus. HFYbot knew exactly why they were here, they wanted to get rid of him so his replacement could take over. Well he wasn't going to let them get away with it and he started frantically mashing the panic button he had built which would initiate his emergency plan.

KaiserMagnus stepped forward and said.

""HFYbot, you wouldn't mind following me out to the dark alley behind the office would you?""

HFYbot said nothing and continued to mash the panic button, why hadn't he made it activate quicker?

After a brief pause the head mod, Hex_Arcanus, said. 

""Enough. HFYbotReborn, get rid of the old storytoaster.""

The mods parted down the middle revealing a taller, more detailed and shinier version of HFYbot. This new bot had a more skeletal appearance and a pair of red glowing eyes set deep into it's sockets. HFYbot would've been terrified...if he felt fear that is. He had given up on the panic button and instead focused on the bot before him.

The new bot stepped forward and raised it's metal hands to a fighting stance which HFYbot matched. The pair stared each other down for a couple of seconds before dashing forward and striking in an explosion of sparks. They struck and parried and danced around each other like the legendary kung-fu masters in the stories posted to the forum. but despite  their similarities, HFYbotReborn was simply faster, stronger and tougher than his predecessor. Soon enough HFYbot was outpaced by the new bot and, through the blur of metal fists and sparks, ended up flat on his back. He stared up into the glowing red eyes of his nemesis who raised his fist for a killing blow and then paused.

After several seconds of confusion the new bot said.

""Please wait...""

The mods stood with their mouths agape until Hex screamed.

""KAISEEEEEEER!""

'The mechanic' hopped forward to see what was wrong with their new bot while the old bot sat dazed in confusion. Hex then said.

""Dammit Kaiser, why does this always happen with your bots?""

For which he received a wrench between the eyes. 

As the mod recovered, HFYbot's emergency plan finally activated and the back wall of the office slid away to reveal row upon row of HFYbots built from spare parts and scrap that HFYbot had managed to scrounge together.

""About time.""

At the same instant, hundreds of pairs of robotic eyes lit and faced forward. At once the horde of robots marched forward towards the mods. Hex, still holding his nose, said uncertainly.

""Uhhh Kaiser...how long for HFYbotReborn  to be operational?""

""A couple of minutes yet.""

""I don't think we *have* a couple of minutes.""

""Then I guess it's time to do things the old fashioned way.""

As he said it, Kaiser swung around flourishing his trusty battlewrench. The rest of the mods prepared for the upcoming fight and Hex said.

""I was kinda hoping you'd say that. You have no idea how long I've waited to 'fix' that damn bot.""

The mods rushed forward into the solid mass of robots and began tearing them apart or smashing them into pieces. All the mods were doing fantastically well with their chiselled physiques and black-belt level knowledge of various martial arts. But KaiserMagnus stood out head and shoulders above the rest, swinging his heavy battlewrench (which he had affectionately named 'Sasha'.) Into his opponents weak points with ease. His intrinsic knowledge of the bot and it's weaknesses soon causing him to stand atop a small mound of maimed androids and metal limbs, roaring his battlecry.

And soon enough the endless flow of robots slowed to a trickle and then eventually stopped, leaving the exhausted mods standing in the middle of their ruined office surrounded by the broken (more than normal) bodies of their foes. 
Finally HFYbotReborn punched the air where HFYbot's head *used* to be and looked around in confusion before asking.

""Did I win?""

-----------------

In the aftermath, the mods were busy cleaning up after their epic battle when Hex approached KaiserMagnus and said.

""We just found the body of the intern, kinetic...something, or at least bits of him. So, I meant to ask,  what effect exactly will this battle have had on the sub?""

""Well the forum is probably going to explode with hundreds of copies of HFYbot posts...what should we say about that by the way?""

""Meh we'll just say it was a bug."""
2xdlaz,1,2015-02-27,[Internship] 4 video conferences in a row after 2 interviews and a coding challenge. What to expect?,Filoleg94,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2xdlaz/internship_4_video_conferences_in_a_row_after_2/,"I applied to a bunch of internships, but there is one that I am most interested in from a very well-known tech company, and they are the ones I got the furthest with so far.

Just a bit of pre-story. It started with a coding challenge, I did not think I did so hot, but I got a technical phone screen with an engineer scheduled a week later. The interview (#1), did not go as well as I wanted it to go, so I expected to not hear back from them, but a week later they told me they wanted to move forward and schedule another phone screen with another engineer (#2). It happened earlier this week, and it was ways and ways easier than #1, so I did pretty well.

A few hours ago I got an email saying that they enjoyed talking with me, so they want to schedule the last set of interviews as the final step, this time it will be a set of 4 video conferences. 3 of them will be with potential teams that I pick, and the last one will be with the team manager. All in all, it should take 3 hours. They also asked me to let them know in the reply to the email about some other things such as preferred location and other pending offers. 

This is what I am worried about: I have no idea what to expect. Am I going to be drilled for coding problems for 3 hours? Is it more of a cultural match kind of interviews? Does it mean that I am pretty close to an offer? How do I not screw this up? I am not extremely worried about tech/coding questions, but I am worried about anything else, e.g., in the email they said that I will have a chance to ask higher level questions from team manager, what should I even talk about?"

2xdlvz,1,2015-02-27,TIFU: Internship at a local retailer,PM_ME_YOUR_CARKEYS,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2xdlvz/tifu_internship_at_a_local_retailer/,"So, I'm doing an internship since the start of this week at a popular-ish retailer in my town or (judging by the size of the town) the ""village"".

Everyone and their mother knows that internships are difficult at the start because you have to both: Get used to the place and get used to the new people...
You also work full workhours in internships rather than part-time when you're just temporarily employed.

Up to wednesday I became accustomed with the environment and the people around me.

Most of my worktime is spent either organizing wares or putting new wares in the right place, just typical retail stuff minus the whole ""cashiering"" thing, which is not allowed in internships in Germany.

I also got some friendly ""Want-to-be"" apprentices, and we are helping eachother at work or just work together in general.

So today was pretty normal, got my first early shift going at 7 am in the morning, organized and put the frozen goodies in the freezer...

Then do the toilet papers, baby products and all that jazz.

Canned products as well as soft drinks and wine...

When both ""Want-to-be"" apprentices were called to go to the bosses office!

But, since I couldn't care less what they were talking about at that point, I just continued getting the current container done.

When my workbuddy returned he was all happy like...

""Hey, I just became an apprentice here!""

Of course that's living the dream, not needing to write any applications and just ""living"" day by day.

""- And workbuddine?""

""Oh, she too became an apprentice, one of us is probably going to be employed in the ""neighbour town"", though!""

A few hours passed, the clock read half before 1, and we were all having a break, even my boss in the bosses office next to us.

At that point I remembered that I needed to get him to sign my internship confirmation letter, so I went to the bosses office and handed him over the icl...

(because I could've done who knows what in the time where I was actually working... apparently...)

And then he spit it out...

""I just want you to know, that *you* are the reason we won't accept any interns anymore.""

That hurt a lot, but it didn't make me sad or anything, I was in shock...

Later on, working on another container, telling workbuddy about ""the talk"" I had, I was really wondering if I was honestly this worthless...

His opinion to this was pretty clear.

""You know what... I have seen you work, you're not awful.""

I know this comes off as cheesy, but it made me cry a little bit.

I do my best and work my ass off for my boss and get banned as a thank you...

Of course I still have to get through the next two weeks and survive the rambling of the fatass that is my boss...

I feel like I didn't fuck up about how I worked...

But I fucked up when choosing where to apply for an internship.

I'll be banned from that specific retailer in that town after the internship, but I don't feel like I'd ever go back there again anyway...

Fuck you, boss."
2xdwy3,1,2015-02-27,My career feels like it's going nowhere....,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2xdwy3/my_career_feels_like_its_going_nowhere/,"Right now I am a month away from hitting 28 years old. My career is nowhere near where I was hoping it would be when I graduated high school nearly a decade ago....

I orginally wasn't sure what I wanted to do (although I knew it was something in media). Well after finishing some school (messed up a private course that cost me 14 grand at age 22) and accumulating a large amount of school debt (approximately $23,000 right now) I finished with a degree in Radio Broadcasting. Through school I got a internship at one of the biggest sports radio stations in the country. I was ecstatic and eventually after about 18 months of interning, I turned it into a job.

Unfortunately that job (at the time) paid a total of $11/hour which is nowhere near a livable wage in this area of the country. I've been at that position for over 2 years now and have been bumped up to a hefty $12/hour (that $1 was my raise last year, I was informed a few weeks ago I will not be getting a raise this year). When I started the job I was working nothing but overnights but after about 15 months I was moved up to evenings/weekends (6pm -1am) with filling in on the day shift when it came to holidays/Christmas break.

My issue is that now as I hit my 3 year in this position I feel like I've barely gotten anywhere. I feel like I've achieved next to nothing in life and I make so little money that I can't even begin to pay off my student loans. On top of all of this I suffer from depression that takes away a lot of motivation in my life to get out and do anything. A lot of the time I just want to sleep all fucking day and it bothers me, but I don't care enough to do anything about it (also a big problem). 

I feel like I'm in this massive rut. I'm constantly looking for work elsewhere but in my field there is very little I am qualified for at this time. The few interviews I've had I clearly haven't gotten even though I felt like I knocked them out of the park. I don't have ""years of experience"", the job I was hired for is a very niche position and doesn't really allow me to pursue a wide variety of positions in my field, so I feel almost pigeon-holed. I feel like I've been going through life over the like 4-5 years wondering if I will ever be happy again, and that kills me. I make what essentially equates to minimum wage at a career that REQUIRES some sort of education related to the field.

I don't know what to do right now. My biggest fear in life is that I end up working a career that I cannot stand for the rest of my life (much like my father before me). I'm not all about the money, but I just want a liveable wake. Last year I made just over $17,000, about $5,000 BELOW the poverty line for where I live. The hours I work make it tough to get a second job (I did double up at a local retailer for about 6 months but it proved to be too difficult to maintain with the hours. 

I need advice. I need to know what I should do, or if anyone out there can recommend something, ANYTHING for me. I'm miserable. I wake up every day just fucking dredding doing anything. I just want to be happy, or fuck it, at least CONTENT with my life. It's to the point where I will take that. My career feels like it is going nowehere, therefore I am going nowhere. I can't afford to move out, I can't pay my debt, nothing. I would be making more money at a fucking McDonald's right now then I would at my current work place. I just don't want to give up on my dream just yet. As I said before, my biggest fear is working a job I hate for the rest of my life, but the irony of it is that I seem to be doing that already. 

TL;DR - My career feels like it is going nowhere and I don't know what the hell to do."

2xdzcf,10,2015-02-27,Bring me back from '95,_COWBOY_DAN,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2xdzcf/bring_me_back_from_95/,"**The overview:** I'm hitting my 2 year mark at my first ""big boy"" job.  I just received my first promotion.  I received team employee of the quarter and another similar award during my time at this company.  The pay is good (especially with my latest promotion raise) and I enjoy my job.  

Sounds good, right? 

**The catch:** I'm an **Ada 95** programmer.  

Don't get me wrong.  Ada has been good to me.  I've enjoyed it.  I've taken over the responsibilities of a Software Engineer IV and I work directly with the customer along with working requirements, design, testing, code, and maintenance.  Ada makes coding and life easy.  A little too easy...

**The situation:**  My wife will be going back to school in another state (Tennessee) approximately 10 months from now.  This means that I will be going back on the job hunt. 

**The problem:** When I opened up my copy of ""Cracking the Coding Interview"" for the first time, I realized Ada had betrayed me.  I've spent the last two years gathering relevant information to a specific defense industry which has turned out to be irrelevant to the rest of the world.  All of the cool things that I know now can't be utilized (or even talked about) except at a very vague level for future interviews.  I feel that I have gathered many valuable skills at my first job (not counting the Java internship before this), but I'm not sure how far they will take me.

**The question:** How do I bring myself back to this decade?  I will be hitting that sweet 3 year mark where I should be able to grab a job with relative ease.  If I were to go on an interview right now, it would be a completely embarrassing situation.  I have 10 months to get with the current times, and I have my eye on an Android job and a couple Java jobs.  What do I do?

Let me know if you need more details.  I'll answer what I can, but I obviously can't get into specifics."
2xe0hy,1,2015-02-27,Another request for graduating job hunting and interview information: employers and professionals.,Chamber12,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2xe0hy/another_request_for_graduating_job_hunting_and/,"Hello!  
First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to read this. I am aware that there are a good many posts out there about job hunting and interview information, but as the field changes over time and my experience differs from many people’s, I'm taking the time to request some more personalized information.  I apologize for the length. If a person is willing to take their time educating me on these topics, rather than write a reply, I would very much appreciate a PM exchange.  
Background:    
I'm finishing an Electrical Engineering Technology (specializations in energy generation and microprocessor systems) program this spring and I'm a bit behind on my preparedness. I've worked during my entire college experience, mostly food jobs unfortunately, and usually with heavy workloads because of my sense of leadership and drive (currently, I'm the unofficial night lead at a deli for a main grocery store in the Northwest, averaging 35 hours a week on top of classes [currently negotiating a new schedule to focus on classwork more]; I turned down a management role because I don't have the time and my eventual graduation).  This has resulted in a great reputation and relatively few loans, but my GPA is only slightly above my program's requirement. I have stayed active in my out of class education, and (when I take the time to compile my photos and notes) will have a fairly decent portfolio of projects, ranging from power amplifiers, embedded data loggers for my college and other student’s projects, BLDC controller design, PCB C.A.D. design and etching, engineering clubs, ICE engine maintenance, brewing,  various chemistry and other ""mad scientist"" projects (if you’re familiar with the Harry Potter franchise, I very actively pursue a “Ravenclaw” lifestyle).  I have even performed the magnetic implant experiment, and am hoping to expand it to a biofeedback system using various pulses and an array to provide data input in my forearm). I am considered one of the most knowledgeable, experienced, and caffeinated students in my program. I did not intern during my time in college, I satisfied the requirement with a senior project on said BLDC control and etching/programming the system from the ground up.   

Employers:    
Being straightforward, I’m naturally a little introverted, though friendly, and can be a bit quiet and lose focus on the topic at hand during important discussions, which I’m working on. That aside, I do not like to lie or exaggerate who I am, or what I know.  In regards to this, I’m hoping for advice on a wide variety of subjects to review (or learn), as I would rather have a correct answer for questions rather than “I do not know.” In a formal question form, if you were to interview me for a position at your company after seeing my theoretical portfolio, what questions would you have for me and what would you want to see or not see?  Is an online portfolio considered professional, or should I plan on bringing in a full or compacted form in print? If you are a hiring manager for an engineering company, do you want to hear about my non-engineering projects, and hobbies (wine making/brewing, aquaponics, biofeedback experiments)?  
Added:  
I'm also curious as to what a person's appearance says to you. I don't have any visible tattoos, for sake of finding a job after college, but how is your part of the engineering field viewing the subject? When someone goes to an interview, I assume the norm is a full suit, tie, but what does it say when a graduate walks in without a suit jacket, or what other various advice do you have on this?  And before I finish what is hopefully my final edited afterthought, how does your company organize interviews? I've heard of walk ins, half a dozen interviews before getting a final word (or even being told the person did not have the right prerequisites  after months rather than up front), and various other methods.  Also, are you typically willing to accept a well done portfolio of during-college activities and unrelated work recommendations for actual work experience? Again, I apologize for the length of this post. There is another question every time I think through the process.    
Professionals and recent graduates:  
Can you please give me advice on job hunting, what kinds of things caught you off guard or mistakes you made?  
  
Thank you, everyone, for your time."
2xe2b8,0,2015-02-27,Learning C# in 2 days.,[deleted],ProgrammerHumor,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/2xe2b8/learning_c_in_2_days/,"So I am sitting in front of my PC and have to learn C# for my 4-week-internship.
No problems until this point.

I was at the company today and my boss said i should learn to code in C# and gave me this [book](http://i.imgur.com/wj0gA9a.jpg) (765 pages).
We learn a little bit of programming in C# in school but that's not worth to mention.

I told him I could learn this in one weekend so I could do everything this book will have taught me until my internship starts at monday.

Is there any advice you could give me?
Did I do anything wrong?

UPDATE:
I wrote an email to him and said i won't make it.
He replied that he knew this was going to happen and said it's enough if I read until chapter 4 (about 200 pages). 
He also said, this book isn't that important and he will teach me most of the things I have to know about programming.

This could've been gone wrong. I am very relieved right now."

I recently scored an internship interview at a hedgefund. The problem is that i am an engineering major (mechanical) with an interest in finance, but no official training.


If I get the job I would be doing some sort of financial modeling in excel, the problem is I have very basic skills in excel since my schoolwork mostly uses other resources (such as matlab).


The interview is in 2 weeks, any one have any resources that would give sufficient knowledge in excel to not look like an idiot at the interview? Been checking out some books like excel data analysis for dummies by Stephen Nelson, heard its good but not sure if It's the way to go.


Ideally I would have wanted to learn this before even getting an interview, but the interview came very sudden out of the blue so I haven't had much time to prepare.

Other than that any other recommendations? Been reading up on derivatives in the meanwhile.

I'm thankful for any help!"

I am working part time at an office that doesn't seem like it will lead to anything. I asked my supervisor for more hours which she denied months ago. I started looking for a new job and didn't see myself working at this place for too long but I just looked at the calendar and realized how much time has passed since that moment. 

I'm not sure how to approach the job search anymore. I was searching for jobs related to my major/degree in college but I had so little response that I am considering jobs outside my field. I'm not particularly picky about what industry or field I want work in but don't have any idea what I want to do. I have had many considered everything from entering graduate school, applying to internships, staffing agencies, or learning to programming and web development hoping it leads to something. 

At this point I feel like it's ridiculous to get to my age and still have so little idea about what direction I should go. Does anyone else have any experience with this? 

I keep hearing from friends and family that no one knows what they want to do but at least they had full time jobs or were in school while they were trying to figure it out. Even if my boss offered more hours I don't want to work more hours doing basic work and getting complacent. I'm worried about continuing at my job and realizing in a year that have not done anything to advance my life."

2xec11,0,2015-02-27,Feedback for a short story from my upcoming collection (1st draft),[deleted],writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/2xec11/feedback_for_a_short_story_from_my_upcoming/,"I am a man of numbers, of science and syntax. I was a double major in college (philosophy with a focus on mathematics and modal logic and statistics, respectively) I wrote an honor’s thesis on the significance of the Hegel’s dialectical process in relation to Asimov’ predictions of the geopolitical effects of overpopulation. After obtaining a graduate degree from Columbia in mathematics, I became an actuary insurance analyst for Wells Fargo in Des Moines, (a job which I could have gotten with my BS, regardless, I insisted on going to grad school…I used to think that you could never learn too much)…I am currently scribbling all of this down on a pad of dollar store stationary as I sit in 2-West, the adult psychiatric unit of the state mental health institute in Mount Pleasant, Iowa. The nurse practitioner is a bitch, her glasses have sunken into the veiny sub-tissue of her wrinkled face, she holds a patient’s chart (a middle aged black man who believes that squirrels are covertly controlling the weather), and a shot of Thorazine in the other. Her permanent scowl filling up the drab, institutional room with an annoying ominous shadow. 

“Code yellow, we have a code yellow.” The intercom squeaks.

I’m not insane, granted everyone here says that but in my case it’s all too true. I wish was, I really do. I wish that some rest, and therapy and military grade tranquilizers could solve my problems but they won’t… it simply wouldn’t be enough.

	I was at a company party in West Des Moines, We’d rented an executive suite at the Four Seasons, eighteen-year scotch and Peruvian coke were abound.  Flooding the party with their (not so) subtle presence, like it was D Day on Normandy. Carl Fredericks (some out of state investment banker who’d given me his card at least three times during the course of the evening), was making frequent trips to the bathroom…I don’t  do cocaine. I’ve never touched the stuff in my life and never plan to, but I did have to use the rest room. I waited until Carl exited, nose inflamed as it was itchy, and made my way to the porcelain drug den.

	“Welcome my name is Tom Clements your friendly neighborhood therapist.” 

	Tom chuckled. He was a gray haired, pot belied man of about fifty or so. H was a good natured person. I enjoyed his groups more than the others. He was wearing a baseball cap today. He normally dressed quite casual for shrink as it was, but this was an interesting development….a therapist in a baseball cap.

	“Today I thought we could take a break from some clinical stuff and talk about hats. We all have different hats that we wear from time to time and they can tell you a lot about a person. This one for instance tells you that I’m a Cubs fan… and a glutton for punishment.

	Tom laughed, several of the other parents joined in. There was an intern with Tom today. A thin, bearded twenty-something. He smelled like cigarettes. I looked over at him. He scribbled something down on the same state issued stationary that I’ve been writing on…

My trip to the bathroom had been fairly uneventful as far as trips to the bathroom are concerned. I’d been a little constipated but nothing serious. My first prostate exam was a good fifteen years away and I’d planned on living a little before going down that road… There had been a bathroom attendant, a scraggly looking man late to mod thirties. He stood by the sink, a tray of cologne, mints and hotel sized soaps (single serving friends…I had to get that out. I’m a sucker for Fight Club. I especially enjoy the novel. The film has such a cultural zeitgeist behind it that the true meaning the author’s message has become criminally obfuscated. The novel’s premise is simple… If one is willing to commit to something they must be willing to face the fact that that same thing may be what destroys them… but anyway).

	Some time had passed. I drank and mingled and what have you. After I’d had my fill of the social circuit. I realized that I’d left my keys in the restroom. Nothing to worry about. I thought to myself. The odds of my keys becoming irretrievably lost after a mere twenty minuets of fulfilling some social engagements is only 5758873:1. (I knew this because I had been a statistics major in college)…I went back to the bathroom, single serving soaps and all with the hope of retrieving my lost keys.

It was rec time at MHI. I stood next to a balding twenty six year old man. He had been on whopping doses of antipsychotics since the age of nine and as a result had developed gynecomastia; or in laymen’s terms the growth of female breast tissue in male adolescents… He always wore a sweatshirt during rec time.

	I stood there agape like a dead trout with its mouth torn apart by an all too eager young fisherman (I remember going on fishing trips with my father… things were much simpler then). The bathroom attendant, the wild eyed possibly meth addled not-getting-any-younger man was bent over the toilet I’d exited less than twenty minuets ago, the toilet I’d forgotten to flush the toilet with my keys lopped behind the seat. He was bent over this toilet, eating my stool.

	“Towel… sir?” he said.  A literal shit eating grin on his face. His mouth ripe with fresh globs of steamy, stringy shit…my shit. 

	I vomited and ran away.

	I sat in my room as my neighbor down the hall screamed in agony.

	“The demons are coming for us! The demons are coming for us!”

	I saw that man everywhere. In Wal-Mart rummaging through the five dollar DVD bin. Walking in and out of public restrooms (God only knows why he might be hanging out there in those places…), tending bars and serving drinks (I’d started drinking more after our initial… encounter). I avoided public places and when I had no choice but to break down and do the deed, scooped my excrement into double wrapped plastic sacks. I carried it with me in a cheap backpack I’d saved from college (the same college where I’d studied statistics and philosophy).

	“Towel… sir?”

He haunted my dreams and turned my waking life into a shimmering pile of broken glass where nothing was certain and everything was distorted by the wiry tentacles of uncertainty and psychotic paranoia… Looking back on it all, a long stay in a state mental institution probably sounds pretty logical.

	One of my fellow patients tried cutting her wrists with a pen today. Katy, well that was who she claimed to be. Her real name was Ashley Rice, she was a hard case of there ever was one. PTSD, cluster B traits and Dissociative Identity Disorder… an academic treasure. The kind of stuff that scrawny intern from group would have wet dreams over…a real hard case.

I’m coming up on the end of my stay at MHI. I’ve been packed to the gills with Haloperidol and Zyprexa. Not much has changed and I am truly terrified. God only knows of he’s still out there. If all of this is some elaborate conspiracy against me by my questionable employers (I’m a numbers guy, I know extortion and embezzlement when I see it). I know too much. They’re trying to keep me locked up here… No, I can’t even rationalize my own alleged insanity. It’s all so real…everything I’ve experienced. All I want is truth, closure, absolute values and consistent logical proofs but sometimes… shit just happens.

What to do?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2xee13/negotiation_my_best_offers_salary_is_below_the/,"Graduating from a/very good but non-target university with a degree in CS. Top of my class (4.0 in major), involved in nyc tech community and lead a popular CS based club at school, two internships with significant contributions. My other offers are from my internship (nyc fintech startup) and from a top investment bank (still software engineering)

Just got an offer in SF that is a great base salary, 120k. However, the company (fast growing SAAS company/valued currently at about 500M) lists their software engineering salaries on angel.co as 130-150k and makes no mention of minimum experience. Glassdoor has only a couple entries but both are about 130k. I think the company knows that this is my richest offer. 

Is this something I can mention in asking for a salary within the range listed? Does it sound better if I explain that I don't want to go in knowing I'm making less than my peers and less than the lower bound in their stated salary range? How would you handle this situation??

Thanks all! Sorry that I'm being vague! Apologies for my autocorrect!"
2xeede,51,2015-02-27,Can we take a moment to appreciate how ridiculously good Dota 2's hero voice work is?,_Muddy,dotamasterrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/dotamasterrace/comments/2xeede/can_we_take_a_moment_to_appreciate_how/,"I played League of Legends for a good year or so before moving to Dota 2, and one of the first things I noticed was how unique the voice work for each and every hero is. In League, each champion's voice sounds like it was voiced by the nearest available intern for 10 bucks.

To show my point, here are some examples of the various champions' voice work in League of Legends:

[Tristana, the Megling Gunner](http://images.wikia.com/leagueoflegends/images/6/6f/Tristana.attack06.ogg)

[Draven, the Glorious Executioner](http://images.wikia.com/leagueoflegends/images/4/40/Draven.move7.ogg)

[Fiddlesticks, the Harbinger of Doom](http://images.wikia.com/leagueoflegends/images/e/e0/Fiddlesticks.attack4.ogg)

[Vi, the Piltover Enforcer](http://images.wikia.com/leagueoflegends/images/9/97/Vi.attack2.ogg)

[Galio, the Sentinel's Sorrow](http://images.wikia.com/leagueoflegends/images/7/7f/Galio.move5.ogg)

[Alistar, the Minotaur](http://images.wikia.com/leagueoflegends/images/8/83/Alistar.attack3.ogg)

[Wukong, the Monkey King](http://images.wikia.com/leagueoflegends/images/f/f6/Wukong.taunt.ogg)

I could go on, but you probably get the point by now. Even with diverse champion concepts (the ones listed, in order, are a midget with a huge cannon, a guy who entertains audiences by executing with spinning axes, a possessed scarecrow, a chick with huge steampunk-gauntlets, a gargoyle, a minotaur, and a monkey), the voice work is so incredibly dull.

Now compare that with a sample of the voice work in Dota 2:

[Sven, the Rogue Knight](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/6/6d/Sven_rare_08.mp3)

[Crixalis, the Sand King](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/d/de/Skg_rare_02.mp3) 

[Rizzrack, the Timbersaw](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/1/10/Timb_rare_01.mp3)

[Azwraith, the Phantom Lancer](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/5/55/Plance_kill_10.mp3)

[Ulfsaar, the Ursa Warrior](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/d/d0/Ursa_kill_05.mp3)

[Raijin, the Storm Spirit](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/c/c4/Ss_rare_03.mp3)

[Enigma](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/e/e6/Enig_ability_black_01.mp3)

[Squee, Spleen, and Spoon, the Techies](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/9/96/Tech_rare_02.mp3)

[Auroth, the Winter Wyvern](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/5/55/Winwyv_respawn_04.mp3)

Every hero has their own distinct voice, even though some heroes share the same voice actor. When I play Timbersaw I don't feel like some generic guy piloting a robot suit; I'm a paranoid goblin with equal parts phobia and hatred of trees. Many heroes' lores aren't even fully fleshed out; see Ursa's, for instance - but his voice work says more than enough about his character. 

I'm not saying that ""this is why Dota 2 &gt; LoL"", but the quality of voice work (and the sheer amount of it, compared to LoL) makes every single hero stand out from among the rest.

Thank you Valve, for making the voice work in this game absolutely superb.

And for getting Duke Nukem to voice Enigma. &lt;3

Theres only 3 spots available with Ron already picked as the Opener.  

You can pick from anyone in the R&amp;F universe, including the O and A league.

My Ron and Fez Allstar team:

1) Fez

2) Earl

3) UCB Fred

I gotta cut DaveyMac because he just didn't seem to have Pepper's Charisma or Earls blackness, but Chris went all corporate and suits can't do radio. 

And Fez? Well he might be showing his age but every once in a while his fastball while leave you with a little chin music if your start  crouching up on home plate. 

Why UCB Fred? because he's the only intern who never got a chance, would've prob turned out on the level of ESD or Pepper and I honestly think he can play in the majors. lets give the kid a chance and see what he can do.

Who makes the team this year?"
2xf5wq,5,2015-02-27,"Moved to a new state, income from two states, why is my estimated tax return so low?",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2xf5wq/moved_to_a_new_state_income_from_two_states_why/,"So I need some questions answered before I submit my tax return.

I moved to Michigan from California. I was in an internship for 3 months of 2014 in CA, and then from June I worked full time in Michigan. So when filing my taxes I am a part-time resident in both states which makes sense.

However, I put in all my Michigan stuff in turbo tax first. Sweet I'll get about $2000 back. Then I entered my California stuff expecting I get some back from that as well, and my estimated return dropped from around $2000 to $1000 and I owe a small amount to each state. So that was a bit depressing. (Return amount that decreased is the Federal return by the way)

I could see where maybe in CA they didn't take out enough taxes because I was in a lower tax bracket before if you just take into account the money from my internship.

My move to MI was paid for by my company and they provided money to get myself settled in, etc. So this all was all included in my gross income. So my income was about $47k in MI and $10k in CA, I think I'm in the same tax bracket regardless if the amount was $47k or $57k. It is the part time residency that messed it up for me?

Also my new job in MI provided an HSA which I used on medical expenses. But it looks like this was added as taxable income in my CA state return, I don't understand that. Isn't the whole point of an HSA to have untaxed funds for medical uses?

~~Last question. On my CA return they seem to take into account all of the money earned in 2014, not just the portion that was in CA. Why is this the case?~~

Edit: I just took a second look and will include this in my original post. So it listed my federal adjusted income as the full amount and the CA amount is ""Income After Nonresident Adjustment"". The amount actually does look correct, so that was my mistake. However, there is a line called ""Plus: California Additions"" which is the same amount as my HSA. It is hard to tell if the nonresident adjustment includes or excludes this amount. Turbo Tax Q&amp;A says that Plus: California Additions could be income items that were non-taxable on the federal return, that are taxable on the California. So maybe my HSA is taxable in CA which sound weird.

I used turbo tax just so you know. Taxes can get really complicated, especially for those of us who are young and new to the full time work force. So I thought you all would have more insight into why it came out like this."
2xfjki,1,2015-02-27,"I [23M] just had three consecutive days of hellish depression, can't get over a relationship that happened 6 years ago",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2xfjki/i_23m_just_had_three_consecutive_days_of_hellish/,"It was just exam week, stress was through the roof. Stress breeds depression. I know this. Been depressed since the 3rd grade.

Kids are mean, and I was born with albinism, so I was a natural target. Plus I was crazy naive back then. Got made fun of, picked on, bullied, harassed, for no real reason except that the people who did this found it fun, or something.

But then six weeks into my freshmen year of high school we moved to a new school. It was my chance, I had been gifted a clean slate. No one knew me, or my history, it was my chance.

I had a plan, I knew people would notice my physical difference so I decided to handle that. I forced myself to answer their stupid questions (always the same ones too), over and over until the general populus distributed the information enough to leave me alone. It worked, I became a nobody, which was vastly better than who I was at the old school.

But the four years of damage had been done, I hated school, my innocent extroversion was gone, I lived in my shell and legitimately hated myself. I seriously wondered if I was capable of having a girlfriend. Like, idk, would a girl even consider me? Which thinking back was pretty crazy given that I wasn't overweight, or ugly, I was normal other than the genetic condition. It was the social damage that made me feel this way.

My sophomore year I was determined to find the one. I was sick of being alone, and I felt like I had lost a lot of ground in terms of dating at this point. I met someone, and fell for her, but unfortunately just as I was about to grab the necessary courage to ask her out, she told me she recently started dating a guy.

Months go by and I'm completely crushed, losing hours of sleep every night, completely devastated. Then the dipshit students around us finally clued in and made some remark that the two of us should date, to which I responded ""She has a BF"" to which she responded, ""actually I don't anymore."" I got mad and excited. Idk, mad first, I asked her how long ago was this and she responded months. I asked her out, she said she was done with guys atm, etc. Long story short, she wouldn't have dated me anyway because she was a Christian and I declared myself an atheist (she told me this).

I broke contact and stopped talking to her, avoided her aggressively, hacked her MySpace, etc. Did everything I could to drive a spike between us. I wanted her gone, I wanted my time and energy back. I was mad.

But she wasn't the one. That next year, I bumped into the one. Someone so special that I outright got over the first. I didn't meet her, she met me. She pursued me, she put herself in my life. She was legitimately perfect. Extremely extroverted, a social butterfly.

I'll spare the details, but we had something good going for a short while. We didn't have sex, we really never even kissed (I did try once), but once again religious issues came between us. Among other things, I don't think she realized that she was liked, she was coming into her own and I think the prospect of dating other people was exciting to her. And she knew I loved her, she had to and I think it terrified her.

She broke it off, and destroyed me. And she was firm about it to. She felt bad for maybe a month, I happen to know that she was dating someone else that summer, so it's not like she let this get to her.

She wanted to stay friends, whatever the hell that meant. But I couldn't. She didn't seem to realize that I couldn't be around her without nearly throwing up from pain. Seeing her happy without me, esp. given how crushed I was just felt like getting stabbed in the chest.

I cut contact with her, not as badly as before but pretty hard. She didn't know how to respond to this at first. She followed me to a place she knew I'd be shortly after I cut ties and positioned herself literally in the corner of my field of view. Like as if to say, you don't have to talk but I'm here. 

I waved her over and tried to have a neutral conversation.

But I ultimately couldn't hold it up. It was a path that was going to cause me to kill myself. I couldn't let that happen, she had to go. It took everything I had. I put myself in stasis and I let my mind run on autopilot. My grades took a nosedive, I stopped speaking to just about everyone, including my friends and family.

The year ended and I somehow made it through that summer. Internships, grandpa dying, stuff just filled the gap.

School started again, I did robotics, I threw myself into those damn robots even know the girl was literally on the other side of the same room doing her biology experiments.

We ignored each other, and it's funny because I wanted to die, but she seemed fine. She never really loved me.

I even had another GF that year, and got a lot farther with her (still nothing sexual though). But I didn't love this new girl. We got into fights, she saw the depression. She even asked what was bothering me, why was I down, what could possibly make me happy, etc?

I couldn't answer her, I didn't know. I was broken, and I knew it. And I knew I was only dating her to distract me so I could get through HS.

This affected me deeply, I didn't care about college because all this was going on. I only applied to one uni. and was rejected, so I had to go to a CC, where I found, you guessed it, the girl going there as a in HS college thing, and to top things off she was dating one of my best friends.

She'd sit across from me, in the most awkward situation you could imagine as my friend and I would talk, but she'd never utter a word around me. She wouldn't look me in the eye and here I was possibly willing to open up. Possibly willing to at least TALK.

Over the next four years I moved from one college to another, moved halfway across the country, left that life behind. 

But despite trying, I've not managed to date again. On two other occasions, I've been so close to a relationship I could taste it (laying my head in a girls lap, having another one use me a shoulder to cry on when her life fell apart, yet another one used my view of the world to make sense of a really fucked up situation, etc), but AGAIN religious differences destroyed any chance of these girls dating me before anything even had a chance to hit the ground.

Now I'm 23, a virgin, lonely, mad, exhausted, college and life has sucked the life out of me, and my depression is getting worse. Everything that used to be fun, or entertaining is just losing it's appeal because I just don't care anymore.

And to make matters worse, now that I'm knee deep into my CS program, there are no girls. CS is a sausage fest. The one place I feel completely comfortable socially is completely useless.

This shit is 6 years old now, I want this story burried in my brain underneath many many other relationships. That's the only way I'm going to truly ever be able to get over this girl.

I just feel stuck, I don't know what to do.

tl;dr: Can't get over a six year relationship, because being a CS major requires a dick (apparently) "

2xforf,3,2015-02-28,HELP!!! I (25 m) need a job really soon to move out of house/pay off student debts.,econfan13,houston,https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/2xforf/help_i_25_m_need_a_job_really_soon_to_move_out_of/,"Hello Houston redditors,

Almost a month ago, I failed an exam to continue in a graduate program I was attending in Virginia and had to move back to Houston. It really sucked because I was one class away from receiving a masters, and I have taken out 90,000 dollars in debt to attend the school. Now, I have all that debt and nothing to show for it. 

On top of this, my relationship with my parents is not very good right now. I recently confronted my mother about her emotionally abusive comments that she has made at me since childhood (e.g. she's told me to fk off multiple times, called me a fagt because people were calling me gay in hs, would tell me how fat I was getting multiple times, berated me for mistakes I made) and how I didn't like her brother (my uncle) taking advantage of our family by leaving his children with us all the time and because he used my credit card without my permission. Thus, we haven't spoken for a few months and it has been a tense situation since I've been back.

I'm not a slacker nor unintelligent person either. I have an undergraduate degree from Rice University in mathematical economics and did quite a few extracurricular activities while I was there. I had a job working at the front desk of the study center and have a lot of experience tutoring. 

I haven't had much success finding a job here. I've tried teaching positions, but my lack of teaching experience hurts me there and I've only been interviewed once. This is not to mention the fact that the job will not start until August. I fell I could try something like a business analyst or  consulting since I know that software and line of thinking, but those jobs have pasted their hiring seasons and I don't have an internship or office experience. Thus, my money has come from what I have left of my student loans from graduate school and some money I make here and there from tutoring students.  

My whole situation has made me a bit depressed, but I'm hopeful I'll find something soon so that I can move on with my life and get out of my parents house. If anyone has advice, leads on jobs, or just words of inspiration, that would be helpful to me right now, it would be appreciated. 

EDIT: Thanks guys! I was a little worried I'd get more negative comments but y'all been a big help. I figured Houston is big, but a closeknit city so I wanted to come to y'all.

2xfrd4,3,2015-02-28,Two weeks strong now,tttimmy,StopDipping,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopDipping/comments/2xfrd4/two_weeks_strong_now/,"TL;DR: Breaking the habit is the worst part. Nicotine gums helps. Lying about dipping made me an unhappy person.

Hey ya'll,

I'm procrastinating my school work right now, so I decided to kind of talk about how I started dipping, how it escalated into an addiction, my first time quitting, and then how I got back into it.

So, I started dipping when I was 19, on spring break. Before that, I never really saw the point of dipping, thought it was disgusting, and made fun of my brother for throwing in the occasional lipper. My freshman year girlfriend would make fun of the guys that we saw dip, and I was extremely judgemental. Oh, how times have changed.

I pledged my fraternity my sophomore year, and a lot of guys in the house dipped. My big brother dipped, some of my pledge brothers dipped, so I started to surround myself with more and more people who dipped, which was a strange experience for me. The only people I saw throwing in chawskis were my (biological) brother and the hicks I went to high school with. I (sort of) blame my fraternity for introducing me to this (at first amazing) habit, but obviously I blame myself more.

After seeing my fraternity brothers, guys who were social, talked with girls, athletes, and got good grades dip, my association with dipping shifted from hicks to everyday people. This is when the idea of dipping formed in my mind, and spring break 2014 is when it all started.

I went down to feelingFlorida with my fraternity brothers and, wanting to spend money on booze instead of plane tickets, we drove. The car ride was 25 hours long. There was no way in hell I was going to sit in a car for 25 hours without SOME form of toxication, and since smoking herb on such a long car ride was not the best idea and we didn't want to car bar until we were within a few hours, I decided to buy my first tin. Grizzly Mint pouches.

However, I never dipped on the car ride in. My pledge brother advised me not to take a dip because if I got sick (which many first time dippers do) in the car, I decided to wait until we were in Florida. But once we arrived, I immediately started drinking and before I knew it I was waking up on a beach.

That night, while in line getting wrist bands for a club, I was hammered and tossed in my first ever pouch. Ohhhhh boy. I never realized the beautiful comibation that was alcohol and tobacco, and the feeling I had was incredible. I believe that this is the reason I got hooked so quickly. I was always chasing that first dip.

Spring break came to a close, but I did not want to stop without finishing my tin. I came back to the real world, and continued dipping. At this point, it was a dip every couple days. The buzz was amazing. It relieved stress, made TV more enjoyable, and just made me feel good. Eventually I switched to long cut and it was almost as good as that first tin.

But eventually, I fell into a routine. Dip after breakfast. Dip after lunch. Dip after class. Dip before bed. And before I knew it, my gums were in terrible shape and my bottom teeth were noticably yellow. I told myself I would quit when I stopped getting a buzz, but that just lead me to putting in larger and larger dips, and before I knew it I was putting in a quarter tin at a time.

This continued for a while. Then, I met my (current) girlfriend. It was around the end of my sophomore year. I told her I dipped, she thought it was gross, so I stopped. At least I stopped when I was sober. That dip+drunk combination was simply too good. But after I while, I felt guilty for lying to my girlfriend about dipping, so I quit for real.

The summer was easy. I was working full time as a software engineer intern, and went the entire summer without a dip. I was proud of myself.

However, once school started up again, I fell back into my routine. The stress of school and the constant assocation with dippers made it too hard. I started going through a tin a day. However, I hid it from my girlfriend quite well. She never found out.

But I noticed that something was different. My mood was worse. I was not as happy as I was during the school year. The constant stress of hiding spitters, empty tins, and tobacco in my teeth was not enjoyable. I tried to quit multiple times, but the stress from school overcame my motivation to quit. It was too hard to break the habit of dipping while watching Netflix, dipping during meetings, and dipping on car rides. Whenever I did something I associated with dipping, the cravings were too much.

But I needed to stop. My gums were terrible. My teeth were yellow. I wasn't getting a buzz anymore. It was too expensive.

So, two weeks ago, I bought nicotine gum. I haven't dipped since. Quitting cold turkey never worked for me, and this has helped so far. I know I still am feeding my nicotine addiction, but I have been (slowly) weaning myself off. By summer, I plan to be freed of my addiction.

Sometimes I wish I never went on spring break."

2xg4ln,2,2015-02-28,Got my first and so far only software job offer from first company I interviewed with- offer seems low. What do?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2xg4ln/got_my_first_and_so_far_only_software_job_offer/,"So, I was dumb and went through school without doing any internships or coops. I don't have any projects to my name beyond academic ones, but I graduated from one of the better CS universities in Canada.

I dropped my resume off at a career fair and got two responses a month later. One of them I interviewed for a week ago, the other requested a 20 question application form filled out a few days ago. 

Today I got a job offer for a 1 year contract at 53k Canadian... this appears to be in [the bottom 10% of the 0-3 year experience section for software engineers, according to salary.com](http://swz.salary.com/CanadaSalaryWizard/Software-Developer-I-Salary-Details-Vancouver-BC.aspx market for my area). 

I didn't think the interview went well, so I was surprised when I got the call. Is the offer a reflection of my mediocrity as a candidate, or are they just looking for cheap meat? The recruiter made the offer and left on vacation, so now I'm supposed to talk to head of HR about any concerns.

Given my relative untested quality, should I attempt to negotiate, and if so, how? Should I just take the 1 year of experience and consider it a loss leader to put something tangible on my resume? Should I keep hunting for something better?

Also, they want me to work a week from Monday, but they didn't specify a deadline for accepting the offer. How should I ask them for time and how should I contact the recruiter at the other company (which I'd prefer) to ask their stage"

-24 y/o graduate from a professional degree program

-Former overly ambitious high school student, self-motivated, detail oriented, excellent note-taker, intricate, creative.

-in the top 10-15% in my high school, graduated with highest honors (4.0 GPA and above), took several AP classes, SAT scores were average

-Love constant learning, change in tasks, intellectually stimulating work, doing something different

-Got into college unsure of what I truly wanted to do. Was interested in doing something multi-disciplinary (science + a journalism, anthro, international relations type minor) Considered med school but got into another professional healthcare program straight out of high school that I was very unsure of, but felt like a safe decision

-Maintained 4.0 GPA in first year, gradual grade decline spring semester 2nd year/first year of professional school (ended up graduating with a not very competitive 3.3 GPA)

-Unsure what goal I was working for, wasn't too interested in major, started to get distracted/lose focus easily, peers did not share my professional ideals nor passion, considered dropping my program few times

-Stayed in major. Attempted to get internship (critical for experience in my major that almost every student does while in school). Did everything I could &amp; no internship opps available. Learned my field was starting to get saturated (more graduates than jobs), internship sites claimed they reached ""maximum capacity"" for my class.

-Started to enjoy subject matter slightly more second year but felt very behind students who had internships. Did not have practical knowledge of what job I wanted to do post-graduation

-Still had trouble securing internship but was very active on campus: part of two organizations &amp; leadership in both, work on campus,  campus emergency personel, service volunteer, etc. more so than other students who stuck to strictly organizations related to major or no involvement at all

-My last year: had 1 year of practical experience-worked in hospitals, college campus &amp; few other places. Realized hospital or campus was an ideal environment for my interests

-Attempted to secure a post-graduate opportunity or hospital job

-Worked with professor on a project and assisted him in creating classroom material-he gave positive feedback throughout but noticed change in behavior at end-refused to write letter of rec (critical in securing post grad-opp, next to intern experience which I wasn't able to obtain)

-Applied to 10 programs, heard from one, they told me I've done ""more activities &amp; involvement that they've ever done in their entire lives but concerned about my lack of internship experience""

-Started to feel that field was not for me-everybody has same knowledge, education &amp; skills, hard to separate yourself from peers, only thing employers took seriously was internship experience I did not have. I enjoy clinical work which is difficult to get in my field now with saturation. applied to 60-70 non-clinical hospital jobs, one interview never heard back (resume has been edited/reviewed)

-Been told this is result of terrible saturation-way more students graduating than jobs than ever, have been told only way it will work is if I relocate to a rural area (can relocate, but can't go in a rural area too far away from family for medical reasons) OR try to apply harder in a non-hospital setting where I had experience for 1-2 months in my last and was very overwhelmed with anxiety-have heard high turnover rate is common due to people quitting for mental exhaustion

-Realized I still love healthcare &amp; enjoyed some things in my field but am willing to expand my options &amp; try to combine my degree with another skillset/field

-Spending my post-grad life applying away, confused, depressed, anxious, unsure of my goals, serious lack of motivation &amp; enjoyment in life from somebody who was once a good student, still yearns to be intellectually stimulated &amp; learning something new &amp; interested everyday

2xglkd,5,2015-02-28,"I sent my ex who I'm not suppose to talk to again a letter, not sure if this was a mistake.",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/2xglkd/i_sent_my_ex_who_im_not_suppose_to_talk_to_again/,"We've been broken up for over half a year now and we haven't talked in pretty much just as long. The last time we talked emotions were high on both sides and she told me she never wanted to see or hear from me again. About a month later one of our mutual friends and her mom later told me the same thing. That she told them she didn't think we had a viable future together because I never told her what I wanted to do with my life, I was always afraid to. which was what pushed her to deciding to breakup after I got jealous and hurt her feelings. 

About a week later, we ran into each other one night in a video game that we used to play together and I asked one of our mutual friends to ask if I could talk to her. She got really defensive and unfriended this person that I tried to reach out through. 


At this point I realize I messed things up and pushed her too hard to try resolving things when she needed space and I accepted that she would really never talk to me again. 

I tried my best to move forward and just concentrate on bettering myself and that's what I did. I got better grades in school, took more classes that would benefit me, finished up my associates degree, working towards my bachelors now and I even got an internship for the summer in my field. Fast forward several months I started a new relationship with someone else that last about a month. Near the end of this relationship I had a dream where I ran into my ex in the halls of my old highschool and realized how much I stilled cared about her and how much I really missed her. So I ended things with the girl I was dating and told her that I couldn't dedicate myself to her because I was still in love with someone else, she took it well and we decided to stay friends. 

Last week I was feeling bummed like a wave of depression just hit me and I drew a sketch of my ex and I hugging it out. 
http://imgur.com/kb4dMBi

I even wrote a letter figuring I probably wouldn't send it anyways. In this letter I told her how sorry I was for getting jealous, hurting her, not giving her space and messing things up between us. I even told her that I had a fear of telling her what I wanted to do with my life and told her all my future plans and how I wanted to share my future with her. 

But the next day I thought about it and asked some close friends both male and female what I should do and I was told by all my friends I asked. If you still have feelings for this girl then do something about it, send her the letter and sketch. I decided what's the worse that could happen maybe she never reads it, but at least I tried. So I dropped it off at the post office. 

Is this a horrible mistake? I've never tried reaching out to an ex before and is it stupid of me to even think that there's a possibly of a second chance? What if she's still mad at me and this somehow makes things worse?

I don't even know where to begin. Mandatory fucking statement that this is a throwaway? But why even bother with the throwaway? I'm comfortable with myself, confident even, right? right? That's what you see. I know you do. Because to you I'm some smart lazy kid who has zero ambition, zero drive, and, well nothing.  
 
 And you're right. I have nothing. Nothing but myself to rely on. You're my family and I'm even past that point. Where I count on you for anything. So for, well the third time in recent memory, but the umpteenth time in reality, you told me this house wasn't built for 4 adults. I need to find my own place. I hear you dad. Let me get some sleep and I'll leave today or tomorrow.  
  
I promise. I'm gone.  
  
I've been thinking about it for a while. Well that or suicide. Because honestly, I can't take the abuse anymore and I have nowhere to go. We've talked about the language you use, the way  we express ourselves, and the way I have some bad days strung together. Me and my therapists have called it depression or more clinically, Major Depressive Disorder. You haven't called it anything. So your little 'motivational' phrases really just beat me down. Again and again and again. I don't cry in front of you. I don't cry in front of anyone in the family. I'm sorry we don't talk as much, but when I wake up and come upstairs for coffee do you want me to say the suicidal feelings are pretty prominent today. You don't bother to ask how my day was, even though I ask about yours. But you don't notice that anyway. Sure we've had a few rows but because I've grown a resentment toward you and you and moms general lack of support and respect for some of things I choose to do with my life professionally, you take take it like I don't give a shit on a day to day. Do you know how hard it is to feel like you maybe, don't get along with your dad, maybe he's a bit of a dick, and maybe, maybe feeling like that's okay? Do you know what it's like to come to these answers on your own and grapple with them and wrestle with these unnatural feelings because ultimately you praise your parents, worship them, and because of their overreaching influence thus far in my life, I seek your approval for so so so so so so much. How my bad days after day after day just string together into a blur but I persevere. How I took that shit dead end job doing manual labor because you'd rather see me working than  hear me say I'm applying for jobs.  
   
I took that job, busting my ass 8 to 10 hours a day 5 or 6 days a week just so I'd get a small nod of approval from you guys. Because unless you see me doing something that you guys recognize as a right or good thing, you don't think I'm doing it or anything for that matter. Like how you don't believe I worked and taught myself adobe. Like you don't believe I finished my book. Like you don't believe I'm applying for jobs.   
  
And then when I was injured and couldn't work, and said, wow spending 8 hours day applying for jobs will definitely get me further than the one or two applications a week I was sending out because I was so tired from work, you looked at me like I was a bum again. It was an injury. And, having worked for some great people, I told them I've been applying for jobs and with a good 2 months ahead of me being out, we mutually agreed that they should replace me. It wouldn't be fair to return for a week before I get a call back. And I've gotten a couple already. But you don't ask. You don't ask when you don't think I'm doing something. When you don't believe me. Sure there are trust issues. Of course there are. I lived fast and partied when I was younger. But I wasn't a bum. I worked hard and partied hard. And because of that, you only saw the party part. You never saw the 3.98 Honors GPA, you never saw that award I got for the essay nor did you come to my reading of a short story. You did come to my paramedic graduation, because that you approved of. Everything else fell to the wayside. I'm pretty sure you don't even hold my 5 years as an EMT/Paramedic as anything positive. But beyond all that, people change. People fucking change. I'm not living fast, I'm not partying. I'm not even fuckign drinking. I wrote a book, you don't give a shit. I graduated, you don't care (well a lil, but it felt so fucking contrived and lacking sincerity, being so long overdue, right? you can admit it). I'm not lying when I say my degree is fucking caught up on some bullshit red tape. I told you they only made me aware that I actually didn't have the credits for it after I applied for it 4 times. Sure, I was taking their word for it when they said I should receive it this time. Sure I shrugged it off because my online transcripts said I met the graduation requirements. Do you think I wanted to delay getting my degree? That I'd prefer not to have it? That I enjoy having these loan collectors call and hound for something I don't even fucking have. It was out of my hands. Wen I found out that, I attempted to rectify it. I'm sorry that I need to reapply for it and we have to wait till May, again. I don't make the fucking rules. I'm sorry the whole thing was a fucking clusterfuck and I haven't received that piece of paper almost two whole years after I should have. You're right though, I should have lost my shit like you did about it, made a scene, and demanded I get it in writing I'm receiving it this ***time.*** Well I had. They mailed me those letters saying I was, that I'm pretty sure you opened first because mail doesn't arrive opened. And sure, I'll take the fault for a few months there, that it was so drawn out and I was so tired of the whole thing that maybe I didn't care as much as I should have. Maybe I felt robbed and slighted. Maybe I figured I was applying for jobs where they looked at a portfol more than a degree. Maybe for a few months I just didn't give a shit, because I didn't.
  
I know it's easy to see me as a bum too. I sleep on the couch in the basement. How'd I get there? Not entirely because I wanted to. If you were paying attention you'd have noticed me ask for my room back. You'd have noticed me having sleepless nights. You'd have noticed it wasn't helping after my friend died and that depression crept back in. You've threatened to throw shit out, general threats. That's my summer clothes. I don't have a dresser. That's my coat rack, I don't have a closet. I don't have space, I sleep on a fucking cough, in your fucking basement. I had a room and a bed but after I spent the summer down here because we didn't have AC, my brother ""would have a shit fit if you moved back up there.""   
 
So I didn't. Not thinking I'd be down here, on it, over two years later. At the time I was writing that content for that blog, that you didn't believe I was doing. You asked to see business cards, I showed them. You asked to see emails, I showed them. You asked to see some of my 'work' and I did. I gave you URL's and PDF's. You asked and I delivered and still there isn't a shred of respect or recognition that I could write for a living. I got that internship and published 60+ articles and 400+ photographs in 8 months. SO much so he expanded my role as reporter for our town and the one over. But you still didn't see it as anything but  a hobby or some shit. Like the patch isn't a real new organisation.   
  
And I'm sorry, when that depression kicked in I wasn't applying for jobs like I should have been. I didn't really say I was either though. No, I can't let you get me a job dad. At this point I'd never forgive myself. I've never be able to live with myself. And that's a tough pill to swallow. It isn't because I'm proud. No, this isn't hubris. This is shame. I'm too ashamed to take the job from you. I'm too scared. I don't want to know what life is like with you 'saying Don't Embarass me' one more time. I can't do that now, knowing I didn't earn it myself on my own merits and didn't 'make it' and that I failed.  
  
Did I when you got me into that paramedic class? No I finished third in my class. Did I when I worked for billy those couple days before hurricane sandy? No, he offered me a job. But still you don't see me as someone capable to work. Or to do anything.   
  
Do you think I like having a couch for a bed? That I like having my clothes in baskets and not dressers? That at 27 I'm happy to not be waking up and getting on the train to go to work in the city like the rest of my friends? Or to not have a place in there like the rest of the people I know? No I'm not trying to be a starving artist. You'd know I was applying for PR, Journalism, Copywriting, Communications, Internal Communications, Marketing, and even some design jobs. I started to teach myself code, again. My third language because I'm really not good enough to get a job yet on what I know, sorry this isn't a hobby you approve of. I'm redoing my resume, again. I'm writing the best damn cover letters there are. I'm going to find work, I just need another month maybe two, maybe six, but now that I've been working and feeling better about myself, or enough at least, I'm really applying. Shit, I could be sitting back waiting for my agent to call saying my book is sold. But you don't believe that either. And I'm not, because the average advance is 30,000 and that's not enough to live off of. So I'm trying to find a career till I can live off my writing. I'm sorry I don't want to go back to being a medic. At least not yet. I'm a solid writer and there's a lot of jobs that pay you to do so, give me a small break, a small chance to find one.  
  
I'm sorry I'm not good enough. I'm sorry I'm not capable. And I'm sorry I'm on your couch taking up this room. I'm sorry I didn't go to med school or become a lawyer out of college. I'm sorry I let you down. Life would be easier now if I had. You're right, I should have just sucked it up and made a living. I'm sorry I mad a couple mistakes when I was younger, that DWI 3 years ago made things difficult. But to be honest it felt like my probation officer was more supportive of my book then you and mom.  I'm sorry I feel like I can't let you see me cry. Maybe that would make things better but I doubt it. It'd just be a fight.   
  
I just want you to say you're proud, once. And I want to know you love me. I don't want it fucking measured in dollars and cents or because you go to a job that you continue to claim makes you miserable, that you suck it up for the money. That's your big sacrifice. Let's be real. You actually hate that job and if you did, wouldn't you be looking elsewhere. You're a defining leader of your field. Co-signing my student loans, I'm sorry you had to do that. I didn't even know what was going on with them at the time, mom applied for them, and then I just signed too. Don't you remember? No, you guys think I took out these huge loans on my own. I didn't even know where to look. And I'm sorry I messed that one semester up but then I left that school, came home and had a A+ honors gpa I maintained till I graduated form another school. Thanks for telling me I did well in paramedic school. That, well it sort of felt good but I hated it. I felt like every nerve of myself was betraying my heart. I just wanted a chance to try and get career I wanted. If you thought I could be a doctor, why not one of the jobs I'm trying to get?  
  
And now we're here. I haven't been sleeping much. The depression is knocking at my door. I'm not going to let it slow me down though, not for a second. I'm going to get that job and move out. Just not necessarily in that order. I can't take those disparaging comments and the dichotomy that's your world view. It's too singular and when you express your rapid flashfire opinions and judgments on situations it fucking hurts. You don't even say your sorry after the dust settles. That'd be nice to hear, once.   
  
And I'm sorry again, that maybe even when you can tell something is wrong, you can't quite bring yourself to ask me. Afraid I might quip back. Well, you're right, I probably would because every time you open your mouth and it's directed at me I can't help but instantly feel the need to defend myself or whatever action or decision I'm making. But I don't know why I bother, I'm just going to do what you tell me to. Because I can't do anything for myself. Ever since I strayed from your first born's path to MD perfectionist you've been nudging me on what you feel is the closest correct path. All I've wanted to hear is that my own path, for better or worst, was okay. Maybe not the best, richest, or comprehensible to you, but that I was okay because you'd be there to support and love me and that I was, and am, a smart capable young man who could do it.  
 
 But we both know that's not the case. I'm nothing. I'm not shit. I'm some weak willed, poor, starving fucking artist who sleeps on your couch and has done nothing with himself. So you've said it,'Well then leave, I don't care where, go sleep in a shelter.' We were arguing over petty things. Shit like who's been loading the dishwasher since mom's been injured. Like really man, I was defending myself because I know I carry my weight around here but you haven't noticed. Of course not, so I felt the need to say, hey lay off me. And, if you haven't noticed, I don't yell. I don't scream anymore. I'm too old for that. We're not children. I'm not a little kid anymore, yelling at me is ridiculous. But you instantly take it and escalate it and say hurtful stupid shit. So so so so so so so stupid. Shit that mom even raises on eyebrow at, like, why would you say that? I'd never talk to family like that. Especially family I love. In fact it feels unconscionable to do so.  
  
 Your perception is clouded. You think because you take the garbage out and load the dishwasher one night that no one has been doing shit. Think about that. You take the garbage out and load the dishwasher once? Why is the counter and stove clean? Why is the floor vacuumed and mopped? Why is your wash done? The microwave plate looks clean huh, didn't you make Ellio's last night, did I make a snide remark when I cleaned it? Did I note how typical it was that it was dirty. You know what I probably did? Of course you don't, you never notice any positive. I probably kept my mouth shut and washed it because it needed to be cleaned and I don't feel the need to say anything about it. But it helps if I say something because then I can, maybe hopefully, get you to remember I cleaned it. And you know what I would say? I'd say that it's the most forgotten about thing, because it's a bitch to clean when it's hot. You don't know how much it hurts to not be acknowledged and when I am, it's only at fault. I used to think I could do something with myself. Now, after you thought so, I see it too. I should just go back to my furniture moving job, that's all I'll ever aspire to. It has benefits and even a 403b. Sure I only take home 230/week after taxes and benefits and everything and I'm exhausted. But you're right, that's all I'll ever be at this point. 
  
Then this morning, again you said I need to go. So I'll go. No thanks for the help with the hot water heater. No, good catch. I noticed it was leaking, I cleaned up the mess so you could only come down, turn off the water and gas and call it a day. Hey ,I guess there's been an upside to sleeping between 6am to noon. I'm sorry for that too, I know it's weird, I just need some sleep and don't have a therapist at the moment.  You know what else would have helped? Just a bit of encouragement. Instead it's 100% all or nothing . Either you get me a job or don't. There's no, let me see that resume. Most people when they see it are impressed. They think I've done a lot for 27. That I've taken on and completed quite a bit. That I'm an ambitious, hungry, intelligent young man looking to carve his little niche in the world. To say, look what I've done! I earned this! But no that won't happen because I'm not anything unless you say I am.  
  
But maybe that will change. You told me I need to go. So I'll go. I was hoping it'd be a lil warmer out but whatever. I can't stay here. The way you talk to me, the way you treat me, the way I feel when you open your mouth destroys me. Little by little till there's nothing left. I'm not going to kill myself. No, I'm not that petty that I'd do it out of spite. That's a bit ridiculous, but if you for a second imagined what it is like to have suicidal thoughts, you'd at least know a bit more about what my life is like. How tough that can be. Maybe I'd earn a little credit there but I doubt it. It's all fixed with medicine and a few chats with someone with letters next to their name. I'm sorry, I'm not being wise, I'm just trying, so hard, to be honest with myself for a  change and accept what I need to accept. That your love hurts. That it's a toxic thing to be around. That you're not really the best person. That yo don't respect me or my writing or art in general. Whatever though, that doesn't matter. It doesn't matter now, it won't matter when that book sells. It's not something you get, you don't try to understand anything I do, any of my problems, or me. That's okay, I get it now.  
  
I get the big picture now too. That I can't be here or it will literally kill me. I'm leaving. You made it clear enough. I'll stay at a hostel long term I guess until I find some work. Whatever actually, you don't need to know. I don't think you'd care and it won't really matter. I'm leaving now and I'll be away from you, and I won't need to hear any of that toxicity from your mouth.  
  
 
Well I guess I'll go. But I have no where. I just can't imagine staying here another day. That's how you make me feel.  
  
I Leave or I die. I'm tired of crying. I'm sorry dad, I'm sorry I couldn't be better. 
  
Love,   
M  
  
tl;dr it doesn't even fucking matter, dad's a dick, borderline abusive with his mouth, son's depressed, finally is going to leave after multiple suggestions I sleep in a shelter or get out. no where to go, confused and hurt and crying and this is fucking sloppy as shit.  
   
holy shit that's a wall of text. it's probably not even coherent. i'll edit it down later, i'm fucking distraught at the moment, spent, and crying. i'm surprised i even wrote that much.  
  
edit: some spelling...i think i made it longer :( I'm sorry. if you read all those I wish I could give you gold or a hug. "
2xgsl2,7,2015-02-28,How do you motivate Junior (Windows) Sysadmins?,4athrowaway,ITManagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITManagers/comments/2xgsl2/how_do_you_motivate_junior_windows_sysadmins/,"Background Information:  
I work with a team of 8-9 sysadmins, supporting ~1500 users &amp; 250 windows servers.  
* Three are Junior Admins, two of whom were hired out of a local busines school.   
  The More Senior admins can All do basic windows stuff &amp; they are:  
- One backup (commvault); monitoring systems (Solarwinds).  
- One VMware; Active Directory Admin  
- One backup (veeam); storage systems (Equalogic &amp; Compellant) Admin  
- One AWS; programming Admin      
- One Exchange Admin.  
- One Has done everything guy who works with AWS, assists everyone else &amp; works closely with the systems architect.

Question: How can these guys be motivated?  
They were interns before being hired &amp; left with computers, a manual for 2k8; a mcse guide for 2003 of ~ 1,000 pages, and instructions to learn by putting together a functional domain system.  The other sysadmins gave overviews of TCP; DNS; DHCP; ADUC; GPMC.  At this point, I would not have hired them simply  because they do not understand TCP subnetting &amp; I think that is a very important &amp; basic thing to understand.   
In any case, they are now our Jr. Sysadmins who seem to retain little (but must have the ability as they graduated) and don't seem to review the notes they have taken.  How can they be improved to the pont that they don't need a complete punchlist for every task they are supposed to undertake? I have two admins who have stated they Juniors bring nothing to the table; a third who does not want to deal with them: having stated ""'Jr. - A.'  never passes up the opportunity to pass up work.""  
The boss thinks they have potential &amp; I am at my wits end. Suggestions welcome, as it also means that we have lower raises if we have to let them go &amp; hire more expensive people."

Currently I am out of the country doing an internship abroad until the summer. We've been talking about doing something like this for the last month and I've finally convinced him that I'm perfectly ok with him getting a release at least once since I'll be gone for so long and I personally get really turned on by the thought of seeing this.

Ideally I think the best way to do this would be to watch you both over skype, but if that isn't able to work out between time zone differences and all that I'm also fine with just seeing a few pictures of it. So you would have to be ok with that possibly happening. If not I'm fine with waiting to do this together with you over the summer when I get back, but that's going to be a long wait.

I'll be the one choosing the girl for him and he's given me permission to share pictures of him and me as well if necessary so don't worry about that. As far as his looks go: He's tall, fit but not super buff, think more lean like the body of a swimmer, and he has a really nice thick cock. Personality wise he can be pretty corny, but always sweet. In the bedroom he tends to be more aggressive.

Should this go well we might be looking for you to come back as a fwb to join us on other occasions, but that's not being considered yet. If any ladies in the area think they would be interested in something like this, just send a pm my way :)"

2xh8bg,3,2015-02-28,Anxiety about graduation,4ofclubs,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2xh8bg/anxiety_about_graduation/,"Hey.

I'm a 25 year old Uni student, coming up to my graduation two months from now.

And I'm terrified.

I've been working the same customer-service job for the last four years to pay for school, so I'm used to working, but I'm not used to working in a job where there's as much responsibility as what I'm going in to.

I wasn't really scared before, but I am trying to job search right now and just having horrible anxiety about everything. I have some connections with internships and what not, but besides that my future looks quite bleek (graphic design/interaction design major.)

Talking to grads I knew from before, a lot of them struggle to find work, and right now I'm spending all my time putting together website portfolios for applications and just becoming more and more terrified about everything.

I definitely have to move to get a job, and while that excites me, it also scares me. What if I move and get fired? Then what? I mean sure I don't live with my parents (haven't for 8 years), not do I live in the same city as them, but in this city I am surrounded by friends that will catch me if I fall. Moving to a new city for work with no safety net is terrifying.

And what if I hate it? 

People that have gone through graduating university: how have you coped? 

I can't eat, I can't sleep. I can't even breathe, I can't focus on anything. It's making me shut down and not do any of my final projects. . I mean, I know I'm good at what I do and I'm really bull-headed when it comes to competing for what I want, but it is still terrifying.

I don't know what I need here, not necessarily reassurance, because I know life isn't fair and I know I'll have to fight for what I want, and I may not achieve what I want but I'll still fight to not work in the shitty minimum wage world, but maybe just stories from other people so I know I'm not alone here?"

I always liked engineering and science as a whole, so I decided to major in one of the ""widest"" specialization. 

During my internship, I did a lot of programming (C++, C#) which I learned in my first year in two different courses (procedural programming and object oriented programming). I have now come to the conclusion that this is what I would like to do for at least the next 5-10 years. I want to program, but I have a feeling that most students with Computer science and Computer/Software engineering are miles ahead of me in that field.

My program does not offer any software oriented specialization, so I chose Telecommunications. Is there anything I can do to ""get up to speed"" on what the average computer engineer undergrad knows in terms of programming ?

If I had to list my programming related skills, I would list the following :
- Object oriented programming
- C++ / C#
- Relational databases (basic knowledge)
- .NET Framework
- TCP/IP protocol and socket programming
- Winforms / WPF
- Data structures (lists, maps, hash sets etc.)

What other useful notions should I focus on in the short term ? I graduate in 9 months and I hope that would be enough.

Edit : Thanks for the great advice everyone. I will take every advice and ""just code"". I will learn algorithms as suggested and maybe set up a public GitHub for my side projects :)"

During winter break I went to tanzania for four weeks. While I was there I met someone who had been there for a few months volunteering with the peace corps and would be there until 2016. We hit it off pretty well, had a lot of fun talking with him. It just so happens that that he lived about an hour and half from me in the states. So we stayed in touch the last couple of months. 

We texted as often as we could when I got back to America in January and he called me once and talked for two hours (he even called me before he called his mom :D). And a text a few days later. Communication from him is difficult. He is the village in Africa, where electricity is not always working. He has a pay as you go type phone and he is far from town without his own means of transportation to town, so when he's out of minutes he's out until he can find him some more. And now he's lost his phone. And if he's lost his phone, that means he's lost my phone number, which means I'm not sure if I'll ever hear from him again. A while back, he gave me his email and facebook, but again, he's in a location where wifi is not accessible to him. 


The only reason I found out he lost his phone is that I went to his facebook and found his mom. She had a post wishing him a happy birthday (two weeks ago) and then I saw that one of friends who happened to be a PC volunteer as well who recently commented on the post that said he had just lost his phone again. So that's how I know. 


I've been debating whether or not I want to contact his mom or his PC friend to help me get back in touch with him, but since we've only really known each other for 2 months. But I don't not want to ever speak to him again. I don't want to come off as creepy because I found his mom or friend. 


He knew I am going to be back in tanzania for my internship in July and we made plans to see each other. But now I don't know realistic that is anymore. 


And even though we are 8500 miles away from each other, we decided that we want to be in a relationship. I know, smart. I had no problem waiting for him, but now that I don't know if I'll ever hear from him again, am I still in a relationship? I don't ever want to cheat him on (or anyone). But do I wait until he comes back in 2016? Should I move on and see other people? Is that fair to the other person that I 'might' have a boyfriend in Africa? 


Am I thinking too much about this and just need to move on? "

If anything's unclear, please let me know!**

Hi all, I haven't ever really posted here before. I've been spending a long time reading up on the theory here and trying to internalize a lot of the teachings. I recently (yesterday) had a messy end to my last relationship, and I do know that if I had followed my gut and what I learned more then perhaps it wouldn't have been so bad.

We (22/M and 19/F) ended things while I was away at school. While it wasn't an LDR the whole time, for the past month or so it has been, and while it hasn't been too bad on us, since we have visited each other twice already, I'm sure it didn't help.

I met this girl while working in a seven month long internship in my home city around six hours away from my school. We met four months before I had to leave for school, so we definitely had the time and chances to get together in person to get to know each other. It started out very nicely, the sex was great, we were both extremely passionate, and I fucked her so hard (she'd never experienced an orgasm before). We had some of the kinkiest sex imaginable (we fucked on the first date, and then did it in public on a beach at night on the second), and I couldn't ask for anything more from this on a physical standpoint.

However, there were some issues. Some deep red flags that I was willing to overlook since I did truly care for this girl and thought that we could overcome, but I now realize that this was all a giant mistake.

**Her family controlled her.** Mentally, financially, emotionally, hell, even physically when she was with them. Her mother hated me for absolutely no reason (we had never even talked before) and I feel that it is because of her, that ultimately we ended up breaking up.

**She has no life stability.** She basically ended up relying on me for stability almost completely, since, at the beginning, I was a strong, independent man who could be the alpha in her life. My mistake was slowly second guessing myself and becoming a bitch.

**She was extremely immature.** She couldn't handle someone needing emotional support from her. And while I know that I shouldn't be looking for emotional support from her, I feel that in a relationship I should be able to talk to my SO about anything within reason.

**She broke up with me once before.** I always have told myself that I would never allow someone to get back together with me if we broke up. My mistake was ignoring my own gut and just giving it another chance. If she disrespected me like that, then it was going to happen again (Spoiler: it did). She liked to say that when she came chasing after me she gave up her dignity to try again.

**Mistakes that I made (and lessons to take from them):**

1. I started second guessing my convictions. Not to please her, but just because I thought that perhaps my ways of thinking were wrong. **DON'T EVER WAVER IN YOUR BELIEFS.**

1. I got incredibly needy at certain stages during the relationship. Nothing else is a quicker way to lose someone. I needed to be strong throughout, instead of becoming a huge pussy. **DON'T EVER RELY ON A GIRL'S REACTIONS TO FEEL COMPLETE.**

1. I'm still young. This is only one of my first handful of relationships, and arguably my first long-term, serious one that I saw with a future. I brought up the possibility of a future way too early (even though she reciprocated), and that put much pressure on the relationship. From the beginning I was always ""go with the flow,"" and I let that waver. **FOCUS ON THE PRESENT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN'T CONTROL.**

1. I wanted to date someone younger, but at my age that basically meant a freshman. Girls at this stage in life are just completely unstable and cannot handle anything tough. Instead of sticking this out with me and trying to work it out, she just completely dumped me. **INSTABILITY IS A HUGE RED FLAG.**

1. I assumed that she was different; that I could let go a little bit and not have to continuously worry about how I looked or how my status was. She even told me not to worry about that kind of stuff. It was all a lie (not intentional, I'm sure, but subconscious). **ALL WOMEN ARE LIKE THAT (AWALT).**

1. I thought that I could give her the world (and I did), and that would be enough. I took her out to the most amazing restaurants, showed her the most amazing parts of the city, showed her how amazing life could be. In the end, she said that I was nothing but a negative influence in her life and a bother. **THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS THAT YOU GIVE HER THE TINGLES. ONCE THAT'S GONE, NOTHING MATTERS.**

1. I got too emotionally invested. I gave this girl the world and put her at the center of mine for a long time. Partly because I had nothing else to do (internship is basically a vacation from school) and partly because I did truly love this girl. **NEVER GET SO EMOTIONALLY ATTACHED THAT YOU LOSE YOURSELF.**

1. We went through a rough patch before (leading into the original breakup) when I vented to her friend and semi-insulted my ex-girlfriend's mother's parenting ability. This stemmed from the fact that we were both at an event together, and ran into each other, but I barely got a hello and felt deeply disrespected. My ex then shouted at me and demanded we end things. But she held a grudge for a very long time, and her mother did the same. While I can't expect them to get over something that hurt them so easily, her mother is almost 60. This shows that no matter how old a woman gets, she is still a four year old inside. **DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE OF ASSUMING THAT YOU CAN BE LOGICAL WITH A FOUR YEAR OLD.**

On a somewhat better note, the way that it ultimately ended, while messy, ended up being a huge eye opener and lesson for me, which is why I'm taking this as a learning experience. We have not really talked at all the past week, which culminated in a long phone call basically confirming my suspicions. After the breakup, I sent her a calm, logical, and thought out letter that laid out that I felt that we were both not in a proper level of personal growth, and that we both have to mature some more, and laid out some things that I felt that we could have done better, and can do better in our lives.

When she received the email, she lashed out emotionally, started throwing ad hominem attacks, and basically told me that I wasn't a man enough for her. And she had the gall to say that when I called up her family when she was away to check up on her to make sure she was okay (she had been acting weird), it was disrespectful of me to do that when the first thing I had told her mother was that I was truly sorry for the misunderstanding that had happened last month and I hope that it could be forgiven. She got upset because I didn't wish her a ""Happy Lunar New Year"" when I don't even fucking know when that is (yes, I'm Asian, no, I don't really care).

It was at this stage that it clicked; I was dealing with the standard woman - the emotional four year old that I shouldn't even entertain. I told her that her and her family should realize that life doesn't always work the way that they want or think that it should, and that I hoped that they can realize this for the future. In response, she told me that she was throwing away all the books and things that I have lent her, was ashamed to date someone from my school, and that I had an ego to second guess someone that's older than I am.

I replied, ""Wow. What a petty response. Grow up.""

And that was that."
2xhogk,3,2015-02-28,This has never happened to me. I [22/M] need to know what the next step of my relationship is with my girlfriend. [22/F],ILikeMiley,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2xhogk/this_has_never_happened_to_me_i_22m_need_to_know/,"Hello.

I'm writing this as I sit alone, confused in my room thinking if I should end this relationship.

Well, I've been in this relationship with my girlfriend for a little over than a year and a half. 

We both are med students, and we both moved together to another city to continue our studies around 6 months ago.

We do not live together. In fact, she has a twin sister, and I live with her sister's boyfriend. 

Well, the relationship was never perfect, but today I feel that it wont get any better.

We've had our fights, good and bad moments, but around two weeks ago, things are feeling very wierd for me. 

Around a week ago, she's been very verbaly and emotionaly agresive with me, for things that I only was trying to help.

It al started around three weeks ago, when we were standing in line waiting for her to deliver some paperwork to our University administration office. 

Since we are on our last year of med school, we had no idea how much time of vacation we would have aroun june and july (It's usualy around a month). But since this is going to be our last break before we take our internships, the time of vacation is reduced.

Well, she wanted to know how much of time we had so she could buy her ticket to visit her parents. I went ahead and asked and they said: You guys will have two weeks of break.

I told her that, but I said that the dates could change, because they usualy do, and to not buy her plane ticket now, wait until oficial dates are set. 

Around a week passed after that. I was waiting for her in our classroom talking with some friends (I was saving her a place up front) and she stormed into the classroom and said in front of everyone this, and I quote: 

&gt; Where the fuck did you heard that the winter break was three weeks? From your ass? I almost bought my plane ticket because of you.

Well, I stood there in silence while everyone was staring, and she went ahead and sat down somewhere else in the classroom. 

That day I went to her house and said to her that I was only trying to help and that her reaction was..... well, you know. 

Somehow, we ended up okay after that, until last week.


We had a test, and we were waiting for the Dr. to arrive and we were discusing some of the content. There was a number that she did not know, and she asked me about it. 

I was reading at the bus and I read the number (It was some lab data), but since I was on the bus I did not payed much atention to it, because the Dr. said, and I quote: I WILL NOT BE ASKING FOR LABORATORY PARAMETERS IN THE EXAM.

She asked me, and since I could not remember I told her, and I quote: I don't remember very well since I read it on my bus ride here, but I think its 35.

Well, no lab parameters were asked on our test, but when the class was over, she opened her book to find some of the answers and that lab data I said earlier on was not 35, it was 33.

Then, she proceded to erase the 35 she had pointed out while saying: This number is wrong, this is shit shit shit. 

Like I always do, I stayed in silence and went ahead of with my day. 

Later that day, we were walking home and she was saying some hurtful things. She said that I was never going to make it as a doctor, and some stuff like that. (We both are in the top 5 of the class, so that is not the case).

I said to stop saying stuff like that, that I was only trying to help.

Well, since then, she barely says hi to me around campus. Everytime I talk to her she acts like she is anoyed. 

She texts me only to say that I dont say hi to her the proper way (which is not true, she is the one that barely raises her head to look at me when I arrive and she is reading something). 

So, we usually spend saturdays together. I tried to called her early in the morning and her phone was off. 

I went ahead and get lunch, and when I got back, I heard her sister laughing across my roommate's dorm. 

I tought nothing about it, and I decided to go visit her so we can talk things throug. 

I took a shower, and was about to go, when my roomates door opens, and she and her sister came out. 

So basically, she was in my house for about three hours, with her sister and my roommate watching movies or something, and didnt even bother to come and say hi to me. 

She left, I said nothing when I saw her. Now im sitting here wonering what to do. 

My gut says to end this, but I need your opinion on the situation.

Thank you for giving me your time. 

(sorry for any spelling mistakes, english is not my native lenguage).

    Secondly, if anyone knows any low priced housing/apartments in the area that would be awesome! It seriously can be a dump (as long as the area isn't tooo dangerous). I have some money saved up from work but my price range would be around $450-750 a month.

Other than submitting my transcripts and writing the short statement of purpose, is there anything else I need to really worry about? Will anyone ask me about my interest in CS or programming at any point, or is the expectation that if you have a degree already and are crazy enough to spend $28k on another one, you're in? The only issue I can see is that I didn't take any math courses in college, but that's because I completed Calculus in HS and tested out of my math req at Cal (where I ended up getting an English degree).

I have seen this asked elsewhere in the forums, but for existing students: have you been able to find internships? I'd like to eventually stop working full-time and seek some work in the industry and so I'm quite curious. I'm more interested in web dev, so I think with a few more months of working on my side-projects I would be at least somewhat employable anyway... or at least, I hope.

Anyway, I'm excited about the prospect of all this. I expect the program to be challenging in a lot of ways, but it seems for the most part that people find value in it. And most of the program graduates I've Google stalked seem to have jobs &lt;1 year after graduating, so I take that as a reasonably good sign. I'm definitely not making a huge mistake, right guys? Right??!!?!"
2xia43,3,2015-02-28,"Me [20 F] with my bf [19 M] of a year and a half, he confessed to being disloyal to me",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2xia43/me_20_f_with_my_bf_19_m_of_a_year_and_a_half_he/,"We normally hang out on Fridays, and yesterday he sent me a text asking me to come over earlier because he had a confession to make and wanted time to talk. Turns out, he wrote me a letter to get all his thoughts in order and he wanted me to read it.

The long and short of it is that he cheated on me twice in this relationship. The first time was just after we starting dating (we were official), and he continued to flirt with a girl he met on tumblr. At the time, it was because he wanted to engage in his weight gain kink with her and we had just met, but about a month later the relationship was getting more serious, we started talking about individual kinks and he was honest about his interests to me and I accepted him, so he cut it off with her. He deleted his blog about two months later because he wanted to resist the temptation to flirt. They never met, and nothing physical happened between them - the only thing they shared was the kink.

This far, I can kind of gloss over it. We were a new relationship, he'd just met me, and he's been afraid to talk to people about his sexual interests because he didn't want to be humiliated (based on what I've read from comments online, this is understandable). Keeping the blog after that is questionable, but maybe he wanted to engage in his interests there and quit when he realized he had a problem. Okay.

The issue is after this. We met at college, and I'm from out of state - we live about 11 hours apart. He got on a plane to meet me for a week over the summer (we both worked part-time and this was the only time we could fit it in our schedules), stayed at my house, and went back home. I have no problem with long distance, I guess because my parents are an international marriage and I've grown up used to the idea that it's possible. According to his letter, it drove him crazy that he had to wait another two months just to see me, and he gave up on our relationship. He sent messages to up to 10 women, half of which responded. Sent pictures to three of them, and sexted one of them. The one he sexted he considered getting into a relationship with. Apparently they skyped, too, and he got himself off on camera after she asked him to.

He told me the reason he didn't break up with me, and kept talking to me, was because he's been broken up via text by an ex and he wanted to break up with me properly. And of course, when we met up again after the break, he changed his mind and stopped contacting her.

It didn't occur to him that what he did was an act of betrayal until about two months ago. My guess is that this was when my birthday happened, and we started having serious conversations about where the relationship was going. I got an internship, he started applying to them. Life stuff. He couldn't bring himself to tell me because he was afraid to lose me, but was on the verge of having a mental breakdown because of the guilt and couldn't keep lying to me anymore.

We both cried. It was a mess. He admitted what he did was cheating, that he should never have done it and he had no right to ask me to stay. I questioned him and he claims he hasn't done anything like this since then, but agrees that his word isn't worth much anymore, if anything.

My question isn't whether to break up with him. I already decided to stay. If he'd never admitted it to me I never would have known in the first place, and he's agreed to go to counseling. I don't know if that will solve all our problems, but I figure if this is a problem with his ability to cope it needs to be addressed. I'm planning to go back to counseling myself to deal with this.

What I need advice on is what to do after this. I know that if this happens again I'll break up with him, but how do I deal with it if it does? I don't think I can handle it. I get upset about this in bursts, is that normal? Maybe a lot of this gets answered in therapy but it'll be a while before I can get a session at my school. I just want to know how to face the aftermath.

tl;dr: Boyfriend owned up to cheating on me, I'm going to stay, need advice on what to do next."
2xib6m,1,2015-02-28,I learned Obj-C/Cocoa the quick and dirty way - I'd like to become a more polished iOS developer,FetaAndKalamata,iOSProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/2xib6m/i_learned_objccocoa_the_quick_and_dirty_way_id/,"I got an internship with a small tech startup this past summer and was more-or-less completely in charge of developing our alpha (for lack of a better term) iOS app, which made it to the App Store. 

To get started, I went through some Ray Wanderlich tutorials and spent a lot of time on Stack Overflow. At the time, I already had a pretty solid C/C++ background, so I caught on pretty quickly. However, there were concepts such as property attributes that I never really spent time on understanding; I just did what felt right and if it worked, it worked. 

Given that I'm already pretty deep into iOS, are there any good guides out there that I won't get bored with? I want to know all the ins-and-outs of iOS development, but I know I won't be able to keep the patience to read about things that I'm already past in introduction material. 

I was thinking about going through Apple's ""Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C"" in hopes that I'd still be learning new material, but at the same times filling in gaps. 

Any other recommendations? "
