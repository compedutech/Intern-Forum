I have clinical depression (since 2001), and chronic fatigue syndrome (since 2006)

A senior specialist in the area which I plan to specialise is on my mind a lot. He is a grade A twat. I have a position to specialise in a different hospital in another part of the country but whilst I'm still here I have to deal with him. 
He is extremely intelligent but socially awkward and not very popular. He is known for being difficult and many people avoid him. 
I shouldn't have to deal with him much for the remainder of the internship but he is still on my mind and I'm in a state of constant inner turmoil. 

When discussing a patient he will make things difficult and ask challenging questions and focus on minute details that don't matter. After arguing with my recommendations and treatment plans and making me feel like something he found on his shoe he will mumble that my plan is fine (and yet he spent so long making me feel like a fool). If I talk to him about something and he disagrees with it I will try and explain my thoughts by saying 'I read...' and he will interrupt quickly with 'I don't care what you've read' and not give me a chance. 
Despite knowing that I have a position to specialise in my chosen field he will belittle me when discussing a case by saying 'well I wouldn't expect just an intern to know that' or make similar comments over and over making me feel as though he has no faith in me. 
I dread seeing him in the hallways and when I was working with him in his department I would hate the thought of going in to work. 

Even now, in bed when I should be relaxing I'm thinking of the negativity he makes me feel. I'm usually a joyful, pleasant person but he sucks it out of me. 

My fellow interns understand my feelings but as they have no interest in his field of study his mannerisms don't bother them much. 

I'm not sure what is going on. Is this just me? Is he a bully? 

How can I ignore it and not let him bother me? 

I really really want to stand up to him but I can't. I feel like a pathetic, weak child at school in front of a monstrous bully who overshadows me and I say nothing :(

I also worrying about saying something as the specialist world in veterinary medicine is a small one.

I have been coding for 5 months now solid, everyday just grinding to get better and keep learning new technologies. I have been following the freecodecamp track, im 2 projects away from completing the front end portion. I remade my portfolio once i felt i knew enough and to start applying to jobs. the point of the new portfolio was to showcase skill better then what fcc projects did i think and i needed something much better then my first attempt at creating a portfolio.. anyway.. I have started to look for employment now and have been for about two weeks for front-end developer, junior level position or even an internship i just want to get that experience and my foot in the door. Good news is, i have landed a first stage interview with a company in toronto on monday. I am not sure what to expect to come of it but i will keep grinding, working on projects, bettering myself to get the job i want. So to my question. With everything i have already done and that shows in my portfolio and in GitHub (i just start contributing to an open source project thats a chrome app). Is there anything in there that you would see as a employer and say ""we do not want that guy"" or does the work i have done show that i would be ready for a entree level job? Is there anything i could do better? do you see something that is really poor that i could improve on? Should I just work at improving what i have already or keep making new projects and adding to the list? I myself feel that i am ready for a junior level position. i have the ambition to learn more not just to get a job but to just be better at what i love to do and thats to create web things. Next on my list to add to skills is angular.js which i have already started to study.

The internship is at a major Bay Area firm where the dress code is ""casual"" (from what I understand this implies business casual OR a step below). Here are the considerations that are making it difficult for me to decide what to get:

1. I feel uncomfortable in shoes that are long and/or large, like Wingtips, and I'd like to avoid anything flashy, so loafers / penny loafers appeal to me as a good style choice.

2. I don't own any nice dress shoes (for formal events), just a $60 pair of Rockports. Hence, I like the idea of buying a pair of [Allen Edmonds Cavanaughs](http://www.allenedmonds.com/shoes/mens-shoes/dress-shoes/cavanaugh-penny-loafers/50025-085-3E.html?utm_source=cse&amp;utm_medium=google&amp;utm_campaign=50025-085-3E&amp;CAWELAID=520006330000195339&amp;CAGPSPN=pla&amp;CAAGID=22449920099&amp;CATCI=aud-106330622459:pla-156619198619&amp;catargetid=520006330000352515&amp;cadevice=c&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwr5G5BRD_n-T0pf7x4ucBEiQAlxHOPzMTeM6DfqDmJ1bqXl5nvsCK6QYfgM_eU69MGztlk5saAu2l8P8HAQ) or [Waldens](http://reviews.allenedmonds.com/7512-en_us/SF42470/walden-penny-loafers-reviews/reviews.htm?sort=helpfulness), which would also go well with chinos or jeans.

3. I'm very hesitant to buy shoes as nice and expensive as the above two, since I'm not sure how long they'd last if I wore them every day for 10 weeks, and I'd hate to wear them out at my first internship (especially one with a low-key dress code).

4. I don't own any casual slipons, and I like the idea of getting Sperry [Gold Cup Kennebunks](http://www.sperry.com/en/gold-cup-kennebunk-asv-venetian-loafer/10639M.html?dwvar_10639M_color=10847061) or [Hampden Venitians](http://www.sperry.com/en/hampden-penny-loafer/16177M.html?dwvar_16177M_color=STS10721#cgid=men-shoes-loafers-mocs&amp;start=1). Shoes like these would be great for clubbing and nights out, when sneakers don't suffice. Unfortunately, even if these loafers are acceptable at my work, I'm afraid they might be leaning toward the informal side, and I feel like it's better to err on the formal side.

5. Sperry [Essex Penny Loafers](http://www.sperry.com/en/essex-penny-loafer/16165M.html?dwvar_16165M_color=STS10201&amp;ref=essex#q=essex&amp;start=1) seem to be a solution, but I'm not sure whether they're nice enough to wear with a suit to formal events, or suitable for clubbing and casual wear.

Does anyone know of a pair of shoes that might solve my dilemna? My budget is roughly $275, but I'd like to make purchases that will last me for some time.

My parents know that I have gone through the two violations. Last night, for the first time ever, I got arrested for weed along with another person although I never remember admitting to smoking weed since only the other person was a fucking idiot and got scared and said that he and I did smoke. There was a third person with us who didnt get arrested and was left alone. 

The cops manipulated and lied so that they could get a confession out of my friend who said he smoked I guess. Now I am facing two charges for possession and since it was my colleges' police department, I think the college will find out. Can someone please tell me what I should do because I just want to fucking kill myself since I cant find any escape in this situation Im in. I will lose a majority of my friends if I am held back somehow. I dont know what I want to do in my life, Im ugly, I am incapable of getting a relationship/friends/ so many other things and dont know how to react. I have to pay fines and get a record. Maybe I can expunge the record, maybe I can reapply for school but right now it makes no sense to me. I just want to continue with my school but just feel like I fucked myself over so hard that Ill experience horrible consequences. 

I dont think I can get a job or internship now in this upcoming year or maybe even longer. I cant study for finals even though theres two weeks left because Im stressed and scared. I dont know what to do with my life. I have a whole next three months to look forward to of staying alone with my parents at home over the summer break. Tommorow I have to call them and tell them I got arrested which will only break their hearts again and Im sorry they have a piece of shit son like me who lies again and again.

I have some questions about possibly transferring to CompSci.

So I am currently a sophomore and I go to Behrend right now with a 2.65 GPA.  This semester was my ETM pool semester and I got put into EE.  My first and second choices for my major were CompSci and CompEng, but they both had a 3.0 GPA requirement which meant I got put into my last choice which was EE.

The 2017 ETM pool (next spring) has a 2.60 GPA cutoff for CompSci.  Can I somehow try to enter that major through the ETM process again?

Or do I need to try and do a change of major request and get tight with the CompSci faculty?

I know for a fact that I am comfortable with CompSci and programming is something I enjoy doing every day.  I have a portfolio of projects that I have worked on and a github account with a few projects that I have worked on in teams.  Me and my team won 1st place at HackPSU a couple of weekends ago and I have a software development internship lined up for this summer.

I fucked up in Calc 2 and got C's in both my physics classes (211 and 212) and got a C in calc 1.  I hear that EE is so math and physics intensive and I am worried that this will ruin my GPA.

- Tuition is 100% covered by grants and scholarships!   
- 100% debt free.  

Bad News:   
- Bills don't stop.  
- I can't seem to get a job. I'm a great hard worker and I've had some interviews, but when I tell the potential employer I'm going to school full time they frown and go with someone else.   
- I don't have enough experience yet for an intern programming position. But employers of unrelated fields frown on hiring me because I'm ultimately going to a different field.  
-  Rent goes up $100 next month. From $850 to $950. I can't move because I have no job. Also we are in the cheapest apartment we could find already! (School has no dorms).   

Background:  
- My wife works 7-3pm and brings in about $1300/month.   
- Bills are $1900+ every month.   
- I need to earn $600+ per month while in school.   
- School hours are M-F either 9-11am or 10-4pm depending on the day.   
- I have been offered 10k in student loans, but debt is not OK and really only a last option before homelessness to me.  

I'm not opposed to working evenings and weekends. However if I work an evening/weekend schedule I don't get to see my wife much. While we can make some sacrifice, we need time together for a healthy relationship. 

What are some creative (out of the box) ways I can earn $600-1000 per month during school with an irregular schedule? ( jobs, freelancing, entrepreneuring, etc.) 

Are fast-food/retail jobs my only option? 

How can I find a place to rent or negotiate rent that is less than the lowest on the market? ($750/month would be great)"

My last attempt to quit went good I guess. Basically I got a few months into quitting before starting to toke again.

It was a learning experience because over the months that I had quit, things got better for me and I found a new appreciation for everything.

The reason I started smoking again was because I got home from uni for the xmas holidays and that meant 2 months of sitting idle, bored out of my mind. I thought, ""Hey, I don't drink, I don't smoke and I no longer toke."" Then I though I would crack out the bong and just smoke for the holidays and quit..

The thing is, I never got round to stopping but at the same time I didn't over do it with weed. This time I stayed sensible and kept my shit together. I missed a bit of uni but I made all my deadlines and my grades are far better. The problem is all the other shit parts of toking have started slowly coming back; fogginess, detachment, paranoia and anxiety isn't as bad but its there, etc, etc.

I have been talking about quitting again for a while now because I actually landed myself a software job as an intern. I start the job soon and it's actually a requirement for my uni course, 1 year needs to be in the industry.

I need this job to work out and I can't take any risks because this is my future. I need to be functioning 100% of the time and not be a foggy mess who doesn't fully wake up until mid-afternoon.

I know I can do it this time because I'm in a better place mentally and financially for the first time in a while.

I started cutting back for like the last month because of the immense amount of work I had to complete for uni.

I have properly quit from Friday. The first night I was fucking dripping with sweat, sleep was pretty brutal to non existant. Nobody likes waking up to towel themselves off multiple times a night. Got a solid 8 hours last night though, no waking up. Vivid dreams are back too, even had a dream within a dream which is cool.

Starting the gym again tomorrow and getting back in shape and to keep busy.

Oh fuck, yea the big problem which I never mentioned.

I FUCKING BOOKED AMSTERDAM!

Yea so that was a fuck up on my behalf, I booked a holiday to Amsterdam with my girlfriend for a week. I did it back at the start of the year. I guess that will be a tough holiday but sure I can update this as I go.

Looking forward to this pilgrimage of quitting and keeping it up this time.

Today something came to my mind that kind of scares me now. 


I was talking to a friend about working in the US and he told me that he was working there and before he came back made his taxes and whatsoever. After this talk I was thinking about if I did my taxes back in 2014 when I was working as an intern for 4 months in the US. I remembered some email I got from the government or something that I need to do my taxes. I guess I forgot about it or something and never did it since then. I earned about 3k in that 4 months. I started googling today what could possibly happen because of that issue and I read that I could get into a lot of trouble if I ever return to the US(Which I plan to to do for my holidays in the future). So here I am. I don't know what my options are and that's why I'm posting here.


Since I never got any other notice since then I guess it should not be that much trouble but I want to be on the safe side when it comes to that. I don't want to get pulled over at the airport for some taxthing I forgot because I was just too lazy to do it right away.


Can anyone help me? Should I contact one of those taxcompanies that help you with your taxes or should I just let it slide because it was not enough money to pay taxes? I really don't know and could not find any links that could help me.
Would be awesome if any of you guys has some good recommendations for my next steps.

As you get uplifted from meek first-year students to bold seniors, you become, well, bold. 

This is what happened the day before yesterday, in the morning after I got drunk with my friends and seniors. I was hungover the whole time this happened.

So, our seniors, soon passing out of the college, were with us drinking beer and whiskey. Everyone but I smoked too. It was all very good, everything went smooth. I slept at 5, the others slept at 6. I woke up at 11 to sit dummy for a company that came to our campus to recruit interns, and saw the Hostel In-charge, DK, barging into our flat and searching for stuff (bottles, actually). I took the cigarette packet out of the bin in the gallery he was walking in because it was too conspicuous, but it turned out to be useless, as we'll see later.

He went into my room and saw an unburnt cigarette on my table, and asked, ""Ye kaun peeta hai?"" *(Who smoked this?)* to which I said, ""Sir, maine nahin pi,"" *(Sir, I didn't)* and went off to wake others up. (AA, my flatmate, was sitting like ducks when this was happening, that useless creature). When I came back, the guard who came with DK was looking under my room's beds and found three beer bottles and three whiskey bottles from last night.
I was freaking out on the inside. DK asked me to fetch a bucket to carry the evidence in. I obediently did so. He then proceeded to go downstairs, talking on the phone with some professor (who work doubly as wardens as well) regarding misbehavior by some students the night before. I heard him say something about video evidence submitted by the residents of nearby houses to the warden. That's when I thought I was in deep blue shit. I asked what is going to happen to us, and he said that he'll try to do the best he can (worst punishment, maybe). By then, Piyush had woken up and gotten dressed, so he was a part of the negotiations as well.
DK and the guard went to the backside of our cottage to look at the line of houses adjoining ours, trying to make out something I didn't know then. He had also asked about how we climbed our terrace (which we cannot because there is no direct way; no stairs -- cement, or bamboo, or iron).
All this while, PD (my best friend) and I were discussing how to minimize our chances of getting rusticated.
The guard was a swine; a total philanderer; he showed me his ""item"", his ""girlfriend"", and his wife on his phone while I tried to pry information out of him.

So, the four of us (DK, the lecherous guard, PD, and I) are standing and talking, when DS, my roommate, comes, hungover and haggard. DK asks, ""Tumne bhi pi thi?"" *(Did you drink, too?)*. DS says, sheepishly, ""Sir, mere room mein hi mili hai, pi to hogi hi..."" *(The stash was found in my room; I would be lying if I said I didn't)*
It turned out that the warden and the guard weren't aware of the cottage number. And ours wasn't the one with ""students doing obscene actions"". The cottage they were looking for was 36, while ours is number 41. The guys in that cottage were pulling some weird shit (the guard told), which got recorded on camera. DK was just checking every cottage in the row to catch them but found our stash by fluke.

I'd spend the first 3 months of a semester goofing off. Then when I realise that I'm in serious danger of failing, everything is pushed aside. I study for 9 hours straight, keep a good diet and exercise. Literally do everything to get me in top condition for exams, then I pass.

What I'd like is for me to cultivate this motivation into everyday life. I recently started an internship in which I was arriving late to work everyday. So much so that eventually my boss said *We like you a lot in terms of your work, but if you're late again I'm going to have to let you go*

Next day, up at 6am, going for a jog. First guy and last guy in the office for a week.

The frustrating this is I know I'm capable of the grind it takes to become successful. But my mind needs to go into survival mode to achieve it. I really want to be able to bring this out more often, obviously without endangering anything intentionally because that would be foolish. Does anyone have any advice?"

Sent to my boyfriend of course... And my other friend. The one that I fooled around sometimes. It felt wrong to say that I was cheating on him. Cheating sounded so dirty, so wrong, so naughty. Which was nice when I was in the moment, riding my lover...

I preferred the term knowing what I want and taking it. I love my boyfriend but he really can't pleasure me like Nathan can... I grabbed my morning apple from the side, striding over to the couch and laying down, turning on the TV. The news was on.

""Something has happened, there's a virus, Quanxin Corporation have spread their nanobots, infecting anyone... Lock your doors. Supply food. They're coming... No... Please!"" The middle-aged, balding man pushed away on his office chair, and... A [stunning blonde girl](http://i.imgur.com/WeJiRRd.jpg) that must be some intern or something stumbled into shot, giggling as she planted a soft kiss on his lips, her fake-nailed hands slowly sliding down to unzip his pants...

And I watched as before my eyes his hair began to grow, his face change, watched as she pulled out his hard cock and watched it shrink into... Nothingness. ""Not again, darn it! Come on, Kandy, let's find some more cock."" The bimbo intern giggles, taking a lick of the fresh pussy that just appeared in front of my eyes before moving away from the camera, leaving the... Bimbo? What was once the news reporter there, panting, his... No, her hands rubbing furiously as she experienced her first orgasm. The camera was knocked over, the screen shattered and somebody pulled the wire out. Or tripped over it.

What the actual fuck happened. I turned off the TV, throwing my apple core into the bin as I looked out of the apartment window. My phone vibrated twice in a row. I picked it up, seeing texts from both my boyfriend and lover. Both of them were saying to get to their places as soon as possible, that they would protect me. I turned my phone off.

It was an apocalypse. I had to save myself. I grabbed one of the big kitchen knifes with the serrated edge, and grabbed a sweater to pull over my skin. How did this... Virus work? I looked out of the window again. Blonde bimbos with massive fake tits were chasing down girls and boys. I watched one of them take down a mother running with her two twelve-year old children, turning the mother into a bimbo almost instantly. I turned away before they caught the children.

As I opened the door out of my apartment, I heard a scream. At the end of the corridor I saw one of the girls I share lectures with on her knees, her mouth eagerly licking out a bimbo with... Brunette hair? I watched Cathy's hair bleach blonde, her tits balloon as if it was some sort of voodoo magic. I turned around and sprinted towards the staircase.

---

Who are you? My boyfriend who found out I was cheating? My lover who wants to hunt down my boyfriend and get two bimbo babes? Another survivor entirely? The idea is that we don't get infected instantly, so it will be a bit of a story... Of course, with all these bimbos letting off all their pheromones, you can get awfully horny...

I prefer people who actually reply to the roleplay. No limits, I have a lotta kinks."
4hbevq,12,2016-05-01,"Third year undergrad overwhelmed by finals, internships, and side projects. What should I do?",PVCUREGRKG,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4hbevq/third_year_undergrad_overwhelmed_by_finals/,"First off, I'm currently a junior at a university with a decent computer science program. I'm also in a state that has one of the best job market's for computer science grads on the east coast. I currently have a 2.8 GPA and have completed most courses without asking a question. I've never asked a coding question on an internet forum either, I prefer answering questions on my own to make sure I fully understand what's going on even when it takes a considerably long time. I get along quite well with other CS students but wouldn't consider any of them ""friends"". Most of my real friends are majoring in engineering and can't really relate to CS, so I'm kind of on my own.

Now don't get me wrong, I love comp sci, I'm just lost and having trouble figuring out what I really enjoy and want to do with my life. I've been applying to internships since December and haven't heard back from any of the 20+ companies I've sent my resume to. This has kind of sent me into a spiral towards the end of this semester and now I have little to no ambition to study for my finals this week. Since I have nothing practical to do over this summer, I'm kind of freaking out that I have 2 semesters left and that I'll have no real world experience once I graduate.
At this point the best thing for me to do this summer is to work on personal projects to help pump up my resume and portfolio as they're kind of weak. With just a simple Android app, a few multithreading C programs, and a C++ program that solves a Rubik's cube, I feel that I'm not making myself stand out to any particular company or industry.

Overall, I just feel lost and just don't know what I should expect down the road. I've been flip-flopping between getting a masters degree(in data science or security) and entering the workforce with no experience once I get my B.S. 

With that overview I have a few questions I'd like to ask.

1) Is it normal to feel so lost and helpless even though I love most of my courses and projects?

2) Since I failed to get an internship for this summer, is there anything that you'd recommend for me to work on this summer in addition to personal projects?

3) Are there any ways that I could gain real world experience before graduating in May 2017?

4) How can I figure out what I love to do within computer science (security, back-end web development, embedded systems, system programming, etc.) when my assignments and courses take up most of my time? (I usually get burnt out after finishing an assignment and end up hanging out with friends instead of continuing to work on a personal project)

5) If I can't choose an area within computer science that I like most, how should I know what to focus on and study now?

...For instance I have an FPGA that I've used to help me learn verilog, I have a TI microcontroller that I've used to help me learn about embedded systems, I have a RaspberryPi that I've used to help me learn about IPsec, etc. etc..
I'm all over the place and I love it all! What should I do?

6) ^^ Should I have included these things on my resume? 
I didn't want to seem too low level even though these are the things I enjoy.

7) Am I worrying too much?

Thanks in advance for your help!"

I had a summer internship during school writing a tracking algorithm for detection of a psmove-like controller. Then I spent my final year doing a CV intensive capstone project. During which I took a class on machine learning and a graduate level CV class. For as much as I felt I have learned I know how in depth the majority of CV algorithms are and understand I am only scratching the surface.

I have been searching far and wide to find a job in CV software development but it seems 99% of the jobs require a masters at least and usually PhD preferred. I have looked at grad school but I have to pay off some of my loans before I can go. So is there hope for me finding what I want? I have been constantly reviewing advanced c++ courses in order to prepare for any and all coding interviews but I fear that is not enough. Any advice on what course of action I should take is appreciated. 

A little off topic but say I were to want to review/learn more CV concepts. Would it be better to have a breadth of knowledge of many CV concepts or would it be better to solely focus on one e.g. facetracking using AAM, SLAM, etc."

4hbkv7,1,2016-05-01,"Me [19 M] with my long-distance girlfriend [18 F] of 6 months, for some reason I'm not ""feeling it"" sexually",throwaway41195,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4hbkv7/me_19_m_with_my_longdistance_girlfriend_18_f_of_6/,"Background: My girlfriend and I met on /r/littlepersonals about 6 months ago. We've had a very successful long-distance relationship since then, and I'm very, *very* happy with her -- and she's very happy with me. We're both in school, so we don't get many breaks, but she came to visit me over spring break. It was an amazing time.

Before she visited, when we wanted to have ""sex"" and be intimate, we would text dirty things, send pictures, and masturbate on video chat. We're both pretty self-conscious about our bodies, so when we masturbate on video chat, the camera is just on our faces, so no ""naughty parts"" are seen.

When she visited, though, we had lots of sex. Over the course of spring break we probably had PIV sex more/less 10 times, and were otherwise doing sexual things (mostly me groping/fingering/spanking her) probably more often than not.

Since then, going back to how ""sex"" was before the visit has been really rough for both of us. We both really miss the sex because it was absolutely amazing. But the problem I'm having is that I'm not really turned on when we do sexual stuff anymore. She doesn't really send pictures anymore, and we don't send dirty texts much anymore. We masturbate on video chat every once in a while, but it just doesn't turn me on as much as it used to.

At first I thought it was because of my medication, because I was recently put on a new antidepressant. However, recently I've found myself getting really turned on, and when I watch porn and masturbate, I feel very aroused.

But when it comes to masturbating on video chat with her, I'm just not as interested as I used to be. I'm still very attracted to her physically, and I'm sure that if she was here I'd be very DTF, but the long-distance sex thing just isn't doing it for me right now.

I definitely don't want to break up, because I love her very much, and everything in our relationship is great besides this issue. We have a plan in place for closing the distance as well. Since we're both in school, we won't be able to close the distance until after we both graduate, so it'll be a few years, but until then we will have regular visits. We can do spring break, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and the summer. I have an internship lined up for this summer (and if I do well, for every summer until I graduate), where I'll be staying in corporate housing, and we're going to see how well it goes to have her stay with me.

But in between all of those visits, I find myself being very sexually frustrated. How can I fix this? Should I talk to her about sending more pictures (unfortunately she might be uncomfortable with that) and sending more dirty texts? Is there something new we can try? I'd really appreciate some advice.

Thanks!

   
**tl;dr**: My long-distance girlfriend came to visit me over spring break and we had lots of mind-blowing sex. Since then, I haven't been very turned on by our long-distance ""sex,"" even though I still get turned on and like to watch porn and what not. This has led to a lot of sexual frustration for me, and I suspect for her as well. How can I spice up our long-distance sex life?

EDIT: I'm not 100% sure this is the proper subreddit for this. I've also considered posting to /r/sex or /r/longdistance. If there's a better subreddit, let me know!"

4hd6ij,9,2016-05-01,Unemployed at 29 with a skillset not in line with labour market. Considering going to college to re-enter the workforce.,jobsthrowawayaccount,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/4hd6ij/unemployed_at_29_with_a_skillset_not_in_line_with/,"Throwaway account because I'm a little embarrassed.  I find myself at 29  and Unemployed for over a year. It feels like I need to rebuild my life from the ground up.  I recently was able to pull myself out of the depression spiral that I got into over the last year, but I’m still struggling for a path forward and finding a career. 

 I have a degree in political that I got when I was 25 (I went to school at 21 after being a high school drop out) but it’s not leading to great employment outcomes.  I considered becoming educated the solution to my job problems prior to being 21.  I did a lot of job hopping being school, so I didn’t have a lot of experience to fall back on.

 I believe my current skillset is not in line with the labour market demands here in Toronto.

*  I did sort of luck out and landed an internship in an IT consulting/ managed services company straight out of university, although the places was a disaster and completely disorganized and had a crazy high turnover rate.
* Spent a year as a project coordinator and then project manager: burned out, got fired, brought in and then
* Promoted to Relationship Manager, spent a year in this role, and made some sales into my accounts.
* Decided to return to school at York U to upgrade my bachelor to try to apply to law school.  Ended up dropping out and spiraling into a depression.

I’ve done a lot of interviews over 2015, but most failed to produce an offer.  I was on a role for a bit getting a lot of interviews, and going through multiple rounds but had other candidates chosen over me due to their experience.

Right now I can’t even seem to land a part time job in retail or at a grocery store.  I’ve been rejected in person and online, even when using a toned down resume.  I don’t really have part time experience to fall back on from when I was younger, which is what I assume most under employed arts grads do.  So this leaves me in a bit of a bind.

I’m considering going back to school, at a college in a technical field.  I’m even taking an upgrading math course, and have figured out that I can actually do math- which opens up a lot of options for me moving forward.   I’ve considered a post grad in marketing, engineering technology programs (and considering bridging into a university program out of it) and IT and computer programs.  I've also considered a trade, but it's not my first choice.

I’m becoming paralyzed from overthinking and can’t figure out what to do moving forward to find a rewarding career that I can do well at, and also pull in some good pay.  I’m leaning towards the engineering route so I can design and build things, but it’s a long path head, I’m broke (but would have OSAP) and it’s not a great feeling to be in this situation at 29.

Maybe there is something I’m not seeing here.  Thoughts?

What do you do if you don't have any internship experience? I've seen around that you cannot apply for internships post graduation? Would you have to apply for full time jobs or spend your time creating individual projects if you don't have enough experience? 
4hdohc,6,2016-05-01,I need some advice,IPromiseImNotSkynet,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4hdohc/i_need_some_advice/,"Okay so I just finished my final semester of college and I'm having a hard time finding a job. I majored in Computer Science and I would think finding a job would be relatively easy considering every company needs programmers for something, and since all of my friends from school got offers from one or more companies weeks or months before the semester ended.

But that's not the case with me. In February I started applying everywhere in my area that I felt I had even the slightest chance of getting a job. I probably sent out 20+ resumes. I had a few interviews; 3 phone interviews and 2 in-person interviews, and I still have one more in person interview next week. I've thought that all of my interviews went pretty well, not necessarily perfect but by no means bad, but I have gotten nothing by bad news from all of these companies. Every company I've talked to has sent me that ""we're pursuing other candidates"" email.

I don't know what the hell is going on. My resume isn't the shiniest thing in the world but its not completely blank either. I have projects that I did on my own time throughout the past few years and I've even gotten compliments on the work during interviews. 

What I think the big problem is that I didn't have any internships. Why, you might ask? Because I didn't have the level of experience that they were looking for at the time. I've tried to get experience, but no company wants to give me experience, therefore I don't have any experience. 

The other problem that I see is my GPA. I'll be honest it's not great. I had my fair share of shitty professors that graded unnecessarily hard after not teaching the content very well at all, and I also had a few elective classes that I didn't give a shit about because more important classes were taking up all of my time. So I have a wide range of grades on my record. So when employers have been asking me what my GPA is I've been telling them 'about 3.0' because that's what I thought it was. Well I just learned today that it's not that good. It's more like a 2.7, so that is only going to make things more difficult since the only thing people seem to care about is GPA. I don't think it reflects my capabilities or work ethic at all but nobody seems to care about that.

So like I said I've applied everywhere I thought I stood a chance at and have been ignored or turned down by all of them except the one I still have an interview scheduled for. So what the hell am I supposed to do? I mean if this last one falls through I feel like I'm just completely fucked. My only thoughts from there are to try to get certifications and try again, but the whole ""you'll find something"" and ""everything will work out"" bullshit that everyone around me is telling me isn't helping me find a job any quicker. So does anybody have any useful advice so I don't become a worthless piece of shit like the rest of my family?"

4hdtnz,2,2016-05-01,Tomorrow makes one week!,yourfavoritestone,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/4hdtnz/tomorrow_makes_one_week/,"You don't have to be a ""smoke weed all day every day"" stoner to quit smoking bud.

I started smoking when I was a junior in high school. After I got my first job, it was a ton of fun to young me. I would throw down some money, hang out with my stoner friends, and eat a bunch of convenience store snacks.

College hit and I was stoned almost every night. Got busted by campus police (no serious consequences, but I did get threatened to get kicked off of campus), and bought a vape to hide the strong scent. Months went by, I was getting stoned more effectively than ever and it became a nightly habit, especially when I'm home and I can do whatever I want in my room. That habit lasted well over two years. Switched my major a few times and landed on graphic design (I love what I do, I've done art all my life and finally decided to pursue my passion and forget about the potential job-availability risk. I was going to give it my all.)

I once decided to take a sober semester, *and got the best grades of my college career.* I was never doing bad, but then I was doing great.

Then I started smoking again... it was on and off for a while, never a big deal, I would only smoke when I was done with what I had to do.

However, at a certain point, that habit took over what should've been my top priority. I'd get stoned to do homework, but never do that homework. I'd get stoned to ""be more creative"" and never produce any work. I was procrastinating and making excuses for myself, bringing my quality of work down and my anxiety levels up.

Last week, I stopped myself as I was smoking the last of my stash and asked myself what the fuck I was doing. I had work to do, finals week was approaching. I realized how much work I was putting off. *If you're not producing art, you're not an artist.* This kept repeating in my head over, and over.

I was doing well in school, despite procrastinating and the anxiety. *What if you didn't procrastinate? What if you had a healthier mindset? How awesome would your work be?* It all hit me then. I've been, for the last four years ago or so, just wasting my time. I've had the same miserable part-time job for over a year and a half, I barely have a portfolio together (despite a few nice pieces), I don't have an internship and I'm a junior in college, and I wait all day to smoke at night.

I realized that I was riding on scholarship money and blowing it away. I wasn't preparing for my future at all. If I want to guarantee myself a decent job with a degree, I need to be as involved as possible. That starts with ending my stoner-lifestyle, getting clean, producing quality work and landing an internship.

Emptied out the bowl and called it quits. I've been hitting a non-nicotine vape for the past week (not entirely recommended but it kills the oral-fixation from my habitual night-toking) and I've been getting so much shit done.

If you're on the fence about quitting, just climb over already. Seriously. Some people can handle being a stoner, and some people can't. If you've already debated quitting, stop making excuses for yourself. One month ago I would've told myself that 13 year-old me would be disappointed in present-me. Today I tell myself that 13-year old me would be proud.

Stay strong everyone!"

However, all of the rooms for rent would eat up half of my income and I'm looking to take my earnings back to Wisconsin and use it to pay for school for a year. 

I've never been to Cambridge, and I'm wondering how feasible you think living in a vanabode would be. Are there any 24/7 shopping centers I could park outside of for bathroom use? 

Are there any affordable gyms I could use in the area? 

Has anyone attempted something like this? 

I've been unable to find any Summer sublets for under 800$, even single rooms in a five person apartment. I can't find anyone to share a room with either although that would be preferable. 

EDIT: I should mention, my internship is in NW Cambridge, near Alewife.

Thanks in advance :)

I'm 32/m with a B.A. in History and a M.Ed. in Curriculum and Instruction.    I was a high school teacher for 7 years before transitioning into a role as a K-12 technology trainer for a school district.  During that time I've come to a realization that I'm much more passionate about the back end of the technology than I am about the instructional side of it.  
  
So, similarly to /u/hans_co, I'm trying to plot an exit strategy that will allow me to transition from education into IT while taking as small a long-term hit as possible.  
  
I've built half a dozen or so PCs over the years for myself and family members, manage our home network, and recently brought a home NAS/HTPC/ghetto media server online at the house.  I'm 100% self-taught, though, and don't have any of the degrees or certs that hiring managers look for when they scan resumes.  Furthermore, judging from a couple of hours spent scouring local listings on CL, indeed, monster, etc., all the ""entry-level"" IT jobs within 30 miles of my home -- even the catch-all helpdesk ones -- want at least a 2-year degree with very specific experience and skillsets that I simply don't have and can't simulate since troubleshooting a dropped wifi connection or driver crash on a home desktop isn't the same as working at a high-volume helpdesk at a major research university like the one posting these openings.  
  
I could enroll in a 2-year A.A.S. in Computer Information Systems at the local community college, but we live in a high-cost area and it would put a strain on my family to live off of just my wife's salary while I go back to school.  At the same time I feel like I could probably self-study my way to a passing score on the A+/Network+ exams at minimal cost, but I worry that simply having certificates without practical experience from internships would leave me no better off than I am now.
  
People I've spoken with say that the only thing that matters is what you know once you've got your foot in the door, but realistically speaking, how can somebody like me find that proper balance between textbook knowledge and practical experience to take that first step up a new career ladder?  "

What's the best option if I want to do software engineering stuff once I graduate?

I don't have any finger nails left, I bite them when I get sad or nervous and that is exactly how I have been feeling lately. I have been watching members of the creatures for a good 6-7 years and I am absolutely devastated. I haven't gone to bed these last couple of nights without crying myself to sleep. It's all that I feel I can do since I have no say with the whole situation. I haven't been able to focus in classes and I barely get any sleep. I just can't take my mind off of the Creatures.

I have watched the Creatures grow every possible day I could. I miss the good ol' days where it was just a bunch of friends playing video games and laughing. Don't get me wrong, they still do that to this day but it just doesn't feel the same to me, it feels more like a business and there is nothing wrong with that, things change. I have seen numerous Creatures leave and get kicked, all leaving a hole in my heart. Every time I saw a new Creature leave, I just felt so terrible inside, all the great memories, the laughter, the ups and the downs. But they didn't make me feel as sad as the event that has happened recently.

James and Aleks were definitely my favourites, and I am sure many of your favoured their personalities as well. They are undoubtedly the best combo on youtube right now. With them leaving the Creatures, it leaves yet another hole in my heart and I don't know how I feel about them leaving to make a new channel. Yes, I am excited to see them and their hilariousness on the new Cow Chop channel but I am also in tears for the Creatures, just knowing it will never be the same. I know I am going to have to life with it and I will always stick by the Creatures no matter what. They're the first youtubers I watched and I absolutely loved their personalities and still do. Every Creature (and now intern) has a very unique personality.

The Creatures have always been there for me and will always be there for me, through tough times and good. If I ever want to watch them all again I can just watch the old content on their personal channels. I have always and will continue to be there for them, through tough times and good. I never thought I'd have to make a post about how heartbroken I am that a bunch of friends that I don't even know personally ""broke up"". Yes, I may never get to be an official Creature, but deep down I know that we all are. We act just like them, they're our role models. They cry, we cry. It's how it's always been (at least for me). It also sucks that a lot of the games I play are games they introduced me to (Smite, Minecraft, Terraria)
and every time I go to play them, I can't help but be hit with nostalgia.

I wish good luck to the Creatures and to Cow Chop, you guys have always been there for me and I shall repay. I'm never going to leave and I am never going to think about it. I know that you guys are still friends and will always be friends and that's what makes me some-what happy at the end of the day. I hope you guys always keep in touch, for our sake, and yours.


Now for the projects.

I had the idea, and also saw this everywhere, that we should make some sort of reminiscence montage, over the years of their friendship. I think that we should all comment our favourite moments, whether they're on the Creature Hub or on their personal channels, just as long as they have each other in them. Try not to overload on the NovaHD and JorDaniel type stuff, lets include all of them. (I am hoping to make it 30+ minutes).

Another idea I had is that a graphic designer (or anyone) should make a phone and desktop background including EVERY Creature, past and present, maybe make an alternate version with the interns.

Just my thoughts on this situation and some ideas for old times sake. Also, sorry if some of this doesn't make sense, like I said, I haven't had a lot of sleep because of this.

We haven't been having great conversations on the phone and our dynamic feels a little off lately. 

However this is not the case at all for her and one of our mutual friends [also 22m]. I met him through some hobbies and me and him would hangout and play video games fairly often my gf would be there too a lot of the time so they kinda naturally became friends as well and we hang out just the 3 of us maybe once or twice a month. At one point my gf made a FB chat group with the 3 of us in it to just share random thoughts and have general dumb chit chat.

As of late I've been a little withdrawn from posting in the chat because I'd started getting a little depressed with my gf out of town and me being at home alone. Plus many of my friends are so busy with college finals prep and final projects that its not too often I get to hangout with people other than our mutual and 1 or 2 other friends. Well since I stopped posting in the chat its basically just our mutual and my gf talking back and forth and because both of them don't have to many things going on in their free time they've been basically texting each other throughout the day every other day.

I don't like that this interaction has been making me feel this way, but I've been feeling a little jealous and insecure. Plus leading into our impending time apart me and my gf were planning on trying out a nsa break period, but after a week we called it off. Lately she just seems to be changing kind of rapidly and she has been making it seem like she thinks her current or previous image isn't necessarily what she wants to be seen as. 

The other night we were flirting a little and we decided to send each other nudes later in the night, I had really been pent up a little having not had sex in 2 weeks and was pretty excited and into the whole thing. So later on she sent me pic which was my cue reciprocate. while i was trying to take the photo are FB group chat start popping up a bunch because every time someone in the chat talks every member get an alert that pops up. So while I'm trying to get in the mood to send this pic, I would get bits of a conversation my gf and mutual were having that was more personal than like throw away for fun banter. For whatever reason it immediately turned me off and made me feel kinda weird that she would multi task sexting with me and having a fairly personal conversation with him.

I feel weird about the whole friendship triangle right now, but I can't tell if I should or maybe my minds just playing tricks on me.

Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated


   
**tl;dr**: Should I feel weird about my out of town gf talking to our mutual friend more than she talks to me?"

**Hedonistic Arithmetic Part II: Addition and Multiplication.**  

*****  

Suffice it to say between spending the night curled up with Trish in her bed and our incredibly steamy shower getting to work on time wasn’t going to happen without matter-energy-matter transference. In the name of saving some of my reputation at work I phoned the office while I was on a bus to tell them I’d “overslept” and would be in as soon as possible.  
Mercifully there weren’t any surprise morning meetings nor had I been scheduled to meet with a client or tapped to show up at a job site so the fallout would be minimal. Provided of course I could get home, change into something approaching professional looking and not schizophrenic before jumping into my jeep and heading downtown.  

Half an hour later I pulled into an open spot underneath the building where the firm I work at makes its home. The offices themselves are situated in the business district of the city and anyone needing a bit of inspiration for their latest project merely has to look out the window listen to the frozen music as von Goethe would have put it. Somehow I’d managed to make the journey without dressing like an utter maniac as well, although to be honest matching a robin’s egg blue shirt with thin white pinstripes to a cool grey suit and a pale gold tie wasn’t exactly rocket surgery. Still despite the small victory in dressing ones self I had a chat with one of the firms’ partners, more to make sure everything was okay since oversleeping was most definitely aberrant behavior on my part.  
Internally I felt decidedly like a shit-heel when saying I’d simply slept in and had nothing to further offer, but at the moment I was in survival mode. This particular partner had been something of a mentor when I’d started my internship at the firm and stated that it was okay this time but not to make it a habit in the future especially in relation to partner decisions. Soon thereafter my internal kicking had died down due to the necessities of work and wrestling with the new CAD software which refused to work.  

About an hour before I’d planned on taking a lunch break the thought of dumping the infernal computer sitting on my desk into the river after freezing for the fourth time was becoming less and less abstract.  
Fortunately the cooler part of my head prevailed and I finally acquiesced to calling our resident IT specialist IE the intern who’d installed the program in the first place.  However my phone chimed and vibrated before I could ever lay a finger on the screen, signaling someone had texted me.  

&gt; Hey Mr_Lewd_Punny_Name, I need a second opinion on a project. Come by my office when you have a moment? Eleanor.  

I don’t work at a large firm so our office space is consequently small, and moreover we have an intercom system which, unlike CAD software, rarely malfunctions. That said most of us have each other’s phone numbers and texting is an unobtrusive way to communicate if something needs to be discussed but it’s not pressing.  
No, what made me raise an eyebrow at this text was the name of the sender.  
Eleanor had started an internship with the firm a year after me so by now we were friendly enough, but in all that time I’d known her as being somewhat aloof. What’s more she rarely asked for help beyond confirming that something she’d worked on matched client specifications as well as internal design standards save for the occasional headache of a problem. Still I’m not the type to leave people hanging if I can lend a hand and in any event perhaps I could have seen the damned software work correctly so I got up from my own desk and headed down the hall.  

The mystery of Eleanor’s request only deepened when I arrived at her office. With the exception of founding and a few senior partners the offices are double occupancy without exception. Sometimes it can be cozy but generally most get along and in the tradition of local apartments the common areas are much bigger and open. Eleanor however was alone in her office and I’d not seen her officemate up to that point.  
“Close the door.” She said with an unusually tremulous underpinning to her usually pleasant and almost bell-like voice. Clearly she was anxious about something and apparently didn’t want it leaving the confines of the office. Even if I hadn’t caught the slight wavering in her tone the anxiousness was essentially written in bold print upon congac hued monolid eyes and in the corners of her thin-lipped mouth. As the latchbolt clicked home I asked the obvious,  
“How can I help you?”  
Eleanor didn’t answer right away beyond a space-filling nonspecific noise while manipulating the mouse in her hand. The pause gave me a bit of time to take in a few more oddities about Eleanor on this particular morning.  

The best way I’d be able to describe Eleanor’s look on every other day would be fashionably modest; flats or heels that barely cleared an inch, fully buttoned blouses with mid-calf skirts and the occasional jacket, minimalist makeup including subtle shades of lipstick and clips or braids/twists to keep her hair up and out of the way. All in all very businesslike but still feminine.  
That morning however Eleanor’s makeup and hair were decidedly different than the norm. Her long raven hair hung fell over her shoulders and down her back in luxuriant waterfalls and the glistening burgundy color on her lips actively fought with her eyes for my attention.  
“Yeah, can you look at this walkway design? I *think* the angle of the handrail is what the client wanted but I’d rather have a second opinion just in case.”  
With a simple nod and “Sure” I walked to her side and bent at the waist to examine her work. Knowing next to nothing of her clients hobbled my opinion but a cursory glance revealed that the angle of said railing was noticeable but largely inoffensive. Even still I hate working in the proverbial dark and turned my head to ask Eleanor about some of the specifics but was distracted once again. Two buttons were undone on her avocado-hued blouse and the sections of material were conspicuously open. So much so in fact that from my slightly elevated and diagonal position only blindness would have allowed me to miss the telltale featherlike pattern of lace underneath the blouse itself.  
Sharks have struck with less frantic splashing and under the majority of other circumstances I’d have proverbially sank my teeth in then and there. However the workplace was different; I’d worked hard and built a reputation for myself which included not fishing off of the company pier. On top of that this was decidedly different behavior from Eleanor, well past noticeable and well into signal flares and klaxons territory.  
With a mix of confusion, slight alarm and simmering arousal all competing for space in my head I swiveled my head and held Eleanor’s gaze for a moment before grabbing her office-mate’s chair. Leaning back and taking a seat I regarded Eleanor with a raised eyebrow before asking.  
“The handrail looks good Eleanor, most of your designs do…”  
There was a pause as I automatically leaned back in the chair and steepled my fingers at chest height, holding Eleanors gaze all the while.  
“Tell me what you *really* want.”   
There was a sigh that preceded what she said next. However my directness seemed to at least cut through without shutting her down; the nervous edge to her voice had abated.  
“Look, you know I’m leaving the firm in two weeks and really don’t want any big goodbyes…”  
Indeed I did, in fact Eleanor had told me not long after speaking with the senior partners. Apparently she wanted to move to a different part of the country and ply her skills in a smaller market with warmer weather. Logical move to be sure and perhaps if I weren’t so sentimental about the firm and the city I might have done something similar by now.  
“… but there is *one* thing I really want to do before I leave.”  
Eleanor was apparently fond of theatrics because she chose that moment to swivel her chair towards me. This revealed the final pieces to her ensemble; a black knee-length pencil skirt that displayed her toned calves and a pair of off-white pumps which were not only much taller than an inch but bore a subtle snakeskin print as well.  
“I want to fuck a co-worker during business hours. Not on my last day to avoid any complications, I want to see a man I work with and know I’m contractually forbidden from having sex with him before remembering what his dick felt like inside of me.”  

There’s obvious and there’s **that**. Somewhere in my mind a voice was probably reminding me that I’d already gotten into enough trouble that day, that this was a stupidly risky thing even if I wasn’t late and…  
I wasn’t listening to more rational thoughts. The moment Eleanor had left her unspoken question hang in the air the steeple disappeared in favor of palms rubbing together slowly and the grin that had taken over my features would have qualified for lascivious without much effort. That and the sudden shifting in the front of my pants was a dead giveaway.  
Fantasies are always one thing however and I probed a bit further to see just how serious Eleanor was.  
“Obviously this would have to be done on a lunch break, but the question is *where*? Theoretically my SUV would be a good choice but the parking lot is usually pretty busy…”  
“The 12th floor offices were still unlocked when I checked this morning.”  
She’d picked a relatively decent spot; the day prior a cartel of self-styled masters of the universe had cleared their offices relatively quickly without informing the property managers. With a little luck it would still be open, a little more and there’d be carpet or a rug available, and a lot would yield abandoned office furnishings.  
There was another matter however,  
“There’s also protection…”  
Eleanor’s hand slipped into her purse and produced a little blue box with her own sultry smirk before dropping it back in. I’m pretty sure I tensed slightly as the front of my pants tented just that tiny bit more for a millisecond.  
Clearly Eleanor intended to carry out her fantasy and planned accordingly. The last piece of the puzzle was the right partner and she’d decided that was me. At that point frankly I had visions of throwing her on the desk and pumping away gleefully right then and there, but this was her rodeo. However I tend to be a curious sort of person and there was one last thing I needed to know, if only for my edification.  
“So when did you decide that I’d be the guy to carry this out with?”  
She didn’t answer right away as if considering the weight of her next words. When she did there was an almost wistful breathy tone as if relating a cherished memory.  
“Not all at once, it was more over time. I know when you’ve gone to happy hour with some of the other associates you’ve talked about sex in some form or another and some of it *have* gotten back to me.”  
I made a mental note to figure out who was the loudmouth from happy hour and either thank or curse them depending on how things played out. As Eleanor her hand moved to facilitate her fingertip’s almost absentmindedly caressing of the skin bared from the undone buttons while she slowly crossed her legs in front of me.  
“Then the day the pipes burst and we had to get all those boxes out of the storage room, you had to take everything but your pants and tshirt off and I could see your arms and shoulders move and how you tossed those boxes on the table over and over…”  
Eleanor’s fingertips slipped inside hem of her shirt for a moment before she recovered and continued.  
“… after that I did a bit more homework to get a clearer picture of you in that way. I like the image Mr_Lewd_Punny_Name.”  
On the one hand I was slightly irritated that Eleanor had been that cagy as opposed to coming to me directly despite the fact that such a proposition was a minefield. On the other hand…  
“12th Floor then. In… 45 minutes.” I said after consulting my wristwatch. Perhaps I was imagining things but I could have sworn Eleanor’s eyes widened slightly and her legs pressed together subtly as her own little lightning bolt struck home. Regardless I’d just agreed to be part of Eleanor’s fantasy and for the moment nothing further needed to be discussed, at least with words.  So after getting up I re-adjusted myself to minimize the growing erection from any prying eyes (after giving Eleanor a look) and returned to my office while trying to wipe the vestiges of that lascivious grin off of my face. After a few minutes passed a thought entered my brain; *Am I really going to do this?*  

45 minutes later on the 12th floor I’d answered my own question, although I was still feeling a little exposed. Only a few floors in the building are fully occupied by one company and already two or three people had walked past the guy standing in front of a now abandoned office. Just as the first vestiges of doubting Eleanor’s resolve bubbled to the surface the click of heels on tile heralded her arrival.  
Instantly my heart hit the anterior of my ribs and my nethers stirred against a blend of cotton and nylon the moment I lay eyes on her. The heels accentuated her slim yet toned legs which her skirt (a pencil skirt no less) hugged as she walked while the two buttons on her blouse were tantalizingly revealing without being obvious. As she got close I could appreciate the way her flowing hair accentuated her almost delicate face and read the anticipation in her eyes. Clearly Eleanor had ruminated on her decision and still found it appealing, although she’d nearly been thwarted by the intern asking obligatory silly intern questions as one does in that position.  
The doors to the abandoned office were indeed unlocked (and that plastic card was there the whole time, honest) and we set about trying to find a suitable venue. Our first thought was the obligatory conference room, however that turned out to be not only devoid of a table but displayed multiple stains on the carpet that effectively killed its candidacy. From there we split up and started checking other in a frantic search to find something suitable. I quickly became frustrated with two offices and a breakroom and was entertaining the thought of trying a quickie in my SUV when I heard Eleanor sing-song from around a corner,  
“Found it!”  
Indeed Eleanor had run across the ideal venue for our little tryst; an office which not only had carpet and a sturdy-looking desk but also a remarkable view into the heart of the downtown district. Eleanor was still admiring that view when I sauntered past and leaned against the doorframe. Those heels had done a remarkable job of lifting her rear and such a view deserved admiration.  

“What a view.” I said in the best come-hither tone I could muster. The moment Eleanor turned and clapped a hand over her face to suppress a giggle I realized just how corny that had sounded and had to chuckle myself while closing the gap between us.  
Eleanor stopped laughing overtly but still snickered a couple of more times even as her hands found my tie and began gently stroking the silk with both of her hands in succession.  
“So how should…”  
Eleanor was cut off by the sudden grasp of my arms around her waist and my lips pressing against her. All her planning had worked to perfection; the moment I’d gotten back to my office my productivity had essentially stopped thanks to visions of frenzied removal of clothing and flesh meeting with abandon. At first Eleanor seemed shocked at this sudden change in demeanor for a moment but quickly started moaning into my mouth and digging her nails into my chest. Although our tongues stayed put that time Eleanor’s teeth gently pulled at my bottom lip for a moment as our lips parted and coaxed a grunt out of me.  
Feverishly Eleanor’s hands tugged the jacket off of my shoulders and deposited it unceremoniously before my hands found her waist and pulled her tight against me once again. This time I didn’t hold back in the least; my tongue drove into her mouth while I ground my now rigid penis against her with a feral growl. Eleanor melted against me with a moan while clinging to my triceps for support as her tongue pressed into mine almost deferentially. Now it was my turn to give Eleanor’s bottom lip a gentle tug with my teeth, only this time my attention was focused on her ear.  
“Tell me how badly you craved me.” I hoarsely whispered in her ear before forcefully sucking the lobe between my lips and nibbling. Eleanor practically squeaked while her hands clenched at my sides for dear life before panting out a reply.  
“All week Mr_Lewd_Punny_Name! Touched myself… thinking about those arms holding meooooh…”   
My hands had been tugging at the buttons of her blouse in succession and pulling the fabric from beneath her skirt and one had brushed against the general region where I’d presumed her nipples were. Even in my lust-fueled state the sudden intake of breath and arch in her back wasn’t lost on me and only spurred me to tug at her earlobe a modicum harder while frantically trying to make it through the remaining buttons without popping one free. Once Eleanor’s blouse was free and open I practically yanked the two halves open and let go of her earlobe with a final bite to see what I’d revealed. To say that I approved of Eleanor’s lacy black bra would have been a cosmic understatement; she’d obviously picked something that looked good on her and highlighted the perkiness of her small pert breasts without any false advertising.  
Clearly she deserved a commendation and I did so by yanking her in by the small of her back and hungrily kissing and sucking between her breasts while my other found the back of a thigh and squeezed greedily, all the while still unable to utter anything other than feral grunts. Eleanor could still talk but now she was starting to have problems controlling her own volume, vacillating between deliberately quiet to unabashedly forceful while digging her nails into my sides.  
“Fuck! Fuck you’re strong Mr_Lewd_Punny_Name.”  
Flattery is one helluva skeleton key and Eleanor was adept at turning it, so much so that I let go of her thigh and started feeling between the cups of her bra to find the closure. My educated hunch paid off when I my fingers found the simple hook and loop closure and in a surprising display of dexterity given the state of my lust managed to unhook it in one motion. The moment the lacy confines of her bra fell away I had to pause however; Eleanor’s nipples were adorned with silver barbells which winked at me with reflected sunlight.  
Eleanor sensed my hesitation and evidently caught the look of wonder on my face that was still coming to terms with modest and slightly aloof Eleanor walking around with such adornments hidden by her clothing.  
“Careful with them, they’re sensitive and the barFUCK!”  
I’d noticed. Hence why I dove back in with aplomb and clamped my mouth down around one of her nipples in coordination with one of my hands enveloping her other breast with a splayed grip.  
As my tongue curled underneath each ball in turn before I gently nibbled and my fingers kneaded and squeezed I felt Eleanor shudder in my hands and raggedly pant. Encouraged by such a result I grunted against Eleanor’s skin before my thumb and index closed around one of her nipples and gently tugged while my teeth followed suit with the other. Eleanor managed to cut off a moan escaping from her throat before her hands started feverishly tugging at my belt in an effort to engage in a bit of reciprocity even through spasms of pleasure.  
I wasn’t having any of it just yet however and after a quick switch of my hands my mouth closed around her other nipple and sucked enthusiastically in conjunction with swirls of the tongue and nibbles while I used one of my hands in concerts to gently pull and even slightly twist her other nipple.  
 Soon the onslaught pushed Eleanor over the edge and her fingers dove into the waist band of my pants in order to hang on while she quivered and grunted repeatedly in my arms. Eventually she managed to pull herself somewhat upright and rest her head upon my shoulder while breathing deeply, her hands finally freeing my buckle from itself before zeroing in on the infernal button and zipper that stood in her way.  

The moment my zipper hit it’s base Eleanor’s hand slipped further in and started to caress the pulsating hardness beneath the fabric of my boxer-briefs with a soft moan.  
“Oh god, fuck me Mr_Lewd_Punny_Name, please fuck me…” she said while slipping her hand underneath the elastic of my boxer-briefs and pulled my penis into the air. Eleanor looked down and made a noise somewhere between cooing and sighing while giving the shaft a squeeze and a couple of gentle tugs before meeting my gaze again.  
“Please, I’m so wet…”  
For a moment I didn’t answer, only shifted my hips towards her hand. She didn’t wait long however as I kissed her mouth vigorously and deeply before telling her “Over the desk.” with a growl.  

Eleanor not only complied after kicking off her shoes but also started reaching back with one hand to tug at the hem of her skirt. Exciting as it is to have a women claw at her own clothing so she can be penetrated that much sooner I was possessed and had to reveal her ass myself and subsequently stepped forward to hook my own fingers underneath the hem of her skirt and yanked it over her hips to the tune of a gasp from her and an approving grunt from me. Like her pert little breasts Eleanor’s ass was small but pert and rounded and seemingly fit my hands perfectly as I squeezed and spread each cheek individually while framed by a lacy black thong to match her bra.  
Ordinarily such sensations would have been cause for me to slip my penis between her thighs and tease her while caressing and smacking such rounded pertness with aplomb, but as I said earlier I was a man possessed and knelt behind her while dragging the offending and sodden thong down her legs before removing them entirely courtesy of her lifting a foot at the end.  
Fortunately I wasn’t *so* possessed to neglect protection and started rummaging in Eleanor’s purse for the little blue box she’d flashed me while sliding a pair of fingers along her swollen lips. That proved to be a bit of a distraction since it became instantly apparent that Eleanor was not only telling the truth and completely bare but perhaps downplaying her wetness; after a couple of passes it felt like I’d collected a stream between my fingers and Eleanor was pressing her hips down at them with sharp almost frustrated grunts.  
Providence struck again however and the moment my fingers felt that little box I snatched it out of her purse like it was the key to prevent a doomsday device from going off and practically destroyed it to get at the smaller packages within. With a bit of judicious work between my teeth and free hand I managed to continually stroke Eleanor’s folds while rolling the condom down before grabbing her hips and slipping the now sheathed head of my penis into her.  
Before pushing further however I was compelled to bend over at the waist as far as possible without slipping free and growl in Eleanor’s ear, “Remember..” before my hips pressed forward and I was buried in Eleanor to the hilt, her broken moan commingling with my open-jawed grunt and resonating in the mostly empty offices.  

My first thrusts were slow but deep and swiftly built in force after both of our hips had subtly shifted to accommodate the other. With each thrust forwards my hips pulled Eleanor back to me resulting in a smack of skin meeting skin and a sharp moan from Eleanor, and as the pace built while still maintaining my long strokes words flowed from between my lips between guttural grunts.  
“You fucking needed my cock inside of you all morning didn’t you?” 
I might have been getting into the danger area of volume but Eleanor was right there with me, tossing her hair back and moaning in between exhortations.  
“*Yes!*”  
My fingernails dug into her hips just that much harder and my hipbones slapped into her cheeks in the same small but noticeable degree.  
“You needed me to fuck your brains out!”  
“Yes, fuck I needed your big cock inside me and your hands on my tits!”  
I swear I felt my cock twitch inside of her just from that alone and rewarded her with a spank to each cheek before hitting the crescendo of long strokes I could muster. Now our moans and grunts and dirty talk and skin-slapping had hit a new crescendo and in the back of my mind I started to wonder if people in adjoining offices were starting to catch on.  

It was a small part that wondered it however, because a much more pointed and prominent portion decided that now was the time to send Eleanor over the edge even as I could feel the pressure just beginning to mount between my hips. As I changed the angle of my hips slightly to find new areas of Eleanor’s anatomy to stroke one of my hands slipped forward and found a deliciously familiar sensation of skin and metal. It didn’t take much pressure and slight twisting before Eleanor’s hair was thrown back as her head became the cresting portion of a back-arch.  
Now Eleanor’s moaning was verging on screaming territory and surely would have carried beyond the walls of the abandoned office. Instinctually my other hand left her hip and clamped down across her mouth while still pumping away and pinching her nipple. Rather than take it as an affront Eleanor stuck her tongue out and dragged one of my fingers into her mouth in order to forcefully suck between chest-heaving moans.  
The renewed addition of nipple stimulation sent Eleanor over the edge again after a couple of minutes from my combined onslaught and I felt her walls clench at my shaft through the barrier of latex between us.  
Although I’d been pressed to the hilt inside of Eleanor when she came and was panting in my own right from the insane bliss of things so far I wasn’t as close to my own release as I typically would have thanks to the thicker condom than I typically use. However this did give me a bit of clarity which generated a wicked idea.  

Slipping my hand away from Eleanor’s nipple I gently swiveled my hips back and forth as if I were simply letting her recover before diving underneath the bunched material of her skirt and seeking out her folds once again. From there my fingertips traveled upwards and met at their upper origin. It only took a few delicate strokes before Eleanor’s thigh stiffening and a gasp indicated I’d found her clit and immediately set about rubbing it between two of my fingertips while pumping into her again. This time Eleanor was quicker on the uptake and soon a finger was in her mouth and being sucked between moans and pants once more. It seemed like mere moments before her thighs visibly quaked and quivered while her walls clamped down on me in waves yet again, and all the while I was growling at her, 
“That’s right you remember *every* fucking time you look at me.”
Now visibly flushed along her legs and ass Eleanor slightly collapsed into the desk and moaned in soft ragged waves. Unfortunately this meant that I still hadn’t come and Eleanor apparently had run out of steam.  

Although irritated that I hadn’t gotten off I was more than pleased with what I’d done to Eleanor and after planting a soft kiss upon her ear I slowly pulled out. Much like when I’d rolled the offending (yet necessary) condom on I rolled it back down with one hand while caressing Eleanor’s thighs and ass.  
Eleanor however had one last surprise in store for me. Rather than stand up she slid to her hip on the carpet before pivoting to her knees and walking forward. Before I could even get a word out she braced herself against my thigh with one hand while wrapping the other around my shaft after collecting some of her wetness and engulfing the head of my penis with her mouth.  
Eleanor however wasn’t interested in teasing or putting on a show; instead she immediately started pumping with her mouth and hand in unison while pressing against the underside of my penis with her tongue. I might have been somewhat close before but such a need to bring me to orgasm while looking into her brown eyes conspired to make my loins fizz and crackle in overdrive and a litany of grunts and huffs to escape from my chest. Intertwining my fingers in her hair seemed to be the best way to hold on lest I stutter-step out of the room in pleasure but it seemed to encourage Eleanor to pump that much faster and harder  
In what seemed like record time I felt the pressure reach critical between my hips and made it’s imminent release known to Eleanor in a clenched guttural tone,  
“Fuck yes Eleanor take it, drain my fucking balls…”  
With one last moan from both of us she did just that, sighing and lapping with the head of my penis in her mouth as my hips bucked forward with every spasm of pleasure. How I remained standing I’ll never know but Eleanor made sure to get every drop before standing with her hair askew and a glazed over look in her eye. For a beat we just gazed at each other through a haze of orgasmic bliss and dawning realization of what had just happened before I gently leaned in and kissed her lips while squeezing her hands.  
As we pulled ourselves back together we made small talk before slipping back into the hall and taking the elevator back down to the firm’s offices with everyone seemingly none the wiser.  
After I’d gotten to my desk I found a can of nuts I kept on hand to ward off cravings and dove in since I hadn’t actually eaten anything for lunch. It was only after I dropped an errant hazelnut on the floor that I noticed something new was in my jacket pocket that wasn’t there earlier. Eleanor had managed to slip her panties into the pocket without me noticing.

4hgs2v,2,2016-05-02,Really hard to take her advice to not give up.,melancholicthrowaway,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4hgs2v/really_hard_to_take_her_advice_to_not_give_up/,"Hi. I'm not sure where to start. I've already tried to kill myself several times, but I always chicken out  when it comes time to do the deed. The closest I've gotten was swallowing a handful of pills, then throwing them up when I put too much thought into what happens after the end and got scared again. I really want to die. I have trouble falling asleep at night. I always think too much. Most of my days consist of feeling like shit as I take several hours to muster up the strength to get out of bed. If I have free time, I binge watch anime or bring up something to play to keep my mind distracted. If it isn't a school night, I try to stay up long enough that I'm so exhausted that I'll fall asleep immediately, so I don't have to think about anything. It rarely works; I still lie there failing to sleep for a while, and it's not something I can do if I have to wake up early in the morning.

 I can't for the life of me seem to get employed, and I haven't worked a single day of my life. When a friend from highschool gave me advice, she said I should focus on my resume; she remembered me well enough from speech and debate that she figured I'd have it in the bag as long as I could get an interview. She's working on her MBA at a really good school and had a comfy looking internship last time I checked, so I look up to her a bit. On my end, I've gotten a few interviews, but I can't even get myself hired by the local McDonalds.

Right now, I'm just leeching off of my parents, who are paying my way through college. I had a bit of a breakdown near the end of highschool, so they ended up enrolling for me. I basically go to a backwater school that was everyone's backup choice. And even though I just lie down doing literally nothing most days, I still end up failing my math classes, which I just can't seem to get. I'm honestly just a waste of money, and it'd be better off going to someone else who actually needs it.

I don't know how I feel about my parents. When I found that other people could actually befriend their parents, I tried really hard to befriend mine. The few times we eat together at the dining table, I really tried my best to talk to them, but the conversations never go anywhere, so it's always a silent meal. Whenever they'd decide to watch a movie, or if some other interesting media pops up, I'd try to discuss it with them, but they never really talk. Most of the time, they just heckle me for a botched job I've done somewhere around the house or in my life. I should still be grateful to them, though. They put food on the table and are sending me to college while I'm not really doing a thing.

There's this girl I still like. We dated for a little under a year, and  we find that we're both just as depressed at around that time ( I'm glad she's doing better now; I think I've gotten worse). Despite that, it was the most  serious relationship I've been in, and I learned a lot from her. She's really sweet and she made me happy. In return, tried my best to be there for her, but I just wasn't enough. She broke up with me, and is with another guy now, but we're still friends and talk to each other ever day.  She used to have a habit of telling me how her day went every evening, which didn't stop immediately after the break up. That's how I found out she lost her virginity after two weeks of knowing him. I know it really shouldn't matter, but it bothers me, and it kind of hurts a little. Unlike me, he actually has a job and can make her happy enough that I know she doesn't cry as often as she used to. Looking back, I  can't get it out of my mind that she felt sorry for me and only accepted me asking her out out of pity.

I really should be moving on, but I can't help but think of the life we talked about having together after we graduated. I'm not entitled to anything and should be feeling happy for her, but I guess I just feel a little bit abandoned. We exchanged hand-written letters, and I still pull them out to read, sometimes. I'm still mad at myself for throwing some of them away when I couldn't bear to think of her anymore.

We used to run a guild together, but I started logging in so infrequently that I just transferred the leadership to her. Nobody really noticed when I finally stopped logging in, so I guess I wasn't really doing a very good job. She seems to be handling it better, though. When we first started, she didn't want the leadership and nominated me when nobody else would step up, but I guess she just needed someone to get the ball rolling before she could take over.

A friend of mine got married the other day. I'm really happy for him. Someone else who I see in a lot my classes and started going to college the same time as me is about to graduate a year early. She works really hard, so she deserves it. A while back, there was this kid on the news; 16 years old and he made some sort of invention for water starved people, I forgot what it was. Meanwhile, I might have to stick around for another year if I keep failing my classes. Finals are coming up, and I think I'll fail math again. Still can't get a job. But I haven't really found the time or motivation to job hunt, so there's nobody to blame but me.

I know I have it better than most people, and I really have no right to complain. I tell myself that every day, but it's hard to not want to just give up and try to sleep my life away. The fact is I'm just a worthless basement-dwelling leech, the kind of person that everyone hates in society. I'm so cowardly I can't even find the strength to kill myself and get it over with already. I'm not even sure why I'm here anymore; I guess I'd feel a little less lonely doing this instead of struggling to sleep some more.

I'm tired of myself, and I really really want to die.  I'm just a whiny brat that should lay down and die already. But I can't find the courage to do it myself. It'd be best if there were a way for me to do it quickly without having to think about anything, and without any time to change my mind."

I'm a second year (of three) CS student in the UK. I've just been let go by my current employer (call center manager) after a slew of redundancies. Now I am looking for new work and was wondering if its too early to apply for dev jobs.

I only have one small side project which is a automation script for a report i had to run in excel, quite basic. I've applied to everything i could find that specifies it is an internship or for undergrads but being in Scotland that was a total of two. Is it worth applying to grad positions?

I'm on track for a first class degree and think I can talk intelligently about the soft skills I gained from the managers job but all the requirements in job descriptions seems very far away from my current level.

Thanks for your time. :)"

And at Hudson there is one frat that reins supreme, where the brothers are smarter, stronger and more privileged then any of their rivals. And boy do they know it.

The line stretches down the block as students wait to enter Alpha Sigma's first party of the semester. I stand on the doorstep of the opulent fraternity mansion, arms folded in a way that shows off my bulging biceps and rippled chest. The collar on my Abercrombie polo is up, obviously, and I scan the line for any lithe young pickings that I could have fun with. I dumped my Theta slampiece over the summer - I said I had to focus more on my Goldman Sachs internship, but the real reason was I was just... bored of her. Who knows what I'll find tonight? Maybe a girl truly worth showing off to the high society I had been born into...
___________________________________________________

Hey, thanks for reading! So the premise of this roleplay is pretty simple. I want to play a douchey, All-American frat bro who gets to corrupt and use a naive young first year. You could be a spoiled, stuck-up legacy blonde, a small-town busty brunette or even an ebony/latina girl who'd never dream she'd abandon her people to suck on the cock of a rich white guy. So long as you're creative and imaginative, I'm game!

This can be played short-term, but what I'd really like to do is create a little world of opulence and privilege. I want to seduce your character with promises of the high-life, taking you to all sorts of exclusive events and country clubs, all the while making you into a more and more depraved slut. By the end of it I want you to be my bimbo, a good, obedient little girl who smiles and sticks her chest out while the men discuss business.

Detail, creativity and good grammar are key. I'm pretty open to most kinks and this scene can go from plain vanilla to extremely dark.

Hope to hear from you!"
4hhopx,2,2016-05-02,Advice on Best Graduation Path?,nyklyfe,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4hhopx/advice_on_best_graduation_path/,"I'm about to finish my junior year in college as a CS major, and I just wanted a bit of advice as to which path I should take from here.

I just transferred to my current school ( one with a great CS program) this fall, with little prior programming experience. I was a CS major at my old college, however the program was extremely weak, and after 2 years there I found unable to grasp fundamental aspects of CS.

At my new college, I'm learning so much quicker and I really feel like I've grown a passion for CS and have established myself as a pretty good programmer. However, I feel like this really has been my ""freshman year"", seeing as though I didn't have any internships or tech jobs/skills prior to this year. I have an offer to be a TA for a upper-level programming class next semester, so that's really the only thing I can put on my resume right now.  I've been talking to my advisors, and I've come up with two options.

**OPTION 1:** 
My last 2 semesters, take 4 CS classes each, which would be pretty hard, but still doable. My GPA would definitely take a hit ( my college has a VERY vigorous CS program). 

**Length to Completion:** 4 and a half. 

**ACCOLADES:** TA job, 1-2 side projects, MAYBE one internship( at most, since I only have one more summer to get one), Bachelors Degree, slightly lower GPA( due to the 8 CS classes in 2 semesters).

**OPTION 2:** My last 2 semesters, I take 3 CS classes each. This leaves me with 2 CS classes left to graduate( after 4 and a half years). Now, my school offers a 5 years CS Masters Program, which although It would obviously take me more than 5 years to complete, I'd still be eligible for. The perk for this program is that I can substitute 2 undergrad classes with masters courses. Meaning If I took 2 masters courses, I would get 6 credits for my undergrad AND masters degree.

**Length to completion:** Undergrad in 5 years, Masters in 6 Total.

In this situation, I feel like I would have a lot more time to rack up a few more things to my resume and get some more experience. I would definitely have more time to make some side-projects, and I feel like not only would I be able to rack up MORE internships, but better ones as well( as a masters student).
In this situation I would graduate in 6 years with a Bachelors, a Masters, more internships, more side projects, and a better GPA( due to only having to take 6 courses in my last 2 semesters). 

Really, overall, I just feel like on my current path, I wouldn't be ready for the real world just yet. I'm definitely not experienced enough to get a good job just one year from now, let alone an interview. However, at the same time, from what I've read, a lot of people prefer spending the time getting job experience over getting a masters degree. 

ON A SIDE NOTE: If no masters, I would graduate with NO DEBT. If I did do my masters, I would graduate with about 13k in debt. 

Any advice would help greatly. Thanks!"

Please raise issues and make proposals in the comments and they will be added to the next year's agenda.

Please keep in mind that the UNGA is not the UNSC, resolutions made are mostly non-binding and most resolutions cannot be vetoed. For example, if a UN vote is to condemn a country for an action, the result in real life is that all countries who vote 'Yes' are condemning that country, and it just happens to be a majority of UNGA members.

Resolutions which can be vetoed include membership applications, changes to the UN charter, changes to the UNSC, and deployment of peacekeepers or observers, the suspension of members, as well as a few other things. UNSC meetings can be called by players on important issues during which the P5 have veto power.

I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing anymore. I have an ""ok"" job for still living at home with my folks. I make 12 an hour. I pay my car payments with insurance which equals to be about 300 a month, 106 for my cellphone, get my own gas, food, and credit cards. My folks don't give me any money and haven't since I was like 16. I just stay in my room or I sleep over at my gf's apartment most times, it's like they aren't even there and they don't make me pay anything for living there. My gf and I talk about moving in together, but she's finishing school and works 2-3 days a week, and she shares rent with 2 other people. Anyway, I feel stuck as fuck because I'm finishing up school with a bachelors in Public Health. I was really into working out and nutrition from like 19-23. Since then I lost all motivation, put on about 60 lbs, and I just don't care about shit anymore. I'm trying to get my motivation back and I'm at the last semester with school. Anyway I had no idea what the fuck I was doing going into college. I'm from the U.S. BTW. My buddy convinced me to go and find something I'm interested in. I never cared about school. Barely passed high school to be honest, but I was a pretty different person from HS going into college. I took a year off from HS. So anyway I have no idea where to work and it's bugging the fuck out of me. School doesn't teach you shit about how to find a job or what the field will even be like. Everything I learned in college I could learn in one 4 hour Youtube video. So I'm talking to advisors and teachers about who hires new grads with just a B.S. or where I can get an internship and no one has been helpful. Everyone just says make a LinkedIn account and message people who work in the field. Hasn't worked. Not a single person responded. In my message I just introduced myself, told them what I'm interested in in the field and wanted to know if they would be willing to answer some questions about the career field. I messaged about 8 people and not a single response, BTW, everyone was from my school's alumni I messaged. I worked the whole time I went to school. I commuted. I never joined greek life or got involved with shit. Every successful person my age who actually has a job in what they went to school for seems to be have been involved with greek life or something, or they are super social. I'm not social, I'm not anti social, I just think the majority of people are fake as fuck and I would rather talk to people who actually appreciate you rather than some ""social butterfly"" trying to act like they care about you. Some jobs that I ""could"" work require a whole bunch of certifications that I never even heard of in school, which cost a shit ton of money or I need a masters to make 88k a year. 
I want to grow up and move out of my folks house but how do I even get a masters while doing that, I won't have any money. School seems like a huge fucking scam, but how do people get jobs right after school? I don't get it. Do you just have to fake being social or acting professional? I feel so insecure when it comes to measuring up to people my age. Everyone puts on this fucking front like they are so ""mature"" I'm not saying I'm not, I just wish I had the urge to present myself like I am, and I don't have the slightest idea where to start. I have no role models in my friend group. None of my friends finished college. Most dropped out, and my one friend who is successful didn't go to school but has a lot of tech certifications. This person just tells me ""figure it out"" and has been no help to me.
TLDR: Finishing school, have little experience because I wasn't active in school events/job stuff, have no idea who hires new grads because everything says masters or 4 years job experience in the field, I have no idea where to get that, losing motivation, how the fuck do you get a job when you feel you can't measure up to that successful social butterfly who is involved with everything and dresses perfect? Rant-I feel like college is for people who had parents that went to college that pushed them to do well in school and life. I don't have that. I did it on my own and my motivation/care isn't there. IDK what the fuck I'm doing. I just want to feel like a god damn adult and have a job making 40K a year hopefully."
4hilm8,13,2016-05-02,How to best spend a month of freetime?,CodeCappuccino,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4hilm8/how_to_best_spend_a_month_of_freetime/,"So I am a third year undergrad, set to graduate Fall 17/Winter 18 with a BS in CompSci.  In school I've learned C++, Java, and C#.  Looking back this was probably a poor choice class wise, as now I cannot keep the three languages straight in my head.  I've also just wrapped up my first technical internship, where I worked with C#, ASP.NET WebForms, and some JavaScript.  I have a summer internship lined up to start at the beginning of June, where I do not know what tech stack I'll be working with.

Overall, in terms of resume gaps, the biggest issue I have would be side-projects, which I am hoping to address this summer with either a mobile app or some open-source work.  In terms of knowledge gaps, I feel as though I should learn one language much deeper then I know now (probably Java), learn testing (as my school's curriculum has completely failed to address it), and the standard data structures and algorithms interview prep (TopCoder, CTCI, etc.)

With the upcoming month of free time I have, I want to address these concerns, but I am unsure of what to prioritize.  I currently feel that I should perform a deep-dive on Java, as that will help me the most with coding interviews.  But I also want to learn Swift and iOS development, as mobile dev is the field I can most see myself going into. (I already have experience with Android)

So my questions are:

1) Which of these should I prioritize?

2) What book/resource will most help me reach that goal?  For example, Effective Java seems to be the universally agreed upon book for that language, will reading it accomplish familiarizing myself with Java much more intimately?

3) Is it a bad idea to try and learn yet another language, in the form of Swift?

TL:DR - If you had 4-5 hours a day, 6 days a week, for a month, what would you focus on?

Thanks!"

I finished my first project and then got moved to a different team to start a new project. For the first project, I didn't 100% finish it because they wanted it delivered really fast and they weren't happy with the approach I took, so they decided that I'm not good enough to be a developer or something, and then moved me to another team. Two other people inherited my project instead and were tasked with refactoring my code into the better approach, and I got pushed off to another team that has nothing to do with software engineering. One of my coworkers from that team even told my new team that they should make sure my project doesn't involve any coding, which is absurd because she has no programming background whatsoever and is basing her opinion of my development skills on the really rough project that I worked on for the first half of the internship - a project which I worked on pretty much by myself with little to no guidance. I won't say too much about it because it was sort of a toxic relationship there and I am glad I am no longer on the team or working with her, but now I'm on a different team and my project is more process management rather than development. :/ I don't want my development skills to atrophy...I need to spend as much time as possible developing so I can improve! So should I quit a month early and just spend that time on my coursework and writing code on my own? Or should I just do whatever they ask me to do for the last month and give this new field a chance? I was a software engineering intern and now I'm a systems engineering intern. My primary interest is writing code and engineering software. I already have a software engineering job lined up for when I graduate in a couple of months. I want to spend my time writing code and learning about code, not doing this. I agree with the previous team's assessment that my programming skills could benefit from writing a lot more code...and that's what I want to do! :/ 

I have enough money to survive until I start my new grad job in a few months. My biggest fear with quitting is losing potential contacts and another month at this really hot company on my resume. My biggest fear with not quitting is spending another super intense month (the workload here is very intense even for interns) on stuff I don't want to do, for small pay, while my coding skills stop growing and while my coursework doesn't get the attention it needs. Finals week is approaching and it's going to be really challenging. If I were to quit, I could spend time studying to make sure I get the best grades possible. I've already been studying whenever I can, but the internship has been so intense that my coursework has taken a backseat to the internship work. Now that I'm not even working on development, I'm hesitant to keep doing that."
4hj2rc,0,2016-05-02,"[24/M] I think I need to break up with my foreign GF (25/F), need advice desperately",i_got_lady_problems,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4hj2rc/24m_i_think_i_need_to_break_up_with_my_foreign_gf/,"Hello folks, I am pretty distraught over my current relationship situation.  I have a wonderful, lovely girlfriend who I like very much but have recently (just today) come to the conclusion that perhaps I don't love her and may need to break up with her.  Fair warning, there is some serious backstory.  A good chunk probably isn't that necessary, but I'm feeling a bit ranty and want to give the full context.  **Skip to the bottom for the TL;DR.**

----------

**The backstory:**

I have known this girl since I was 17 and she was 19 (summer 2009).  We both worked as counselors at a summer camp.  She's from New Zealand and came in on the Camp America program.  That summer, we were both INCREDIBLY attracted to one another as often happens in camp romances.  This was the summer before I went to college.  After the summer ended, she went back to NZ and I went to school.

We continued to keep in touch, daily, for maybe the first year or two.  I mean, we were completely infatuated with one another, would send each other gifts, etc.  During this time, I messed around with girls in college but they were all brief hookups and had no emotional component.  During the end of my sophomore year/beginning of my junior year we fell out of touch a bit, until she ended up visiting Vancouver and messaging me about it.  I still held this image of her in my mind as my ultimate dream girl, so I flew across the country from the east coast to visit her for a few days (very coincidentally, I was being flown out to Cali for an internship interview and the dates just lined up).  We started keeping in touch just like we had before, and everything was fine and dandy.  Might be worth noting, we still hadn't had sex yet and had only kissed, which for me was pretty unusual given my proclivity for one night stands back at school.

----------

In February of my senior year of college, I told her I'd be coming to visit her in NZ, which she was ecstatic about.  I then promptly became very, very ill (I'm talking confined to my bed, had to leave school for a month and a half, lost 20lbs, etc.) and basically fell off the map until two weeks before I was going to visit.  My shitty reasoning was that a) I was super sick and wasn't really thinking about talking to anybody, and b) when I went back to school I was just focused on making sure I graduated; if I didn't graduate, I wouldn't be going to NZ.  So, two weeks prior I messaged her, said, ""Surprise, I'm coming to NZ!""  And she seemed really surprised, and told me she thought I had just decided to start ignoring her and be an asshole (more or less).

I went to NZ, and long story short it went horribly, she ignored me and was very cold (not necessarily unreasonably).  I was pretty sad, because this for me was the culmination of years of fantasizing about my dream girl and I kind of thought ""Well, if things don't work out here I guess that's that.""  So, I went home very dejected and decided that it was time to finally get over this person and get on with my life.  We kept in touch a bit over the next few months, but I tapered off because it was too much for me to be keeping in touch with a person I thought I loved but who didn't love me back.  Over the next year and a half, she occasionally would write me letters or send me FB messages asking how I was, and I ignored them.

----------

Finally, in March of 2015 she sent me a really heartfelt email saying that she felt like she was losing out on a great friend and that it really hurt her.  I decided I was being an immature piece of shit, so I responded and told her how I was feeling (I still harbored affection for her, and I was trying to get over her, but it was basically impossible when she would continually reach out to me.  Also, that my rational side was telling me I was insane for wanting to try and make a relationship work with someone who was literally on the farthest possible place away on the planet).

We started keeping in touch regularly again, and then after two months she told me that she had the opportunity to move to NYC for a year (where I'm living), but would only do so if I was single when she got here.  I was dating around at the time, but nothing serious and so I wondered if we really could make it work.  So I said yes, I would be single when she arrived, and after six months she moves to NYC and we start dating.

----------

Since then, things have been...not exactly smooth sailing.  Turns out she doesn't like NYC.  I really like spending time with her, but she works a job at a restaurant at night and so our schedules don't really line up too much.  Also, this means it is hard to go away and do things on the weekend, since she always works weekends.  At one point she had three jobs and was working batshit insane hours, so I suggested she move in with me to save on rent.  She did, and we've been living with one another since early April.

So, the whole point of this...Thursday is our six month anniversary, and we have been talking more about where the relationship is going.  Within the past two months, I've taken a new job which is basically my dream job.  She wants me to move back to NZ with her (ideally) after her visa expires in six months.  If I had had my old job, I probably would have been game for that.  Now that I've got this new job...damn, it is a freakin' hard choice to make.  And the fact that I'm so torn about it makes me think ""Hm, well if I really was absolutely head-over-heels, I would just profess my undying love for her, pack my things and hop on a plane!""

I keep telling myself that it doesn't have to be one or the other, and that maybe I can get my job to let me work remotely, but even if I did I don't think I would want to leave.  My family is in NYC, my friends are here, I like living in the city, I have an amazing job.  I am just very resistant to leaving.  So, I think the right thing to do is to break up with her, because I think it's extremely unlikely that she would want to stay living with me once I essentially tell her I'm choosing my job over her.

----------

So, I feel like my options are thus:

1. Indicate that I'm going to move somewhere with her after her visa expires, and naively hope that my attitude changes when that time comes (unlikely; this seems like a very misleading and shitty thing to do)

2. Tell her that I'm not going to move out of NYC, but I still love her and want to spend as much time as I can with her and want to her to keep living with me and we'll just have a relationship with an expiration date (honestly this is my ideal.  Still though, this seems kind of selfish and I doubt she would be willing to continue living with me after I de facto break up with her, which is essentially what this option is).

3. Break up with her completely, and either encourage her to travel the States for a bit or go back home, or stay in NYC, whatever thing she wants to do.  I'm very happy to help pay for any of this, and I can easily afford it (although I would want to be tactful about it and not just come off like I'm throwing money at her to solve my problem; I just want to make whatever path she chooses as easy as possible).

**TL;DR: Longtime fantasy girl from foreign country moves around the world to be with me.  Her visa is expiring, I don't want to leave my city.  I think I need to break up with her.  Is that the right thing to do, or are there other options I haven't considered?  If it is the right thing to do, what's the best way to do it?**"
4hj3qb,7,2016-05-02,Need advice for my GUI application,DovahkiinVasNormandy,javahelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/javahelp/comments/4hj3qb/need_advice_for_my_gui_application/,"I'm working on a text based RPG to really challenge my abilities and even learn some stuff I've never done before. The company I intern for uses maven builds and JUnit (with mockito) for everything. Since I've learned alot about enterprise applications, I decided I'd shoot high for this personal project, as my other projects have been console oriented (e.g. a movie generator that asks what kind of mood your in and picks a movie for you), so I want a huge text based rpg that will basically be a version of Dungeons and Dragons.


I may get long winded so brace for that. I've already laid a lot of ground work for the application. I've created a player, it's sub classes to choose from, enemies (several types), an item interface for having several usable items, and a few ""manager"" classes that will handle things like being a broker for stats and damage during battles, a save file manager, a load manager, etc. When I've been getting stuck I've been writing the story which is composed of an intro, race descriptions, dialogue options, all that rpg goodness. 


But I'm starting to get a little ahead of myself. I keep coming up with more and more ideas to add to it, the universe seems to be getting bigger (I rediscovered I love creating narratives), I'm thinking about level designs (even though they won't necessarily be seen but are just to help with describing the environment), on top of that I've been making skeleton classes and JUnit test classes and trying to design a UI.


My problem isn't necessarily that I keep adding on (and possibly making it a difficult project), as I look forward to the coming challenges, but in becoming aware of all I want to do I realized, at what point should I start to implement the UI? If I do as much behind the scenes code as possible will it make it more difficult or easier to wire up to the UI when I'm done. And on the opposite side of the coin, will I know the code I'm writing behave like I have planned if I save the UI for last. Then I think, should I create the UI first and then write the code around how I've designed the UI, is that easier or more difficult?


So I'm curious for those who have done GUI applications before. Is it easier to write the code around an already designed UI, or create the UI around the code using JUnit to reinforce the behavior I desire. Or somewhere in the middle? I'm finding this  is a huge undertaking, and I have no friends that are programming savvy to help or give input, so I'm doing alot of work here.

**TL;DR: Creating a text based RPG with Maven and JUnit that will have a GUI. Had an epiphany that I'm not sure when to implement the UI. Should it be:
1) Before the code, and write the code around UI design?
2) After code and utilize JUnit to enforce the behavior I want for when UI is active
3) Or Somewhere in the middle of one and two** "

I'm trying to plan out my move to Chicago (I'll only be living there for a year). I'll be moving in around 3 months, but there are a couple of things that I'll need to do beforehand. 

1. Take a loan out to pay for the course ($11k) and rent ($800/m = 9.5k for the year)

2. Sell my car, which I still owe some money on (5.5k left to pay, but can easily sell it for around 9-8k.) However, I don't know how to go about selling my car, when my bank still has the title.

I have never taken out a large loan before. My credit score is around 700 and I've never missed a payment before. However, a couple of thoughts that bother me are: **Is there a way to take out a loan and start paying it back when I get a job?** and **How can I sell my car, if technically my bank still owns it?** 

Also, it's possible that I won't have to go through with the bootcamp, if I'm offered a job after my summer internship. But I'll still need to take out a loan to survive, at least until I start making $. **Any of you guys have any advice?** Sorry, this post is a bit of a mess haha."

1 summer and semester of research experience at my university
1 year starting from last may ending this may as an intern at a company near me.
a new internship this summer with raytheon starting in june.
I am getting recommendations from 2 professors (MIT alums if that matters), one from my manager at first company and another from raytheon if I do well.

I just feel like with all that, my gpa is bringing me down. I've only been working all this time and all those hours to pay off college but I'm not sure if being debt free, graduating in 4 years and having shitty grades is better than having 30k in debt and doing well. 

I want to confidently apply to places like google or microsoft. This semester isn't going so hot with one of my classes anyways. my other classes are Bs and As this semester as long as I don't bomb the finals.

I have a github but it's only got a monte carlo stock options simulator and a game I'm working on (authoritative server networking, opengl and 2d liquid physics), both of which are pretty dense but horribly organized.

I'm thinking of starting filling applications for summer 2017 sometime in September.

what do you guys think? What can I do to boost myself in the meantime? I'm working on improving my technical interviews just in case I land an interview.

I'm 26, and late last year my internship turned into a full time job making 50k/yr. Last month I finally moved out from my parents house and have cut direct contact with my mom and all contact with my dad. I hear about how my mom is doing through a third party.

When I was in high school my dad helped me set up a checking account and without my knowledge he made himself the primary on the account. Since then he regularly checks my account to see if I'm spending my money the way he thinks I should. After going full time but Prior to me leaving I couldn't save up any money due to my dad needing extra money ($700+) on top of the ($500-600) rent I was paying. 

So onto my current situation:
I closed the checking account that my dad had access to and opened a new one in my name only and that has pissed him off royally. I also have a savings account and 2 credit cards that I set up last year. I used the credit cards to but things last year with out every purchase bring scrutinized and paid them off with the savings account. My dad did not know about any of these accounts/cards

I just heard from the 3rd party that my dad tore my room apart over the weekend and found an old statement for my savings and is furious that ""my mom let me open a savings account without putting one of them on the account""

Since he now has my savings account information is there anything I can do if he poses as me on the phone with the bank? I called and had a verbal password set up but is there anything else I can do? Is it worth going to a lawyer yet?  Sorry for the long read, I would greatly appreciate any advice!"

I'm not sure if its relevant to my case (feel free to skip to  TL;DR if not), but I'll list my qualifications next:

I graduated with a batchelors of science in mechanical engineering just over a year ago with a solid GPA, intern experience, study abroad experience, leadership, etc. 

I have worked summers since I was 14 as a pool concessions/janitorial worker turned lifeguard, turned manager of a local city pool. During a time-off between US semesters and an upcoming study abroad semester I mentored my high-school's robotics team, helping them with applying physics and basic engineering to the design of their competition bot. I found interest in fluid mechanics related work and (having just completed the manufacturing engineering course) found an internship related to manufacturing of hydraulic valves.

Post graduation I moved to an area that I have always loved, to be close to the ocean, thinking ""Well I'm pretty qualified, I'll find opportunities!"", and I did find one. I work as a drafter and ""hydraulic engineer"" for a pool building company. 90% of my time is spent doing basic drafing with CAD software for construction plans. I do a lot of drawing for large commercial jobs, but as I do not have my P.E. I cannot sign and seal my own plans. I am the only person at my company to have a college degree of any kind, and while I learn a lot about the industry every day, I feel as though I don't have much room to grow. There aren't really any positions I could be promoted to that would fit my skillset, I am making roughly 70% of the average starting salary from my major (its a comfortable amount of money, but I see no reason for it to ever go up while at this job). I have my F.E. certification, but with no mentor or P.E. to work under I am unable to pursue that further either. I'm not unhappy at my job, but I know that I *could* be making more, and (most importantly) I feel as though as long as I wait to find something more relevant the less sharp I will become and the less appealing I will be as a candidate for other jobs. I'm not really using my degree very much.

I have found interest in product design engineering as I enjoy the creative aspects of optimizing form as well as function, and began applying heavily to related jobs in several areas (not just where I currently am). I enjoy evaluating customer needs and applying my education to deliver a calculated solution. I enjoy being a part of a team of people smarter and more experience than I am to learn from them. 

TL;DR: Typical college engineering graduate ""above average"" qualifications, got a decent job in area I love since market is tough, now trying to move jobs to something more relevant.

---
 
Given my current situation, I have started looking for something more technical, relevant, and interesting to me. Something where I can be of value and also better myself as an engineer and grow career-wise.

Almost all of my job searching has lead me to find ""Entry-Level"" jobs that somehow still manage to list several years of experience in a very specific application of engineering that one couldn't possibly have as a recent graduate.

This seems like a common concern, but where can I get that experience? How can I experience a specific engineering application, get relevant training, become more knowledgeable and therefore more valuable if there are seemingly no ""stepping stones"" on the way to these ""entry-level"" positions?

It seems as though the only way in to a lot of these companies is to have been lucky enough to co-op with your company of choice and also be lucky enough to decide that you would like to further your career in that area after college, otherwise you're just too unqualified for 99% of the entry level positions up for grabs. Do companies not train their employees anymore? I know training is expensive, but employers have the opportunity to advertise for a *huge* pool of talent that are proven, capable learners and mold them to be exactly what they need, yet no one seems to hire anyone who hasn't been trained by someone else already.

Am I missing something?"

My employer just sent me a W-4 to fill out, and my understanding is that the more allowances that you have, the less they withhold for federal income tax. The thing is, I understand that the standard deduction is $6,300, and the personal exemption is $4,000. My parents still list me as a dependent so I can't claim the personal exemption. This will make my taxable income about $3,700. So my income tax liability should be around $370 for the summer. I need almost all my money in September for school, and I don't want to wait around until January 2017 for a refund. How many allowances should I claim so they withhold roughly this amount, and not a whole bunch more? I can't really afford to wait for a fat refund. "
4hjyh0,98,2016-05-02,Bloodline spoilers,Nonsuch42,StarWarsLeaks,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/4hjyh0/bloodline_spoilers/,"I got hold of Bloodline early thanks to my local bookstore having no respect for release dates (!). I'm nearly finished, and have some preliminary thoughts on it below that will be relevant to the timeline/backstory. Most of this has probably come up but I thought I would share my take:

- Ben is 23 when the novel takes place and if the destruction of the Jedi has happened Leia sure as hell doesn't know about it. There is no suggestion of anything being 'off' with Ben - Leia is worried about him, but for reasons that appear to have very little to do with Ben himself.

- There is maddeningly absolute silence from Ben and Luke; this, of course, is entirely by design. Up to 3/4 of the way in, Leia has spent the whole novel intermittently trying to reach them (via the Star Wars equivalent of Skype) without success. While there is a lot of stress on the fact that communications are often bad, I find this silence very ominous indeed. I’m sticking with the theory that the academy attack has either already happened by or happens during the events of the book. I don’t think it happens as a direct consequence of the book’s central revelation (this is a hunch more than anything else, but it's what I'm sticking with).

- The key reveal in the book is Leia being outed as Vader’s daughter by a rival senator. This completely ruins Leia’s political career and means her fellow senators view her with horror and disgust. Leia’s primary concern is Ben - she hasn’t told him the truth previously because she never felt it was the right time. She records a private message explaining the truth to him, though we’re not privy to what that message entails - all we’re told is that she’s red eyed after recording it.

- The Falcon is implied to have gone missing before the events of the novel, so it has been lost for at least six years by the events of TFA.

- Han, who is heavily involved in the racing world and lives apart from Leia due to their respective careers, is suggested to have regular contact with Luke and Ben. This is a direct contradiction of the novelisation, which suggests that Han hasn't seen Ben’s face since he was a teen. [Cue dramatic music.] The single unified canon project is crumbling before our eyes!

- It is public knowledge that Luke and Leia are siblings. That Padme is their mother is also implied to be known in certain circles. It appears that their father's identity as Anakin/Vader is what was kept secret.

- Luke is generally alluded to rather than referenced outright, but those times where he is actually described suggest someone with saintly patience and wholehearted and enthusiastic acceptance of Vader's redemption. Leia clearly finds Luke's attitude towards Vader and his redemption very difficult to accept. The senate views Luke with considerable suspicion in the wake of the parentage reveal, and it is suggested that his Jedi powers - combined with his lineage - might make him a threat. This suspicion is intensified by the intense secrecy that surrounds him. Luke keeps his affairs very private.

- There are a few very fleeting references to Ben. Leia evidently thinks of him as a boy more than a man, mentally comparing him (in terms of his youth) to her 16-year-old intern Korr Sella. This may provide further meaning to Han’s reference to a “boy” destroying Luke’s Jedi project. The idea seems to be that she surrounds herself with young people (her staff tend to skew young) and mothers and supports them in the absence of her own son. There is also the faint suggestion that Ben's Force abilities are kept quiet, since Leia holds herself back from revealing that at one point.

I’m obviously going to have more developed thoughts on this once I get to the end, but that’s it for now. It’s a great read and I strongly recommend picking it up asap."

I’m paid really well and I would love to work here for a few years. However, my contract is only for 6 months. When I initially got hired, the recruiter and hiring manager made it seem likely that an extension would happen if they liked me. Unfortunately, I have some doubts and I’m worried if in case it all falls through.

&amp;nbsp;

I’ve just leased an apartment for 1 year, and I’m worried that I won’t have a job to pay rent after 6 months. Is it possible for me to take on a part-time remote dev job? I don’t have too much professional experience besides this current job and a past internship. In my current QA role, the work isn’t too difficult or demanding, but writing automation tests all day isn’t my passion. I could get onto a web or mobile dev job and improve my portfolio.

2. Was it really that easy for you to make friends during your work term? Did you guys actually hang outside of work hours and such?

3. Is it true that most interns put in lots of overtime work and it's pretty much expected of us? E.g. I have a buddy who worked at a startup in San Fran and he worked 11-12 hour days at times.

4hknxj,77,2016-05-02,I went from 0 coding experience to landing a paid programming internship at IGN.com this Summer! AMA (sort of)!,bodhibell02,FreeCodeCamp,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeCodeCamp/comments/4hknxj/i_went_from_0_coding_experience_to_landing_a_paid/,"Hello! 

FreeCodeCamp asked me to answer questions and explain my story here on the subreddit, so here I am. 


I had 0 coding experience until last July when I started with Team Treehouse for HTML/CSS and then found FreeCodeCamp. I have completed everything up to the React Dungeon Crawler, and I have done a few side projects as well on my own with Udemy lessons etc. I applied for the internship on a whim (I saw it on the IGN website, I am a huge fan of them) and got it! I believe 6 interns were accepted from a ton of applicants. 


I think one of the most interesting things about this internship process was that there was no technical coding interview, but there WAS coding homework. Check it out here: http://www.ign.com/code-foo/2016/. This plus a skype interview and that is all it took. I think I had some compassion from the guy who interviewed me because he too was self-taught and he knew how hard it was to get his foot in the door. (I am also decent at coding I guess?). I will be the oldest intern there at 31 :)


So it is possible! it is just step 1, I mean I obviously want a full time gig!


I will answer any questions sporadically when I check my inbox, but please ask away. 


UPDATE:  I am no coding prodigy. I am not some expert genius. I worked hard, and slowly got better, and I guess I am at intern level. Things lined up nicely with this internship (location, hiring manager could relate to my position). The internship could be awful (I think they use a lot of PHP, ew), I could fail, I still have to find a full time job! Look, I still suck at coding...we all do in some ways, and should always try to achieve mastery...


From Dan Pink in the book DRiVE:


""In the end, mastery often involves working and working and showing little improvement, perhaps with a few moments of flow pulling you along, then making a little progress, and then working and working on that new, slightly higher plateau again. It's grueling to be sure. But that's not the problem; that's the solution""



I cannot think of a better explanation of what programming should be. It fits perfectly!"

We've had our ups and downs, often relating to her changing everything about herself when she dates guys, but this is...something I don't know how to handle.

I met Sarah's boyfriend, Tom [26M], a year and a half ago when I was home on winter break. I liked him well enough; despite being older, he seemed sweet and unlike in the past, it didn't seem like Sarah had changed her whole personality to be exactly what he wanted.

When I came home from college last May, I met Tom's best friend, Zack [25M]. All three of them live in a house owned by Tom. A few hours after I left their house, Sarah called and said Zack was really interested in me and wanted my number. I thought he was kind of boring, but Sarah talked me into it.

Our first date started at a restaurant and ended watching movies at their house. Zack made me a very strong alcoholic drink and I didn't feel comfortable driving home, especially because I'm underage and it would have been a 45 minute drive. Sarah set up an air mattress for me and she and Tom went to bed early. When the movie ended, Zack talked me into sleeping in his room and lied, saying we didn't have to ""do anything."" Instead, he raped me; I cried and said no many times and he went ahead anyway.

So when Zack tried calling and texting me the next week, I quietly freaked out and just...ignored him. I knew I had an out of state internship that I was leaving for in approximately 3 weeks, so this seemed like a good solution to my anxious brain. Then I got a call from Sarah, complaining about how whiny Zack was being because I was ignoring him and how I needed to fix that.

Which is how I ended up on a second date with him at the movie theater. I thought a public place would be safe, but Zack would not stop groping me throughout the movie.

I went back to ignoring him and when Sarah called to complain again, I was firm and said she needed to deal because I wasn't interested. I did not tell her about what really happened until I came home from my internship, just before I went back to college (early August). She seemed really understanding as to why I wouldn't want to be around Zack anymore and when we hung out over winter break, it was always away from her house.

I have been in therapy for what happened and was even hospitalized in January for trying to kill myself. I struggle a lot with blaming myself. If you're going to write comments about how it's my fault or whatever, please be respectful and click the back button instead. The rape happened and that's not the issue.

My issue is this: Sarah and Tom got engaged last month. She is ecstatic and I want desperately to be happy for her, but instead, I keep having nightmares about Zack being the best man and me being the maid of honor and being forced to walk down the aisle together. It's bad enough that I'm considering asking not to be a bridesmaid all together, but then I imagine watching their wedding from the crowd while my rapist is up there, standing next to Tom and that freaks me out too.

I honestly don't know what to do or say. I think Sarah has kind of figured out that I'm less than enthusiastic about her engagement, but is not necessarily connecting the dots as to why.

TLDR: my bff's fiance's bff raped me last year and despite her knowing this, I don't know how to break it to her that I likely won't be able to go to her wedding for my own mental health if he's involved."

I am coming from /r/personalfinance, where I asked [the following question](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4hjku4/better_offer_but_not_sure_about_experience_it/) about a job offer. I was tentatively advised to take it, but also advised to ask the question here for a more in-depth look at the experience aspect of my question: 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I have an offer that I *think* I really want to take. The position is at a large financial company in a good city, and pays right down my alley at around 63k with attractive benefits. To recap: I’m a computer science grad (this week), and ideally I’d love experience at a good company in software development. But, I’m also not the perfect candidate: I have an alright gpa (3.4), but I have no internship experience, which I know has held me back.

&gt;*(tl;dr): Would I be making a mistake for a software dev career down the road by accepting an infrastructure/database job offer?*

&gt;**The Position:** 
The title is actually called associate systems and support analyst, but as far as I can tell it has nothing to do with the field of “systems analysis,” despite the fact that they sound similar. The position itself seems to be more related to infrastructure, and database maintenance (like live monitoring of a database for erroneous entries? I’m not sure if I’m explaining this correctly). 

&gt;The position *doesn’t* have a strict focus on software development. Though the development process is in the job description, the interviewers flat out told me that development isn’t a big part of the role (and languages I have experience in aren’t on the job desc.). *There is a software dev track in this company for entry level,* but I believe I applied too late in the semester to snag one of those roles, as I was busy applying elsewhere and this company just slipped my mind. (Such is life.)

&gt;That being said, this is the best offer I've received so far. If I don't accept it, then I can safely continue looking for explicit dev positions, but at the obvious cost of not having a job getting experience in something.

&gt;**My question is,** if I take this position, will its lack of development exposure hinder me in finding software development positions in the future? OR, can it be only a good thing, given my lack of an internship? My understanding is that roles like QA, etc., have a tendency to pigeonhole CS grads into that type of role later in life. But do I risk that with accepting this position, or is it different, and only a neutral/good thing, given my lack of experience? The job offers exposure in database tech at least, like DB2 and  Oracle/SQL."

Like I said, I am a recent grad (Dec 2015) from Michigan State looking to gain some great UI/UX experience. I've been working as a freelancer since about last June when I decided to take up UX. Unfortunately, a lot of places won't hire you on as a contractor if you don't have any experience.

I am looking for a full-time permanent position or a full-time paid internship. I am open to contract work.

I'm experienced in Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, and After Effects. I am also well-versed in the full UX process. I really shine at conceptualization, wireframes (I use Axure), and prototypes. I'm skilled in user research but would love more experience in that arena, especially with administering/conducting user tests and interviews.

It's a technology consultant position so the description says there is a lot of travel but other employees say it's usually not more than 50% your first years.

I have the option of living out of the city (closer to the airport) for around 800/mo. This would be a 30-40 minute commute one-way when I am not traveling. I would also have to pay $5/day for parking. Or, I could live in the city, close to my home office for 1050/mo. This would be a 20 minute walk to work.

I plan on saving around 1000/month which entails 401(k) contribution and Roth IRA. I already have a Roth with about 10k in it. I have 10k in a savings account from working internships and odd jobs that I am living on right now.

Thanks to scholarships, going to a state school, and internships, I am graduating with no student loan debt. I have no credit car debt. I bought my car used in cash: Honda Civic, so no car payment. I am currently living on my 10k savings and usually spend 1000 on food, insurance, cell phone, entertainment, etc.

There are also apartments I could get for 600-700/month, which are 20-30 minutes from work, but obviously not as nice, and more ""hood"". 

Would you guys go for the longer commute, larger apartment, and save more money, because of the anticipated travel? Or is 1050/mo still reasonable in my budget and live in the smaller apartment downtown.

Probably about two months ago I would cry when I left my boyfriend's house for the weekend. There was no real reason for it. However, now it seems I'm uncontrollably crying a few days a week and for like an hour or more until I can calm myself down. I'm not even entirely sure why I'm crying sometimes. Crying does help me feel better but I have homework to do and don't have time for that right now.

Some reasons why I've been stressing

-I'm graduating college and I'm excited now but change always makes me super anxious. Anytime when I would start a new semester in school I would be super nervous and scared.

-I have an internship at a local magazine and they said in order to work there I have to make up my own job which I haven't been doing because I have this online class which is taking up all my time and freedom. I have an overwhelming feeling that I'm not good enough. The last article I wrote wasn't the best and I don't have the best plan for what I want to do with my life there.  I hate everyone asking me what my plans are for the future. I hate that everyone expects me to have a full time job when I'm done. I just want to take my time. 

-I don't have as many friends as I used to have. Which is kind of good because a lot of them are doing hard drugs and I don't think it would be healthy to be around that. But it's hard to find new friends and the close friends I have are incredibly close with each other and I feel like a fourth wheel. Also, when trying to talk to people it's so hard not to come off as desperate. I saw an old ex best friend at my work the other day and was like ""well if you ever wanna hang out you should text me"" and she just gave me the finger guns and a smile and walked away.

-I was tired for like a week and a half last week. Then a day ago I was incredibly awake and stayed up till 9 am, then I got up at 1:30 pm and went to work. After work I wasn't tired and it made me worried and I drank NyQuil to sleep. This happens frequently. Don't know if it's related to my cycle??

I've recently secured an internship at a great investment company in Kansas City, MO which runs from early June-August. While I'm extremely pleased too start this internship I want to start working full time after this internship (assuming all goes well), but still have three classes left to complete in the fall. I've signed up for all online classes, so I would be able to work full time at this company through fall in hopes they will offer it too me. My question is this. I understand this is dependent on each company, but has anyone ever received and started working a full time job, while completing the last of their classes for their bachelor's degree? Or do most companies want to wait to hire until the bachelors degree is completed? In this case, this is an entry level IT job where I would be doing internal desktop support and states in the job description that a bachelors degree is necessary. If anyone has any advice or thoughts on this I would really appreciate it. Thank you."
4hm9ct,5,2016-05-03,Made out with the wrong person and can't figure out what to do.,Tifu_throwaway_hobag,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/4hm9ct/made_out_with_the_wrong_person_and_cant_figure/,"So about two weeks ago my friend Rachel (all names changed to protect the innocents) invited me to a dorm party. She wanted me to meet her friend Tracy, because Tracy, like myself, is a lesbian. I'm graduating this winter before moving out-of-state (about an hour away by train), so I'm also kinda hoping to have a last fling/one-night-stand before My last semester.

Anyway while Rachel is telling me about the other people she's inviting she mentions this guy Logan. My curiosity is piqued because I've known Logan for about a year (we're in the same major and I hang out with his younger brother) and he's always come off as a VERY repressed gay boy, from a terrifyingly conservative family, so hearing he was going to be at a party with alcohol and weed was interesting to say the least. I asked Rachel what his deal is, since I've always assumed he was deep in denial about his sexuality. She told me that he's bisexual and also transgendered (pre-everything) and apparently not in denial about it at all.

(SIDE NOTE: ima keep referring to Logan as ""he"" in this story because those are the pronouns he is still comfortable with as they match his current presentation. But Logan's true gender IS female. Don't tear me to shreds for this linguistic choice.)

So hearing Logan is trans is like a switch getting flipped in my head because it feels so right. One reason I used to think he was just cis-gay is because you look at him and you can see the estrogen in how it's influenced his body shape and there's this effortless femininity to his expressions and gestures. Plus I always found him a bit attractive. I am a lesbian, but I do casually crush on gay guys from time to time, I think because my brain picks up on this hormonal chromosomal stuff.

Fast forward two days to the party. I begin hitting on Tracy. Tracy's nice, smart, fun to talk to, obviously into me. We drink, we play beer pong, strip poker, and have fun. I mix Logan drinks and accidentally get him super drunk--I learn belatedly that he already has the alcohol tolerance of a woman and has actually never been this drunk. I take responsibility for my mistakes and bring him water and sit with him a bit. He's complimenting me on my outfit and dancing and talking about what he wants for his transition. I do my best to bolster his expectations.

Wasted past the point of recovery, Logan goes to bed in the 1st bedroom. Tracy puts on her favorite song ""I write sins not tragedies"" and at the chorus I kiss her like only a drunk lesbian can. We go into the 2nd bedroom and she gets on top of me for like two seconds before she remembers that all her friends are in the next room. I don't care, but she does, so whatever, we go back out.

The dancing winds down and Rachel is super pumped about her wingwomanship abilities. She tells me that apparently this was Tracy's first kiss. ""Oh fuck"" says my commit-o-phobe brain. On one hand I'm happy for Tracy because doesn't EVERYONE want their first kiss to be from a super hot blonde (note: May be biased description) while their favorite song plays in the background and all their friends raise a glass? On the other hand I was only looking for a fling/one-night-stand and I'm getting vibes from Rachel and Tracy both that Tracy wants something more.

I play the rest of the night out. We go to get late-night Chinese and I hold Tracy's hand at the diner, act super couply, blah blah, she gets my number, and at the end of the night I kiss her goodnight before we go our separate ways.

She texts me the next day. I text back but I'm really feeling it, plus she's so quick to be vulnerable, saying how much she likes me and wants to see me again, blah blah. (I'm guarded because my last relationship u-hauled and was a disaster, and I've never met Tracy before, so I want to just brake if it's not gonna be casual.) This is our last week of classes, with finals next week, and with my internship on top of that and some health issues with my dad I am legitimately booked. So I say ""I can't take anything else on my plate right now."" Which is kinda true. But it's not the whole truth. Because the reality is, which I've realized now that I've been sober for four days, is that I can't stop thinking about Logan. It's like my subconscious has known about the trans thing forever, and now that my conscious mind knows as well, it's got permission to just go fucking haywire with this attraction. I am a 22-year-old woman and this is like some middle school shit.

God, I am my own worst enemy. I went into that party knowing I thought Logan was attractive. I remember being drunk and knowing I was still attracted to him. And yet my stupid idiot drunk brain was like, ""but I'm technically supposed to be here for Tracy."" So I made out for fun with someone awesome and who actually really likes me now, and not only made out, but led her on past the point when I realized she was way more into me than I was into her. And I need to tell her that without fucking up the memory of the great time we had with what we did because it's her fucking first kiss and I think it'd be nice for that to be a good memory for her, you know? And I need to figure out what my options are to deal with this Logan thing. Because by this point he's heard about me and Tracy and even if he actually is into me there's very few ways I get what I want without being just the biggest piece of shit ever.

TL;DR: made out with and then led on an awesome girl who likes me too much instead taking a risk and going for the girl I'm crazy about who probably doesn't think about me at all. There's no way I can think of for me to fix this without being a mega asshole."

Classes are out but working a summer internship 8-4 with a 1hr commute each way so I'm left with a) waking up early as fuck but then going from 1pm-next morning without food b) being awake for 10 hours before starting workout

Being able to wake up at 10 and gym 11-1 past few months really spoiled me

I'm thinking eat a decebt sized bowl of oats with Pb around 1 then an apple around 3 then workout 5-630/7 with a shake and some bananas half way through, finally get home and eat a fatass meal and then peace out to bed and repeat

How detrimental would this be though?"
4hmvzr,1,2016-05-03,I need THIS life to stop.,VictorMancini85,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4hmvzr/i_need_this_life_to_stop/,"Hi there. This is my first post here but not the first time I stop to read, thanks for the support you give, it meant a lot even without being involved in the thread. 

I am sorry if this gets a bit too long, English is not my first language and I'm not used to talk about feelings, so I might need more words than strictly necessary. 

The main point of me writing this post is that I'm sick and tired of my life routine, but complaining about it only got me very bad reactions. 

Maybe I am lazy and spoiled, maybe I was too lucky for most of my life and now I can't cope with work because I have no discipline. That's what my girlfriend seems to mean when she complains about me complaining. 

I'm almost 31, for the last 15 months I've been working day and night with a partner on our own business. Things are starting to work out, we are hiring our first employee, who is finishing an internship in a month and seems to be a good fit. 

For the first time in months, last weekend I could sleep more than 6 hours and ""forget"" about work, maybe some day this week I can even get home before 20:00. 

Everyone around me says it is worth it, they seem to be pretty sure about it, way more than I am. They say it's an investment and we are lucky to have clients in this economy. 

Fuck that shit. I can't afford to buy soil for my plants (soil is dirt cheap, literally), I pay the bills and the end of the month starts on the 5th for me. Can't buy clothes to wear for work, can't go out to dinner, not a single night, can't afford my cat to be sick because that means using my business credit card and being even more broke for a couple of months. And I am hungry most of the time because my stomach is way bigger than my bank account. 

I think of death as a relief. I think of killing myself every day, but I just can't. It makes me think of my loved ones having to pay for a crappy funeral where no friends are going (I've been a terrible and very distant friend) and it makes me sadder, but it takes suicide out of the picture for a while. So I light up some weed and it lightens up my mind. I've been an occasional smoker since I was 16, but with my financial history I never had a chance to abuse. Last year I grew a couple of plants and that's how I can afford it now. For the last month I've been trying not to smoke for a week and didn't even get to the first 24 hours (I've had plenty of weed available for the last 7 months, but this habit is new). 

I don't know if the drug is causing a depression or a depression is making me use, but every day I feel like killing myself until I smoke and then I look at my problems in a different way. I wake up my ass from the couch, cook some shitty shit and go to bed defeated again. I can cook like a pro, but I just don't want to any more. 

It feels like the only thing I can decide about, and taking the choice of smoking again while I listen to some music is the only moment of happiness I can afford. 

My girlfriend used to be a loving and supportive one, but no one loves a broken man and I know it's just a matter of time till she leaves. It makes me sad, but I made up my mind long time ago, it's quite understandable, no one wants to live like this. 

For the business, things have been growing quickly for the last 5 months, at the beginning of 2016 I was looking for a job, just to know what I could afford to look for, but not with the biggest expectations. I got the interest of a couple of big firms, but I ratted out because I got some clients and I hoped things would get better faster. I always had problems with authority and I am scared of having a boss and not liking him, I tend to do stupid things like pointing it out in front of everybody. 

At this pace, I might be able to take some days off this year, but I don't know if I have the strength to get to that. I feel exhausted and sad. 

My mother, the one who might have spoiled me by filling my shelves with every book I asked for, was diagnosed with cancer last December. She's gonna make it, the diagnose was on time, but I haven't been able to visit since her first chemo session, which was at the end of January. And that hurts, like it hurt when I couldn't visit my younger brother in hospital after a spine surgery. 

I just can't find a meaning for all this. I find myself crying alone at least once a week, and that has never happened to me. I don't want to take any drugs, not even marihuana, of course. I just want to get back to the gym, sleep 8 hours and have some food on the table. And I feel so weak, because I know there are people out there with bigger problems who deal with it, but I can't even find support. People look at me like my brothers do: the big guy with tons of confidence and all the answers. But I am done, behind closed doors I am just done. 

I thought this was gonna make me feel better, but I already stopped twice to cry and that's too much feelings for me. Thanks for reading this, I hope I can write something funnier soon. "

I have a Bachelor's in Communication. I've completed three unpaid internships and have been working a PR position for 5 months. 

I work in a very small office with a group of people who are close friends and have worked together for years. I feel that several of my fellow employees have both been over-critical to the point where I feel llike I can't do anything around them from sending a fax to asking a question in a meeting, without being criticized, and one of them has also been very condescending and it has made it hard to work with them.  

My boss has been unavailable and has communicated to me that my job is ""not priority"" for her on several occasions. I've also received very little (essentially nothing) in the way of training. 

I received a performance review last week. There were some criticisms that I agreed with whole-heartedly. I fully embrace that I have made mistakes and that there are areas for improvement in my work. However, there were also statements in the performance review that did not accurately represent certain situations. The review also contained at least two statements that were outright erroneous. The way it was worded I am wondering if they are setting up to fire me. 

I feel like the situation I'm in is toxic. I'm a very hard worker. I worked three unpaid internships and four retail jobs before this and received only outstanding evaluations. I've put 110% into this job-coming in early, staying late, working outside of regular hours to complete projects some of which were not explicitly assigned to me. I'm also smart-I got grades in both high school in college. However, being in this office my confidence has dwindeled down to nothing. 

For the sake of my mental health I need to get out of this environment. I know that this is not the smartest thing I could do career wise but I've struggled with my mental health in the past and I am very familiar with what my breaking point is. I've far surpassed it.

My main point in posting is I'm wondering what my options are, and I am exploring everything.

My idea is to apply for every office position I'm qualified for at two local hospitals, and also look on Indeed for receptionist roles around the area I live in while taking every state and county test I can find. I'm willing to work two jobs. I'm willing to put in more than 40 hours to make ends meet. I just want to be treated fairly. 

Any advice?"

Ive been wanting to land an internship, to gain experience. Now the issue is, some of the things shes mentioned, Ive never had experience doing(using a particular coding languages) When she calls back should I make her aware of this ? As I dont want to seem like an idiot once hired. 

Another Dilemma is that I had an interview last week with Company B, and the interview went really well. I just hope they thought likewise. Company B will be making a decision come later this week. 

How do I go about holding off Company A, respectfully, until Company B makes a decision on whether or not I have the position. Also making Company A aware of my not so steller coding background(IT major - MIS concentration).

I'm a brother from Madison who's got an internship at UIowa for the summer. I'm wondering where I could look beyond Craigslist since I'm not familiar with it, or even if anyone on here is looking for someone.

I know at UW, we have a roommate and sublet Facebook group, but for some reason ours requires that you are a UW student. Does UIowa have something similar?

The internship goes through August and starts in June so it would really only be for the summer months (unless I found something else out there).

And also, I'm excited because of never been to Iowa city! Of course, I am a badger so my heart is in Madison, but I'm exceptionally excited to have the opportunity to visit another B1G college town. What are some things you recommend checking out in the summer?

My understanding is that 80% of students leave, but I'm wondering if that's a good or bad thing in terms of experiencing in the city. (Many people appreciate how Madison slows down after the May 14th exodus).

4hnymk,2,2016-05-03,Not sure if I'm depressed or just kind of a piece of shit.,smvmgothrowaway,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4hnymk/not_sure_if_im_depressed_or_just_kind_of_a_piece/,"I recognize that the title makes it seem fairly obvious, but still.  I feel like I need to write this out, and I want other people to react to it.  I'm sorry it's so long, and I know I should probably just go see a therapist, but I'd like to hear what someone who I'm not paying thinks of the whole 13 year shebang.  Without all the parts, it's not the whole story.

My whole elementary to high school life was lived either at home or on a church campus.  Tiny church school my whole life, 7 people in my class.  I ran everything at that little school.  Newspaper, Student Council, even the basketball team at an intimidating 5'4"".  I was the wunderkind.

I graduated from that school at 17, went to a (still pretty small) Christian college and found out exactly how small my pond had been.  I did okay my first year, but I lost my scholarships, which required me to maintain a 4.0.  The second year my mom moved to a different state, and since I didn't know how to exist without an adult around, I transferred to a different Christian college near her.

Here's where it gets weird.  Somewhere in the middle of the second semester of that year, I stopped going to class.  I had been kind of engaged at the time, I say ""kind of"" because it was long distance and there wasn't a ring and we were both just dumb kids and there was no way we were getting married, but yes.  She got pregnant, which I thought was odd since I was a virgin, so that ended.  

I say all that because if you asked anyone who knows me, up to and including my wife, they would tell you that I had a kind of mental breakdown due to being cheated on, and being far away from my social circle, and due to losing my belief in God, because that's what I've told everyone forever.  I told everyone that I stayed in bed for days questioning reality, because it was a better story than ""I gave up on my classes and played PS2 in the dorm for a month straight"".  

I eventually realized I needed an excuse for this, so I went to the school psychiatrist and said what I needed to say to get a depression diagnosis and a prescription.  In my head, this was an act.  A play for pity so maybe so my professors would go easy on me at the end of the year.  And yet it is true that in the middle of several crises piled up on themselves at the age of 19, I couldn't make myself get up to go to class at the school that was costing $20k/year.  I look back and see that I was legitimately exhibiting symptoms.  I even took the meds for a while, but they messed with my dong, so I stopped taking them.  After all, I wasn't really depressed.

I was suspended from that school at the end of the year for poor academic performance.  Which was just as well, because my mom got her old job back and we moved back home, and I went back to my old college.  Things were going to get better now.  I had my friends back, my pseudo-fiancee was well in the past.  Except no, another lazy semester and more academic suspension.  I took the next semester off to get myself together.  I honestly don't remember what happened during that time.  And that's not me saying I was like blackout drunk all the time, I just can't recall.  I assume it was uneventful.

The next semester I tried a college I could commute to.  The reasoning went that I was living with my mom, so I couldn't get out of going to class.  Except I could totally just go to the mall, or in one particularly stupid instance, drive to a parking lot and just sleep in my car.  I didn't make it through that semester either.  So I took more time off.  The student loans were piled up at this point, but hardship deferment made things easy, I could ignore the consequences.

I was 21 at this point, and I got a job at my old high school.  This led to the single biggest mistake I've ever made.  A student became infatuated with me, and I let that grow instead of squelching it.  I want to be clear that no laws were broken, it never got physical while I worked there, and she was otherwise legally of age to consent.  But it was obvious that she got special attention.  That was easy to rationalize, she was uh... not academically gifted.  Her home life was garbage, so why shouldn't she come over for tutoring (again I emphasize, that is not a euphemism).  

Well, after a year of this sort of thing, my mom asked me what the hell I was doing.  Both in general and with the student.  She pleaded with me to go back to school, promised to help cover my bills if I'd just give it one last real try.  So I did.  The student and I became an item at this point, because I'm an idiot.  I enrolled at a school about an hour away, because it was late December and they were still taking applications for January admission.

I went to class.  Not every day, not every time, but I passed a semester's worth of classes for the first time in 4 years.  It seemed like I was on the upswing.  And hey, objectively I was.  I passed the next semester too.  Eventually tensions with my mother boiled over and resulted in me having a strange episode of suicidal desires.  I was ""winning"" this college game again, but I didn't want to play.  I didn't want a 9 to 5 in a cubicle staring at a screen all day just to pay my mountain of student loan debt.  I wanted to spend that time staring at screens in my room apparently.  I don't know what I wanted, but I didn't want this.

I was sincere in thinking that death was my only out, but I also felt like it was big enough of a decision that I should try to let someone talk me out of it.  It turns out that's not what those hotlines are for.  Or the hospitals.  I was in a really weird spot.  Eventually I just told everyone I wasn't going to do it, and that was sincere too, but the problem wasn't resolved.  I'd just keep going through these motions and hope a meteor came for me or something.

In the middle of my 3rd semester at school, a professor mentioned an internship that was in a city adjacent to the city I lived in, but an hour away from everyone else.  Lucky me.  I got it.  Cubicle time.  I was really having a hard time making myself do all this shit when I wanted no part of it, but I knew it was what I had to do if I didn't have the guts to off myself.  Then my mom kicked me out.  And look, yeah, it was awful timing on her part, but I was insufferable.  I had at some point broken up with the student from earlier, but she had dropped out of high school.  We both suddenly needed a place to live, so we decided to move in together.  We lived together for the next 3 years.  

I mean, she was at least 18 at this point, but she was just so fucking stupid.  I honestly don't even mean it in a malicious way, she just objectively had the IQ of a head of cabbage.  You could tell after two seconds of talking with her.  But attention felt good, and a roof over my head felt better.  Now I had absolutely no choice but to go to the school I didn't want to go to (Can't pay the rent without even more student loans!), and the internship I didn't want (it was paid, but part time), so that I could keep coming home to my personal hell.   

She just made everything so hard.  The agreement was that I'd put her through beauty school and then we would transition off of my student loans to live, and on to her income.  Well she went full Grease and dropped out of beauty school.  Later she tried a semester at community college, and just didn't go.  I didn't see the irony at the time, but I quickly realized how my mother felt.  I guess my mother wasn't depending on my income to pay rent, but still.  The student got a job at what I'll call a diner, and eventually became a shift manager.  So there's that, anyway.

But I kept going to school and to work.  After taking commutes into consideration, I had a 50-hour schedule every week.  I made up for this by not going to class nearly as often as I should have, but eventually, through all of it, I graduated.  I was 27 years old, it took me 10 years and 16 semesters, but I had a bachelor's degree.  The 9 month internship had gone for years longer than it was supposed to, and they hired me after graduation.  And it was finally time to cut ties with the student.  I found her a different shift manager job at a restaurant that paid way too much.  And by ""found"", I mean I put together her ""resume"" and did all the personality and math tests for her.  They were really excited to get someone who scored that high on the math.  I have no idea how she's still there 3 years later, but my understanding is that she is.

Anyway, I moved.  I had a degree, a job that paid a livable wage, my own apartment (with virtually no furniture, but still).  Clearly, I was never depressed.  Could a someone with crippling depression have done what I'd just done for as long as I had without eating a fucking bullet? Somehow I had.  But loneliness is hard to deal with.  I was no stranger to beer or weed at that point, but I became particularly well acquainted.  Every day for weeks, I was high or drunk.  It stopped when I realized that was a bad thing.  I admitted to myself that just maybe I really was having a problem, and I found a therapist.  I was honest.  I got put on Wellbutrin.  I made an OKCupid profile, went on dates, and in October I married my wife.  I haven't been to therapy in a long time because there were insurance issues and fuck me, finding a therapist I can gel with is annoying.  But clearly, I was depressed and I beat it through therapy and medication, right?

I fucking hate my job.  I have no motivation here.  Mornings are hell, and my boss understands that once or twice a month, I'm just going to work from home or take a PTO day because I don't fucking feel like coming in.  I'm absurdly lucky that he's cool with it.  My apartment is a mess, because neither my wife nor I ever want to get up and clean.  I mean, I've seen much worse apartments, because every now and then one of us realizes the depth of our squalor and makes a bit of an effort, but yes.  I'm 325 pounds and can't make myself stick to a diet or exercise plan.

I want to make music.  I played piano and guitar as a kid, I played in praise bands all through my teenage years.  I remember that it made me happy.  I have a keyboard that is collecting dust in my closet, and every time I think of setting it up, I feel like someone asked me to push a rock up a hill.  My two best friends got me a modded game boy with LSDJ as a wedding present so I could make chiptune stuff with it because I thought it would be such a cool way to make music.  They put so much effort into it and now it just sits on my desk.  I pick it up sometimes, and I just put it back down.  I can't make myself do anything to improve my situation and it's driving me crazy.

But I'm on Wellbutrin!  I was doing so well!  I thought I finally had this thing beat, and I'm still just... fucking miserable.  I love my wife.  She's the bright spot.  But we don't do anything, and she's even more of a shut-in than I am.  So I'd be lying if I said I was sure that was making things better.  And now my two best friends, really my only two friends, are moving across the country this year.  My wife doesn't really have friends, she left her social circle in another state to be closer to her family.  I have no idea what I'm going to do.  When I think about going to meetup groups or something I just feel like it's a pointless exercise.  I just play video games and watch Twitch while my wife reads or plays on her tablet.  We're just distracting ourselves from our misery because neither of us can help each other or ourselves.

So I'm confused.  If I feel the same way while medicated that I did before, then I feel like I couldn't have been depressed.  This is just... me.  Which I know is a very depressed thing to say, that I'm not sick, I'm just an asshole.  But I'd beat it and now I haven't.  And I remember the beginning when it was all an act.  I feel like depression is just something I've deluded myself into believing so I can feel sorry for myself.  It's become headcanon for my own narrative, to explain all of my laziness and my failures and my social awkwardness and my inability to follow through on anything that would make my life better.  I don't know.  I'm not even sure why I've written all of this.  

If you've read all of this, you're probably the 4th best friend I have right now.  So thank you."

Everything about it looks great, including the company, it's what I want to do, everything. I'd received the contract to sign off on and was reading through it, and found something that somewhat concerns me.


The first is that you give permission to work overtime whenever, without being paid for overtime, and the other is that they have you opt out of the Working Time regulations (regulations which stop you from being able to work more than 48 hours a week). 


These two combined are somewhat concerning, as it seems they want me to give permission to possibly work a hefty amount of over time (and possibly a LOT of hours), and not get paid for it.


This will be my first real full time job barring an IBM internship I had, which didn't have these clauses. I was wondering if this is something to be expected from this industry, and if it's something to be concerned over. Obviously I'm not looking for any legal advice, just people's advice/experience. Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit!

I attended SCADs game design program in pursuit of 3D Art. Let's say it wasn't the best. A lot for the techniques they taught us were very outdated and I had to teach myself almost everything while there. Big waste of money and the advisors are not any help. The best advice they can offer is""connect with me on LinkedIn, look through my connecting and message people."" I'm pretty bitter. I don't think my portfolio is terrible. It's just not great. It's took me a year after college to build it up and I'm still trying to add in things that are missing. Its very difficult to get portfolio work done when I work a full time job to pay the bills. Unfortunately things for me have slowed for me quite a bit. Especially motivation wise. I wish I had the portfolio I have now at the time of graduating and maybe I could have done some internships. I've been thinking about quitting my job or reducing the hours significantly, taking out loans and going to school full time. It might be worth even if it is just to rebuild my professional network. I've exhausted my SCAD connections. I just don't know how I can balance working full time, taking classes and doing the hw. It seems there aren't enough hours in the day. My parents worked really hard to pay for my undergrad so i didnt have to worry about working full time. I could just focus on school. By no means are my parents rich. I could never ask them to do it again. I so badly want to have to have a future in this industry and not be a wage slave. My spirit is pretty broken. I'm 25 now and my life seems to be going no where. Any Gnomon students or alumni have any advice? Is this school really worth the risk? How do they help their recent grads?  I think I'd rather put myself into debt and have potential happiness than continue this dive into misery and depression. Ok sorry I'm ranting. Thoughts?

It was of course then that my younger sister Hayley had grown up.  And out, in particular - despite still not being old enough to drive, she had a bustline that defied the lingerie available at Victoria's Secret and required that she go to specialty shops given the slimness of her frame and the ampleness of her breasts. 

What surprised me was that wasn't the only part of her that developed above-and-beyond - while her 'special situation' was always something I'd known about since our parents entrusted her with that fact, I wasn't expecting that she was using my never-used Fleshlight (I found it too small), and that she was, as well, finding it too small.  

Maybe we could give it a rousing finale together....

I am currently in school for Computer Science, to hopefully get into Game Development. I went to SkillsUSA state with a group for game design and simulation, which we won first place and now go to Nationals in June.

All this sounds fine and dandy, though the thing is I want to quit from the competition, since the game we made was incredibly mediocre/boring by critics standards, amongst other things (internal politics in the organization is a big one)

The thing is, if I quit, I can kiss a recondmendation letter and a possible internship opportunity out the window, since that's what my teacher told me if I quit. 

But the other thing is though is that it I go, and if there is supposedidly industry people at this competition like she said there would be (there was supposed to be at the state but it was essentially just two judges, one from the school and the guy who I was supposed to intern for), wouldn't a mediocre product look bad on all of us anyways, and the industry people not take us seriously anyways?

I know it might be as obvious as ""Just go with the competition"", though I'm not entirely sure anymore. I honestly need an idea on what would be best."
4hpgkw,5,2016-05-03,Internship was a nightmare--what to do next?,majestic_alpaca,VetTech,https://www.reddit.com/r/VetTech/comments/4hpgkw/internship_was_a_nightmarewhat_to_do_next/,"After 5 days of my internship at a mixed large and small animal clinic in Missoula, MT, I had to quit because I couldn't reconcile the way that they practice medicine with my knowledge and experience with good, quality care. What I'm wondering is whether I morally need to do something more than distance myself from this place, such as report them to the DEA, or the AVMA, or even just spread the word locally somehow. Here's the story:

I've been working in the small animal field for 3 years in Portland, OR, working as both technician's assistant and as a surgical assistant. So I've seen a decent amount of small animal medicine, working in clinics with both a fairly low-income client base, and a very high-income client base. I've helped with procedures that I didn't agree with, but I have never felt uncomfortable with the care that we were providing. 

I moved to Montana just as I was finishing up my online Tech Program (perfect, since MT doesn't even have a licensing requirement :-/), and I just started my final internship, which includes a major large animal component. I expected large animal medicine to be different, and I was prepared to be shocked by the difference in the medicine practiced. What I wasn't prepared for was how these doctors practiced small animal medicine as well.

The list of issues that I have with the practice is extensive, but their anesthesia protocol is what made me leave. When a pre-med is given (which is about 50/50 I'd say), it is Telazol, sometimes with Ketamine. Creepy, old-school, but fine (again, when it is given). All animals are masked down for induction--ehh, uncomfortable, probably drastically increases the cortisol levels in the patients, but again, old-school and OK if done right. But it isn't. Half the time the animals are still screaming as they're being intubated with tubes that no longer have a functioning cuff. 

Once they're intubated, they're prepped normally for surgery and moved into the surgical room (which is filthy, BTW, I heard one DVM say, ""Why clean up the blood? It's just going to get bloody again in a minute."" and another say, ""I bet I could use this sx pack for all of my surgeries today to save washing time.""). Monitoring anesthesia consists of watching to make sure that the patient is still breathing. And that's it. Sometimes the tech remembers to put on a pulse-ox for which only the spO2 works, and that's only sporadically. Sometimes the tech leaves the room altogether, and no one is even watching to make sure the patient is breathing at all. And their carbolyme hasn't been changed in over a year. And you have to keep turning the flowmeter down because it gradually increases throughout the procedure. And. And. And.

So then the procedure is over and the patient is carried hog-style (holding ankles, head dangling with tube still in place) to a kennel in a closed room. The tech stays with them until the tube is removed, then promptly leaves to start the next surgery. I told them once that I wanted to stay with the patient until he was responsive, and was told ""He's fine, he's breathing.""

So routinely no pain control is given. At all. I asked one of the DVMs to use some, and he did at least give a Rimadyl injection. But then I asked one of the techs about it, and she gave me the 50-year-old explanation of, ""If they're in pain, they won't damage the sx site."" I told her that was BS and gave her some info about the benefits of pain and inflammation control post (and pre!) sx, but I don't think it made any difference--I'm just an intern, after all.

At this point I'm ranting, so feel free to stop reading if you want, but I just have to share this because I am still just in shock from how bad it all is. Yesterday, we had a brand new client come in with their dog for head shaking. DVM looks in ear, finds grass seeds, recommends sedated removal. Owner agrees, mentions that patient had laceration repair elsewhere recently as she is heading out the door. No records were exchanged, no history was taken, I don't even think that vitals were taken. Patient was incredibly anxious about being there to start, was then given Telazol and Ketamine and masked down for seed removal. Patient fought the gas hard--swimming for a good 3-4 minutes before finally going under. Seeds were removed within 60 seconds and gas was turned off. Patient promptly vomited an entire bowl-full of dog food (no one had asked when she last ate). Of course she hadn't been tubed, so I was concerned about aspiration, and told the DVM I was going to sit with her while she continued to wake up--otherwise I think she would have been carried to the kennel behind a closed door as is customary. She was incredibly dysphoric (What? An anxious dog becomes dysphoric with ketamine? Never!), and another tech and I had to pin her down to keep her from flailing and injuring herself. Finally the DVM wanders back into the room and I beg him to give her anything to calm her down. So he gives her DexDomitor. Not my choice, but at least she calmed down.

Then, DVM finally gets around to surgery that has been waiting in kennel all day at around 3:30pm. Turns out, patient is 15-year old spaniel in for a ""cyst"" removal. But she is covered in 20+ masses, that are mast cell tumors if I've ever seen them. I know you can't diagnose as a tech, and that even a DVM shouldn't diagnose just by looking, but the DVM hadn't done any actual diagnostics at all--he didn't even know which masses we were supposed to take off. In fact, he had advised the owners to euthanize rather than go through with the surgery, and was surprised to see the patient there at all. I asked him whether they looked like MCT to him, he said ""They're sebaceous cysts."" And that was the end of it. 

So he picked a few especially angry looking ones, and started cauterizing to remove them. I felt sick, but not because of the cautery. I felt sick because here was this old dog, who I am 75% sure was covered in MCT, who had been given the favorite cocktail of Telazol and Ketamine, and was now under anesthesia with absolutely no monitoring other than checking that she was breathing every now and then. She somehow made it through surgery, but the cauterizing wasn't successful and she kept bleeding through all of her sutures. And she took about 20 minutes to wake up. And then she was incredibly dysphoric for another 1.5 hours. And I didn't leave her side for fear that she would go into anaphylactic shock at any moment from the MCT reaction.

The DVM's response to both the slow recovery and the constant bleeding was to just keep her there overnight so that they could clean her up in the morning before she went home. I'm sure it isn't surprising to hear that no one is at the hospital overnight. I left at some point because there wasn't anything more that I could do. And this morning I contacted my school about finding a new location so that I don't have to be a part of that type of situation ever again. I assume she made it through the night, but I am 100% confident that neither of those procedures fit under the ""Do No Harm"" oath.

So what do I do now? They don't lock up or log their controlled drugs, so I could easily report them to the DEA. But I honestly don't think that anyone is abusing their drugs, and I'd rather do something that would cause them to change more than just the way that they store their drugs. I also don't want to ruin these people's lives. I don't know. I'm torn about whether I should do anything at all. What do you guys think?"
4hpina,1,2016-05-03,Research vs internship (for this summer),gradarch,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4hpina/research_vs_internship_for_this_summer/,"I've always thought that I was going to go into industry after graduating so my low GPA didn't worry me too much. I worked on personal projects and competitive programming to make up for it. I have CTCI and I planned to study it non stop for a month this summer before applying to US elite/prestigious companies. I graduate in December 2016 so I'd apply this summer. 

Now I'm considering grad school for computer architecture. Unfortunately I developed this interest after taking the computer architecture class.

I almost have a paid internship at Accenture (here in Dubai) lined up. Internships aren't that useful for grad school so I might decline the offer to do unpaid research at my university. My professor said he would give me some projects that he doesn't have time for (he's the department head) to work on. I assume he'll give me guidance as well. Maybe I'll get something published.

I'm very unqualified for grad school. Taking the position is useless if it can't offset my weaknesses. Here's my lack of qualifications:

1 - 2.6 GPA. major gpa is less. (I expect that my overall and major gpa will both become &gt;2.7 at the end of this semester. I'm expecting mostly A- or As)

2 - C- in computer architecture. C+ in operating systems. No compiler design class.

3 - This is [my school](http://www.aus.edu). Outside the US and ranked #400. I'm American though.

To make things even more bleak there's [this](https://www.quora.com/Can-I-get-into-grad-school-for-computer-architecture/answer/Shane-Ryoo?srid=7myq).

&gt;The field is shrinking rapidly and only a handful of companies now employ computer architects.  Even many of us that worked for renowned professors at top-5 schools no longer work in computer architecture: there aren't enough positions and only the top few students get the jobs.  That includes myself and several friends, many of whom work on processor-touching projects at Apple, Intel, Qualcomm, NVIDIA, and elsewhere.  We all had 3.9+ GPAs in undergrad from top-10 universities.  But we don't get to do computer architecture.

One option is to take this research opportunity and try to get into a low ranked school for masters and then a higher ranked one for PhD. Another option is to work for a few years in industry and then go to grad school. Another option is to abandon this entirely and go back to my original plan. With Facebook in particular I'm sure I can get an interview through my last recruiter (I failed the FB summer 2016 internship interview).

My questions:

1 - Could doing research until December give me a chance at a decent school? It's not worth dropping my internship if not.

2 - If I go to industry with plans of grad school later, would I have to do research? How long? Could I even get a research position without research experience?

3 - Is the computer architecture field really shrinking?"

I'm (very recently) divorced. I'm in school getting a masters in computer science and I'll be done in June 2017. I currently have an internship that pays well and a different one that starts this summer. I just found out that my current company won't be hiring me (or anyone else) back next fall, so I'm facing the possibility of a loss of income for about 9 months. I'm not in such a bad position, my assets are as follows:

Income $750 from support payments. While I'm in school (so 30 weeks of the year starting 2 months after my summer internship ends), $1620 plus another $350 every 3 months for books from the 9/11 GI Bill. I have a (cheap as I can find) car worth, maybe $1000. I have assets in vanguard: ~$150,000 in various bond funds and ~$100,000 in a Roth IRA. I have about $13,000 in a regular savings account, my checking account hovers around $4000 to $5000. 

My current internship brings in $2400 a month, my summer internship will bring in $3800 or so. Obviously, I'm concerned about 9 months plus however long it takes to find a job with a huge drop in income. Additionally, starting in the fall, I will very likely be making 6-ish hour car trips a couple of times per month and my current car just won't handle that.

My question is what are the tax implications of withdrawing from the vanguard bond funds? If I pull out $X, is that $X of income that I have to report on my taxes? Or since that money was already taxed, will I just have to pay capital gains on whatever profit I made on that money? Something else?

Thanks!"
4hplnq,4,2016-05-03,Shaking when I wake up... manifestation of trauma?,industrystndard,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4hplnq/shaking_when_i_wake_up_manifestation_of_trauma/,"I've been waking up shaking. It's a full body tremor that persists for several minutes and then goes away, and is always coupled with a fear that I've overslept for the things I have to do that day. As soon as I check the time I feel better, but the shaking takes a while to stop. It's gotten a little better in the last few days because I've spent the last week FAR away from my FLEAS-dad and work has been pretty slow, so I'm not so on-edge. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that when I was a kid, me being late was a major trigger for his rages and drama. 

I used to have pretty bad trouble sleeping and so I slept in/was late to school a lot, or I would be slow getting ready (because I *hated* school). Then, in the car while my dad drove me to school, he would start this huge scene of banging on the steering wheel, telling me he was so stressed that his **tongue and cheeks was bleeding from how hard he was biting himself** (I could do a whole other post on this alone tbh), talking about how stressed out he was, how stressed out driving makes him, how his stress could kill him and how I need to understand that my being late is making it worse. In other words, he thoroughly enjoyed implying I was **killing him** by being late to school.

Not to mention how he made me feel guilty about using the car to get to school. We lived about a mile away from school so my dad always wanted to bike to school each morning (some kind of bonding thing for him) even though I hated doing it since I never had enough energy, and I was never on time anyway. So whenever we drove, he'd start talking about how **""gasoline is soldier blood"" and how driving me to school was a reason we were at war in the Middle East**. (While I concede this has some truth to it, I can not see why he found it necessary to lead a child to think they are at fault for a war.) Or, if he wasn't feeling political that particular day, he'd tell me how he didn't want ""us"" (read: **me**) to get ""sedentary"" (read: **fat**). And how I used to be such a skinny, athletic kid. And how much he loves bicycling but he never gets to do it because he's so busy and has to drive everywhere and work all the time.

Trapped in the car while all this was going on, I would just be apologizing, silent, or cowering while he performed his drama. Sometimes he would get red in the face from shouting. Almost every morning he found cause to yell at me and slam things around. Now I recognize it as BS posturing to get a reaction from me, but when I was younger his anger used to make me feel physically ill. Once when I was in a hurry to get out the door I ruined some art of mine that was very important to me. While I was trying to fix it, he started screaming at me. I just broke down and I don't even remember what happened after that.

These days I handle my transportation, and I'm hardly ever late. It's worth noting that whenever I had to get to school *myself* as a kid, I would obsess over having enough time and end up arriving very, very early. My dad, on the other hand, seem to run late all of the time. And every single time he does, he berates himself, loudly, to anyone in the room/house/in a mile radius. How he's stupid, forgetful, always losing things, a failure, ect, ect, ad nauseum. So I've been wondering how much of me being late was really my fault, or if my dad is the one with time management problems, if I've developed a unhealthy fixation on lateness as a result of trauma... thereby causing the morning shakes. Not to mention how *actually* being late will basically give me a panic attack. I've had meltdowns in front of my supervisors at my internship because I missed part of a shift or something like that, and I get so scared that I'll be screamed at or fired.

Anyway-- this is kind of long. Looking for a little support here, and maybe some advice for dealing with intense morning anxiety/having peaceful sleep."

I'd love some career advice, and I'd even be willing to pay someone an hourly fee to get together on Skype or Google Hangouts and chat. 

A bit about my current goals: For the next 3 years, my plan is to work as a full-time software engineer and do a Master's in Computer Science through Georgia Tech, with a specialization in Machine Learning and whatever Trading classes I can take. I ultimately want to work at Citadel in downtown Chicago, and I feel like the Master's along with what I'll be learning at my job starting in August as well as what I'll be learning on my own time will prepare me for a role there. My reasons for wanting to work there are - 1) Money for my financial goals 2) Prestige for lifelong employment anywhere should I need to move and 3) Challenging environment in my favorite city.

I have a solid GPA and learned a tremendous amount at two known companies in California, as well as two companies in Illinois. I have a full-time job starting in August at a really hot company in Chicago, and I'm planning on staying there at least long enough to have all my stock options vest, and hopefully until they get acquired or go public (both are likely to happen during the next 24 months). They build management software and deal with tremendous amounts of data, which is why I feel like I'll learn a lot about big data analysis and efficient code.

Does this career plan sound feasible and on the right track given my goals of working at Citadel, making a lot of money in challenging environments where I can learn a lot, and maintaining lifelong employability? Is the master's a waste of time or will I 1) learn enough from it that it will help me achieve these goals and 2) is it a good way to perhaps get an internship at Citadel or even a full-time job down the road? Is getting an internship there after a few years of working full-time just downright weird? Should I not limit myself to just Citadel if I'm interested in HFT and hedge funds?

Any advice would be appreciated. Would love feedback from people who took a similar route."

Figwit puts a firm hand on Nirreth's shoulder, shaking her slightly. ""It'll be good. For both of us. You're like the daughter I never had and I could use the experience of you heading off into the world... leaving me... forever.""

Of course, Figwit does have a daughter. Three, in fact. Two older than Nirreth and one younger. 

""Figwit, shuddup,"" says Penelope. ""Your eldest is one of my best.""

""Of course she is,"" Figwit replies. He turns back to Nirreth, losing the ability to maintain his cheerful grin. ""This is just as difficult for me, no different than Andalin and B'nyanna. And who is gonna cover up for Cyrin's mistakes with you gone?

""I'll check in from time to time, and you'll be nearby for this investigation for the time being. I'm sure Lady Farstrider's troops will take good care of you.""

Penelope interrupts once more: ""To be honest... with all this Dragon Cult business going on and whatnot, I really don't know how big of a team I can spare for this.""

""Actually,"" the large metal man removes himself from the window. ""I have an idea...""

Nirreth inhales deeply and looks Nirreth in the eye, **""This is it, ekellon. Are you ready?""**

*ekellon = acorn*

The Melting Iceburg is a favorite locale for members of the Rising Phoenix Company. Roscoe Roscoeson IV keeps his establishment in a fine state. It is said that his great, great grandfather funded the bar with money from a green gladd dagger stolen from Thrain Axudar himself. Other reports say that Axudar knew and allowed it to be stolen. Either way, the barkeep provides Phoenixes with a generous discount.

A number of Phoenixes crowd the bar, raucous roars of revelry coming from them as they watch the viewing orb above the bar. It's the Grand Battle semi-final match between the Phoenix's current Besh Squad and 'The Interns' from an adventuring company in Baldur's Gate, Acquisitions Incorporated. Varnys Deckard just unleashed a massive fireball on The Intern's forward line for massive damage. The unskillef thief Joe sulks in a corner of the bar. Melinda allowed him to tag along with the condition that he can't have any alcohol. ""I love milk anyway!"" He mumbled as he took a sip from his mug.

The party and the handful of Phoenixes accompanying them have pushed together multiple tables to form ""SUPERMEGATABLE"" as Melinda put it. She slides into a seat and looks across at the party assembled before here, ""Yeah... this feels right,"" she says as she rubs the corners at the short end of the table. ""Mahogany.""

Paz takes a sip from a glass flute. ""I want to,"" she says to **Z** who sits across from her. ""I know that I easily could, but I have duties as Contessa. Driving my blade into dark creatures, finding precious gems, and slaying dragons? Yeah, totally. But meetings, councils, and emissaries from The City of Splendors. Nan Mabel said that she had the same issues when she was our age; bureaucracy is endless."" She sighs and takes a long sip of her champagne. **""Is it fun?""**

-----

""I'm not gonna lie, it's pretty rough,"" Canna Biff A. Ronee says to **Arik**. ""Wayford is accepting yes, but I'm still part orc and well... you know how that goes. So yeah, I would imagine it that you have it even worse out there in the world. Penalties within the Company are harsh when it comes to racism and if anyone does have a problem with you, they'll have to deal with my orc side first. **Would you ever consider starting a new refu-- excuse me, that's a shitty word to use. You know what I mean.""**

----- 

""ROSCOE ROSCOESON THE FOURTH,"" Melinda slams her fist on the table eyes boring into those of **Geth and Randal.** ""A CHALLENGE HAS BEEN ISSUED!!!""

A loud cheer goes up in the crowd of the Melting Iceburg. This apparently isn't the first time this has happened. A tray of pint mugs magically appears on the table in front of Melinda Suncatcher. She takes hold of the handle of a mug unique to her and her only. It's a regular mug with a picture of a bird on it. It's art.

""Well lads,"" she says as she raises her mug into the air. ""First to pass out owes the winner, Melinda Suncatcher of the I'd'ho Suncatchers, a full five course meal at the Golden Idol.""

I need some help, advice and suggestions!

I hold a BS in Computer Science from a top-3 school, but have not been employed as a software engineer. In the time since my graduation 12-years ago, I have been involved in freelance projects and managing businesses. In the last 4-years I have opened two restaurants and a fast food place and they are successful. I'm still part owner of one, but no longer involved, and want to return to software engineering.

I worked on Python/Django, C#, Android and Lua. I still have a good grasp of data-structures/algorithms and understand OOP, functional programming, recursion and so on. I'm looking for a junior position to get me started on technical problems so that I can sharpen my skills. I get along with team members, self motivated, reliable, on-time and have a team first mindset. I'm excited about starting, but need some help marketing myself.

So is there hope? Can I still find a job and a career as a software engineer?

1. What should I do to become employable as a software engineer?

2. What projects should I work on to best show my skills?

3. Everywhere I look, it seems businesses are looking for senior software engineers and that junior positions are filled from college. What can I do?

I live in CA and willing to move so I should be in the hotbed of software engineering jobs. I applied to a few internships, but I think they are targeted to fresh grads or students and haven't heard back."

4hqtx1,1,2016-05-03,Want to travel to Cuba in Spring 2017 - need help &amp; advice,vesoop,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/4hqtx1/want_to_travel_to_cuba_in_spring_2017_need_help/,"Hey everyone, I have always wanted to go to Cuba but I have been previously unable to go due to the US embargo. However, with the embargo being lifted and US &amp; Cuba relations becoming more and more open, I figured that it will be much easier to travel now. 

I am planning to go during my Spring break next year which is March 24 - April 2 (9 days). I thought that would be the perfect time to go since the weather would be pretty nice that time of the year and its at a time when traveling there is much easier now but if I go any later, it would become a giant tourist destination (I don't mean to say I'm against it; I hope it does so it benefits the Cuba but at the same time, I would like to see it before it becomes a big tourist destination). Also, since spring break is typically shorter than the other vacations, I won't be busy with extra classes or internships or anything like that so I would have a good week's time to travel. 

I have traveled pretty much my entire life with my parents so I do have experience with traveling, but I would like to plan this trip on my own since it would most likely be a solo trip (maybe one or two other people at the most). I can travel from anywhere from NYC to Philadelphia so I can be flexible with departing &amp; arrival. 

From reading around and doing some research, it looks like many of you have traveled to Cuba so you would have some experience and can hopefully help me out. 

I have searched around on this subreddit and much of what I have found is a bit old and I think with how quickly things are changing in regards to travel to Cuba it would be best to have as up to date information as possible.


Some things I was hoping to get some more information on:

* How would I go about booking travel tickets and lodging (I am currently planning for myself but I might need to plan for ~2 more people)? I don't think it's as simple as it is for traveling to other countries yet, so I would definitely need some help with this.
* What are some recommended places to visit and things to do? From what I've read, Havana and Vinales are at the top of my list. How would I travel to both places? I've read that visiting the tobacco &amp; coffee plantations in Vinales are highly recommended so how would I do that? 
* How much would the entire trip approximately cost? 
* Are there any areas or things I should stay away from? 
* How much money should I have on me to spend for food, shopping, etc.? 
* Is there anything else I should do while I'm there?
 
I hope I'm not asking too much and I would really appreciate any help or advice you guys can give me. Thanks!"
4hqvhr,37,2016-05-03,To everyone with high test scores and low GPA waiting to apply-READ,applyingtothrowaway,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/4hqvhr/to_everyone_with_high_test_scores_and_low_gpa/,"I wanted to share my story on my college admissions process and how much I realized that grades really do matter, and good test scores will NOT get you into top tier schools. 

A common question is if a 33 and a 3.2 will be enough to get into a top 20 school.

I thought the same thing until this year, and from February-May were some of the hardest months of my life.

TEST SCORES WILL NOT ADMIT YOU. TEST SCORES WITH GOOD ESSAYS, ECS AND RECS WILL NOT ADMIT YOU.

I say this from experience. I just applied this year and got rejected everywhere except for two schools and waitlisted at one. I had a 3.6W (3.3 UW) GPA (trended from 2.7 freshman to 4.9 junior and had an explanation for why,) had taken AP Physics C, AP Gov, AP Chem, AP Calc AB, IB Psych, IB Chinese, (**scored 4/5/5/5/5 for AP and 7/7 IB**) 

My senior year course load was IBHL 2 English, HL History, AP Calc BC, IB Econ, Geophysics. I had a cool story of growing up internationally, had internships, varsity sports, academic extra curriculars (speech and debate, mock trial, leadership in both) and according to me and my teachers, great essays and recs. **To kick this all, I had a 35 composite ACT (34E, 35M, 36R, 35S, 36 Essay)**

That said, I moved my senior year to a very competitive school in Virginia, and was rejected from: Yale (legacy), Middlebury, Claremont Mckenna (ED2), Washu, Vanderbilt, and was waitlisted at William and Mary (in state as well). I was admitted to Lehigh and Fordham, and upon appealing my Lehigh decision, was one of the select few to receive merit based aid. 

When I got my 35 and got my grades together my junior year, I thought I was set. I went from thinking I would get into most schools to praying to get waitlisted or accepted to at least one. Any one. But I didn't. The days rolled by and I was rejection after rejection after rejection. 

While this was happening, I was watching my peers with scores in the 20s and kids who I knew I was smarter than get into top tier schools. I would get asked about college and be ashamed to answer because I felt like a failure. I'd done interviews with Yale, Vanderbilt and Middlebury and they all went excellently. I wrote my essays well and communicated with my admissions counselors, but to no avail. 

To the juniors and younger: 

You don't realize how hard it is getting rejected from multiple schools you believed you would get into. You never want to feel like that. It's so hard because when you apply, you see yourself at a school, you fall in love, you know you can do it. But when you get rejected, fundamentally, it breaks down your sense of self; you realize that you're not the person you thought you were. When it happens once? That's normal, college admissions are finicky. Six consecutive times? That's when something inside breaks. 

Let me tell you, if you're in a situation like mine, chances are you go to a competitive highschool, are smart, have smart friends, and have always been the ""lazy scholar."" That said, watching all your friends get into the places that you got rejected from will make you feel more alone than you ever have.

That's part of the reason I'm posting, as a twisted sort of vent for my frustration and anger. I cannot stress this enough, traditional teenage angst aside, if you're in this situation, there aren't a lot of people like you, and less that understand how you feel.

Personally? (as if this post wasn't personal enough) nothing was harder than seeing my girlfriend who I love dearly get admitted to Georgetown with a 1260/1600 because her mother worked there. For the record, she was waitlisted at W&amp;M, UVA, NYU, Lehigh, Villanova, rejected BC, JHU. Stuff like this turns the kindest people bitter and angry. I know how mopey it sounds, and it sucks, it really does. 

There's a map of where everyone is going to college next year outside my highschool office and I'm too ashamed to put up my face.

When I applied to all those reaches, I thought I would be ok if I got rejected from all of them, at least I tried, right? 

Wrong. 

I'm not a traditional suburban white kid, I've been through some really hard stuff, but believe me when I tell you, this is one of the worst experiences of my life, and it really doesn't go away, not right away at least.

Juniors, sophomores, even freshmen with high test scores, please listen, please be careful, and do everything you can to get your grades up. Having good scores and ok grades makes you an exception to the rule. Don't assume that you'll be the exception to the rule at top tier colleges, because chances are, you're going to get burned. 

Don't make my mistake.

Thanks for reading this, it was really therapeutic to type this all out, this community has been really great and I'm on a throwaway incase anyone from my school knows my reddit tag.

4hqvs2,31,2016-05-03,I don't know what it was...,Marion-ette,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4hqvs2/i_dont_know_what_it_was/,"When I was eight, my class went on this field trip to the aquarium. I remember standing beside this huge tank, hands and face pressed to the glass, watching all of these amazing creatures swim by. Every color I'd ever seen was in that tank, swimming past coral and rock, swooping in and out of the pathways of turtles and small sharks. I was amazed and overwhelmed, and I wasn't alone. Opposite me, hands and face also pressed against the glass, was Alan. It's how we met, became friends, and then married 15 years later. And now he's lost.

Even though we were married over a year ago, we hadn't gotten around to the honeymoon yet. Between me working full time at the aquarium where we met while working towards my environmental studies major and Alan taking every class, internship and extra curricular activity to get his masters as a marine biologist, we've been rather busy. I thought it was a god send when his internship took them out of the country to study deep sea creatures in Wales, and that his boss took pity on us and invited me long. ""It'll be good to bring the wife along, like the honeymoon you never had. Plus, never hurts to have another scientist along for the ride.""

The plane was tolerable and the food was odd, but the scenery was breath taking. We'd been there for less than a day before Dr. McKinney (Alan's boss) had us sized up in scuba suits and planned out the ground work for where we'd be diving, how long, and how deep. All the basics were covered for me, a small refresher course on hand signals, then it was time for dinner. It was the last normal night I think I'll ever have again.

We started at dawn. I struggled into my scuba gear, Alan helping me get all the straps for the oxygen on tight and right. The man driving the boat, who's name I couldn't pronounce and shoddy English I couldn't understand drove us far out past the sight of land, and dropped anchor. The goal of the day was to take underwater photographs of the fish, the habitat and the pollution. We were all outfitted with cameras and enough air for an hour of exploring before safely coming up. McKinney went over first, breaking the almost glass-like appearance of the waters surface. His head bobbed back up as he stuck two thumbs in the air and went back under. I could see Alan grinning like a nerd in his face mask as he mockingly grabbed his nose, pretended to pinch on in, and wiggled his hand down above his head before going over as well. I turned to the guy driving the boat, and for a moment I felt a small pang of fear that maybe while we were down there, he'd take off. 
I shook off the feeling, made my way to the side, and let myself fall into the water. 

I knew the water was cold, but I didn't really feel it in the suit. Maybe 20 feet from me I could see Alan, already captivated in the small cluster of red and green fish swimming in a tight pack near him,  completely uninterested in the million pictures he was taking. He looked up quickly and saw me, gave me a wave and went back to work, like a child with a new toy. Out to my left McKinney was also snapping photos, but he was more interested in whatever was growing on the rocks around him. He noticed me, waved, and from that point on I was pretty much on my own.

The day was pretty much just that. Sail to a location, grab a new tank, take a billion pictures, and repeat. By 10pm it was dark, I was tired and had already missed out on three trips down that Alan and McKinney had gone on. Balls deep in homework and having had enough of this diving business for one day, it took forever for Alan to convince me to go on one last trip down. ""Evelyn, you've got to see them. It's really beautiful, they're like little flashlights."" Only half paying attention to his chatter about the fish, I agreed, saved my homework documents and suited up, if only to make him happy. 

This time the water was freezing, even in the suit. Our suits now had small lights on the goggles, giving way to maybe 10 feet of visibility. Along with the cameras we also had hand held lights, which only made me feel the smallest bit better.

McKinney saw me in the water, but didn't signal me at all. He just sort of floated there, in the black. He must have been twenty feet from me, flashlight pointed down, crossing streams with my own, so I know he knew that I was there. Still he didn't acknowledge me. 

I started to feel uneasy. It didn't feel right. I looked for Alan to my right, turning my back to McKinney, scanning the black for wherever he might have been, but I couldn't see him. I turned back, and McKinney was gone. Just gone. I panicked, and began frantically swimming up to the boat. After forever I broke the surface and scrambled on board. I pulled my mask from my face and took deep breathes trying to call out to whatever-his-name-is that drives the boat. I reached the helm, but he was gone. The sonar was still working, and if the guys where down below us, it would've picked them up. I stood there for what seemed like forever, watching the sonar go around, waiting for the ping. And then it happened, and I swear my heart stopped.

The size and shape was clearly a diver. Alan. I'd hoped it was him. But then where was McKinney? The diver was moving, slowly, circling the underside of the boat. What the fuck was he doing down there? Looking for me? Looking for McKinney? A moment later, another shape appear. Oh thank god, they're okay.
Then a third shape came onto the screen. 
It was bigger than the other two and just as quickly as it came, it was gone.

""What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck..."" I couldn't stop repeating it, backing away from the screen. Yelling rose up from behind me, the sailor was yelling at me in Welsh, throwing his hands wildly at the sonar and then towards the water. 
""I don't know what you're saying! I don't know! There's something in the water. Help me find Alan!"" I was screaming and at some point I had started crying. He slammed his hand down on the console and pointed out to the sea. 
Then he turned the key and started the boat.
""NO! No, stop!! What're you doing, we can't leave them out here!"" I lunged at him, punching and scratching at his arms until he let go. He grabbed my whole face with one hand and shoved my head back hard and I could hear my skull whack against the wall. Blood trickled down the side of my head and slipped into my wet suit. I lunged at him again, biting and scratching. He fled from the helm and out onto the deck. He was screaming at me, pointing to the sea and then to the sky. ""Dead,"" the only English he'd ever said to me, and he was yelling it in my face. ""Dead, dead, dead,"" Over and over. ""He's not dead!"" I screamed back, shoving him hard in the chest, and then we was gone. The splash broke the silence and I could see his blonde head bobbing up and down in the water, still yelling at me, crying out for a life raft. Suddenly he stopped mid holler. Leaning against the railing I watched as he remained perfectly still in the water facing me. His eyes widened and then we heard it. It was the sound of large air bubbles breaking the surface like when a diver breathes out and the tiny bubbles rise to the top. But this wasn't small like those, it was like someone overturned a bucket and let the air pocket out. Some 50 feet away from him I saw the water pop. Then another. Then another, only closer. I reached down beside me for the life saver, and brought one finger to my lips very slowly to motion for silence. 

The next moment happened in an instant. I don't know why, but he turned to look where the air broke the surface. Whatever it was cleared the distance between them in a second before I even had time to think. He was gone and I was alone. I ran back to the helm, grabbed the radio and called out to anyone for help but all I got was static. The sonar was pinging in the background picking up on whatever was down there. The screen showed one figure below me, completely stationary in its location before the boats power went out. No radio, no sonar, and fuck, no keys. *Where the fuck are the keys?* I ran to the side of the boat, sobbing in my suit, and searched the deck for the keys. I hoped against all odds that they had fallen out of that guys pocket before he went over. I looked up at the sea and 100 yards out, I saw a light. 

I picked up my flashlight and pointed it out towards the light and to my amazement it reflected goggles. Then one bare hand rose up out of the water, gave me a small wave and disappeared, head and hand, back under the water. 

I raced to get my mask and goggles on, tightened my tank and dove back in. The water around me was pitch black beyond my headlight. Below me was a vast blackness and above me was the faintest sliver of moonlight, letting me know the boat was still there. I swam out as far as I could in every direction, heart pounding in my chest as I flung the flashlights beam everywhere looking for Alan. I had gone further from the boat than I'd have liked when I saw him just floating there, like McKinney had been. I knew it was Alan, I could tell by his body shape, just floating in what looked like a black abyss. He raised a single hand and lazily waved at me. But it wasn't right. It looked the way a child would wave, loose in the wrists. Then a small light appeared a few feet away from his right leg. Then another, near his shoulder. As if a switch had been turned on, hundreds of tiny fish began to light up all around him, making him more visible to me. 

That's when I saw it. Propping his body up, was some kind of creature. It was long and thin, with wispy fins coming off of this enormous tail stretching down at least ten feet. It's black hands were wrapped around Alans wrists, making him motion waving at me. Black eyes, sunken and swollen stared out at me from just behind his head. 

In a second all the fish went out and this thing swam at me like a river snake. It came across the distance before I had time to react and smashed Alans goggles against mine. Through my cracked lenses I could see his eyes were white and lifeless, skin pruned from his suit filling with water. I pushed him away, letting his body sink down into the black, panic and bile rising in my throat. I kicked up hard, making my way to the surface, desperate to get the fuck out of the water. My panic peaked when a hand grabbed my ankle. With a quick twist I knew it was broken, pain rising up in my leg making me scream. I looked back and saw it's face. 

Black and green scales covered either side of it's face. Deep slits moved with each breath it took making the neck look like it was pulsating. The corners of it's hideous mouth reached all the way back to where ears would be, if it had any. It's lips parted to reveal two rows of sharp teeth, bits of flesh and plant caught in between them. As it's mouth opened wider the bottom jaw looked like it disconnected creating a huge opening to see down it's throat. I kicked wildly with my good foot, desperate to break it's hold on me.  Adrenaline kicked in and I pushed the light on the top of my camera right into it's eye. The flash went off in its face and the scream it let out wasn't like anything I'd ever heard before. 

I swam as hard as I could despite the pain in my ankle, broke the surface and scrambled on board. I limped to the helm and locked myself in. I could hear pounding from the underside of the boat and sharp screaming came in short bursts all through the night. I clutched my camera to my chest, my only scrap of evidence. Only once was I brave enough to look out over the water and I wish I hadn't. Slowly circling the boat, just inches above the surface, was the creatures arm holding up Alans head.

Not sure how to gauge my failures.",exquisitesunshine,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4hqzva/is_being_a_developer_supposed_to_be_easy_not_sure/,"I apologize for the naive question but as a graduating CS student I have been extremely depressed. I changed to a CS major 2 years ago and have coded for the first time 2 semesters ago. I am currently struggling with coding despite getting a grasp of the basics and on top of having zero experience (no internships or side projects yet, planning on working hard this summer to improve on coding), I am a slow learner in general and was never a math person (not that I did poorly). 

When I changed to CS major with the goal of becoming a developer, I realize that as a programmer you will need to constantly learn and keep up with the latest trends in order to separate yourself from many others who are entering the CS field. I have been depressed for a while now because I see so many people in my class who have started with programming and have dealt with the command line ever since they started school or has done so much during their high school years while I still feel like I've just started. I know some that work super hard and are top of the class but can't even land interviews with Google. On top of that, it seems like people around me just pick it up much easier. My professor graduated with a degree in psychology, then got a law degree, then finally a PHD in CS. My friend started as a hardware engineer then becomes a software developer for IBM. There is an Arch Linux developer who does his job as a hobby--he's a full-time surgeon.

How do I cope with the possibility that I can realistically never be as successful as some of these people? Every day I wake up with a plan in my head to work as productively as possible and have removed distractions in my life but when I get to learning how to code, I feel like I don't know how to learn in a productive manner. Any time I see something I don't understand, I google or look for a Youtube video but I feel like this isn't what successful people in the field do and it might be better if I read a textbook from start to finish. I might get easily dissuaded when I don't understand explanations as I'm searching for an answer. I don't know anything about the market--what set of skills are sought after, what combination of languages to pickup, what niches are in demand, what roles there are in a company, where the industry is going, etc. Despite all this, I always fantasize myself one day becoming a competent developer that can write programs to fit people's needs on my own, yet I've made little progress thus far and any progress that I've made are frankly quite pathetic given what is expected of me as a graduating CS major.

Sorry for my incoherent post.

Hello 


I am looking to anyone who works or has worked within Networking / Servers / and Cloud server/networking


I have an second/final stage interview on Friday and the only thing I was lacking in the first interview was Networking knowledge.


I was told to know some stuff by the next interview!!
I have bought and am reading bits of the Networking For Dummies 9 in 1 book.


The servers run on a linux system, they have cloud servers also. 
This is for an intern job so I only need to know basics but I want to firmly suggest I know my stuff! 


They have also mentioned DNS and DHCP to know about.


Could anyone give me any bullet point topics to read about and if youre feeling generous with your time some key jargon words to go with it?
I want to impress them by knowing some key things about networking and network maintenance when im coming from a non-networking university background.


Thank you in advance

As per the title, I’m after a software engineering internship that will span 6 months. I have already completed a 6 month internship, looking to get another under my belt. I’m comfortable working in Java, Android, HTML/CSS, JS and PHP. A full stack developer internship would be ideal, but something more focused could be just as interesting. I have experience with a range of other languages, frameworks and technologies as well – so if you’re after something specific, shoot me a message. 

I won’t bog this down with the run-of-the-mill “Hard working, focused, enthusiastic” shtick - hopefully any potential employer out there will pick that up on their own, after the first interaction with me. 

Hoping to start immediately. If you’re looking to add a good hand to your development team, please get in touch. 
Thanks!"

I'm a junior studying computer science at a public university. Each year, FAFSA and state financial aid cover my tuition and I get to take home $6k, so right now I have about $20k saved up from this aid + part-time jobs. 

I'll make it clear upfront that I'm extremely frugal. The last time I went shopping for clothes was 2 years ago. I'm using the same phone I got 5 years ago. I neither smoke nor drink. I don't have any out-of-pocket expenses because I'm still a dependent living with my parents, i.e. housing and all living expenses are covered for me already. I skip lunch everyday. Basically, I have a weekly net loss of 0 dollars because I don't ever spend my money on anything. It's all just stashed up in a savings account.

I'll be starting a paid quant internship with a bank in the summer, but given that it's a temporary position, there's no guarantee that I'll have a steady source of income yet. However, I'm actively practicing my programming skills everyday and I am reasonably confident that I can graduate next year with a $100k dev job lined up -- granted, it's in a very high COL area.

My abnormally frugal habits can only go so far, so I want to know what's the best thing a (relatively) young and single person can do to have the best financial security 10-30 years down the road besides having a stable job. Let's assume these constraints:
 
1. I score the $100k gig within a year and the company's benefits include free meals and health insurance.
2. I move out from my parent's home and live by myself ideally in a $1k/month mini apartment (think 200 sq ft max).
3. I commute either by walking or by taking public transportation.
4. I basically have no friends so I don't do things like go to a bar, attend fancy banquets, etc.

Any advice would be appreciated. I've never contemplated this before because all my life, I've never been financially independent yet; I still live with my low-income parents while I assume school as my full time occupation and apply for tech jobs/work on my personal closed source projects when I have time. But as I'm about to graduate in a year, reality has struck me hard and I'm somewhat anxious that I'll screw up when I go out into the real world on my own."

So a little background information, I am going into my second year in a four year university for Computer Science and I just had my first phone interview for a SAP/Software Development internship position at an electric company. I've had job interviews before that I've aced pretty well, but those were in person and it was just for things like a tech store, or a boba shop, so I don't think those compare to the internship interviews. Pretty much I had a 30 minute interview schedule for today. The recruiter asked me pretty standard questions such as, tell me about your experience at your old job, and some coding projects that you did, what are your strengths and weaknesses, and then the rest of the time she was talking about the job position and what I would be doing and what's available for me. We never really got off track, but the interview seemed very natural and not awkward whatsoever. Most of my responses she responded with a genuinely sounding ""awesome!"" or ""that's great!"" When it came to when she asked me if I had any questions for her, I asked things like what's the company culture like, and if I were to get hired, what type of things what would I be primarily doing. All and all I felt pretty good about the interview because it somewhat felt like a nice conversation. One thing is, the interview only last 15 minutes instead of the said 30 minutes, and from what I hear from others, they usually end the conversation with something along the lines of ""Okay if you got the job you'll hear from us within a week."" However, I didn't get that and the way the interview ended was just after I asked her questions and then we wrapped things up with her saying ""Okay if you have any more questions about the position feel free to email me."" After the interview I gave her a follow up thank you for the interview and now I'm just here wondering if I did well. If anyone could drop some insight on how you think I did or if I have a good chance of getting the job, I'd greatly appreciate it."
4hsnmj,2,2016-05-03,"Me [34 M] with my friend[30? F] 3years, almost positive she is cheating. Leave it alone? Find out for sure and tell her husband? How do I play this...",matt2012bl,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4hsnmj/me_34_m_with_my_friend30_f_3years_almost_positive/,"My wife left me suddenly about 2 years ago. I suspect , at the very least, emotional cheating if not sexual but I never got an answer and have no smoking gun to show that for sure. It's been very hard and I am still racked with pain from it. This is relevant later.


I met this girl about a year before my wife left me on account of us being training partners at a local mma gym. She started there just a week or 2 before I did so our skill levels match pretty well and training together for so long allows us to predict each others movements and techniques. I try something and she counters and we giggle like kids on a play ground. It's really the most fun I have ever had. I will grapple until I am too old and frail to do it any longer...even then I might still try to.


Training is a very intimate experience. My gym is a second family to me. I would do just about anything for any of my gym mates inside or outside the gym. When you train dangerous techniques, you hold your training partners life in your hands and they intern hold your's.  That builds strong bonds quickly. 


After my wife left me I had the wonderful experience of competing in a tournament with this girl. By this time we were pretty good friends and we car pooled to the tournament location. The conversation inevitably turned to my failed marriage. I trusted her enough that I told her everything from start to finish about what happened the night my wife left me including my suspension of cheating. She acted as though she was appalled by the situation and the venting really helped me. The whole situation deepened the bond I had with her. For the first time in over a year I felt like maybe there were still virtuous women left in this world.


There is another guy at out gym that everyone could tell she was enamored with the moment he showed up. Jokes and mumbles soon started flying around the gym. Both of them are married and the girl  has 7 children with her husband and is supposedly religious so I always chalked it up to just a crush.


Dude is a ""sometimer"" at the gym. The girl and i are there almost every day. She lives only a few minutes from me so I would follow her almost all the way home before our paths diverged. This is the only reason I noticed her pulling into the shopping center across from our gym after closing.


The first few times I just thought she needed things at one of the stores. It didn't take long for me to get suspicious.  It was like clockwork... After training, everyone hangs out for a bit and chats except this guy. He stuff his gear in a bag and flys out the door. The girl stays and chats but on nights that he is there she gets in her car and jets across the road to the shopping center. 


Curiosity finally got the better of me and I followed her over there tonight. Wouldn't you know it...she meets up with dude and gets in his car and they drive off together. Again I have no smoking gun to say that what they are doing together is not innocent but it definitely makes me question their motives.


Given my thoughts on how my marriage ended, I will not associate with cheaters. I pretty mad about this situation and really considering quiting the gym and telling her husband. But I have no proof.  For all I know it could be innocent or it could be something that all parties are aware of and on the up and up. I highly doubt that because I have heard that dudes wife is very jealous of him training with women.


If I don't find out for sure, resentment is going to come to a head and I'll say something I'll regret. But if this is what it looks like, I won't be able to train with her or him ever again without letting my feelings turn into words or actions...This is a very dangerous proposition when you train at an mma gym.


How can I approach this with her where if I am wrong about what I saw, I don't damage our friendship? But if I am right...I cant go on knowing that there 2 innocent people who are being deceived in the most haneous way imaginable to me. What should I do in that case? Leave my home gym and the only friends I have? This girl has a husband and 7 children. What about them?


*tldr* a good friend who sympathized with me my ex wife's possible cheating seems to be cheating on her husband with another gym mate. I don't know for sure but it is highly suspicious.  I won't stay quite about this if I find out they are cheating but if their interactions are in fact innocent, approaching the subject could irreparably damage one of the strongest friendships I've had in a long time."

I just graduated from college and took a serving job at a very busy restaurant on nights and weekends. I have a pretty intense internship 4 days a week, and the serving job pays the bills. I've only been serving for the last 6 months and this place is the big leagues. It has a really heavy volume and you have to really be on top of things to do well.

I've managed to survive so far, but I've endured a couple bad nights. They usually stem from one or two small mistakes that always seem to balloon into something bigger,  ending with a long lecture from my manager who can be VERY intense. 

After another bad night, I came to the conclusion that I can meet their standards if I really focus hard on it. Only problem is that my other internship is also very demanding and I'm working to land a paying gig there. I'm just worried that I won't be able to give enough to succeed in both.

( I currently have about 30k I would be able to put down and they would front the other 30k for a down payment on a home.)

I already have roommates lined up from school, internships, etc. So filling the house wouldn't be much of a problem and it should cash flow to some degree (also I would much rather build equity vs rent). However I have some questions on what the appropriate tax treatment would be here.

Would I show an ""arms length transaction"" and just act as I was just another renter for year end K-1 purposes. Or would I not included my rent payments in gross rents received? I have read through the IRS Instructions and haven't found a clear cut answer.

Thanks in advance to everyone who takes the time to read this/reply and sorry for the length. Please excuse any typos, I am writing in a hurry.

I have two sisters, [17F] and [23F]. 

The past few years have really shown that my parents just aren't the right people for each other. My dad is very practical, stoic, and blunt. He's not the best at showing affection physically, he usually shows that he cares by doing things for people rather than with compliments and such. My mom on the other hand very much loves romantic gestures and tender words. She's also very sensitive and emotional so my dad sometimes (inadvertantly) hurts her or upsets her with what he says.

I'm actually a lot like my mom, at least emotionally, so when I was younger I did not have a good relationship with my dad at all because he would often upset me with his words. (Ex: I would excitedly tell him that I accomplished X and then I would get what I perceived as a lecture on how I could have done it ""better."") When I got older I realized that he did genuinely care and that he was trying to help me in the only way he really knew, so I made sure I communicated to him that it wasn't what he said as much as how he said it. Since then I know he has tried hard to deliver his words in a softer way, and we have a generally good relationship now. 

I have also always been very close to my mom because of how similar we are to each other. Sometimes I feel like she treats me like a friend more than a daughter because I know she can't/doesn't talk to my sisters in the same way.

I am away from home now because of university; my sisters are living at home with my parents. In spite of this, I often act as my parents' ""counselor"" when I am home because they simply find it hard to get along now.

To try to make a long story short, my mom has gotten involved in a lot of MLMs in the past five years. She keeps jumping in and then getting out because she's not making money. My dad tried to be supportive for the first 1.5 years but since then he has repeatedly told her that MLMs are a scam. Right now my mom is in another MLM that she is convinced is *the one*. She is very sensitive about it and refuses to hear anyone say anything bad about it--she will start reciting facts that sound suspiciously like they came off a company pamphlet, or she will start crying and saying that she wishes she could just leave our family and be financially independent and not have to deal with people not supporting her. At this point my dad has decided to just let her do what she wants as he doesn't have the energy to deal with it (he supports the family because my mom doesn't work, and he does a lot of the housework + projects on the house).

I have tried to reason with my mom about MLMs but it hasn't worked very well. Eventually I started realizing that what she wants is to find some sort of purpose in life (she reads a lot of books on finding yourself and life's purpose and self-help books like that). I also think she wants to feel desirable and competent again (she was very popular when she was my age and was a star tennis player). I have gotten a sense of this because of the way she tells me things (treating me like a friend and not a daughter). I have gotten into makeup in the last few years and I'm pretty good at it now, she's always asking me to do smoky eyes for her and blush and all of that. She's joined a dance class and is really excited to perform in a few months. I'm glad she's found something that she likes so much, and I'm happy to do makeup with her, but also...

She has told me about other men besides my dad and how they make her feel. How they compliment her and give her flowers. How they inspire her and tell her that they love her. One of them wanted to marry her and whisk her away to Europe to live in the lap of luxury for the rest of their lives. The other guy is a fairly wealthy man as well, although I don't think he ever promised anything serious.

My dad became aware of the first guy eventually and made my mom cut him off. She eventually cut the other fellow off of her own accord after a fight they had. Since then she and my dad have been ""working"" on their marriage, although I doubt that they have made much progress (won't go to a ""real counselor"").  

I love my parents but frankly I don't think they're right for each other. I have told them both that I would not mind at all if they divorced because I want both of them to be happy, but they of course want to stay together for my younger sister and because of traditional values against divorce. I could keep trying to help them but I'm their daughter, not their counselor. I shouldn't be doing this. Combined with stress with school and work and internships, the stress is really building up on me.

My dad is leaning on me more than ever because he doesn't feel like my mom can support him in the things he wants in life (investing, buying real estate, retiring soon). He wants her to get a real job. She refuses because she ""hates work"" and ""wasn't made for a 9-5."" She has a bachelor's degree but has never pursued a career because she stayed home full-time to raise me and my sisters.

I'm sure it's clear from the way I post that I agree with my dad that we need to get her out of this MLM. We have already discussed briefly how I should approach her about it, as she won't listen to him. However, I still feel compassion towards my mom. I believe that people grow best when they are well-loved, and I want to do my best to help my mom out. Getting into the MLM wasn't a logical decision--I feel that more than anything, it was an emotional one. She wants somewhere to belong. She wants to feel independent and in control of her own life. She wants to feel beautiful and desired and like she matters to someone. My dad doesn't make her feel that way. I am doing my best to try and help, but I feel like pretty makeup and a ""daughter-friend"" is just putting a Band-Aid on a gaping wound. I need a fresh perspective on the situation. 

I am already trying to support my dad as best I can.

4ht4z7,0,2016-05-04,Changing Engineering Discipline After 3 Semesters?,chocomilkman,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4ht4z7/changing_engineering_discipline_after_3_semesters/,"Hi guys,

I'm currently a chemical engineering major looking to change to computer engineering due to an internship I had working with embedded devices and software development. The only problem is I've already done 3 semesters of courses and thus will be slightly behind on core courses when it comes to switching. However, due to AP credit, I already have all of my calculus, chemistry, physics, and gen eds complete. This means that hours-wise, I'm slightly ahead of where a normal compE would be. 


Do you think it's doable to finish the degree in 5 semesters and not push my graduation back? I have a scholarship that only covers 8 semesters, so I'd really like to do this if possible. I only have 70 hours left, so I could average  14 hours / semester which sounds doable to me. A compE who followed the plan would have 78 hours left due to gen eds, physics, and calculus requirements. 


Any thoughts? I may rethink changing if it will likely push my graduation back. 


Also, I plan on talking to an adviser soon, but since I'm currently away from school on an internship, I won't be able to for a few more weeks. "
4hte80,2,2016-05-04,GPA low because of GE classes,blacksama,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4hte80/gpa_low_because_of_ge_classes/,"Hey guys,

So I have a really low GPA (below 2.5) and put on probation once, but it was because of the GE classes. Looking at my transcript, while I maintain at least a C+ or B in my engineering classes, the ones that I received a D- or D are english, history, and all that crap. 

I had a really challenging freshmen and sophomore year because my dad died and my mom was in depression and unable to work for 2 years, I basically have to work a full time job and full time student to support her and my little sister. At the time, I really didn't know what I was going to do. I was majoring in Chemistry but I was really tired from overwork myself, and I took a bunch of irrelevant courses that didn't interest me. After my mom finally back to work and can take care of herself, I had more time to really think about what I want to do, and by the time I got back up on my feet, my grades already bit the dust. I already used 1/2 of the course forgiveness to make up for those dumb History and political science classes, but I still got about 3 more courses that are below a C-. The GPA has prevented me from applying to many internships and jobs that I want. And I really hate myself for letting myself slide for those completely unnecessary courses that I could have done better.

4htgkd,10,2016-05-04,"[long] Probably not the only post like this, but it's something I need to get off my chest. It's about being absolutely terrified of the near future.",thrwwyc132,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4htgkd/long_probably_not_the_only_post_like_this_but_its/,"I’ll preface this by saying that I’m sorry if this is stupid. This is me attempting to collect my thoughts and put my feelings into words.

I’ve always had this massive sense of anxiety towards the future. Since high school, I’ve never really had a real plan for how the rest of my life was going to go. When I got to college (which is a whole other issue entirely), I didn’t really know where I was going to end up, which resulted in four changes in major by the time I had finished freshman year. It took me until well into sophomore year to finally settle on something that I, at the time, thought would be a feasible career path that could bring a sense of stability into the impending doom of the future. 

I really hated where I went to high school. It was your typical rural, small town high school, with under 500 kids in the entire student body, where everyone knew everyone’s business, and I couldn’t stand to live in that for the rest of my life, so I chose to go out of state for college. Obviously there have been positives and negatives to going to school where I did, the larger of the negatives being the rather large out-of-state tuition fees and that the school (comparatively speaking) really doesn’t give a shit about out-of-state students. Their professional network only really has anything for people from the state, so as far as looking for summer internships I was pretty much on my own, as the school’s internship platform didn’t have anything that I could do, when I would go home for the summer.

The major I eventually settled on was pretty much an Information Systems major. That falls under the college’s business school, which was something that I always enjoyed in high school. For the unaware, it takes some of the aspects of comp-sci and integrates them into a business setting. It combined two of the things I was passably decent at in high school; business and computers. Although, about a year ago, I realized that the major really didn’t set me up for much in the way of career advancement. It was a major that pretty much tailor made you to fit into a low-level IT position, working as some sort of database architect (or something like that), or as a data analyst. The major really doesn’t go far enough into the concepts of computer science to really be useful there, and it sure as shit doesn’t go far enough into the other areas of business to be feasible there. 

I realized this (senior) year, that I really don’t enjoy the major that much. I’m okay at best with some of the coding stuff, and I can do a bit of SQL and access database stuff, but the major really didn’t go to in depth in any of that stuff, so I feel like I’m seriously underequipped to find any sort of job in that area. Just looking at job requirements online is one of the most demoralizing things I can do because I never seem to hit enough points to be a potential candidate. I’ll also be one course shy of also having a Marketing degree when I graduate. Marketing is something I enjoy so much more than the other major, and it’s something that I could potentially see myself doing for the future. 

The big problem is that there’s less than two weeks until graduation. Plenty of applications sent out, no interviews, no job offers, and certainly no stability going forward. And now it feels like life has just devolved into a constant state of panic about the future. I really want to stay in the area where my college is. I love the town, I love the people, and I could seriously see myself living here. But the problem is that unless a job offer falls out of the sky sometime in the next week and a half, I’ll have to move back home with my parents for a while until I can find something to do to pay off the FUCKING ENORMOUS student loan debt I’ve managed to rack up.

One of my biggest fears in going out-of-state for school was going back home a failure. Failing to find a job, a place to live, etc.. And the fact that in two weeks I have to move back home makes me a failure in my eyes. I have to go crawling back to my parents and pray that I can find a job back here. 

And then there’s my parents. Literally the most loving and supportive parents I can imagine having, but there’s one thing about them, and that’s that they really don’t want me to stay here near college. They want me back home. And I know, as soon as I get home, they’re gonna start pressuring me to no end to find a job in my hometown, even though that’s literally the last thing I want to do. 

To be honest, and to kind of sum this up, I’m seriously fucking scared. I don’t know what’s going to happen in the next few weeks, because I’m seriously running out of time. I have six months until the student loan payments start. And I have six months to find a job where I’ll be able to support myself. And I have to do that with a degree in a major which really didn’t prepare me well enough for a career in that area, and an interest in another area of business (marketing, like I said before) which when I asked about it, my advisor told me that Marketing majors are a dime a dozen and it’s an all in all useless major.

So yeah, I’m pretty fucked if I’m honest. At least as far as I can tell, the only thing I can think to do is to just keep applying to jobs I know I’ll never get and hope that one day soon someone will hire me. And like I said at the beginning, I’m sorry if this is stupid, or petulant, or childish, or whatever, I’m just constantly freaking out about the next phase of my life, and part of me just wants to disappear or something; make all of this go away. If you’ve sat through this whole thing, thanks for reading. 

tl;dr: Graduating in two weeks in a major that I really don't enjoy and really didn't equip me well for the future, massive student loan debt, wanting to stay in the area of my school, but I'll have to move back home for a while until I hopefully find a job. Anxiety sucks.

* Scott Bloedern

* Bradley Czech

* Tom Pearce


One of these things is NOT like the other. That's right. The devil is in the details. There have been no reports of Tom Pearce and TH having sex. We have all assumed motive for Ryan as a jealous type ex.

Bradley as a spurned lover she thought was weird.

Scott as a lovelorn roommate.

But Tom Pearce was just...older. A stranger beside me to her.

Now let's look at some tidbits of information we know here:

* Tom Pearce is the one who took the photo of Teresa by her Rav4

* He is the ONLY one to ever make mention of harrassing phone calls.

* He was mentioned by Dedering in his report as saying ""Tom Pearce continues to talk about Teresa in the past tense""

* His shop was closed that Monday

* He called Leslie LeMieux to provide further information at 12:30am on 11/04

* With that phone call **HE** inserted himself into the investigation before Ryan did with his search parties

* When talking to LeMieux he began telling her stories of men trying to invite her into their homes. I have issue with this, because if Teresa tells Dawn about Avery with a towel, why is she not telling Dawn about men trying to lure her in for drinks?? Tom Pearce is the only person to ever mention this, perhaps to deflect investigation off of him.

* If Tom Pearce WAS driving her car and got pulled over or was seen on his way to Avery's, he could claim he is just ""borrowing her car"" making him not look suspicious (this is my own speculation, not fact)

* Teresa either shot or developed the Czech's nude photos in his studio

* To quote Zellner ""The Stranger Beside Me""..was not only Ted Bundy's co-workers title of her book...but in re-reading Tom's statement to Dedering, they did not work in the SAME studio. ""he and TERESA actually set up two separate businesses under one roof.""..Beside each other.

* ""He did indicate that her employment with AUTO TRADER has been taking up quite a bit of her time."" Didn't she only work Monday's..I think I recall Monday and Thursday's, but Monday only is what I initially thought. Maybe a tinge of jealousy? Not enough time for Tom?

* He is the one who reported her missing, ie. ""He who smelt it, dealt it"". Okay this one was just for fun, but look at all that shit up there!

**NEVER ASKED FOR AN ALIBI**

Edit to add:

From this site: http://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/news/features/2016/01/21/making-a-murderer-teresa-halbach

* ""Pearce recalled that Halbach had taken photos for Auto Trader several times before at Avery's home and that she felt uncomfortable around Avery.""

* Pearce had hopes that Halbach would one day take over his studio.


From testimony:

* She worked as an intern for him at University of Green Bay

* after her internship at U-GB ended, he took her on within his studio because he recognized ""the drive, the passion, the want""..and she worked hard, and he recognized that. (my input: she was hot to him and he wanted to be around her more. all guys do and say crap like that)

* In photography, you have to ""know the book, and be able to break the rules when you are out there""... He also speaks really WAY too enthusiastically about photography in a studio. I know photographers for weddings, magazine spreads, paparazzi, directors of photography in film..none of them talk about photography this way. WEIRD! Like...Donald Sutherland banging Karen Allen in ""Animal House"" weird.

* Tom says her niche was children, she loved to photograph children. What an eye opener it must be for everyone now to know what else she liked to photograph.

**Quote from testimony when asked by Strang:**

Strang: Right. And whatever the number was that came up
on the phone, she recognized it?

Pearce: Yeah, she knew what it was, but she wouldn't let
me know.

**This completely contradicts what he told Leslie LeMieux at 12:30am on 11/04/05:**

""PEARCE did say TERESA had mentioned she had been receiving multiple calls, **from an unfamiliar number**, to her cell phone recently.


**THE MOTHER-EFFING COUP DE GRACE**

There was a theory from /u/Powerdan74 about Zellner and Sarah Gee possibly using ""running"" as a hint. Check his thread here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/MakingaMurderer/comments/4du8yd/the_defenses_running_theme/

I present to you:

Kratz: Now, as part of that business, as part of
Teresa's photography business, were you aware of
a particular client that she serviced, which was
Auto Trader Magazine?

Pearce:There was a time when she had told me about, that
she had picked up a client, which was Auto
Trader, and she would be **running** around taking
pictures of cars, yes, I was aware of that.

Kratz: All right. And had she ever asked your opinion
or advice about working for Auto Trader or that kind of photography?

Pearce: I don't think she asked my advice, but I think I
may have suggested something to her. Her
photography business was picking up for studio
wise a lot. And it seemed like when she -- It
seemed when she first started with Auto Trader
was just on Mondays. Mondays we're typically
closed in the industry, because we worked a lot
of Saturdays.

So, it seemed all of a sudden that she
not only had to do Auto Trader on Monday, but
possibly Wednesdays and some Saturdays. She was
constantly telling me that she was **running** doing
Auto Trader. And I could see that she was
starting to burn the candle at both ends.
And at one time, I sat her down and I
said, gee, you know, you are **running** here, you
are **running** here, you're **running** and I didn't
want her to get to a burn out point. So I just
asked her, how is Auto Trader, is it a good
client, blah, blah, blah.


We never talked on how much she was
making, or whatever. That -- that was never
discussed. I mean, that was where we drew the
line in our business end of it, but I was more
concerned about her well being of **running**, of the
constant **running**. She was constantly **running** and
that's what she enjoyed. So that was the only
time I really had any discussion with her about
Auto Trader.

Of course, I'm going to be programming as much as possible, but are there any certs, online courses, etc., that I should do from now until then? 

Also, where would be the best place to find internships for Summer 2017? Have companies not begun to post applications for that period online yet? I've checked Indeed, but it's hard to find specifications of the time period on there."

I really want to choose Waterloo SE because as a US citizen, the end goal is to work in SV and I know that Waterloo SE is pretty much the best option for that.  The very real possibility of getting coops in Cali makes Waterloo seem like the obvious choice.  If it weren't for the Schulich scholarship I would not even be considering going to UofT.  That being said, I'm pretty biased because I've wanted to go to Waterloo for years, my siblings go to Waterloo, etc.  So if it's possible for me to achieve the same things at UofT as a Schulich Scholar then I may choose UofT.  I would do summer internships to make up for the lack of coop, but I'm afraid I won't be able to get the jobs I could get if I went to Waterloo.

Am I missing out on industry opportunity if I choose UofT ECE over Waterloo SE?"

Don't make the same mistake I did and stick with a bunch of losers just because they are ""safe""

So I've been very BP for most of my life, and have only been recently turning it around. Looking back, I think one of the BIGGEST things holding me back was the people I associated myself with. I was pretty shy and nerdy growing up, but I hung out with kind of a mixed group back in high school. A lot of my circle in high school was similarly nerdy, but my best friend was kind of a ""bad boy"" who did a lot of drugs and hung with the popular group. So even though I had a lot of people influencing me to be BP, at least I had some positive influence from my best friend. 

Going into college though, things were different. I was still a shy, kissless virgin. Basically my entire dorm hall was filled with guys even shyer and nerdier than me. I wanted to get out of my comfort zone, party, bang hot girls, etc but in the end I stuck with my hall because that was the safe option. I originally rushed a fraternity (Greek life is huge at my school) but in the end I dropped that just to play video games with my hall on weekends. Soon, I was hanging almost exclusively with my hallmates. 

Like I said before, I had a pretty BP childhood, but the guys in my hall were FAR worse. I'd sometimes try and put myself out there and meet girls or people in general, but my hallmates would poke fun at me. It was basically a ""crabs in a bucket"" mentality. They'd make fun of me for having ""low standards"" and trying to talk to girls that weren't ""hot enough"" for them, even though they'd never have the balls to talk to girls period. These guys were basically the type who'd make any excuse not to put themselves out there, and justify themselves playing video games all weekends. I wanted to branch out, but even at the end of freshman year, I was too afraid to really put myself out there. 

During my sophomore year, I was put in separate housing from them, but still stuck with this group. In the meantime, I got into working out and lost a lot of weight. However, every weekend it'd be the same routine -- get dinner with them and then LITERALLY sit around doing nothing afterwards. Our ""hanging out"" would consist of them talking about video games and occasionally making immature jokes, while I just sat there being bored out of my mind. I wanted out. That summer, I took a job as a cashier, and improved my social skills dramatically. I also signed up to be the school mascot, which meant that I'd always be hanging out with the cheerleading/dance teams. 

Things finally started to turn around my junior year. Due to joining my school's spirit squad and a couple other groups, I finally started to have a different group to hang with. I didn't really have a solidified circle like I did before, but at least I was around people who were more willing to do something other than sit around all day. I actually went to parties on occasion, and got my first ever kiss that year. Being friends with the cheerleaders/dancers also helped me a lot in learning how to talk to girls. 

During the summer before my senior year, I had an internship in a large financial corporation, and basically all my coworkers were RP. I felt out of my comfort zone being around all them at first, but towards the end of the summer, I was molded into a far more confident person. The guys I worked with were either athletes or frat guys in college, so it was a stark contrast to the foreveralone gamers I stuck with for my freshman and sophomore years. We'd often go out for drinks and even hit up clubs together. Unlike my freshman year friends, these guys forced me to go out and talk to girls, and joined me in breaking free of our comfort zones. I also stuck with lifting, and got into pretty good shape. 

Going into senior year, I decided to take an opportunity to be a founding father of a new fraternity on campus. This in turn, gave me a network of several dozen guys who were all pretty confident and all wanted to become better guys. While we were considered ""lower tier"" on campus, it was a helluva lot better than my freshman year group. There were a couple guys in particular, charismatic and even a little douchey, who I learned a lot from. In the end, I grew a TON during my senior year because of the new circles I associated myself with, far more than I ever did during any of my previous years. 

Now I'm a senior who's about to graduate, and I'm basically the only one from my freshman year group who has ""broken out"" of the group. I'm pretty ripped, had sex with 3 attractive girls this semester, have been on TV as the mascot in multiple SEC football games, have performed in many shows across campus, and have a leadership position in a fraternity on campus. In other words, although I'm nowhere near where I want to be, I'm doing FAR better than I could have imagined doing as a freshman. Guys from my freshman year group are basically all still kissless virgins who don't really hang out with anyone outside of that group and haven't really gotten involved on campus. They're all nice guys, I'll give them that, but a lot of times I can't help but feel resentful towards them. Although they were a good ""safety net"" my freshman year in that I always at least had SOMEONE to hang out with, I would have taken a different group more conducive to pushing me out of my comfort zone any day. 

The most important lesson college has taught me, was the importance of who you hang out with. There's a saying, ""You're the product of your 5 closest friends"", which I find to be so true. From now on, I'm going to spend the majority of my time with people with similar values, with people who will push me to become a better man. 

EDIT: One thing I also want to mention, is an example of what happens if you DO surround yourself with a bunch of guys who are lazy and content. One of my best friends and the only guy I actually keep in touch with from the freshman group, is this guy who you'd think is a total boss if you first saw him. 6'2, built, and very good looking. He was a track star and top wrestler back in high school, and set university records during his first few weeks on the crew team. However, his personality is very ""nice guy"", and he primarily hangs out with the lazy bums in the rest of our freshman friend group. He used to be really involved in campus groups, but nowadays has a fucked up sleep schedule and scrapes by in school. It sucks that he's wasting so much potential, but at the same time he's trying to break out of his rut. I've told him how harmful it is to hang out so much with the freshman friend group, and he's beginning to understand and branch out. "

As you get uplifted from meek first-year students to bold seniors, you become, well, bold.
This is what happened the day before yesterday, in the morning after I got drunk with my friends and seniors. I was hungover the whole time this happened.
So, our seniors, soon passing out of the college, were with us drinking beer and whiskey. Everyone but I smoked too. It was all very good, everything went smooth. I slept at 5, the others slept at 6. I woke up at 11 to sit dummy for a company that came to our campus to recruit interns, and saw the Hostel In-charge, DK, barging into our flat and searching for stuff (bottles, actually). I took the cigarette packet out of the bin in the gallery he was walking in because it was too conspicuous, but it turned out to be useless, as we'll see later.
He went into my room and saw an unburnt cigarette on my table, and asked, ""Ye kaun peeta hai?"" (Who smoked this?) to which I said, ""Sir, maine nahin pi,"" (Sir, I didn't) and went off to wake others up. (AA, my flatmate, was sitting like ducks when this was happening, that useless creature). When I came back, the guard who came with DK was looking under my room's beds and found three beer bottles and three whiskey bottles from last night. I was freaking out on the inside. DK asked me to fetch a bucket to carry the evidence in. I obediently did so. He then proceeded to go downstairs, talking on the phone with some professor (who work doubly as wardens as well) regarding misbehavior by some students the night before. I heard him say something about video evidence submitted by the residents of nearby houses to the warden. That's when I thought I was in deep blue shit. I asked what is going to happen to us, and he said that he'll try to do the best he can (worst punishment, maybe). By then, Piyush had woken up and gotten dressed, so he was a part of the negotiations as well. DK and the guard went to the backside of our cottage to look at the line of houses adjoining ours, trying to make out something I didn't know then. He had also asked about how we climbed our terrace (which we cannot because there is no direct way; no stairs -- cement, or bamboo, or iron). All this while, PD (my best friend) and I were discussing how to minimize our chances of getting rusticated. The guard was a swine; a total philanderer; he showed me his ""item"", his ""girlfriend"", and his wife on his phone while I tried to pry information out of him.
So, the four of us (DK, the lecherous guard, PD, and I) are standing and talking, when DS, my roommate, comes, hungover and haggard. DK asks, ""Tumne bhi pi thi?"" (Did you drink, too?). DS says, sheepishly, ""Sir, mere room mein hi mili hai, pi to hogi hi..."" (The stash was found in my room; I would be lying if I said I didn't) It turned out that the warden and the guard weren't aware of the cottage number. And ours wasn't the one with ""students doing obscene actions"". The cottage they were looking for was 36, while ours is number 41. The guys in that cottage were pulling some weird shit (the guard told), which got recorded on camera. DK was just checking every cottage in the row to catch them but found our stash by fluke. Nonetheless, consuming alcohol in the hostel is not allowed, and we were going to face the disciplinary committee, or the DisCo (an infamous achievement; parents get called and stuff). I said, ""Sir, first and last time tha. Seniors bhi jaane waale hain, aur hum sab bhi 6 mahine baad milenge. Aage se nahin hoga."" (Sir, this was the first and the last time (so not true). The seniors are leaving soon and so are most of our friends for their internship. We promise not to partake in the campus again.) Everyone on the campus drinks. Many get caught. None gets punished. He then just left it to us to dispose of the bottles. Of which we had over 50. Three years' worth. We took all of them in a traveling suitcase and dumped them into a nullah.
Such is the life."

Ive been smoking weed pretty much daily for 5/6 years. Last year was the last year of my bachelor degree so early in the school year i decided to get help from a counsellor specialised in helping young adults with substance abuse issues. It helped me alot, and i got off weed. I did relapse once during the year, but i picked myself back up well. Last summer I was on and off weed. When i could, i was, when i couldnt I wasnt and it was fine. 

Then I moved to a new country to start a masters program. It started well. I didnt know the place, so i didnt know connections, didnt fuss too much about getting any either, because I did have ways to get a small supply about once a month or so. 

Then January 2016 came, and thats where shit starts downwards spiraling. People around me got connections, they hooked me up, I found a connection, and pretty much since february Ive been smoking almost non stop. I did manage to get myself to go on a 1 week breakm which was supposed to last but I couldnt take it, I caved, got weed and now Im stuck in this fucking hole.

I dont even know if its worth getting out of at this point. I have 2 weeks of school left, and quite a few exams. Ive failed to get myself an internship this summer and I just feel like Ive failed myself so much at this point that I dont even see the point of trying to not smoke. Ive run out of my supply and I want to go get more today. Its a 3 hour commute, in total (there and back = 3 hours) but thats fine, I can handle that. The thought of not having more bothers me more than the commute.

I just need fucking help cuz i dont even know what to fucking do."

Just got a callback for another interview regarding an IT Tech position at a high school. Because of my distance (still away at Uni until graduation), we have done one Skype interview, and I believe the next interview will be over Skype as well.

One thing I haven't brought up previously was the salary I would be making. I feel that waiting until the 2nd interview to inquire about compensation is the more professional thing to do, to make it look like I'm not only in it for the money.

If I feel comfortable enough during the interview, I want to bring up the inquiry about how much I will be making (keep in mind, this is my first ""real-world"" job right out of college, excluding internships). How can I do so in a professional and humble way?
Thanks!"
4hv1mf,1,2016-05-04,Help! Losing my job in a couple weeks!,TestEngr,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4hv1mf/help_losing_my_job_in_a_couple_weeks/,"This was my first job ever, started as an Intern and moved to a contract position. I have never had to search for a job or even know  how to nail an interview.

So I have been (luckily) given the heads up that my contract will end in a couple weeks. I'm trying to handle this emotionally but I need to handle it financially also.

My current situation.


Debt/Income | Value
-----------|-----
Rent | -$521.69
Car Insurance(Bi-Annually next bill 6/22) | -$380.00
Check 1 | $1,443.02
Check 2 | $806.59
Check 3 | $806.59
Health Insurance (healthcare.gov) | -$172.55
Internet (after 1/3rd split) | -$37.40
Utilities (average after 1/3 split) | -$83.33
Student Loan Payment | -$314.12
Current Credit Card Debt | -$2,000.00
Emergency Fund | $5,000.00
Current Checking () | $843.46
Total Net | $5,390.56

So after all bills this month I will have 5.4k roughly to live off of until I find a job. If it wasn't for PF recommendation of having an Emergency Fund I would be in a much horrible situation.

Now what do I do to make this manageable? Adding in food cost of  $400 a month (I will have to reduce this substantially) to monthly expenses I get roughly $1k a month. 

So I have roughly 5 months to find a job...while this may seem like alot I honestly don't believe I will be employed within 5 months...While I look great on paper, I have trouble in interviews due to my social anxiety...and that usually kills any chances that I would have had.

Sorry for the rambling I'm just extremely nervous and don't know what to do. I need any input on how I can reduce my monthly expenses... Will my loans give me forbearance if I lose my job? what about my health insurance...?"

I have failed at audiophilin' for I can't make out the differences between these headphones or dac/amps ... at all.

I tried, I really tried. I really wanted to hear major differences *somewhere* either between the Dragonfly and the Schiit stack, or between the headphones. I just can't. If I'm being really honest with myself here, the differences I *think* I hear, are not sufficient enough to even state.

The longer version:

My entry-level set-up was the Audioquest Dragonfly and HD650.

Audio bliss! Really enjoyed the DF/650 combo. Unfortunately for me, I kept researching. I learned maybe the DF wasn't ""enough"" for the power requirements of the 650. I lived with this knowledge for a while, because the Fidelio X2 found its way to me through that infamous Amazon sale. I didn't get a total dud X2, but my pads leave some to be desired. The sound though! I was a big fan right away and stashed the 650 away, told myself ""the pads are worn down anyway..."" which is true, my ears touched the driver foam making them annoying to wear for long periods.

Fast forward many months. I moved from New Jersey to Alabama for an internship. Took the DF and X2s with me. About 3 months in, I accidentally janked on the DF input jack and started only getting sound out of the left channel with the X2 and a pair of earbuds I brought with me (soundmagic e10). Well, fuck. I contacted Audioquest who sent me a replacement. Since I only had a month left in Alabama, I had them send it to NJ.

I got the Schiit stack and he400i after spending some time over at r/avexchange. I was just curious about what a ""proper"" dac/amp could do, and was VERY curious about planar technology. Transactions were great, it being my first time buying equipment I was nervous but kudos to those that sold me their old gear. Without the DF on hand to compare, I thought the Schiit stack sounded great. The he400i were somewhat close to the X2 but with slightly more present mids and slightly less boomy bass. I also found them a little more comfortable... at first.

Back in NJ, first thing I wanted to do was try the 650 and Schiit stack. Tried it, no problems, sounds good, mind = not blown. I went back and forth between the 650 and 400i using the stack. Oh, yeah, my source is Spotify premium... still reading? phew, good. Try as I might, I couldn't really tell any major differences - the kind that were more obvious when the X2 is thrown in the mix. I knew I was only holding on to one of these (650/400i) but I couldn't, and still can't tell which is better from purely a sound standpoint. I hadn't heard the 650 in many months, and I have to say I'm very pleasantly surprised at how punchy and full the bass is. It's really no slouch. To my ears (which we may be learning are shitty?) they're right there with each other in the bass region. Both are slaughtered by the X2 in terms of overall boom, though I would concede the 400i has the ""tighter"" bass of the three. 

Onto the dac/amps. I suppose, thinking about it now, that there really shouldn't be *major* differences between DACs. They're supposed to just get out of the way and deliver ""cleaner"" audio than your on-board card normally would (please correct me if I'm wrong, still learning). Both of these do that just fine. What surprised me were the amps. As you know, the DF is a dac/amp combo, and it's USB powered. I've also read that its output is very small in comparison to dedicated amps. There is no question that if I crank both, the Magni will produce much louder volumes - the issue is, I have absolutely no need for all that volume. 

Now, I know it's ""impossible,"" but I tried my best to volume match one laptop using the DF and another using the Modi/Magni. I did this by getting both headphones to just comfortable listening volumes where I was as close to certain as I could be that one wasn't louder than the other. I proceeded to listen to the same segments a few times on both. Switching headphones between them, I still could't say one dac/amp or headphone was in anyway better, or rather, *more enjoyable* than the other. I was also surprised, though not exactly pleased, to learn that the DF powers both cans just fine. I'm not just talking volume, but all the attributes sounded virtually identical to me. See, the thing is, I actually wanted the Schiit stack to shine above the DF. I wanted to justify the impulse purchases I made... 

What, if anything, am I doing wrong? I listened to a range of songs and they all sounded pretty much the same to me. Could anyone recommend a test track that should expose differences? Is it logical that the dac/amps performed the same? same for the cans? 

If I had to pick one, it would have to be the 650 primarily based on comfort. I'd have to replace the pads to make them perfect. As far as the dac/amps go, the Schiit stack hasn't done enough to convince me it's better than the DF, and it won't plug and play into my work laptop. I have to separately install drivers and I would need to get the IT guy to sign-off on that, he's a prick so that stone-walls that process. 

.... so, I think I'll keep the DF/X2 and head over to r/avexchange with the rest. Why the X2? well, turns out I like bass... I also really like its soundstage/imaging above the other two. It's not as comfortable as the 650 (and basically the same as the 400i for me) but I don't hear huge gaps in the mids as has been reported, so yeah, since it doesn't need a lot of power the DF is pretty perfect for it. Looks like the set-up I had for the longest time and truly enjoy is where I belong. I'm glad I scratched the itch, though. I know there are many levels left out there, getting a tube amp for the 650 for instance. I just don't think I'm interested that much to spend the money - and I know that I for sure will only be sticking with streaming services. I've heard FLAC files and also didn't hear any outstanding differences... 

Thank you kindly for reading and providing any input. I'm a big fan of this subreddit, but I think unless something changes as a result of this thread, I won't be making any other ""upgrades"" in the future. "

I am currently a rising college freshman at Florida State University. I've been fascinated with Computer Science for a couple years now and obviously chose it as my major. My CS teacher in High School always encouraged my growing passion and kept talking about how I will have no issues at all getting a job right out of college because everything computer science is in such a high demand right now. However, I recently discovered this subreddit and I see more and more people complaining that they're still without a job after graduating months ago.

Is this seriously a common occurrence? I know CS is my passion but this outlook that I found on here kinda made me nauseous…

Also, I will obviously try to do internships, etc. but is it really that bleak of an outlook without?

Plus, how much is attending a state school in Florida gonna hurt me? I see people from very prestigious schools around here who struggle to find a job and I'm worried how bad my chances are with a state degree in a not so much state of the art area which is Florida."

I've been looking into different ways of getting my 150.


I'm leaning towards a few options, I'm just curious as to which will help me down the road the most / make me the most versatile moving forward in my career.

I'll graduate with a BBA: Accounting (~3.4 Gpa, 123 credits)



My second degree options to reach 150:
All of these second degrees would come from the same school as my undergrad. Cost isn't a major major issue, I'll finish undergrad with no debt so could take out some loans for the second degree.  

BBA: Information Systems: 10 extra classes, ~8k

Masters of Science: Information Systems - 12 extra classes, ~20k

Masters of Science: Information Technology (online program) - 16 extra classes, ~22k





What will make me the most diverse moving forward. I'm interested in Audit / IT/ IS / Data analytics  type work.

I am currently in Grade 12 and I got accepted into Civil Engineering at Ryerson.
My math and physics ability is VERY average. If I kill myself to study and try my best, i only ever reach a mark of around 75-78%... meaning I'm not too good. 

So my question is,,
Will i survive engineering at Ryerson?

Math i can deal with. If i do the homework I can manage to get by, but it is the physics that really troubles me. 

Aside from that I have a few general questions:

- How are the math and physics classes in ryerson (difficulty)?
- Are courses not titled as 'Calculus' 'Mechanics' etc.. such as intro to engineering have math and physics in it?
- How are the internships?
- Should I get residence?
- Which Liberal Course should I take?

Thanks so much guys,
any responses will help me a lot as I am near the time where I must chose my program to accept.

Thanks again.

Well lo and behold I just received an offer for a medium sized corp here in LA after having an interview last week! The interview questions were not too bad, I had to reverse a string, write a Linked List from scratch, and finally write some simple sql queries. Needless to say I am beyond happy as my first real experience in the field.

I have to say thanks to those who gave some great advice in that thread, particularly /u/c4t3rp1ll4r and /u/programstuff. My advice to anyone in the same position is to read what they had to say and build projects. Also, many of the callbacks I was getting were interested in my C#/ASP.NET MVC/WebAPI skills so it seems like that tech is very in demand, at least in my region."

I'm writing this because I can't admit it to myself. I can't bring myself to ask anyone for help. I don't know how long this will be or how deep into my life this will go but I know no one has seen this side of me, not even me. 

My life, as far as necessities go, is perfect. I'm a normal 21 year old Law student, my mom is paying for everything. I haven't had a real job in my life. I have connections from my mom and my family and so I have had some short, well-paid internships. 

My grades are awful, I feel like i'm just getting lucky no matter where I go. I didn't put in any effort in high school but I found myself in Top 20 law school. It was probably because I lied on my personal statement. I took a serious family issue and made it sound like it really has an effect on me but it didn't. I didn't care about it - My friend just walked by.. I had to quickly switch tabs.. 

I'm not a sad guy, i'm quite outgoing and can make friends easily but they don't stay for long. After a while I lose interest and lose touch. I had a lot of friends in high school. I had one best friend in my life. Now I can't say it that word. I pushed him away because...I don't know why. I liked him. I still like him. I made other friends but we've all grown  apart. I still see them over the summer but I see that they have grown closer together while I'm just that guy they invite over for football. I'm good football. I was always good at sports. My back up plan is becoming a P.E teacher. I think I might enjoy it. But I'm smarter than that. Everyone keeps telling me i'm smart. I think i'm smart but i'm also stupid.. Stupid enough to make it through university by just passing. In my foundation year I needed a 60 to pass. So I got a 60. In my first year I only needed a 40. So I got a 40. I wasn't looking to make friends in my foundation year. I knew they would all fail. Still I got invited over for football. We played football, went back to dorms, got takeout and played Fifa. Good times but they all failed. In my next year, my flatmates were fun. I started drinking and having fun. Then I got bored of drinking, so I stopped. 

I don't know where I was going with this. I think I forgot. I don't really know what to write about. I'm not really depressed. I'm not happy. Yes, I read hundreds of posts like that. I'm just lazy. There are a lot of 'I's' in this post. Sometimes I ramble when I type. If it gets late at night, i'll send random texts to my Facebook chats. They will be long and they will make no sense. They will ignore them. I didn't want to reply, I just thought it was a funny thought...I'm not really depressed. I have friends. I have money. I'm just lazy. 

When i'm playing volleyball, i'm usually the guy making jokes. Everyone laughs at those jokes. I might become a volleyball player. It's never boring on the court. 

Sometimes, I pick up my guitar and would play some covers but then I'll be a bit embarrassed because my housemates can hear me. They never said anything but they don't say much. Lately, I don't even look them in eye when I say *hi*. I just grab my food, maybe laugh if they say something funny, and go back. I remember at the start I used to tell them that we should cook food together. It's a lot easier and cheaper. They said where the kind of housemates that just make fun of each other. That's true, we make fun of each other a lot. They even gave me a nickname, Ferret, because I sleep a lot. - People keep walking by and looking at my screen. I should head back home and finish this. If I feel like I still need to. That's silly, no one cares what i'm doing. It just looks like i'm writing an essay. Maybe I should study for my exams instead. Or write that essay that I only handed half of it in. Why did I do that.. I could have asked for extension. I have been avoiding it for too long. I'll go back and finish writing it and then pretend I uploaded the wrong one.. accidentally. I have a medical excuse, maybe I didn't sleep enough and forgot to check. That will work... I'm always lying. To everyone. To myself. I'm not depressed. I'm just a liar. I slit my wrist a couple times but I just wanted attention. I even put a plaster on it and removed it in front of housemates. Then I just laughed it off. I'm such a liar. I had a meeting with the student adviser because of attendance, they were going to report me to the Home Office, but I had a medical excuse. I cut myself before that and pretended to scratch it. She didn't notice. I'm just a liar. When she walked out to scan my papers, I pulled my sleeve up. Then when she came back, I pretended to cover it up. I'm such a liar. She asked me if i'm ok at the end. I just said yea I'm just tired and want to get back to revising. She sent me an email asking me to fill out a form just in case this effects my exams. As a safety net. I was lying. The medical condition isn't that serious. If I just washed my sheets and stopped eating late at night then I would be able to sleep early and wake up for classes. I didn't need the 'sleeping pills'. They're not even sleeping pills, they just make me drowsy. I'm such a liar. 

I sometimes think of what would happen if I died but then I know that would hurt my friends and family. I couldn't do that to them. I don't want to die. My little brother would never be able to live normally if I did. I taught him everything. The games, Pokemon, he liked it. I even told him I would give him my 3DS if he got straight A's. I introduced him to animes. He really likes them. Even introduced me to some. We have our own handshake. When I went abroad we did it and he teared up. But I go back every summer and every winter. I need to skype my family more often. I just send them texts. I'm such an asshole. My family means everything to me but I don't show them that. I've never said I love you to anyone. I can't say it. I heard my older brother say it to my father once, I thought he was being weak. He's older than me but he's always been more sensitive. I'm going to be an uncle soon. My eldest brother will be a father soon. If I died, do you think they would name a son after me? That would be cool. I don't want that. What if he turns out like me. A liar. Lazy. Ungrateful. I don't want to die. I'm not really depressed. I'm just a liar.

4hvvim,3,2016-05-04,Small Story/Suggestions Welcome,IntegratedTennis,burlington,https://www.reddit.com/r/burlington/comments/4hvvim/small_storysuggestions_welcome/,"Disclaimer: This post comes as a result of the original failing to materialize in the /r/UVM. Still I feel obstinate in getting this out there. 

A shot in the dark... but seeing as this post is going to be my introduction to actually participating in the reddit ""inter-webs,"" I might as well make it as equally interesting as I have found the countless wasted hours I've spent in /r/supplements and /r/audiophiles. Firstly, this shall be an ode to you ""redditors,"" to whom, I will be forever indebted to for relaying the exact supplementation to mitigate MDMA neurotoxicity, and also exactly which brand of banana plugs are the best quality in relation to the range in price. Secondly, a candid divulgence of information my fragile ego would by no means allow me to convey without anonymity. Lastly, and not without due diligence, potentially fruitful in regards to my genuine intention (hopefully, to a certain degree, cathartic too). Hopefully at the expense of what feels like falling backwards into the Grand Canyon, it is at the very least a descent read. 

I attended a very prominent preparatory boarding school not too far outside of Philadelphia. I transferred there, on the merit of my academic record, my success early as a tennis athlete, but mostly because it was tradition for the sons of my fathers firm to attend the school. I did not protest, because I budded heads with the administration at the parochial school I attended prior. As a member of student government, and feeling like a prideful outsider being a child of divorce and raised protestant, I would organize an ""illegal"" dress down day where (almost) the entire class would participate in protest of girls being permitted to wear the shitty standard uniform khakis instead of their shitty formless skirt-kilt things, while the boys were not afforded the same option in reverse. My disciplinary record wasn't hot, point being. I also thought I was really cool, and if I'm honest, was a douche majority of my high school career. That didn't change much when I transferred. I found myself on campus before the academic year, conditioning for soccer season, as what's called a ""repeat sophomore."" For the uninitiated, it is pretty standard for those who graduate from college-preparatory institutions to do so the year they turn 19. Luckily my birthday is late in the year, and I realized I was indeed part of the majority. Anyway, I found the adjustment quite comfortable, and soon found myself in a social scene that would alter who I was and how I identified myself as an individual(More on that later...). Although, on paper, throughout my career there, with a glance at my transcripts, one would find not too much difference across the board, to that of my initial High School experience. Although, the zero tolerance policy, may have landed me in the deans office/in front of the disciplinary/honorary council a handful more times. Despite that, I carried a combined weighted GPA of 3.6, scored a 2260 SAT, lettered in 3 sports, captained two, participated in SGA and various clubs, was awarded for my academic excellence in the Humanities Department, and received a letter of recommendation from our future Governor. I had been recruited to play tennis by my fathers alma mater, and was offered a small merit scholarship. I only applied to two other schools just as a pissing contest with my classmates, but was very much looking forward to the prospect of college living... not so much was I looking forward to playing tennis though. I knew I would probably be a lowly ranked player for atleast majority of my time there, and the league was formerly known as Division I-AA, a subdivision of DI. Being a wall, essentially, for actual DI prospects to hit at didn't excite me after all. That in combination, with me applying to their Humanities Department in hopes of receiving more money, full well knowing I'd declare otherwise, made quitting more palatable. Oh yeah... I forgot to mention... I might of picked up a bit of a coke/pills habit... also maybe some extremely pent up, deep down, hidden insecurity. So... yeah, I'll spare you the details of my spiraling, and sharp decline of a semester and a half of college, but I think it may have involved having less accountability, no one who really knew me, or cared about me to say enough and that I needed help, trying to prove myself in the dark side of greek life, and all the other bullshit people attribute to freshman dropouts. I was one of them... but it came as a result of my parents catching wind of the severity of the situation at school and having the school send authorities on their behalf to place me in the hospital, and then promptly to a rehabilitation facility towards beautiful Burlington, VT. There I detoxed and slowly found my way back to myself and sobriety. It took about 6 months or so. I took advantage of an internship program offered by a constituent, and began to take classes again at the CC of Vermont while still in minimal treatment. After the internship and classes ended, I pleaded with my parents to permit me to send out transfer apps to Middlebury, and UVM, but they were not too akin to the prospect of me being back at a 4 year school. The cocktail of having a house divided in regards to financial responsibility pour moi, and the amount of disappointment I've laden my parents with has left me without a cause or a paddle. ""How the mighty have fallen,"" my dad likes to say. 

What a tragic story? Meh... I'm not about to parrot the same speech people give after overcoming difficulty in their life, but I still have every intention on taking the steps necessary to ensure the best possible chance for success and my happiness. I'm resolute, but more importantly, I met a girl during my time in VT. This is essentially the point of whatever this is... I have seen her sparsely since my departure from the area some 5 months ago. Oh btw, substance is no longer a factor in my life. Probably should have said the declaratively, earlier. Sorry, I'm excited, I just got to where I've been trying to this whole time. Anyway, I am very much itching to get back up to VT come later this month, when I can begin taking classes again at Winooski, working part-time, and commuting back and forth to Middlebury to assist instructing tennis but more importantly exploring and adventuring within this love interest. Phew... what I'm trying to get to is, I would very much be interested in an opportunity to sublet a place more suitable for a student, instead of trying to jockey for position with landlords at places I can ill afford. I have been bashful in reaching out to the UVM Housing FB group admins due to the nature of my dilemma, but might muster up the courage with material to prove the strong likelihood of my attending as an incoming sophomore come the fall, if nothing really comes of this effort. I feel very much at a loss, and wish so much so one of my friends had attended UVM so this actualization wouldn't seem like such a large hoop to jump through. I now will conclude this tireless appeal, with preventing myself from trying to list shit that would substantiate me as a good dude who just got distracted and sidelined by cursory, hallow, and disingenuous incentives but more or less just wants to feel accepted again as one of his peers. Also I wanna be close to the girl who thinks fondly of me, and I to her. Also, Burlington is the shit (And it's 7 hours from my parents). So if you have any information that a tech savvy young person wouldn't have already pursued in regards to subletting pursuits, contacts/links to maybe aid my situation, please send it my way. Also, pm me if you feel so compelled. Cheers!

PS: Forgive my ramblings and stumbling. A small readership is probably all I could fathom reading this. I will probably delete it come two weeks time, but if you got to this point of rambling- I love you, and thank you.

4hvws4,2,2016-05-04,Had an expunged charge show up on pre-employment background check. Where will it go from here?,KimJongUn_stoppable,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4hvws4/had_an_expunged_charge_show_up_on_preemployment/,"Hi guys

I recently got an internship offer pending a background check for PNC Bank. I took a fingerprint test, expecting things to go alright. However, I just received a phone call from an HR person saying a charge showed up, ""Sale Liquor Underage,"" and asked me to explain what happened. I was surprised to hear this because I had the charge expunged, expecting something like this not to happen.

A little background on what happened: my school began to get a reputation for being a party school, so police began to crack down on freshman. I was out one night and had a little too much. Not sure how, but I eventually got arrested for underage consumption, taken in, and booked. The charge was for underage consumption, but in my local jurisdiction, apparently there is a universal charge called ""sale liquor underage."" I was not convicted.

Now, I'm pretty worried about what this will mean about my internship offer. The guy I spoke to said that my offer will be put on hold for review, but expects that the other won't be revoked permanently. Now, I don't know if he was just saying that or truly thought that. The charge was 2.5 years ago and my resume shows that the charge is not a reflection of my character.

This is really concerning because I thought this was over and in the past. I didn't expect it to come back and haunt me; it didn't for other internships. But I want to know if anyone has any experience with something like this or familiarity about the law. I also hope that I can people's opinions about how this will affect my offer. Now, I realize that the readers are not my employer, so their answers aren't certain, but I'm worrying and am looking for some advice on what exactly is happening with this.

So, my questions are this:
1) What is the law in Ohio for expunged records on background checks? Does the Ohio law apply here, since PNC operates across states. Also, my job is in Chicago, IL.

2) Can this be used against me in the hiring process?

3) Do they have access to the police report from the incident?"

So maybe you guys have some advice for me as well.

My CV is a mess: Dropped out of Electrical Engineering, then started an [apprenticeship](https://www.matse-ausbildung.de/uploads/media/Profil_Englisch.pdf) in software development but had to quit after having completed 2/3 of it due to mental healthy issues (which is fun, since it turns out there's a reason for messing up that much in the past). Kept going to school though and will have at least some kind of paper in the end.

Now that I am back on track I though about finding an Internship first to gain some experience. Apart from a few small school projects I don't have anything to show yet so what kind of small project could I work on to put on github? Maybe something less common is better than yet another blog or pong?

Working on open source projects seems to be fun and rewarding, yet when I ""explore"" on github I end up with rather big and complex pieces of software. Are there any websites that could recommend something more manageable?

I have experience mostly in Java yet browsing jobs it seems most are about maintaining ancient customer or warehouse database applications and websites based on JSP and took like they were designed in the late 90ies.

Yet would it be best to go for one of those jobs and stay there for a while to get some references? Or rather hop onto something I am enthusiastic about although I don't have a lot of experience with it?

How honest should I be regarding the past and mental illness? Won't it sound like an excuse? On the other hand, what's the point in coming up with a weird explanation as to why things turned out the way they did?

I'm currently a student shooting at a Computer Science degree looking at trying to get into IT management/Systems Administration. I want to start labbing to get experience with Windows Server and networking with hopes of pursuing some sort of certification, e.g. CCNA. I have some experience with domain admin as an intern but rarely get to be as hands on as I'd like to.

**What I currently have:**

* Some shitty 10/100 Monoprice 24 port switch for LAN parties
* A GS108 for the lucky few that show up early to LANs/home network
* Some shitty Netgear router
* Some shitty Pentium D Optiplex from the early 2000s
* More cables than I know what do do with

**What I want to do:**

* Have hardware that capably runs Windows Server 2012 R2 (I have a few copies through my University)
* Run multiple Linux VMs to practice with different Distros and for various purposes
* Host permanent/semipermanent game servers (nothing horribly intensive)
* Host a reasonably high-speed local fileshare to distribute games during LAN parties
* Have everything be reasonably quiet; near silent would be ideal, but I know with a lot of gear, especially rackmount, that's not always possible. My workplace currently runs two ancient Apple XServe 1U units that sound like fucking jet engines 24/7.
* Keep everything as cheap as possible (college student life)

**What I'm thinking of getting:**

* Procurve or similar 24 port managed gigabit switch. Passively cooled would be preferable.
* R710 or maybe an R210 II. These are recommended almost universally and seem to be good contenders for quiet, cheap, and capable.
* SSDs if I can find them cheap, otherwise probably looking at some 7.2k or 10k drives in RAID.
* Less shitty wireless router, though this isn't a huge priority
* Lackrack
* Appropriately sized UPS

I'm totally open to thoughts and suggestions. I'd like rack gear because it's tidier (and tbh I like the aesthetic) but if getting something reasonably quiet isn't possible I'm willing to move up to a tower.

Thanks all!"

I've seen some people say - mostly online - that they had a special interests in things such as fireworks or computers.

The reason why I'm asking this question is because I've never had a significant amount of interest in anything for longer than a few years. I can't think of anything I do and/or (barely) enjoy or have an interest in now compared to what I enjoyed growing up. They're also very different when you compare them with last year's.

I think I'm also asking because my life has been stuck in a rut for months now. I feel like I'll never be able to get a job or have a good career because I either have/had interest in fields that are falling apart or cutting back or because I have a hard time keeping interested in whatever I'm committed to after a certain period of time - I've done internships and volunteer/un-paid jobs where I got bored of working there after a few days.

So, again, does anyone else not have a special interest? Or, if you did, did you end up disliking it after a certain period of time? Why or why not?"

Unfortunately, I don't have Secret Clearance with the government yet.

I have industry experience starting from internships I did while still in high school and continuing to now. Like any self-respecting computer nerd I've been doing things like building my own computer and rolling my own Linux From Scratch installations for over a decade. I have made contributions to several open source projects, such as Alien Arena, an online first person shooter video game.

I'm willing to entertain some of the more esoteric positions or something out of my direct profession, even if that means starting as entry-level. I'm a fast learner, even if you don't give me the training ;).

3. Rails (one project because I was thinking on switching to rails)
4. Nodejs/MEAN stack (currently working on my own project in this and on a freelancing project)

So first I thought C# is awesome I like it and started going that route, then a few of my friends started doing Rails and I thought I'll give it a try. After that I wanted to see what's up with the whole Node thing and I like it a lot.

I want to lose this weight so I can get pregnant and am looking for some friends to commiserate with and support each other.

The long version---------------
I need some moral support. I'm 27, set to be engaged this summer to a wonderful guy and almost done with my masters degree. We want to try starting for a family in a year or two but I have polycystic ovarian syndrome and am about 150 lbs overweight. 

I have steadily gained weight most of my life, with some brief successful and sane diet and lifestyle changes, usually about 6 months and 30lbs at a go. I've done myfitnesspal and counted all my calories, I've integrated exercise and activity into my life. I've been to therapy, I've seen a nutritionist for over a year each. I've been to Overeaters Anonymous and tried to get on the bandwagon while my SO lost 130lbs. And eventually I get overwhelmed, and tired, and apathetic about the daily upkeep and then go on a steady upward trend. 

I have a family full of addicts and feel like food is my drug of choice. When I am counting calories and staying on a diet I feel like a 'dry drunk', I obsess about my food, count and recount my calories and feel miserable. Then again when I'm not counting or on plan I think about food all the time too.  

It feels like seeking treatment in an eating disorder facility or getting bariatric surgery are my only other options, though I'm open to more therapy and am currently in group therapy for eating disorders. 

I feel like I used to be able to be on a diet for several months and now when I try I fall off the wagon within a few days, maybe a few weeks. 

I know it sounds like I just don't have willpower or am just lazy but I feel like food is the only arena in my life where I feel truely out of control. I'm doing well in grad school, I have an awesome relationship, the best dog ever, a good support system within my school program, good reviews from my internship supervisor, and work part time at a job I'm good at and like. 

I think this is an addiction and I just don't know where to turn. I feel so worthless and out of control when I think about my relationship with food. 

Being a mother is something I've always wanted and my SO and I have waited a long time getting our shit together so we can be financially ready and in a good place in our lives to start popping out some kids :) 

But my weight and PCOS make my chances of conception pretty grim. I decided I need to get with the program and just get started losing this weight this year which will likely reduce my PCOS symptoms. 

However PCOS can actually make weight gain very easy and weight loss extremely difficult. 

Basically what I'm looking for is some friends who I can have real conversations with about weight and weight loss and how fucking awful this can all be. To be supportive when I am doing well and when I'm having an off day, someone to share this experience with because I don't have that right now and I really need it. "

4hxr58,225,2016-05-04,I'm a teen and the head pastor at a church I attend had a private meeting with me that turned strange and I could use some advice.,chocolate_chimp,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/4hxr58/im_a_teen_and_the_head_pastor_at_a_church_i/,"Hi, everyone! My names is Hunter and I'm 17, I've been a Christian since I was 11.

About a month ago, some stuff happened that kind of made me a little upset and I don't know what the best course of action is. The story is rather extensive so I'm just going to start from the very beginning. I'm changing the names so this doesn't get any bigger until I've determined the best course of action.

I attend the church that I grew up in (Church A) and go to a youth group at a neighboring church (church B) on Wednesdays because I have friends there and the old youth pastor and I really relate. I met the old youth pastor (let's call him Elijah) sophomore year and over the years I grew very close with him (he's very young for a pastor, but ordained). Elijah and some of the guys in our smaller Bible study all have become very close in our faith over the years and it was very good. Elijah and the head pastor of Church B sometimes had disagreements but Elijah was very humble and always just went with what the head pastor (let's call him Matt) said. About 6 months ago, a job opportunity to join/start an outreach ministry in another state and Elijah took it right away, without question, it was the fit for him. And though we really miss him, we knew Elijah would be better serving in that ministry than this. 

Thus began the search for a new youth pastor and Matt took over youth during this time. Before Elijah left, he had started a youth worship band and we had been practicing every week (I play guitar and am a decently accomplished singer) because we were tired of worshiping to a soundtrack. I, being still in highschool, had to take some time off of band practice to focus on wrestling, and planned to resume the band as soon as playoffs were over. 

It was during this time that the transition occurred and Matt took over non-permanently, Elijah left. The search began for a new youth pastor and I continued to wrestle. 

Matt found a new pastor and I approached the end of my wrestling career. It was at this time that I got a text from one of my other friends on the youth worship team that said that the church was expanding (they are adding an addition to the church to accommodate the large youth group ((nearly 100 students)) and large amount of Sunday school children). With this addition, they are building a youth worship stage where I would be playing and were considering buying new instruments for the youth band to improve every aspect of worship (the church is very financially secure). 

I was thrilled to hear this and ready to go all in for God in this aspect, and really devote myself to what he had for worship. I really felt that this was where I was meant to serve and was super thrilled that I was getting the opportunity.  A week later, I lost my last wrestling match and the first thing I did after I showered was to text my female counterpart in worship (let's call her Tay) and tell her I was ready to go. She sent me the new practice details and the songs we were working on, and then she just needed to get the confirmation from Matt, but everything should be good to go.

A couple days pass, I start practicing the songs and familiarizing myself and I get a surprising text from Tay. She told me that Matt said that we weren't adding ""new"" people to the worship team right now because we are still young and trying to develop what we have first. I was admittedly a little put off, but I said okay. I smiled through it and said, ""Okay, I'll be patient."" I waited and resolved to serve in other ways until it was my time to serve.

The following Wednesday, Matt had apparently, via executive pastoral order, put his daughter on to the worship team, without consulting anyone (not that I would expect him to). When I saw this, I'll admit, I was jealous, but I bit my tongue and waited to talk to anyone about it until I was in trusted company. My best friend, let's call him James, is a leader at the youth and interning at the church so he has a little more authority than me, to say the least. But I voiced my concerns to in him in confidence, just waiting patiently for my time to be involved. 

During this time, the new youth pastor made his arrival at the premises. Let's call him Josh. Josh is a 6' 5"" 300lb powerlifter, who competes in strong man competitions and is ranked in the nation for a specific strong man sport (this is important for later). He seems to be a really interesting person when I first meet him and I really want to give him a chance and not dismiss him because of how close I was with Elijah. 

Here are some things I learned about Josh within the first two times of hanging out with him (once at youth, followed by a trip to Eat n Park with some older students and the volunteer leaders, and out to eat with the boys Bible study a week later). 


1. He can deadlift 700lbs


2. He is bald at the age of 27


3. His parents and grandparents have full heads of hair (he shouldn't be bald, genetically speaking)


4. He thinks steroids should be legalized and mentioned a pro-steroids documentary to me


5. He would smoke weed if it were legal


6. He abuses caffeine pills to function during the day


7. He had anger issues 


8. His wife was having a lot of trouble getting pregnant and they had been trying to for a long time (steroids kill sperm)

Based on this, I might have made some logical conclusions, but kept them to myself and never shared them. Two weeks later, Josh collapsed and had a seizure while moving furniture into his new house. When this happened, a close friend of mine who is also into fitness asked me about it and I admitted that I had a suspicion that he might have abused steroids. She told her dad this (a close father figure in my life, strong christian, and ex steroid abuser before Christ). With steroids being such a close issue to her dad's heart, he went to Matt and told him directly that there had been some concerns (I wasnt aware of this call) and Matt said he'd look into it. 

Several weeks later, James (my best friend from earlier) gave me Matt's number to call and if I wanted to meet with him to ask about the worship thing and see why I wasn't allowed on. Before I got a chance to call him, youth rolled around and Josh told me during the meeting he needed to talk to me about something later, to which I said okay, happily. (although I expected it to be quick because I had siblings to take home and they didn't know I'd be disappearing for a while with Josh).

Later, he leads me down the to offices section of the church and I make a lighthearted comment about looking forward to seeing how he had rearranged his office since Elijah had left. He laughed awkwardly, which through me off and lead me straight passed his office door, and turned the corner into the next door, straight into the office of Matt. 

Matt told me to sit down and began to have a surprise meeting with me which he defended by saying, ""I didn't want you to get panicked or scared so I figured I would just bring you down here."" I think that's pretty ridiculous, I didn't arrange plans for my siblings to get home, I didn't have time to gather my thoughts about anything or even refuse the meeting, I was just thrown into the sharks with no support (or parents).

The meeting consisted of us hashing some stuff out but I think it handled very badly and this is where I need advice and a place to talk about this. There was no prayer during the meeting a no mention of any Bible verses or Christ. It was very businesslike and the entire attitude of the meeting said Matt&gt;Hunter. He told me that he thinks about me ""about this much *makes small gesture*"".

When I told him the thing about his daughter being on the team (very respectfully and in no accusing manner) he got angry and told me that me saying that ""really pissed him off"" (which, regardless on whether or not you think Christians can swear or ""piss"" is a swear word, shouldn't be said to a youth student by a head pastor). If someone had said that on stage, it would have blown up, how is this any different? 

He also brought up the steroids thing and told me that whether I apologized for ""slander"" or not that it didn't make it better because Josh's reputation was ""scarred"" and my words have power. He refused my apology basically and told me that ""you are stupid"". I said sorry again and this happened:

Me: Josh, I'm sorry for spreading false info, I wasn't trying to trash you. If you can promise me you're not on gear I'll believe you-

Matt: -Woah Josh, you don't have to promise him anything and Hunter it's ridiculous of you to ask him to do so.

I was dumbfounded. I got yelled at for apologizing. At my home church (Church A) the pastors wouldn't have done anything like this. They would have been humble and understanding and looked for their own sin in the situation. I just don't get how Matt could be so different. 

The thing that really pushed me over the edge is when he said to me, ""Did you talk to anyone else about  Josh and the steroids thing?"" And I told him yes, James (who is an intern at the church). 

He responded with, ""Yeah, that's what I thought. I'm going to be talking with James about that. And if you tell James that I'm going to be talking to him about it, I'll make sure you never set foot in this church again."" 

Is this okay? I'm pretty sure it's very against Jesus to threaten someone expulsion from the church on a non-sin issue. I felt really threatened and attacked during this meeting and I've scheduled a follow up with a pastor from my church, my parents and Matt and I'm going to confront him. How do you think I should go about this?

Thanks so much for the support guys.

4hxt29,1,2016-05-04,"(US/VA) Graduating Saturday, Looking for Opinions/Criticisms on Current Financial Plan",recentGradMay7,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4hxt29/usva_graduating_saturday_looking_for/,"Hey r/pf,

I'm looking for some advice/critique of my post graduation plans and current financial situation. I'm currently 21 years old, living at home, graduating in three days with a BS in CE/EE with a minor in CS. 

Current finances/budget: 

* Student loans: 28,373 of federal student loans, varied interest rates, highest of which is 2k@6.8%, average around 4.2%. 9k is subsidized, everything else is unsubsidized. Not currently in repayment, but my graduation date is May 7 (This Saturday). 
* Car repair/maintenance bill of ~800: Shit situation where my car needed to be serviced/new tires during a week where I was out of state for senior design/school stuff+Finals+Work obligations, so that ended up getting done at a dealership as they gave me a ""free"" loaner while it was being done. Got railed on that one. 
* Insurance/phone currently covered by a parent, subject to change. 
* Food/Household/etc: 
* Consumer debt: None. Credit card paid in full every month for ~3yrs now, 9k limit. 
* Girlfriend owes me ~833 for her share of a mattress/bedset, repaid $100/mo, which I'm not worried about. 
* Should be getting a ~$200 travel reimbursement from the University. 
* Car: I own my car outright, worth ~14k at current age and mileage.
* Liquid assets: 21k between my checkings/savings account


Income:

* Currently working as an intern doing software engineering for $15/h, but I've got a full time salaried position beginning May 9 at 60k/year paid biweekly. 
* Company match of 4% contribution to 401k
* Of that 60k, I plan on contributing ~8% to the 401k and maxing my IRA yielding ~12.5k total savings yearly including company match. 
* Using [this] (http://www.paycheckcity.com/coadp2/netpaycalculator.asp) calculator with my state/withholdings from above, this leaves ~3k/month in net pay. 

Current Expenses (Monthly, projected for new income level):


Expense | Cost
---|---
Gas | $100
Gym Membership | $25
Food/household | $300
Couples related activity fund | $300
Min student loan payment according to Nelnet @ 28k total | ~$300
Car insurance(Predicted) | $60
Phone service(Predicted) | $75
Total, excluding housing | $1160

I currently do not pay for car insurance, but have gotten a few online quotes that all end up around $360/6mo based on my current age, car, etc. 
I currently do not pay for my phone, but I bought a Nexus 6P off contract and can switch the service to whatever makes sense if the need arises. Just taking a brief look at the Verizon site, $75/mo is highballing what I'd need to pay monthly for a decent plan. 

I'm planning on aggressively paying down the student loan balance with ~1kish payments monthly depending on living situation. I'll also be taking the ~20k I've got in cash after the car repair bill, subtracting 6mo total expenses, and dropping the rest on the loan balance straight off. 

Living situation: The plan before this past week was to live with a parent for free for a duration not to exceed 6mo (Their offer, stated multiple times over ~4yrs while I was in college) while I get a real budget set up and put a large dent in student loans. My parent told me Monday of this week that this will not be the case, and beginning June 1 they expect $700 monthly for the same living conditions I've had for the past ~5yrs, while keeping the same parent/son ""Do all the chores for the entire household"" mentality. 

Options:

* Pay my parent $700/mo, 1BR, inflexible rules, ""heavy"" household chore burden. Use extra money for student loan repayment. 
* Pay anywhere between 1k-1.3k all inclusive to rent an apartment in a decent area that is in a decent range (&lt;45min drive time) from my work, girlfriend's work, friends/family/etc. Girlfriend would chip in on this, but she works part time/doesn't have significant income. 

I'm leaning towards just paying the $700/mo for a short time(&lt;12mo) and dealing with some BS in order to set myself up to be debt free in the very near future, but its going to be a drain dealing with all of the parent's requests. Side note for the renting from the parent topic, I doubt that the parent will be wanting to write up an actual lease/agreement, which means that they will likely still be of the opinion that I could be ejected from their home as they see fit. Dunno if that's actually something that could happen or not. 

Anyways, I just wanted some opinions on my plans, budget, and the living situation. I'm just looking to be well prepared for the future and have a solid plan that I can adhere to. If I'm overlooking something or have anything calculated incorrectly just let me know and I'll make the necessary modifications.

4hy2nc,4,2016-05-04,Feeling a bit lost in life,I_like_Penguin,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4hy2nc/feeling_a_bit_lost_in_life/,"So i'm a freshmen in college and ever since last July I have gotten days where I feel really lost about what I want in life and on the other days I have to think about but they mostly involve what I want in my future. I feel like I could be such a better person. Not in an ethical way but in a hey that guy is pretty interesting kind of way. I spend a lot of my free time running and watching movies so i am pretty physically fit which is one of the things which I never really stress about anymore unlike high school where most of my stress came from running performances. Now it is a complete 180 where I am now stressed about pretty much everything else and not running at all and it is kind of overwhelming. Here is what I am specifically worried about right now:

Summer plans. Im upset i couldn't get an internship or at least an interview for some summer position and my options right now are working at the patent office across the country for no money where I would live with my aunt and uncle and know no one else (most people will at least juniors in college interested in law degrees) or stay at home working a job as a tutor/retail position both of which are really boring to me and I'm not sure what to do about this. 

my friends are great people but next year stuff will be changing because I am staying on campus taking on a random roommate which I am nervous about now because it will mean I will likely be living with a freshmen which isn't exactly appealing to me right now. 

major. actually not too worried about my grades so I guess thats a plus. 

relationships. so this girl has seemed to be very into me over the past 3 to 4 weeks and I never really had an opinion one way or another and then after she texts me first a few days ago she seems less interested now and idk if I screwed up but I think I just wanted her to like me but i'm not sure if I actually had feelings for her as well (i thought I did at points but others I didnt) so i'm not really sure what to think about this at all and that kinda worries me.  


So the reason all of these feelings are catching up with me here could be a couple of events. the leading theory in my mind is that in last July I was really into this one girl and she appeared to be into me as well where she gave me all the signs you could think of that all of our friends were really excited for it and then bam she said she was never into me at all and actually thought I was extremely annoying so that sort of ended and it upset me a lot I guess considering I never was in a relationship and this was truly heartbreaking for me. 

So what should I do? How can i figure out my life? I need a goal to work towards so what should that goal be right now? 

any advice is appreciated even if it just you telling me a story about something you went through that might be related in a single aspect or not at all. "
4hy7bf,1,2016-05-04,[Advice] Do I stay or do I go?,FallynKay,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4hy7bf/advice_do_i_stay_or_do_i_go/,"Background-I am about to graduate undergrad and move onto graduate school. I have a summer internship in a few weeks and then right after, I have to start school. My school is almost on the other side of the country than my Nmom. Right now, she pays for my phone, my insurance (car and health) and chips in with some money when I need it. I currently live with her, her boyfriend and my brother but I don't pay rent or utilities. She only had space for her and her boyfriend in one room and my brother in the other when I moved in but I was given his room and he slept in the living room. Sounds sweet, right?

Nmom's characteristics: Plays the good mother so she can look better than everyone else, constantly doesn't remember her abusive ways (emotional and verbal abuse), tries to justify her actions of letting my abusive (physical) Ndad come back into the house over and over again, either makes every one of my happy moments about her or introduces a bunch of negativity which has led to me doubting my relationships and accomplishments and is basically passive-aggressive every waking second


What happened-It is finals week so I came home around 11:00 from a review session with my teacher. I was eating a late dinner and my brother was getting ready to go to sleep in the living room. My Nmom and her boyfriend were loudly talking to each other about nothing so my brother knocked on their door and asked them to ""tone it down"". The boyfriend reacted in a verbally hostile manner but I assumed he was joking. My Nmom laughed it off but I told her that it wasn't funny because they were being loud at 11:00 when my brother was trying to sleep and we have neighbors who have complained about them being loud before. The boyfriends says he doesn't care and starts purposely stomping on the ground (we live on the second floor) and my Nmom continues to laugh. She sided with him and started being passive-aggressive since I had spoken up about it.


Everyone went to bed while I stayed up and studied.


This afternoon, the boyfriend comes back and calls in my brother. He basically says that my brother asking them to ""tone it down"" was rude and disrespectful and that from now on, he would be sleeping in his old room again. The boyfriend didn't give a damn whether I stayed in there with my brother or moved into the living room but because he (the boyfriend) pays rent and is a grown man, no child is going to tell him what to do. He said all of this and referenced me but didn't address me which I found to be rude but whatever.

I then asked if we could sit and have a discussion about this so we could try to understand where everyone was coming from. He says no, there will not be a discussion because he and my Nmom have made this decision and there's no room for anybody's opinion. 

I immediately have flashbacks of the same type of speech that my abusive NDad would use. I question him about being considerate of the other people living in and around the apartment. I question him about including my Nmom in the discussion (she wasn't there for this part because she was coming home from work). 

He says I can talk to her if I want but the decision is final because he has made too many sacrifices with me living there. He says that he can't watch TV in the living room anymore (untrue because my brother plays video games on the TV in his old room and I'm usually at school, working or on my laptop. Any TV show I want to watch, I watch on my computer so I never use the living room TV outside of background noise). I tell him that he doesn't have to do that and he agrees. I tell him that I have made sacrifices too such as giving my dog away because he doesn't like dogs on the furniture (my Nmom agreed with him). 

That dog was the best dog-always made me feel loved and good about myself when I lost my relationship with my Ndad and when my Nmom was picking on me and emotionally manipulating me. His presence alone was enough for me to pull out of my depression, seek help, start working out by going on long walks and feeling like I meant something to someone. So to give him up was a HUGE FUCKING SACRIFICE. He then laughs when I mention giving up my dog. I ask why he is laughing and he says that giving up the dog wasn't that big of a sacrifice.

Again more flashbacks of my Ndad. 

He keeps saying that my opinion doesn't matter, he pays rent, he's a grown man, my Nmom agrees with him and the decision was final. I feel myself getting those angry tears so I pack up some stuff, call a friend (Thank God for him) and ask if I can spend the night. He agrees and I leave.

I called my sister on the way over to my friend's house and she basically sides with him, won't let me vent (even though I specifically told her that I needed to vent). I'm hysterically crying as I drive down the highway and she keeps saying that I'm being dramatic and not understanding that he grew up differently than us and he doesn't know how to ""talk"" to us.

Side note-what grown man doesn't understand that re-configuring people's spaces needs to be discussed first?

I get to my friend's house but am scream-yelling at my sister about how awful our Nmom is and how she (my sister) moved out of the house before it got really bad. I tell her that both my Ndad and Nmom drove me to attempt suicide twice and then I hang up and go into my friend's house. 

He left for work but his roommate's boyfriend is there. The roommate's boyfriend asks what happened because my face is puffy, my eyes are red and I look upset. I tell him everything and he says that he has a room in an apartment that he doesn't use (because he's always hanging out with the roommate/his girlfriend) and if I need a place to crash for the three weeks I'm here before I leave for my internship, he's happy to let me (Thank God for him too). 

So now I'm faced with this decision. Do I stay with my Nmom and just soothe my soul with how good it's going to feel to leave her and her boyfriend forever when I go off to graduate school? Or I do take the roommate's boyfriend up on his offer and just live in his apartment? I need to stay here so I can work and get some more money and most of my stuff is still at my Nmom's. Am I just being dramatic and making a big deal out of a bad argument? Am I just stressed from finals and trying to graduate and thus am emotional? 

My sister called back and told me to bear it for three weeks and if I want to cut ties (especially financially), I should first hear my Nmom out first because the boyfriend may have just thought she agreed when in fact, she might have just been considering it. She is big on discussions (before ultimately doing things her way) so I know the boyfriend just took it upon himself to approach my brother and me. However, she has chosen his comfort (as well as my abusive Ndad's comfort) over her children before so I do think she agreed. But how do I deal with the situation now, like right now? 

TL;DR: My nmom's boyfriend is displaying the same traits that my abusive ndad had. He and I get into an argument about them not yell-speaking as loud at 11:00 at night. He completely invalidates me and laughs at me and is a massive dick about the entire situation. I leave and have the choice to live somewhere else. I only have three weeks left. Do I stay or do I go?"

I've been concentrating in AI at my university. I've been taking classes from computer vision, machine learning, convolutional neural networks, and NLP. I have an internship lined up this summer at a large company, and I've been told I'll be doing something along the lines of playing with different learning models. I think working on the cutting edge at places with solid resources like Google, FB, or OpenAI would be my dream. I know entry level positions are unlikely to be the super rad stuff, so I'm trying to see what I can do to maximize how impactful my first full-time job will be. I really want to make sure I work on something really interesting and cutting-edge. However, school itself has been a lot of work and takes all my time, even to just make through a class with learning all the material, so it's been difficult to make some time to do work outside of class. Should I just suck it up and try doing research as well? Or should I just wait to graduate and see if industry can help me make good work and make a name for myself? I'm also debating getting a masters, but by the end of senior year I will have taken all the AI classes that I'd like. The rest are more so graduate seminars on new research or personal projects taken as school credit. Is it worth it to get a masters in a different specialization like computer systems?"

I have lurked around this forum a little bit trying to get some insight on my relationship with my mother. Over the past year or so I have come to the realization that my mother may be a covert/vulnerable narcissist. Leading up to this revelation, I had a hard time describing my mother and her behavior to other people, and I never knew how to describe it myself. In general, she is a very anxious and nervous person, however she refuses to seek the help of a therapist and does not believe in medication of any kind (she has a hard time even taking an aspirin). She is also extremely sensitive and takes everything extremely personally in all aspects of her life. For example, about a year ago in her healthcare-related workplace, she mistakingly broke confidentiality protocol and needed to be documented for it; she cried to me about how her boss must not like her rather than admitting that the disciplinary action was required by law.  In general she is an outwardly kind and generous person and I don't believe her intentions are malicious. It wasn't until my now-husband and I were talking one night that he said something about how she has some narcissistic tendencies that I started googling. I came across a few articles about covert narcissism and nearly every word hit home with me. I was so excited that I actually had a way to describe everything I have been dealing with for most of my life. 
My mother has very much tried to make my life and my younger sister's life her life. I am from the midwest, where she currently still lives, and I moved to California nearly 7 years ago. After I moved, she would talk about how she might like to move to California too....only after she pleaded with me not to ""leave her."" When my sister went to college about 30 minutes from my mom's house, mom talked about getting a place close to my sister. When my sister took an internship in New York after graduation, mom talked about how she could move there, too. The list goes on and on. My sister and I both feel that my mom does not seem satisfied that moving on and having lives of our own is a good and healthy (and perfectly normal) thing; she doesn't want us to leave her and would much rather have us live in her house with her until we die. Basically, she dreams of Grey Gardens. 

In the past, I have tried setting boundaries with my mother and she completely ignores them. She wants to talk at least once per week for at least an hour and a half to two hours per phone call. I have told her many times that my schedule is very tight and I do not have that kind of time to devote to her calls (nor do I want to invest in that much time that often). Yet, she still manages to keep me on the phone for far longer than the 45 minute time limits I give her. She gets upset when I do things like fold laundry or unload the dishwasher during our conversations, even when I tell her that I am short on time and I need to do these chores while we talk. 
The icing on the cake was at my wedding this fall when she had a complete and total meltdown and full blown anxiety attack (which she will still not admit to. She is firm in believing that the sandwich she had for lunch made her sick...even though we split the same sandwich and I was completely fine). I believe that a big part of it had to do with the fact that she wanted the attention on her, and that on some level she knew that the family dynamic would fundamentally change once I was married and moving forward with starting a family of my own. Of course, she will admit none of this. 

I started seeing a therapist a few weeks ago as my new benefits through work make it very affordable for me to do so. The first session I had, my therapist said ""your mother is a narcissist"" after I told her a few simple stories of what my relationship with her is like. I am heavily considering going Low Contact with her because I feel that it is important for me to continue to live my own life. The fact that she lives 1800 miles away makes this possibility a little easier. Can anyone offer me some advice on going LC with their Nmom? Insight on their own experience with a covert/vulnerable narcissist? 

Thank you everyone!

(For the record, I am 35 years old and my sister is 31. Our mother is 63 and our parents divorced 15 years ago...my mother served my father. We both have healthy relationships with our father and step-mother)

Codename: Ichor

Age: chronologically 35, biologically 26

 [Appearance:](http://i.imgur.com/t4As1HT.jpg) 

* Hair: Black, long, can be messy
* Eyes: Dark Brown, hint of gold. They appear to be fully gold through his suit.
* Skin: light brown
* Body: Has lean muscles, somewhat tall.  He has some scars on his body from his time kidnapped and from various battles.
* [Supersuit:](https://i.imgur.com/BBsBgyF.png)  His supersuit is armored with tiny gaps for the blood to flow through. His armored gloves have separated fingers, allowing him to have greater control of his blood manipulation. His legs are a little more armored because the majority of his attacks go through his hands.  The feet of his soles are made of a rough metal in order to get better grip on slick surfaces.  His suit is made out of a porous alloy that is as strong as titanium but has the weight of Aluminum.  It is reinforced underneath with a carbon fiber weave, allowing him to use his armor as storage channels for his blood.  He is able to harden his blood inside the suit, strengthening it further.

* When not wearing his super suit, he likes to wear a graphic t-shirt and jeans.  He wears his suit during public appearances.

Personality: Despite his macabre power, he is usually really laid back and enjoys having fun. He has a very odd sense of humor and tends to speak first and think later when with friends. He can be very persuasive, and loves strategy.  He tends to be a very warm and friendly person, but can be outright intimidating if he doesn't trust you. He is kind of nerdy as well despite his years in battle, and loves to make pop culture references.  Sometimes even during mission briefings. He can be very serious if needs to be and has gotten more serious throughout the years.  He essentially has two modes: battle-hardened veteran and perky manchild.

Backstory: Growing up in Florida to immigrant parents, Sam was an outcast.  Despite being born and raised in Florida, he was always the foreign kid.  He didn't have many friends, either.  Except for a select few, everyone saw him as that one weird brown kid that didn’t know how to talk to people.  Instead, he turned to science and books.  He’d spend his days in the fantasy land of a book or game, or researching a new theory in biochemistry.  As time went on, he cultivated a reputation as the resident nerd of the school.  
All that changed when he was 13 years old, when Mexico and Canada declared war.  Like pretty much every place close to the borders, he was caught in the crossfire.  Suddenly, Canadian sympathizers were accusing him of helping Mexico.  Despite not actually being Mexican, he was caught up in Anti-Mexican sentiment due to his looks.  This drove him closer into his research, where he spent most of his time.  He graduated high school at the age of 17 and immediately began an internship with Booster Tech in the biological research division, where he studied biology based powers for potential artificial power creation.  

 The next year, war broke out once again: the Mexican-Canadian war became a world war when more countries joined in to support their allies. Living in Florida, he was all too aware of the effects of the war.  This time, it was the other side that hated him.  One day, while walking back to his place from work, he was ambushed by men shouting at him in Spanish.  When he woke up, he was more than 4000 miles away in Spain.  He spent the few weeks as a human punching bag for Spanish nationalists before breaking out.  

One day, upon waking up in the dark, humid cell that he was being kept in, something clicked in him.  He could feel liquid rushing through his body, pulsing with every beat his heart took.  After cutting his hand on a particularly sharp rock, he noticed that the cut on his hand wasn’t bleeding red.  It was covered with a shimmering golden substance.  His very blood itself had changed.  After a week or two of constant practice, he was able to control his new powers with some confidence.  The very next day, he escaped in a surprise attack.  Not one person was spared.

After a few uneasy weeks of blending in to the surrounding area and adjusting to his new life as a super, he received the news: The war was finally over.  Then, a few weeks later came another surprise: A large aircraft carrier had docked itself in Vigo.  It was definitely not a Spanish model ship.  His new neighbors had tensed up.  Did the ship not get the message that the war was over?  After a few days came another surprise: the identity of the sailors.  Emboldened by this new opportunity, Sam went to go check it out.  Finally, he would have a chance to be where he belonged.

-------

After helping his allies on board the HCMS Phantom Shadow defeat the Purifiers, Ichor received a chance to lead when the leaders stepped down in order to pursue other ventures.  As a newly elected Squad leader, he was given joint control of the ship.  Along with the other squad leaders, he founded Cape City around the site of the Phantom Shadow.  As a place where super powered individuals could live in peace with regular people, it quickly became a bustling city.  Eventually SPECTRUM sprung out of the former squads, with Ichor as one of its leaders, as an organization that could work all around the world to preserve this peace.

_____
Power: Hemokinesis.

He can shape, control, and manipulate blood. He is even able to compact and crystallize the blood. He possesses overactive Bone Marrow, which replenishes the blood at much faster rates than normal. This gives him massive amounts of blood to use at his disposal and gives him superhuman healing (about 3-4X the normal speed). Due to his mutation, his blood is an extremely efficient carrier of oxygen and nutrients. He has some conscious control of the blood while it is still inside his body, and is able to manipulate the flow of blood to different areas of the body to rapidly increase healing in these parts.  He is able to pull the blood straight from the pores of his skin.  The blood that he uses in battle is a golden color rather than a dark-red, as a result of his mutations. Any crystallized blood will evaporate into a harmless vapor after about half an hour.  He is able to create some bio-luminescent pigments in his blood, and uses this to make tracer rounds or to mark enemies.  He can create light at the intensity of about 200 candelas.  The texture of the hardened blood can be manipulated to be hard and crystallized or jelly-like, or anywhere in between.  Also, his mutant blood has made him age slower than normal.  He ages at speeds a little between 1/2 and 1/3rd that of a regular person.

He has perfected various techniques over years of practice:

* Blood Blaster: He is able to shoot blood bullets of different sizes and shapes from his hands. This is one of his most used attacks, and can fire at speeds up to that of a Sub Machine Gun (about 1000 RPM) At low speeds he is able to change the direction of the bullet in midair. However, the blood cannot be reused once it hits its target.  This ability can rapidly deplete blood if he's not careful.
* Blood Blade: He is able to create blades of varying size and shape out of blood that can attach to various body parts. He is able to create a sort of inner webbing in the blade to minimize blood loss while extending the blade. The blades are about as sharp and durable as steel, and can break. The broken end is still controllable.  He can combine this with his Blood Blaster to create streams of razor blades.
* Blood Bulwark: He is able create protective armor out of the blood. The armor is as tough as steel and can be detached from his skin to form a mobile shield. He is able to create the armor anywhere on his body, and the armor can be detached. He often uses it on his arms as kind of an accompaniment to the protection already offered by the guards on the Katar that he uses.  He also uses this in conjunction with his blood blades to create blood claws.
* Blood Bullwhip: He is able to elongate his blood armor into a flexible whip that extends out of the front of his hands. The whip is about as tough as leather and is used to hold on to objects. He prefers to use this for functional purposes.  
  * Blood Brambles: He places spikes on the end of his whips, allowing him to use them offensively.
* Blood Brand: He is able to transfer heat from a heat source using the blood, allowing him to burn or even melt objects if the heat source is hot enough.

Drawbacks: His hemokinesis requires warm temperatures to function correctly, so he is weakened considerably by cold temperatures. He finds it hard to use his blood manipulation in the cold because doing so drastically lowers his body temperature.  He can only manipulate his own blood or fluid that is at least partially made up of his own blood. With the latter, however, he has diminished control depending on how much blood is in the fluid. He is unable to redirect that blood back inside his body, so it is lost after battle.  He has to consume massive amounts of calories as well as iron supplements to account for his massive blood production. He has no control over how much blood is produced, so he has to use his powers often to prevent himself from getting hypertension.  The golden blood that he uses in battle is very distinctive and can be identified easily, especially when it is glowing. His armor is short lived due to solidified blood evaporating after use.  Blood contaminated by anything that would kill his hyper-active blood cells is not usable. Overusing his abilities risks his blood becoming deoxygenated, which can suffocate him.  He is extra susceptible to the effects of poisons. 

Resistances: He is resistant to heat.  He is resistant to physical attacks due to his blood closing up the wound easily and his healing factor.

Weapon: He owns a [pair of Katar](https://i.imgur.com/JmKcRNE.jpg) that he uses as a short-range weapon and to extend the use of his powers.  These katar have channels in them that he can use as barrels to steady his aim for long range attacks.

Special Skills: He is a good strategist and is an expert at biology as well as biochemistry and chemistry.  He is skilled at first aid, and used to be a Doctor before he became a full-time hero.  He is a master of his fighting style and is skilled at the use of his Katar. He is a great talker, and is skilled at making people feel at ease.

4hynqx,1,2016-05-05,"NYC Apartment Question - Cheap apt for 6 mos then nicer one, or just nicer one right away?",Khayembii,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4hynqx/nyc_apartment_question_cheap_apt_for_6_mos_then/,"Current MBA student in NYC.  Will have an investment banking internship over the summer and, if I don't really screw up, a full time offer for after graduation by the end of the summer.  The offer will be for $60k signing bonus, $125k base (which steps up to $150k after my stub year) and anywhere from $60-100k annual bonus.  These are market numbers, confirmed by students going to the same bank as me, so I know they are 100% accurate.  I will also have the offer prior to making this decision, so we're going to assume that I have the offer (because obviously if I didn't I wouldn't be mulling this question over).

Girlfriend is moving to NYC and we'll be moving back in together at the end of the summer.  She is starting an apprenticeship at very low income but will graduate into about $90k/yr within ~6 months.  These numbers are based on what her coworkers at the place she'll be working at started out at after they graduated from the apprenticeship so they're accurate.

We have two options when looking for apartments.  One is to get a temporary cheap place for about six months.  At that time I'll just about be graduating and she'll be moving into her new role and out of the apprenticeship.  At that time then we could find a nicer place more in line with our incomes and needs.

The second option is to just get the nicer place right away, based on my offer in hand and the belief that she'll be able to get out of her apprenticeship and make the money she's planning on without problems.

**Here's why this is a question.**  Moving in NYC is very expensive.  She's moving here in August regardless so we'll be moving in together then no matter what.  There's two reasons I'm considering just getting the nicer place and taking the added rent and risk:

**1.  Broker Fees.**  Broker fees in NYC are usually around 15% of the annual rent expense paid at the signing of the lease up front.  It's very tough to find apartments that don't have these fees, and usually when they don't have fees listed they're baked into the price of the rent so you're paying more anyways.  It's very difficult to find a true ""no fee"" apartment in NYC.

If you assume the cheap apartment is $2,500/mo (reasonable for an apartment that has a decent commute to Tribeca, where we'll be working) and the nice apartment is $3,500/mo, and if you assume you move into the nicer place after six months, you have to pay two broker fees - $4,500 and $6,300 or $10,800 in total.  If you periodize these (divide them up into monthly payments), you're really paying $3,900/mo for situation one, and $4,025/mo for situation two.

So $125/mo more for situation two (nice apartment right away) versus situation one (cheap apartment for six months then nice apartment).

**2.  Moving Expenses.**  If we move into a place for six months we're going to accumulate an entire apartment's worth of stuff that we'd have to move again, whereas if we move into the nice apartment right away we're going to have a very small amount of stuff to move only once (I have just one bedroom worth of stuff now, she is moving from her parents' house, so not much).  I'd just assume that hers would be $300 for the initial move (driving across country) and mine let's say $100 for local move, so $400 for the move for situation two.  Situation one would be $400 for the first move, then probably another $300 for the second move to move everything (furniture, kitchen stuff, living room stuff, etc.).  We can assume that a cheaper moving expense due to getting rid of stuff would be offset by the expense of replacing it, so it's a wash.

So the way I've been looking at it because of these two issues are, if we can find a truly no fee apartment at a certain threshold of rent, it might be worth it to move for six months.  Otherwise we're better off financially just getting the nicer place and getting it over with.  Qualitatively, we'll be taking on the risk of her job not panning out as hoped, but also the ease of moving just once.

I don't know where the calculator, the only one allowed for it, is. I haven't studied anywhere near enough. It's worth 40% of the grade, and I'm going to fail.


Due to lack of motivation, I failed the one yesterday. I got a C on the first of the week.


I didn't get an internship (started applying in September). I have no job for the summer.

There's a very high chance I will need to retake these three classes.

And yet, I feel calm. Resigned, I guess. It's out of my hands now. I know exactly where I fucked up. I know what I need to do. As someone who has never failed, in anything, I think I needed this. A slap to the face, and time to reevaluate.

4hyr5m,16,2016-05-05,[Map] Lair of the Necromancer - A complete dungeon made for use in Roll20,lil_literalist,Roll20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roll20/comments/4hyr5m/map_lair_of_the_necromancer_a_complete_dungeon/,"[Imgur album of the map.](http://imgur.com/a/kDtzv)

The details of the map are in the link above, so I'll comment on how I used this in my game. 

My players and their NPC ""intern"" were 12th level when they entered this dungeon. They had been hearing rumors that there was a new lich in the wilderness, and hordes of undead seemed to confirm this. Now, a lich is not destroyed when its body is... um, killed. It regenerates wherever its phylactery is hidden. As such, actually destroying a lich can be a tiresome endeavor. But my players heard that an artifact of life can be used to indicate the direction in which a lich's soul flees when its body is destroyed, leading to the phylactery. So my players stole the [Branch of Life](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/artifacts/minor-artifacts/branch-of-life) from a noble family and brought it to the necromancer's lair. 

My players went through the dungeon and ended up bypassing the special undead rooms entirely. They got past the door to the ceremonial chamber by just using Disintegrate on the walls next to the doors. They went in and began battling against the necromancer who, as it turned out, was not actually a lich yet. The NPC intern stole the Branch of Life from the party and gave it to the necromancer, giving him the last item that he needed to complete the ritual to descend to lichdom. It turns out that the NPC had been the one to plant the rumors about using an artifact of life to find a lich's phylactery. The necromancer and the NPC intern ended up teleporting out together when they got low on health.

Here are the different enemies that I used. The undead are mostly lower-CR creatures, so I just used a lot of them.

4hyunl,5,2016-05-05,Graduated college and cannot find a job,NineTails100,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4hyunl/graduated_college_and_cannot_find_a_job/,"I graduated college in August 2015 and I have been unable to find a job in the field in which I got a degree, Broadcast Journalism. I've always wanted to be a reporter on TV, and getting a job in the field is harder than I thought. I am falling into depression for the first time in my life. I've never felt so down, or so helpless. 

My Senior year things were looking great. I looked the best I ever looked. I knew if I wanted to be on TV, I had to look fairly attractive so I started working out Junior year and paying attention to how I looked more. People started coming to me for fitness advice and everyone told me I certainly had the ""look"" to get into broadcasting. 

Moreover, I landed an internship at CNN's Headquarters in Atlanta and spent 5 months there which was really exciting for this small town girl. I was able to anchor newscasts on my college TV station. Everyone kept telling me I would not have trouble finding a job. 

So I graduated, and literally had the best year of my life. Lived in ATL for half the year, worked at CNN, graduated college, made the Deans List (both Spring and Summer semesters) and now I can't find a job. I went from being excited and optimistic to depressed... 

Every single job I apply to, I usually either get NO response or I get an automated email, ""Thanks for your interest, but you have not been selected to proceed in the next phase of the process.""

I have lost count how many jobs I have applied to. I never even get so much as a call back. Never even got an interview. I even paid a monthly fee on LinedIn so I could send Inmail to people in the industry and still got no response. When I did it was a polite rejection and that was few and far between.

I've seen friends of mine land jobs after graduation (albeit not in the TV news profession). Speaking of friends, I've lost contact with a lot of my friends from college because I moved back home with my parents in the boring small town where I'm from. But when I do go meet up with my friends, after about 5 months of job searching I got tired of them asking if I've found a job. Quite frankly, I can't even afford to make the drive to go meet them anymore. 

I really don't have anything in common with anyone in my hometown, most people here chose to get married, start families very early. The idea of fun around here is Church or red neck activities like mud bogging, hunting, etc. Even the girls do it. I'm just not that type of girl. Nothing wrong with it, if you are into that. I'm just not. 

I get tired of attending family functions because it is almost embarrassing that I am still at home living with my parents. My family has even given up asking if I have found a job and they've even started to joke about it. Which really hurts my feelings. I am usually joking and laughing but now all I feel like doing is locking myself in my room and crying.

I honestly don't even want to get out of bed. I am a big fitness buff and I haven't even felt like going to the gym or going for a run in this nice Spring weather for the last month. Some days, I don't even leave the house or change out of PJ's. 

I got tired of seeing my friends from college and their lives on face book. None of them had problems finding a job. They get to go out on Friday nights, attend concerts, take trips. While I'm stuck at home in this small boring town. I deleted all my social media. 

I quit applying for TV jobs and sucked it up and applied for a job as a waitress at a local diner. The jobs in this town are all waiting tables, flipping burgers, cleaning toilets type of jobs. I specifically went to college because I knew this was not the type of life I wanted to live. I chose Broadcast Journalism because I thought it would be my ticket to live in a big city, which I've always wanted to do since I was a little girl.

I also enjoy telling stories and ""investigating."" I'm really nosy and was always asking questions about ""adult"" matters even as a child. So I thought I picked the perfect profession. Now I'm doubting why I even bothered going to college, or I wonder if I chose the right career to get into. 

I just feel like a major failure. A couple of months ago, while I was on a run, I ran into a friend of mine I went to high school with. She moved and has a nice job and got engaged. She was in town to see her parents. Talking to her, I felt like such a failure. I cried all the way home. I hide it from my parents. I usually cry in the shower so nobody can hear me, or late at night/early in the morning in bed. That is how I fall asleep sometimes. I NEVER use to cry. I was the one usually cheering up people when they were in a funk.

Meanwhile, I've literally applied to wait tables at the crappy Diner in town. I know people have it much worse than I do and I feel bad getting depressed over it. But this is not how I pictured my post grad life. I thought I'd be in a city working as a reporter, meeting new people, making new friends and just the opposite has happened. 

I hope I don't sound ungrateful. I've got supportive parents that have helped me out with bills and given me a place to live while I try to find a job. But I'm starting to feel I've worn out my welcome and they've started dropping hints ""this place is hiring have you checked into that?"" it is always a department store, a restaurant, a grocery store. People that work there are teenagers in high school. Here I am a college graduate.

It felt good to get this off my chest. When anyone starts telling me ""Good luck, I'm sure something will come along soon."" I usually nod and give an optimistic response, but now I just feel like crying.

I'm writing this at 2 AM in the morning, because I have no job to wake up to like a normal person... But I feel very alone and depressed."
4hze6z,26,2016-05-05,"Minority anger and paranoia is, in fact, harmful and dangerous",MisoginyManticore,TiADiscussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/TiADiscussion/comments/4hze6z/minority_anger_and_paranoia_is_in_fact_harmful/,"Warning: very long read

I decided to make this post as an extention of a comment I made on a TiA submission about some black folks waiting to punch out people for perceived ""microaggressions"", where I divulged some personal experiences with that type of stuff. I looked back and decided this needs to be talked about in depth, because I see a lot of people dismissing the festering pit that certain groups are falling into without being called out for it, and instead, completely justified.

So, how many times have you seen the argument ""oh, I'm a historically oppressed minority, if I wanna be angry, I'll be angry, I DESERVE to be angry and hateful towards my oppressors, don't you dare insinuate there's something wrong with it, you bigots! I'm angry and proud, don't devaulate my experiences as oppressed and discriminated X! If anyone of you Y does something to me, I'm gonna show you all!"". Plenty of times. It comes from blacks, from gays, from women, from transsexuals... and we let it slide, because we think that well, maybe they do have the right to say ""kill all men/whites/cis"" because hm, sometimes these groups WERE violent towards them.

We excuse this behaviour and think that these people have the right to ""blow off steam"" and the such, that at a certain point they'd stop being angry and paranoid, and start a constructive course of action, once they blow off enough of that ""steam"".

The reality is, it never happens. Paranoid anger and anticipation of violent retaliation is a progressing disease. The longer it is left unchecked, the worse, in fact, it becomes. The longer a person is in the state of mind when they are waiting to explode as a defensive measure, the longer their hate incubates and warps their thought process, and leads them to insulate themselves only amongst the same violent and paranoid people, spurning their sickness on. 
I speak from experience here, and I want to share it with you, so you understand how fucked up these angry victims really are.

About 8 years ago I was in a very, very dark place mentally. There were huge job and health problems, and to add a shit cherry on top of the shit cake, I was forced to move in a new neighborhood. It didn't help that this new neighborhood was Muslim-dominated. That's not to justify my attitude or anything, just explaining the exposition.

There were problems with these Muslim migrants - thefts ran rampant, women got hassled, street fights routinely occurring. One of my friends was assaulted near her condominium, and harassment of local people, male and female, often happened on public transportation.

Why I'm describing this? Well, I carry firearms, and did so back then, CC and all. The distrusting climate in the community, my own health, mental and daily issues, as well as the witnessed behavior by the kind of people I've talked about (often indeed, pretty despicable), put me in a situation where I was ITCHING for conflict. I was in constant anticipation of someone to be violent towards me so I could be violent in return.

Basically, I was primed as a bomb fuse, anticipating and dreaming for someone to cross my way, so I could rain holy retribution. Its horrible, I doubt many people would admit to it, but I feel you should be aware, it's not a rare abberation. Every time I got outside, I practically prayed some dumb ass would try to mug me or start a fight, because then I could shoot them and get off as self-defense. That's literally what I thought. I rode in public transport with my finger on the trigger, 5 days a week, scenarios roiling in my head, wishing so bad that someone makes a wrong move and I blast them back to Allah or something.

Also, it's not that it wasn't fuelled by outside paranoia - at work, at public venues, with friends - everyone chimed in on how this is so shitty, we can't as a community tolerate this, etc. Needless to say, I had no trouble forming a social circle composed out of people with the same mindset, and we just egged and egged ourselves on, helping us entrench deeper into the distrust and hate. And the true terror in this situation was the fact that this paranoia wasn't totally unfounded. Perhaps, if there was no objective reason for it to develop, it wouldn't have. But alas. Nothing is ever black and white, wrong or right. Fortunately, however, in the couple of years of this shit going on, noone gave me an excuse to act upon it.

The real problem with this is the plasticity and flexibility of the human psyche. There's nothing easier than to convince yourself you are right and justified while doing the worst things ever, because all you really know is oneself, so that's all that matters. Then again, coupled with the human propensity to confirmation bias, leaves an angry person in a place where they are constantly bombarded with data that supports them being angry, and being angry removes the mental facilities to reason and search OTHER data. Then, anger doesn't go away, that's the point - the longer it finds no release, the bigger it grows.

How this relates to minorities? Simple. By the definition of being a minority, people that feel themselves to be of a minority, flock together, they seek out those like themselves. That's an ideal breeding ground for violent and paranoid attitudes to play out. People tend to be more cohesive in such groups out of fear of ostracization, and even those who might not share the beseiged mentality, will sooner or later develop it to conform. This is basic group dynamics - there will be the spearhead of people who are itching on their toes for the release of the anger, and there will be the bulk of less courageous ones, that none the less, will egg the radicals on.

The fact that lesser and lesser altercations are percieved as ""aggression"" now, just makes the already shitty situation worse. For example, in my phase of being a shitty person, I was expecting and anticipating something major - a theft attempt, a physical altercation, a fight breaking out. But with microaggressions now, gives people the reason to disproportionately blow over the smallest thing. And, because people apparently give a PASS for such mindsets and behavior, they've no fucking reason to drop it.

Look at a couple examples, two black and one white. Christopher Dorner, Vester Lee Flanagan and Dylan Roof. These killers are the examples of the beseiged paranoid mindset playing out in full in people who saw themselves as victims and persecuted minorities.

This is what Christopher Dorner had said in his manifesto: ""Unfortunately, this is a necessary evil that I do not enjoy but must partake and complete for substantial change to occur within the LAPD and reclaim my name. The department has not changed since the Rampart and Rodney King days. It has gotten worse...."" See? Completely justified in killing people because of a percieved racial bias in his line of work. And black people did hail him as a martyr for a while - the evidence that his mindset and anger didn't develop and grow in a vacuum.

Vester Lee - maintained accounts on Facebook and Twitter, which were suspended after he was named as a suspect in the shooting. On both profiles, he repeated his claims of racial discrimination by WDBJ, specifically naming Parker and Ward. Flanagan claimed that, while working with Parker during her internship at WDBJ, she had made a coded racist remark regarding a friend who lived on Cotton Hill Road (an existing street that runs to the southwest of Starkey in southern Roanoke County). Once again, murderous anger over a percieved slight.

And Dylan Roof claimed in the manifesto to have developed his white supremacist views following research on the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin and ""black-on-white crime"". Feelings of a beseiged group of people under the attack from ""bad people"".

Anger that otherizes and dehumanizes other people is NOT OKAY, and there is never any justification for it, unless you're at another persons gunpoint. It's also a myth that only stupid and weak people fall for it. I've had higher education by that point, worked as a news outlet editor, ie - a model of an ""intellectual"" - and that didn't prohibit me from devolving into a paranoid, hateful fuck.

However, people keep acting as if being a minority means that you can't cause substantial harm, so well, we can let these people's anger and hatred go completely unopposed and unchecked. Or, catering to their demands would make them mellow. It's not so. Victimized anger is a drug, and people form an addiction to it independent of the objective reality they experience. Often enough, one doesn't even need to be on the receiving end of injustic, just hear and read about it often enough to develop this kind of mindset. It doesn't exist in a vacuum either - it's fueled by the desire of a person to be in the RIGHT and to punish those in the WRONG, simple as that. And we live in times when just one, ONE person can cause a lot of ""substantial harm"", if he puts enough effort into it.

What matters in this whole debacle the the most is the toxic mindset people develop when exposed to such paranoia, waiting for an excuse to blow up and cause harm, all while feeling completely justified in being a horrible person. 

This is why Im telling this shameful story and why I despise the now-popular idea that minorities have a right to be angry, and the notion that you can be hateful and angry, because ""its not like we're hurting anyone!"" that SJWs espouse, giving all kinds of people passes on their hate and even fuelling their toxicity and paranoia. No - it's hurting themselves, first and foremost. It takes very little time and next to none effort to pass the line from being angry to justified when causing bodily harm and death. The anti-white/male/cis rhetoric, for example, is just saturating people with anticipation for violence, as countless examples on social media show us.

And the problem really truelly lies with the person themselves, because after a while it just naturally got to the point where I attempted to shoot MYSELF, this time with a shotgun. It was an issue with being a shitty person, not as much as with other people behaving like shitty people. When someone hates others so outwardly, it's most likely they hate themselves more than anyone else, and the worst you can do to a self-destructive asshole like I was, is ""oh yeah buddy, you're totally in the right, them fucking white/black/muslim/cis people, smh, they DESERVE your wrath"".

So what can be done about it then? Not tolerating this sort of behavior. Telling people that they have no fucking right to be a crackpot because someone wears a hairstyle similair to theirs or because a police officer shot on person on the other side of the country. That they're not entitled to dehumanizing anger and that this kind of shit will lead if not them, then another wackjob, on a path to murder, and if they really want to be partially responsible for aiding some crazy's delusional thinking. That their mindset, is ultimately, harmful. That they better work on themselves and their own issues, rather anticipating an external attack. That being a minority doesnt exclude them from being assholes, if they're being assholes. Every strata of people has an unhinged nutjob that's just glad to be influenced by prejudice and self-righteous anger, and pull a trigger on the perceived source of their discomfort.

So, we have to really abandon the notion that paranoid anger is ""therapeutic"" and benign for the ""opppressed bodies"". It is fucking not.

What *code editor* are you using when working on Python Toolboxes in ArcGIS and ESRI AddIns? What are your favorite free options?

I'm a student in geomatic's engineering currently on an internship where I'm asked to modify an Esri AddIn and all we’ve got is *Notepad++* (and the python2.7 IDLE provided with ArcGIS). I've done programming in school but I’ve never work with AddIns and Python Toolboxes so I’m quite lost as to what would be best (especially since the guy who programmed it all left close to no documentation).

It was of course then that my younger sister had grown up. And out, in particular - despite still not being old enough to drive, she had a bustline that defied the lingerie available at Victoria's Secret and required that she go to specialty shops given the slimness of her frame and the ampleness of her breasts.

What surprised me was that wasn't the only part of her that developed above-and-beyond - while her 'special situation' was always something I'd known about since our parents entrusted me with that fact, I wasn't expecting that she was using my never-used Fleshlight (I found it too small), and that she was, as well, finding it too small.

Maybe we could give it a rousing finale together....

In short - looking for someone to play my 'little sister' in this scene.   If you've got any questions, let me know.

Cheers to all!

*I hope the Slovenian ploy worked*, Hans thought to himself.

Idly swirling his Jägermeister around in his glass, he kept his gaze firmly focused on the television screen. Every other staff member in the embassy, and person in the city of Vienna, and the country of Austria, did the same. Probably not with the Jägermeister, though.

The results of the second Austro-German federation polling were coming in. Across Germany, where the federation's support was near-universal, and Austria, where support was about to be revealed, many held their breath. 

In the ninth hour of reporting, just as the anchors were running out of things to say, an intern came running in from the edge of the screen to hand a piece of paper to the main anchor. She pulled out her reading glasses, squinted at the paper, and broke into a huge grin.

*""The final results are conclusive: 61% in favor with a union.""*

A massive cheer reverberated through the halls of the Embassy. Across Vienna, fireworks were going off. Hans, however, simply closed his eyes, and sighed as he felt a massive weight being removed from his shoulders. He downed his glass, set it on his desk, and walked outside. Leaning on the balcony, he watched the fireworks until whoever was launching them ran empty. As the night suddenly grew darker and quieter, he enjoyed a few more minutes of peace and solitude, before going downstairs to congratulate his staff, and make his way to the Parliament Building. In reality, the biggest work in the union had only just begun.

---

In a joint announcement, the Chancellors of Germany and Austria declared that the voices of the people had been heard, and the union would occur.

""The day has come! All Germans have returned to their natural state, one of unity and brotherhood with each other.""

""This is a day that would not have been considered possible in the aftermath of the Second World War, where the German lands lay divided and occupied. Even at the end of the occupation, those Powers continued to exert their influence through the treaties controlling Austrian behavior, and the partition of Germany.""

""However, keeping a German down requires much more than they could give. Unfazed by the partition, we tore the Berlin Wall to rubble, and reunited Germany. Just as October 3rd shall be forever celebrated as the day that two German nations unified, so too shall this day be celebrated, for the same reason. The Germans and the Austrians have been kept apart for centuries - initially by the power-hungry monarchs of feudal states, and then later by the desires of great powers, who feared being overshadowed by a united German nation. It is no surprise that after just a few decades of peaceful republican rule, the decision to unify has now been taken. It is the democratic decision.""

#**German Federation - Deutscher Bund**

**Government System**: Federal Parliamentary Republic

**Chancellor**: Roderich Kiesewetter

**President**: Heinz-Christian Strache

**Government**:  For the next year, it will be a joint Austro-German Government, however following that the districts will be reassigned into a new government (with most members of parliament retaining their seats in the Federation) that accurately represents populations.

**Flags, National Symbols, Anthems**: Over the following year, all flags and national systems will be made uniform as well. An upcoming referendum will decide whether to adopt the German flag, or create a new one. Meanwhile, *Deutschlandlied* is the National Anthem, though throughout the verses, all ""Deutschland"" references will be replaced with ""Deutscher Bund"". The lines containing references to the German lands now owned by Poland will be removed.

**Military**: All military assets of Germany and Austria will be combined into the Federation's Bundeswehr. Current German designations will be used for the body, with Austrian units to be mixed with German units in divisions.

**Laws**: The German and Austrian legal systems are nearly identical, so it's not expected that it will take much effort to reconcile them. For the next year, the laws will slowly be brought into line so as to be uniform throughout the federation.

**Embassies**: In all countries where both Austria and Germany have an embassy, the bigger embassy will become the one for the federation. In all countries where this is the Austrian embassy, the German embassy will become a consulate, and vice versa.

**Main Political Parties**:

   * Christian Democratic Union

   * Freedom and Democracy Party (Combination of the Free Democratic Party of Germany and the Freedom Party of Austria)

   * German Social Democratic Party (Combination of the Social Democratic Party of Germany and the Social Democratic Party of Austria)

   * The Greens (Combination of Germany's Alliance '90/The Greens and Austria's The Green Alternative)

WWE knew they were about to start a new era, and start to weed out the old guard a little more (Brock, Kane, Big Show, Taker) and start focusing more on the young, new, fresh talent. One thing that they wanted to do was to better connect with the fans, so Trips say ""Hey Vince this group on the internet sent me a fruit basket, and they talk wrestling lets check it out.""

After lurking around they decided that they would assign an intern to browse Reddit and get a vibe on who this ""new generation of fans"" like and dislike. That's when they get the idea, that if we use this to our advantage we can tease spoilers and help get them excited for the current product and where we are headed, so in comes FalconArrow.

Look at what's gone down since FA first started on Reddit.

2. Call Up's for E&amp;C, Apollo, Corbin, and Sami Zayn

I've never properly failed at anything before.  The academic side of life has always came easily to me and I've never really applied myself properly at anything unless under intense pressure.  I once got 11% on a maths exam,  lowest in the class,  and I was threatened to get kicked out of honors class. I got a 98 on the next exam, highest in the class. I was always above average with very little effort but I feel like I've never been anywhere near my potential.  I was a child prodigy,  but mental issues and an abusive upbringing have always held me back.  Despite this,  I've always been very proud,  and as much as I hate to admit it, very very arrogant.  This is my first year in electronic and computer engineering,  which is widely considered one of the toughest degrees you can do.

:--|:--
[The ABA just celebrated the 50 year anniversary of the Miranda decision - are there any recent (last 10-15 years\) Supreme Court criminal decisions that come close to the massive effect of that ruling? If so, what case and how?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4hzyjg/i_am_david_benowitz_a_criminal_defense_attorney/d2tu4h8?context=5)|There are two cases that come immediately to mind. THe first is a Supreme Court case called Booker in which the Supreme Court decided that the mandatory nature of U.S. sentencing guidelines was unconstitutional. THat presented a sea change in federal sentencing law.
[(I'm a young civil defense lawyer but criminal law still fascinates me\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4hzyjg/i_am_david_benowitz_a_criminal_defense_attorney/d2tu4h8?context=5)|The second case is Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts. That came out in 2009. The Supreme Court held that the prosecutor in a criminal case can't use sworn affidavits to substitute for witness testimony in a criminal case. That changed the way criminal cases, particularly drug cases or cases involving DNA evidence, are presented by the government. Before this case, the government would try to use sworn certificates to prove authenticity of drugs that had been seized. This case held that that procedure was unconstitutional, because it didn't allow for the defense to cross-examines who had taken the action that led to the creation of these affidavits. 
[What is a bit of advice you would give to someone considering going to law school?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4hzyjg/i_am_david_benowitz_a_criminal_defense_attorney/d2tsewu?context=5)|To me, it doesn't make good sense to go to law school unless you want to actually practice law. There are some people who would say a legal education is a good education unto itself, but I disagree, particularly because of the cost and the time and energy involved in pursuing a law degree.
 |I highly encourage people to pursue internships before they decide to go to law school. For me, I did an internship with the Public Defender's Service in Washington, DC as an investigator when I was 23. That was what made me want to be a public defender.
[If you needed to hire a defense attorney, what should you look for?...  Is there a checklist that you would recommend?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4hzyjg/i_am_david_benowitz_a_criminal_defense_attorney/d2tuecj?context=5)|I would look for someone who is an extremely hard worker, who specializes in criminal defense work, and is accessible. The last thing you want to do is hire someone to represent you in a criminal case who, for example, is the cousin of a friend who is primarily a real estate lawyer that sometimes takes on criminal cases.
 |It's sort of like picking a surgeon who is going to operate on you. You need to be very sure they have the experience and skill before you let them cut you.
[When new students enter law school, what percentage claim they want to practice criminal law? Due to so many TV shows and movies it is the type of lawyer that is the highest profile - I often wonder how/why people gravitate or end up in the other types of law? How easy a decision was this for you and when did you know for certain where you were going?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4hzyjg/i_am_david_benowitz_a_criminal_defense_attorney/d2tttrk?context=5)|The reason I wanted to become a criminal defense lawyer is because I was in the Big Brother program when I was in college. Through my interactions with my Little Brother and his family, I saw how terrifying and fraught with problems the criminal justice system is. Then, I did an internship right out of college as an investigator at the Pubic Defender's Service in DC where I investigated rape cases, homicides, etc. on behalf of indigent clients and that is what made me want to be a public defender. After I entered law school, I was totally focused on that goal.
[Have you ever turned someone down because you thought they were guilty?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4hzyjg/i_am_david_benowitz_a_criminal_defense_attorney/d2tsjps?context=5)|The short answer is no. One of the key purposes of my job is to represent someone to the best of my ability. Whether they committed the act that they are accused of is irrelevant to that goal. The whole point of the criminal justice system is that every person gets the best representation possible.
 |For example, I've had many cases where I've represented people who had committed one of the ten acts they were charged with by the government. 
[Has the recent decriminalization of marijuana in DC increased your caseload at all? Do you have an opinion on the decriminalization of Marijuana?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4hzyjg/i_am_david_benowitz_a_criminal_defense_attorney/d2tt068?context=5)|The decriminalization of marijuana has not had an effect on my caseload in particular. But, I agree and believe that marijuana should be decriminalized, both because of its proven medicinal benefits and because it has been used to justify unconstitutional actions by law enforcement for several generations. 
[Why do prosecutors engage in prosecutorial misconduct? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4hzyjg/i_am_david_benowitz_a_criminal_defense_attorney/d2ttqqc?context=5)|My belief is that some prosecutors engage in it because they don't know any better, and haven't been trained properly. I believe there is a larger group of prosecutors that engage in that type of activity because they confuse their obligations to do justice with winning at all costs.

4i0non,0,2016-05-05,My reasoning why Blue-Eyes Alternative isn't being released...,FlyGuyPhilly,yugioh,https://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/4i0non/my_reasoning_why_blueeyes_alternative_isnt_being/,"Ok so I have a theory: lets take us all back to 2015 when the OCG had an exclusive that was sought by all: Cyber Dragon Infinity. This card would have been a game changer in the meta then, a staple in every deck! But Konami didn't release it to anyone except the OCG....

Now fast forward to present, Monarchs, Kozmos, PK Fire and Burning Abyss roam unchecked, unchallenged across our Meta with Blue-Eyes being our possible savior, if only we had a CERTAIN META CHANGING CARD...

Now back to late 2015, Breakers of Shadow is a few months out from being released and Konami says to themselves, ""Selves, what are the big money cards in Breakers of Shadow? Well Solemn Strike of course! and Maybe Igknister...but people aren't going to drop 70-90 USD on a box for a staple....what are we to do?!"" *Enter Konami Intern* ""Why don't we release that OCG exclusive that everyone in the TCG wanted? Infinity something?"" Then the Konami Executives eyes brighten, for he has a brilliant idea. Release a previous exclusive OCG card to a new TCG Booster Set that doesn't have a whole lot else going for it so the prices will rise!!

Now we look to the future: What if there is a set that gets released 1-2 formats from now where Blue-Eyes wouldn't make a big splash in the pond, and the new set doesn't really have anything going for it? **We did it for Infinity AFTER THE FORMAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN USEFUL IN, WHY NOT FOR THIS NOW-USELESS BLUE-EYES CARD!!** Well the set might have Blue-Eyes Alternative Going for it...just to boost it's sales....

*In summary* My theory is that Konami holds onto these OCG exclusives for sets that won't really sell themselves and then puts these highly wanted cards in to boost sales and after the cards would be useful in the meta...just a theory though....

Happy Dueling!

4i0rai,3,2016-05-05,I lowballed badly for my desired salary and not sure what to do moving forward?,throwitawayyyyyy12,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4i0rai/i_lowballed_badly_for_my_desired_salary_and_not/,"Hi all, I frequent reddit but have never posted and made an account specifically for this issue. I'll try to keep it short and relevant. I hope I'm posting in the right subreddit!

I graduated with a BS in Biology in December with intentions of working to save money and eventually start my masters (probably going to pursue an MPH) within a year to a year and a half after graduation. I started my job search a couple months ago and received 3 calls for interviews. One was a temp agency that didnt have openings now but said they probably would in the summer (and its temp to hire which is cool). The other was also a temp agency that was offering a temporary technician position at $15/hour but frequent weekends and 12 hour shifts. With other obligations, this would be difficult to commit to although I was willing to make it work if nothing else came forward.

Then comes an interview with a position I know I'm under qualified for yet applied to anyway. It's a position as an analytical chemist for a small pharmaceutical company. It's conveniently just a couple miles away from my house. I frantically research and prepare for the interview as best as possible while perplexed as to why I was even being called in (My only experience is an internship for one semester in a fly lab).
I didn't look into what people make at this company and it didnt even cross my mind. I dont come from a family of professionals and I've always been taught to hold onto anything you can get, no matter the pay. Given what I know entry level bio lab techs make and the fact that I'm not qualified to be a chemist, I write $13/hour under ""desired salary"" on their forms. I know it was probably beyond idiotic having done no research, but I cant go back now.
A couple days later, I go on Glassdoor and see that chemists are making $25.45/hour at this company. I get a call yesterday for a job offer and when I inquired about the salary and mentioned renegotiation and that I requested something lower than I'm comfortable with, the woman who interviewed me said that her boss agreed to the salary I wrote and I can revisit a raise in 6 months based on my performance.
I took the position (I start on June 3) and I'm just confused as to how I know what salary I deserve. I have no experience essentially and I have to be trained thoroughly (about 3 weeks) for this position, yet I'll be making $12 less hourly than those around me. Also, 2-3 weeks is for basic training and if I perform well then I may later be trained on utilizing HPLC analysis among other more advanced techniques.
I know I technically asked for it, but is my pay reasonable? What should I ask for in terms of a raise in the coming 6 months and how do I discern if I even deserve a raise? I'm really confused and I'm not necessarily upset but I dont want to get screwed over or get paid less than I'm worth. At the same time, my job search hasn't been totally successful and I was willing to apply to retail jobs just so I could save for grad school.

TL;DR I'm going to be paid $12/hour less than my coworkers but Im less qualified, have no experience, and need ample training. Also, the experience I'm gaining is invaluable. Am i being screwed over? Should I do something about it, I don't even know what to do D: I'd love some feedback"
4i0rnc,14,2016-05-05,Paying my last semester out-of-pocket vs. getting a private student loan,makinmywaymidtown,StudentLoans,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/4i0rnc/paying_my_last_semester_outofpocket_vs_getting_a/,"Looking for some opinions on what I should do for my last semester of undergrad. I have reached the maximum amount of federal unsubsidized loans that can be taken out, so I am looking at alternatives. Here's where I'm at financially:

* Tuition cost for 1 semester: $6,102
* Federal Unsubsidized Loan: $3,740
* Remainder of tuition to be paid after federal unsubsidized loan: $3,162
* Current savings account: ~$5,000
* Earnings from internship this summer (after taxes and living expenses): ~$6000

More background information: I've got ~20k in federal unsubsidized loans to look forward to paying off when I graduate, but I am expecting to make about $60,000/yr upon graduation and am not too worried about making payments on those loans. 

It appears that after working this summer I'll have ~11k in my savings account and would be more than able to pay the remaining $3,162 balance of tuition for my last semester. I have a job that I work during the school year so I am not nervous about paying this money out.

I've heard that building up your savings while you're young and building credit through 'safer' debts like student loans can be beneficial in the long run, but it also seems like it would be easier to just pay off the $3,162 instead of going through the private loan process. 

Thank you in advance for your input!"
4i0vs9,128,2016-05-05,Tips for new starters (looking for your ideas),QiuYiDio,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/4i0vs9/tips_for_new_starters_looking_for_your_ideas/,"Hello all - in anticipation of the onslaught of interns and new starters about to hit our subreddit, I've been working on a ""tips for new starters"" wiki page over the last few weeks. I think I've got a decent start below, but would love to include anything else the community might think of.  Looking forward reading your ideas!

**Staffing**

- There are four major levers for staffing: function, industry, team, location – when you start, it is unlikely to be able to pull all 4 levers at the same time, so prioritize which is most important to you

- You have the highest acceptable margin for error when you are early in tenure, so that is the best time to take risks or try something different

- Signals of a harder project: first project with client, due diligences, client is a former consultant, brand new Manager, Senior Manager on cusp of partnership

- The staffing game is played around the clock – even if you are currently staffed, making the right connections will help you get on that dream project down the line

 - Read the Wiki for tips about life on the bench

**Starting a Project**

- Read the SOW and clearly understand the ultimate goal of the project

- Read as much as you can about the client and industry!  Use Google News, 10Ks, internal knowledge sites, and research reports

- Set up Google Alerts for the client, its major competitors, and the industry

- Clarify with yourself what you want out of the project – if seeking a promotion, it is helpful to look at your firm’s promotion criteria

- Have a team introduction where everyone shares their strengths, desired areas for improvement, work habits, and lifestyle needs – pay extra attention to those of your Manager’s!

- Obtain your Manager’s / Partners’ favorite decks – this will allow you to stylistically mirror what they already like

- Obtain the organizational chart of the client (or at least draw one for the key stakeholders you will be working with)

- Take the lead on planning team dinners and events

- Set up feedback sessions in your Manager’s calendar - feedback is critical to improving your performance

 

**Slides**

- Before opening PowerPoint, write the storyline on paper

- After writing the storyline but before opening PowerPoint, write the leads/taglines for each slide on paper

- After writing the storyline and leads/taglines, but before opening PowerPoint, draw out your slide deck on paper

- After drawing your slide deck on paper but before opening PowerPoint, review it with your Manager

- Make sure all graphs, axes, units are clearly labelled

- If creating a deck by committee, align with entire team on abbreviations, units, and all other stylistic concerns

- Learn and memorize shortcuts!  A tool like KeyRocket can help

- Start compiling a folder of killer slides

- Proofread – after you’ve finished, proof read it again.

- Make sure all numbers across your deck tie together

- If your firm has slide production, outsource as much as humanly possible to them – before going to sleep every night, consider what they could help you do to make life easier

- Check your outsourced slides when they return

 

**Modeling**

- Fully agree with team and client on the desired outputs of the model

- Before opening Excel, sketch out the model structure and how it will link together – use a separate sheet of paper for each tab that you envision - review it with your manager 

- Keep all raw data files together and untouched in model – modify as needed on new tabs

- Keep all assumptions together (on one tab, or a set of assumptions tabs) and source them

- Do not hard code anything within formulas!

- Within the model, create a separate column for “units”

- Index / Match is a much more flexible and faster way to do lookups

- Early on, anchor yourself on several key outputs for ongoing sense checks – as you develop the model further, refer back to the numbers to see if they have changed or not

- Learn and memorize shortcuts!  A tool like KeyRocket can help

 

**Client Interaction**

- Before going into any meeting, visualize and understand the desired outcome

- Don’t be late

- Understand who you are meeting with – their role, their expertise, their politics, how much they know about the project, how much they should know about the project

- It is better to lead the client to the right answer or help the build it, as opposed to giving it to them

- Be in the mindset of a good client advisor – clients are not always right, and it is our job to tell them so in an appropriate way; earlier in your career, you should go through your Managers first before engaging the client

- Open ended questions are much more useful than binary questions – questions that make clients introspective are even more useful (‘what if’-type questions)

- Look out for opportunities to connect clients with the firm’s expertise

 

**Travel**

- See wiki article

 

**Tech**

- See wiki article


EDIT:

Other thoughts:

- Check-in and check-out with your Manager daily

- Send an 'end-of-week' summary email to your manager

- If you are unsure about something critical, form an opinion but ask for clarification from your Manager - do not assume!  If you must assume something you are uncomfortable with, note it as clearly as possible

- Go to the office on Fridays and try to get involved in office activities to build your network"

Since then I've been applying for jobs non-stop in the Sacramento area and I just landed 3 interviews within the course of a week. The first 2 went very well and just today I've received offers from both of them. One is at a small tech company and they're offering me $20/hour (this one has a 30 minute commute), the other is in a University lab as a paid intern for $12-15 an hour with the ability to hire on full time for potentially more in the future (no commute). I think I would be very happy with either of these jobs. The last interview, however, isn't until tomorrow and it's with a large tech company which would likely be the best job out of the three (also no commute).

&amp;nbsp;

My question is should I accept one of the two I've already landed or should I tell them I need time to think and wait until my interview with the third company?"

For a summer internship project, I have to get used to working with FaceOSC (https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker), an openframeworks facetracking application based on ofxFaceTracker and ofxCv. 

The problem is...I have literally no idea how to get it running. I've read a bunch about it in the past few days and did a LOT of googling, but I just can't seem to find anything. Almost every link I find says to just run the application, but it's not working for me. I can't get it running and I can't find an appropriate program to run it and collect data (I'm on Windows).

I have very limited experience with GitHub and I have never used openFrameworks before (managed to install it and ofxCv) so that might be the issue.

Has anyone ever used the application? I would love any input or story with the software.

Thanks a lot! If this isn't the right place to ask such a question, feel free to tell me where I should post about it."

4i1d3c,7,2016-05-05,leaning towards a relapse,stringer98,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/4i1d3c/leaning_towards_a_relapse/,"Ok so here goes nothing on my first reddit post. I've never felt drawn to this stuff but this page is amazing. 

I'm 21 and I've been smoking an absurd amount for the last 5 years. I'm finishing my junior year as a chemical engineer and on the surface everything looks great. Very high gpa, got an internship for the summer, was president of my fraternity. I have a great girlfriend and some friends in this world that I truly consider family. All this is the reasoning my addiction always throws in my face when I feel the craving.

I'm currently 30 days sober and I just took a drug test for my internship. Just to be safe I cheated and it was even easier than I hoped, seriously it was a joke idk why they even called me in. Now I'm stuck in the mindset that a) if I get a random screening I can just cheat again and b) I wana fucking get high. I've been this far down the road a few times, 3 to be precise, and every time I relapse I'm back to 3-5 bowls a day within a week. I seriously can't resist the stuff. 

I have a few physiological issues, namely the interaction with my asthma. I developed asthma 3 years ago and my doctor told me it's exercise induced even after I was totally honest about my usage. Gee thanks doc way to arm me with some more reasoning..  but anyway I used to be a very high performance exercise junkie, capt of cross country team, lifting 5-6 days a week in college. I lost that last year when I wrenched my back and I haven't been able to do any type of enjoyable exercise since. This void definetly contributes to my lack or willpower right now.

For some context, I'm planning on smoking this coming monday, three days from now. I made the decision a week ago, but since coming to this page I've been extremely conflicted..

The most recent development is that my addiction just doesn't want to quit NOW, rather that I can save the battle for another day, or year, and yea I recognize that that is simply retreating from a problem. I've always told myself I have to be totally sober when I'm older as I plan to be a father, and I'm a child of a fucked up family thay went through a lot of drug and alcohol trouble. My mom left when I was two, and my dad, god bless him, is a drug and alcohol counselor who has devoted his existence to me and my two older brothers. The one main thing driving me to quit is this guilt/something I feel inside whenever I think of him and all he's done. Not only out of respect or paying him back should I quit, but also because I consider him one of the wisest people I know and he has always guided me to the best of his ability and shown me everything he could from his experiences. He always tells me I'm going to look back and regret the years I've thrown away just like he did..

My addiction tells me I'm not throwing anything away and, again, justifies this remark with all my achievements to date. What I'm afraid of is that I am dulling my relationship abilities and conditioning myself to prefer to be alone when I have the ability to make and enjoy amazing relationships with people. But idk if my recent, relative, separation from many people in my life is due to weed, or how busy I am with school and fraternity, or both. (Btw, I have two older brothers by blood, 9 brothers by action, none of them in my fraternity.) 

Thoughts?"
4i1imy,3,2016-05-05,I [21F] don't think my boyfriend [25M] respects me because of our age difference,SaboSaboSen,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4i1imy/i_21f_dont_think_my_boyfriend_25m_respects_me/,"**tl;dr my boyfriend said I ""act my age"" and thinks I'm immature. I don't know how I could change myself in any meaningful way to be more mature without losing who I am. He says it was a mistake and he didn't mean it, but now I can't get it out of my head. Our age difference was never a problem for me and I'm really hurt**

I've been dating ""Dan"" for about 6 months now. I'm extremely happy in our relationship, we are very similar and go together well. But the other night he dropped a bomb on me. He was going through a tough time and was talking about things that were causing him anxiety, and I was listening and trying to be there for him as a good girlfriend should. But then he started rambling about how he gets anxiety when a relationship reaches 6 months because that means it's actually serious, and although he's very happy with me now he was ""having doubts"" about us. This made me freeze up, I mean why would you say something like that if you don't want to break up? 

I asked him what he meant and he said it was mostly the age difference. Our age difference never bothered me. He's more ""mature"" than me, but can also be a big lovable goof. I never saw it as an issue. But when I pressed him for details he was extremely hesitant to say. Finally he said, ""Well, it's just that sometimes... you act your age"". This really hurt. I'm 21 but I'm not some crazy party animal. I drink casually with friends on the weekend, but haven't been legitimately drunk in a long time. In fact not partying enough is a legitimate regret of mine in college. As far as 21 year olds go, I'm pretty boring. I smoke weed regularly, which he doesn't do but accepts, but I also get straight As. I am extremely serious about my education, have held multiple internships and research projects, and put education as a top priority. I've accomplished a lot in the face of serious personal obstacles and I'd like to say I'm mature for my age- like I said, I *wish* I partied more. 

I asked him to elaborate, and he basically said it was the way I talk or get excited about certain things (like cats and foreign languages, my two favorite things in the world), and the weed smoking though he says he honestly doesn't care too much about that especially if I'm quitting after college (which I am). And like I said, education is my top priority and I get almost perfect grades consistently. I told him that I was honestly kind of hurt, and he tried to backtrack by saying ""Well how do you see 18 year olds? It's kind of like that. It's nothing against them, it's just that there's a lot they haven't experienced yet and it shows"". I guess that's a valid way of putting it... but comparing me to a high schooler only hurt more. Yes, we are at different stages in life. Yes, I don't work a 9-5 and he's been doing that for a few years now. So its fair if that's legitimately how he sees me, but now that I know he essentially sees me as a high schooler, I just can't get that out of my head. 

I think he realized the next day that he at least worded what he was trying to say in a questionable manner. He tried explaining that he was really just looking for justification for his anxiety about relationships and that was what came to mind. He's promised me over and over that he respects me completely, he sees me as an adult, he's proud of what I've accomplished, and that he wouldn't trade me for the world. I can tell by his tone of voice that he's genuinely sorry. But still, I don't really buy that he sees me as an equal human being. Sometimes I'll be talking about something, and instead of commenting on it or continuing the conversation, he'll simply smile and say ""okay"". Like you would to a child rambling on about her favorite TV character. Or he'll diminish my anxiety about schoolwork, because ""working a job is hard too"". He makes an effort to go on fun dates with me and we like to go dancing and explore dive bars together, but lately I've gotten the feeling that he's only doing those things because he knows I want to. I'm starting to feel like a child leading a parent through the toy store while the parent fakes enthusiasm for all the activities they're doing. 

He swears and swears he enjoys doing all the things we do together, and after his comment the other day he swears that he didn't mean it and he sees me as an adult. That the age difference isn't a problem. But now that he let it slip, I just can't get it out of my head. I really don't know how else I could be more mature. I could cut weed and drinking out of my life completely, but then what? I'd still be me. I'd still be getting straight As, working a job, about to start my dream career that I landed right before graduation, and I'd still get very excited about cats and Japanese- basically nothing about me would change except the amount of recreation I do. So it's just... me and my age that he has a problem with. I don't know what he wants from me in terms of maturity. Should I censor my emotions? Should I never show enthusiasm for anything I like? Should I give up my hobbies and just become some corporate robot with no life outside of work? I refuse to do any of these things. I am who I am, I have my shit together to a fault, and if I dare show some emotion or enthusiasm or youthful naitivety well dammit I'm going to do those things. I had no idea that he saw me as being so immature. Like I said, I don't think he meant it quite that literally. I think he worded his thoughts wrong and I know he genuinely feels bad about it. I *don't* want to break up. I'm seriously falling in love with his man and I think he feels the same. I want to talk about it more, but he just insists he was trying to justify his anxiety. I need to either drop it or figure out how to bring it up again and get a real answer out of him. What do I do?"

I wasn't thrilled at first, as I wanted to go into development and ended up doing a lot of manual testing that was very monotonous - but I decided to tough it out as almost everyone I'd talked to said that QA was pretty much the only path to development.

After about six months they gave me an offer for a full-time position doing basically the same stuff and I took it. I had a conversation with my manager saying that I eventually wanted to get into some kind of development and we reached a sort of mutual understanding that we'd work towards it. Eventually I started getting heavy into automation stuff and I'm now pretty respected in that aspect (I was promoted, and one of only a few people recognized in a meeting for the entire organization), but it was always and still is mostly on the side to manual testing.

Now I've been working here for over two years and feel like I've made no progress at all. I made a lot of headway on one team to the point where I was actually fixing bugs that I found in the product code, but my company changes teams around often and every time I get onto a new team I feel like I'm starting all over again. This happened again very recently and I felt like I just gave up, and that management was just throwing me bones and making empty promises to keep me happy and keep me doing what I've been doing. At this point I don't know what to do; I voiced my dissatisfaction to my manager but it just feels like the same old shit. I'm not happy at work. I don't feel challenged. I feel bitter and disappointed in myself and I feel like I'm never going to fulfill my dreams, and I'm worried that my skillset is decaying and I'll have an even harder time finding the job I want in the future if I decide to leave.

I don't know if I should try to just draw the line or look for a new job. Any advice would be appreciated."

after a while I found that there are a lot to learn to build beautiful design and high performance app.
I have tried some ways to learn android .. like study open source app, build some apps I need. but it also takes such a long time, specially when you try to learn java as well,  some times I feel little disappointed. and the only thing push me to continue learning and practicing is loving Android development. 
so I want to ask you guys .. what's your tips to accelerate this learning process? should I learn java very well, what parts should I focus on?

4i1u9s,29,2016-05-05,[Goal][Dutch-Digging] A lot of newspapers and magazines in NL (foremostly web versions) are getting extremely SJW as of the last weeks. Let's find out why that is.,Generaallucas,KotakuInAction,https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/4i1u9s/goaldutchdigging_a_lot_of_newspapers_and/,"see some of my latest threads:

https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/4giia1/socjusdutch_schrijvenonline_blog_dutch_writers/

Glamour magazine (fashion), SchrijvenOnline. Volkskrant, NOS, Metro... they're all getting SJW influence. We knew that happened with a few game journo's, but not with other aspects of society. The question is; why is this suddenly happening? If we can get a better image, then we can have a better understanding of what to expect in the coming period of time. (The Netherlands like to follow the role of the UK and USA, but a few years later. So this is why this is so concerning)

One theory is that gender studies (+other SocJus studies) students are getting internships, and because they wrote and learned so much about ''people from the world and world problems'' this would make them good writers and editors. For example, in the bottom of the SchrijvenOnline article it is noted that the author is an intern from a ''literary and culturecriticism'', who had a thesis called ""post-feminism in the dutch literary thriller"". If this is the case, then we're talking about subversion of the media from students taught in Social Justice.

The second theory is that it's from people who already held certain beliefs, but never brought them forward like this, but now did because of events happening in the UK and USA.

And of course, these events could be a coincidence. (and other theories brought forward by the comment section)

**Goals:**

Dig! Dig to see who writes the articles and where they are coming from; what study to they follow, are they involved with SocJus cliques, etc."

When I got there, I had this cloud of sadness that consumed. I saw all the friends I made happy that not only that they survived but that their outcome was a positive one. For me, at where I had transferred to it was almost like being put through the ringer with full armor and coming out with one piece still hanging on for dear life. I had alot of trouble seeing my friends so happy like this because although I knew this university was part of god's plan for me, the outcomes I had envisioned didnt come through. I didnt have the dream internship, I didnt have the future wife I was going to marry, and I didnt have the most perfect grades. As a side note, when I get really upset or down, I never drink alcohol. Since there was alot there, my friend was like hey have a beer with us. I told him I didnt feel like it was worth it all for these two years and he responded to me and said if you look a little harder you will find something. I bring this up because although times were incredibly rough, my faith in God has been at its strongest and I have this burning desire to come home and work in my church. Something I never had before I went off to college. I will admit it is a hard pill to swallow knowing what you envisioned isnt what God envisioned, but he just builds you up for something more important in the future. So where ever you are at in your relationship with God, look a little deeper and you might find something God is growing you in and just havent realized it yet. God bless :)"

2. Move into development somehow. Seems like there are more positions here and they pay well, and I would probably enjoy it more.

4i25k7,2,2016-05-05,Shade in my life,Tearlyn,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4i25k7/shade_in_my_life/,"Alright so I did what I know for a fact I shouldn't have done, I did the ritual from ""Cigarettes"" honestly I think I'm going mad now. I have had nightmares ever since I have done this stupid ritual and I'm paying the price, this is overall just a warning for all of you people who are trying to do rituals for the fun of it, its extremely dangerous for yourself. 

Now here it goes for when I did it. I did the ritual as instructed, I used a bathroom at a Gas Station, I had a pack of Marlboro's on me. I immediately checked around my general vicinity to make sure nobody was around to disrupt the ritual, thankfully not. I checked my clock on my phone to make sure it was past 12 I flicked the lights, then I started smoking the pack (I only bought them for the use of the ritual I barely smoke as is) as I looked at the mirror my eyes did start to water a little. The room did not get as filled with smoke as I expected but it will went onward. The eyes formed as expected and the Shade asked for a smoke, I passed it one. (Honestly should have ran out right then) it asked for a light of course, when I lit the cigarette for it, the shade began to relax and enjoy itself.

I started to ask it a bunch quick yes or no questions that could be easily predicted in the future, since it is supposed to be all knowing (No I did not think to ask how to time travel and cure deadly diseases honestly just didn't think of it at that time). I asked it a dire question ""When will I die?"" I kid you not, the Shade's mouth materialized and almost looked as if it were grinning almost as if it predicted what will have happened next. Of all things it didn't tell me, I guess the rules in ""Cigarettes""  left something out. I looked at the cigarette and it immediately started to burn up even faster. I chad to speed up the rest of the ritual, I snatched out its eyes, and they started to burn hotter than the flames of Hell (Ever burn your hand on the stove? Picture that times around 8000). I ran and flicked the lights on as soon as I grabbed the eyes. I kept my hand closed until 4 AM, even though it said 3 AM I wasn't going to take a chance. I said aloud to myself ""Well that was fun..."". I opened my hand and I cant even describe how odd the burn marks looked. 

So now my current life situation with the Shade. He is pissed, royally pissed I can tell that much. So, as the ritual goes I've had nightmares every night, some make me awake immediately (Those are good nights, usually can fall back to sleep). I don't even bother paying for heating or air conditioning anymore since I'm always cold. (Similar to a cold feeling after it rains in early spring to give you an idea) You may or may not believe this, its fine if so. Every day drags on and feels as if Monday everyday. 

So I still need to work like the rest of you, unfortunately my small brain decided not to ask for the power ball numbers. When I went into the bathroom at work an intern thought it would hilarious to turn off the lights. (Shit got real, real quickly) So as I start to get out of there (Was washing my hands, or I would have never got out) As soon as I started to make a bee line to the door I heard a few dogs behind me, I could tell they were the Shade's hell hounds. From the way they sounded running I would have guessed about four or five. (Could have been more) Got to the door in time and got out. Overall not a lovely experience. I know that it is one powerful Shade of all the luck...

Life has been difficult believe it or not, the whole minor miracles thing is like winning a five dollar scratch off or being first in line for the cash register. Would not say they are miracles but hey, there they are. Please do not try it, its more of a hassle than its truly worth.

4i27z2,0,2016-05-05,Am I qualified for an Android development position in SF?,abacona,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4i27z2/am_i_qualified_for_an_android_development/,"It's been my dream since I was 15 to live in SF (for many reasons besides just tech), and I am graduating with a degree in CS in 3 weeks. I didn't focus on much programming outside of class until 2016 (wrongly assumed that my degree would be 'good enough'), but I have been hitting it hard since February 2016. I already have a job lined up, and it's ok, but it's not in SF and it's not really something I want to do for longer than I have to (Salesforce programming). I was wondering if the following experience would be enough to land me a junior android position, or if I should continue learning and studying before shifting my focus to a job search...




* This year I won prizes at 2 MLH Hackathons for Android projects, one of which I did most of the coding and project planning (to be fair there were a lot of prizes awarded at the Hackathon where I led the efforts)
* Contributed somewhat at a 3rd Hackathon (web app project, also this year). First time ever doing web dev beyond HTML/CSS) so it was mostly learning the basics 
* Android development internship (over a year ago) for a tiny startup in SF. On my resume I claim this is where I learned Android development, but in all honesty I didn't learn a damn thing here. I ended up learning Android a year later (Feb2016 - now) on my own. Most of my team worked remote, and I was largely neglected for the duration of the 'internship', even though I was paid $25/hr. I felt like Bighead from Silicon Valley, but even more neglected because I was 'working' remote! I would be amazed if they ever used a single line of my code. I was only hired because I taught the CEO's daughter to code on the weekends via Skype. I was let go when they realized I was useless and that they couldn't really teach an intern remotely with their resources.
* Small Android projects here and there, mostly stuff I've modified from the online courses I've taken to add functionality, or things I've hacked together (API's etc) just to see what would happen. No large projects that were written from scratch (that I'm proud of).
* I'm a good speaker and have strong soft skills



Given enough time, I could probably write a basic Android application that works how it should. I'm pretty confident in my ability figure out how to use a majority of the more common libraries (Butterknife etc). I understand how Android deals with memory management in different states etc. I've learned a lot outside of class and while I'm not amazing, I'm a better programmer than a lot of the CS students at my school (which is not saying a whole lot).



**Weaknesses:**

* School doesn't offer an algorithms course, and I'm only 1/3 of the way through the Stanford Coursera course
* Major GPA of 3.2, Cumulative GPA 3.1 (school is not terrible, but not amazing either. CS program here is not amazing)
* No great projects or internship contributions to show off. The other internships I did were teaching CS to kids, and an IT position I took because I only had a few weeks of the summer to work (was studying abroad).
* Interviewed at Guidewire and Addepar in NYC/SF, didn't make it past their first round interview, but was able to solve the problems with a little help. However, these weren't Android positions, they were just systems development and data engineering interviews. (got in thru alumni connections)



Would I be wasting my time looking for positions now? I feel like I could be more confident in my abilities by the end of summer. Should I be spending all of my time learning, or looking for jobs? Should I do both? What can I expect?

Thanks!!"
4i29um,0,2016-05-05,"Junior in College Interning about to make A LOT of money. How can I best manage it, what can I except with such a large income, wisdom?",Infamise,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4i29um/junior_in_college_interning_about_to_make_a_lot/,"Hello /r/personalfinance, I appreciate all the work this community does. This is my first post on this subreddit. I will give a short background of myself and then ask the pertinent questions I can think of.

I am junior in college and 21 years of age about to intern this summer at one of ""The Big 4"" consulting firms. I am majoring in the Computer Network Security Field so my internship will be related to that to some capacity.

I went to community college for 2 years, earned my Associate's degree and transferred all my credits to a 4 year University to obtain my Bachelor's degree titled ""Network Engineering and Security."" I worked at a grocery store while at community college and in total I worked there for about 4.5 years. It was my first job. For my last year working there I managed to make $10 an hour and started at $8.25. I probably averaged 20 hours a week during my time working there. More during the summer and less during school.

I come for an upper-middle class family. I have never paid for school. I currently live an in an apartment for school and only pay the gas bill. I currently do not have to pay for school but will pay off my college student loans. The most money I've ever had in my bank account was around 5k. I have never formally budgeted my money. I never blew it all away, always kept a somewhat decent amount but did spend it quite a bit since I had no debts to pay (for the most part).

I don't have a great value on money and I have very little budgeting skills. I do not worry about money often (because I've never been in debt and have my parents financial support). It is only recently I started to become concerned with money as I am finally running out from the funds made from my past job. It has been a good wake up call.

At my new internship I am going to make $38.00 an hour for 40 hours a week. There is also a good chance that I will get hired here full time after I graduate. I have little conception of how much money this really is. I am hoping to be as responsible as possible with this money and am hoping to have an idea how to manage it before I begin the internship. I am not worried about spending all of the money made.

Now for my questions and concerns regarding this situation....

- As mentioned I have never formally budgeted my money. I also do not check my accounts as often as I'd like and tend to avoid them till I need to pay the bills. Because of this I have overdrawn from my checking account about 3 times. I have one credit card, a debit card, a checking and savings account. I have never missed a credit card payment. I am looking for a way to budget my money. My idea now is to buy YNAB (You Need a Budget). I have been told about Mint, however, to be more cognizant of my spending I like the idea of typing in all of my purchases instead of looking at an automatic record keeping of it. I also do not like the possible negative security vulnerabilities in regards to using Mint.

- Should I get a separate savings account that I designate as a ""non use"" account that I stash 10% of each check into?

- Should I use a budgeting app like YNAB? Is there any other methods that are useful? Is writing down a budget helpful and good practice? Or would an app suffice?

- How often should I check my bank and credit card accounts? On average currently I check about once to twice a month.

- Should I keep a paper copy of all my money deposited into my account every time of payment? Is there anything else I should keep paper or at least digital copies of?

- Is there any mental changes I could possibly expect when I am earning this much money? (I am trying to remain as humble as I can. I have only told a few close friends how much I will be making and my parents and sister.)

- Should I consider any type of investing? Or should I just save as much as possible?

- Should I budget how much I spend on groceries and other frequently reoccurring purchases? Should I budget how much I spend/go out to restaurants not on the company dime?

- Should I obtain a second credit card anytime soon? I currently have discover.

- Is there any wisdom you can give a 21 year old that you wish you would have known at this age?

- Also random side question. I want to hook up Paypal to a checking account to transfer money on paypal to my savings. I have read on /r/personalfinance to make a separate checking account only to be used with Paypal as to avoid any possibility of Paypal taking all my money due to a stupid occurrence based off Paypal's model and business practices. (Lots of people on /r/personalfinance seem to really dislike Paypal.)

Thank you so much in advance for all of your help.
Peace.

Help me settle a debate between my brother and I. My brother will be graduating from college in December. This summer he has an internship where he'll get paid around $7000 (he'll save this), and if it goes well they will offer him a job when he graduates. If he is offered this job, it will be located about 30min from our mother's house. He says that he will live at her house for about 6 months until he can save up some money (he has none currently) and then he will find an apartment closer to his job. He's already looked at apartments and says he can afford an $800 1bdrm apartment. Not sure what his salary would be. His sole reasoning is that he does not want to have to commute an hour each day and would rather find a place closer. I say he should live at home for a longer period than 6 months for several reasons: 1) To save up more money 2) My mom lives in the city and since he is young it's better to live closer to where his friends are and where all the bars/restaurants are. 3) People commute for much longer in order to save money elsewhere. He's never had to pay for anything up until this point. Our mom pays for everything (rent, utilities, food, etc.). I think he is underestimating how much it will cost to live on his own and, even if he could afford it, I think it's much smarter to live with our mom for longer than 6months so he can save money. "
4i2eg1,7,2016-05-05,i [20f] feel like my partner [27m] is from another generation. we have known each other for a year and have been seeing each other for ~1 month.,16electionthrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4i2eg1/i_20f_feel_like_my_partner_27m_is_from_another/,"hi everyone! i am a 20 y/o college student and my partner is a 27 y/o investor who has a very demanding job.

below is some context on how we know each other. it's long and convoluted, so **skip to below if you just want to know the bulk of our issues.**

i met him last summer when i interned at a company in the west coast (i go to school in the east coast). he was interested in a relationship, but i was hesitant since my school isn’t local, he is much older/at a different stage in life, and we had only known each other for a short time (~1.5 months). but with a lot of persuasion and promises to see me, i agreed. i felt an intensity of passion around him that i had never experienced with anyone else, and i believed he was genuine in his intent.

shortly after school started, he talked to me less and less. our text conversations were never that great, and we went from small, meaningless conversations every other day to every other week. the rare times we did talk (on the phone), he constantly reassured me that he really did like me, but i couldn’t understand how you can like someone and not interact for weeks. just a few texts here and there would have been enough. our infrequent interactions became mostly me complaining about our lack of communication, and he eventually completely ghosted on me. he didn’t communicate what happened — he just disappeared. we had never met up after i left the west coast, obviously.

it was very hurtful, because i didn’t know if i had been manipulated or not. if he did like me, why didn’t he keep me in the loop when i’ve complained time and time again how much it pained me? if he didn’t like me, what did he gain by toying with my emotions and why did he do it? i went back and forth, believing he was into me then not, and it caused me a lot of suffering. eventually, though, i buried my feelings for him. 

after some months of no interaction, he texted me out of the blue in january and asked to meet up because he was in the area. curious and confused, i agreed (much to the chagrin of my peers). he apologized, explaining that what he did was awful and unjustified, but his work was becoming more and more hectic and he didn’t know what to say to me. basically (from what i interpreted), he knew he was upsetting me with his behavior and that he was getting busier, so he ignored our problems out of fear that he would lose me if he told me he had no time for us. he then asked if i was still interested in a relationship with him. **edit: he was seeing a woman a little before this time, as outlined in the [post update.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4i9dev/i_20f_discovered_that_i_may_be_a_mistress_to_my/) he neglected to mention this, attributing his disappearance solely to work.**

i thought that was ridiculous and i was very cold to him in person. after his visit and apology, though, my feelings were slowly dug up from the graveyard. i wanted to ask him how a relationship now would be different than last time, how he would dedicate time to me, etc. i sent him sentimental texts in hopes of gauging whether he was really genuine, since i was under the impression he wanted to meet me hoping for a quick fuck (we didn’t do anything). he didn’t answer most of my messages and, once again, completely ghosted on me.

he had caused me enough pain, so i blocked him from my life in every way. lo and behold, march rolls around and he contacts me again. i felt like i was finally over him, so i didn’t mind talking to him (my friends, again, thought it was an incredibly dumb thing of me to do to let him back in my life). i was planning on returning to the west coast for my internship, and he suggested we reconnect.

i was reluctant to the idea, but as we texted each other more, he promised me he would keep up with me this time. he messaged me very often, actually kept up a conversation, and flirted with me. thinking he might have changed, i agreed to see him and things quickly became sexual again.

i haven’t seen him in almost three weeks recently because he is abroad. our texts have become dead again, with me doing most of the talking and him just barely acknowledging what i said.

okay, so now for my concerns! **start reading here if you skipped the background.**

he and i are really different, practically polar opposites. he is unfamiliar with the millennial mindset (despite technically being one). i’m a token millennial — tech-savvy and connected (he hates social media), open-minded (he can be really judgmental), and aimless with my goals/unsure what i want to do (he’s in a field he absolutely loves, has been in it since he was a child, and is incredibly career-driven). he often interprets my whimsical/playful nature very literally, coming across as overly serious, and he isn't entertained by my humor. 


additionally, he respects pragmatism above all else, seeing (my) idealism and naivete as foolish and downright stupid. he has called me crazy when i had an emotional outburst. he sees confiding in others, being open about your feelings, etc. (all things i do) as weakness/vulnerability (he will think my posting on reddit about our relationship is ridiculous). his upbringing is also very different from mine: i had a lot of issues growing up and harbor some mental illnesses, while he had no issues (at least, so he says).


i have always been tolerant towards our differences, and try my best to improve, so it’s very hurtful to me when it isn't reciprocated. he has said very judgmental things before and admitted he lost respect for me because of my thought process. he said things like, “you go to a great school and you really think that?” “you sound just like a hippie pothead” “are you really that naive?” etc. i understand if he disagrees with my viewpoint, but the way he frames things can be so biting and aggressive. i feel like i am not being accepted for who i am, and instead, being debased as a person. i don't think he does it intentionally, but i am sensitive and get hurt anyway. i feel insecure and hesitant to share more about myself. it stresses me out because i wonder why he even hangs around me if there's so much about my personality that doesn’t align with his. 


he probably thought i was much more mature than i am, seeing as he matured at a young age, but, in reality, i am still young and naive. the vibe most people get from me is cute and playful, but he exclusively says i’m sexy, never cute. i feel like a lot of my charm comes from my innocence and inexperience, but he doesn’t seem to value that. 


i get the impression that, since he doesn’t really respect my viewpoints all the time, he’s just after my body. to me, sex comes after intimacy. i must be comfortable and know i am cared for, or i will feel like i'm being used/just lusted after. given the hectic nature of his job, he can't sustain long conversations over text, so we don’t talk much if at all. when we do talk, he is very aggressive about how much he desires me, but he isn't affectionate. he rarely uses terms of endearment, never reciprocates when i am loving towards him, etc. i wonder if he even likes when i am affectionate towards him or if he thinks it's gross/unnecessary/disingenuous/petty. 


also, texting and staying in contact is incredibly important to me since we're apart so much and since i communicate via text a lot. i flirt over text as well and actually need it for continued interest, but he doesn't do it/is awful at it. he is very direct with what he wants, but i need some some back-and-forth playfulness. he blatantly asks for photos and puts in no effort into creating a mood (which is required to turn me on). i get that he doesn't like texting and barely has time, but he comes across as just lust-driven a lot of the times.


i've come to the acceptance that he is a lame texter and that i have to be complacent with us rarely interacting. i won't get my idea of affection (talking to your SO all the time about big and small things, using pet names, sending/receiving good morning and night texts, flowers, cards, etc.) i know he does care, because he has cancelled meetings to talk to me on the phone, worked around his schedule to make time for me, given me his undivided attention when we're together, etc. i know he is very busy and doesn't have time for anything he doesn't want in his life, so him investing time in me is already an affectionate thing to do. however, i seek a deeper connection, and right now i don't think we have that. i am uncomfortable with having sex unless there's a genuine bond.


i have heard the perspective that some people have sex to become intimate. i think he very much fits into that group. he is very impulsive with sex and expressing his desires in general, even suggesting that i take time off from school and move in with him. i find it strange he can be so invested in me, want a relationship, and possibly even to live together when our personalities clash. it's like he wants the physical perks without the emotional investment on his end.

i feel the need to tell him these things a lot, but, like i said, we barely talk. i don’t want to adulterate our limited phone conversations with complaints. we don’t see each other often enough in person, and when we do, my issues often melt because we have great chemistry.

i can't have my emotions fester inside, though, so i end up sending him barrages of texts that he finds extremely off-putting. he has said that when i do that it pushes him away and it sounds like i am attacking him. i never want to make him upset, but writing things out is the best way to organize my thoughts and maybe the only way to get my point across. he doesn’t like texting and can’t adequately respond, though, so i don’t know what i should do about this.

am i unreasonable for wanting him to be more affectionate? i know it's probably hard for him to be as expressive with emotions as i am. but since he's not emotive, i can't tell if he likes me for me or for my body. he admitted he was definitely more physically into me than emotionally. maybe he hasn't opened himself up with me yet? regardless, our current dynamic makes me a bit uncomfortable.

am i compromising too much of what i want for this? he texted me a lot before we got back together, and now our conversations suck again. part of me feels like he's taking me for granted and doesn't feel a need to talk to me, while the other part thinks i'm being unreasonable for expecting him to constantly give me attention when he's so busy. he doesn't give the affection i want and we barely see each other, but we are really invested in each other.

i want to be more understanding and patient with him. i think it would help if i understood what life was like with a really hectic job, but i don't have that experience. additionally, i want him to be more understanding towards me, but he had a different upbringing. how can we reach common ground? are we just doomed because of our differences? 

PS. if you’re into the mbti and if you think it’ll provide context, i am INFP he is ENTJ/ESTP. he thinks the mbti is useless, so i roughly typed him myself.

**tl;dr: i am basically an overgrown child and my partner is a cold, judgmental, domineering father from an older generation. how do we bridge the gap?**

edit: to those who ask why i bother with him, i just... really like him. maybe that's just me being naive, but i always want to try to work things out if possible, because i don't get in a relationship unless i see something long-term. we both really like each other, and i have no complaints when we are in person. it's really just when we're apart, which is most of the time.

4i2lkt,2,2016-05-05,[seeking] Desperately seeking a mentor in JavaScript to help me get out of my funk.,jcupples,mentors,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentors/comments/4i2lkt/seeking_desperately_seeking_a_mentor_in/,"I've just graduated with a B.S. in IT with a supposed emphasis on programming and databases. Unfortunately, the core curriculum was next to nothing in the department of programming languages. All that was ""taught"", and I use this term lightly, was basic syntax.  The only thing I got any use out of was my web design courses where I built a site in ASP.NET with pure HTML/CSS and a bit of SQL. Professor was impressed with me coming in knowing nothing and building what I did. In fact, he was the only professor who actually acted like, and truly did, give a damn. A lot of other students hated him but he and I clicked. We even met a couple times outside of class to discuss my path and what I should be doing. Unfortunately, that's the extent of what I got out of my education. All other professors were either incompetent or just didn't give a shit about the students, and the higher ups weren't any help, either. It was bullshit and I'm still bitter about it, but I'm also beyond glad to be done.

Anyway, ever since I graduated in March I've been trying to figure out what I truly would like to do. I had a bit of an affinity with C# so I figured I'd do that. Things have changed and i've finally settled on JavaScript, web development and most probably the MEAN stack per a friends suggestion. Looks interesting and cutting edge, which is where I want to be.

After on and off self study outside the classroom, i've been busting ass nearly full time self-teaching myself for the past two months for probably 3-8 hours a day. I will say that despite how bullshit the curriculum was for my degree, I was able to understand things like if/else, loops and some array stuff, among other really basic stuff. So previous knowledge that I did pick up from school gave me a LITTLE bit of an upper hand. While I was still in school I would use Bob Tabor's C# tutorials, but I didn't put any serious effort into learning it like I should have. I wasted so much damn time on bitching and complaining about my education when I should have been taking it into my own hands saying ""Screw em, I'll learn on my own"". I screwed up and am currently paying for that mistake.

Ever since I graduated I've been using resources like FreeCodeCamp, Hackerrank and I am currently taking a paid Udemy course on JavaScript and that's been a tremendous help despite having difficulty understanding the more advanced concepts (my latest hangups are closures, call(), apply() and bind()).

My problem is that I don't know how or *how* (I put how twice on purpose) to apply my knowledge or even explain to anyone why I think I feel this way. It's very difficult to convey what I mean by that statement.

I have an insatiable appetite for learning this shit, but I've just been so discouraged lately because I feel I've hit a brick wall that I can't break through no matter how much I try. I'm not even fully sure how to explain why I think it's a brick wall. The frustration I feel from this block is palpable.

My previously mentioned friend has guaranteed an interview with the company he works at, but I know if I go in with what I know now, I won't be able to answer some of the technical questions. I had an interview this week for an internship that was an absolute disaster. 

TL;DR/Bottom line: I know how to play with data structures to an extent in the form of if/else, arrays, loops, etc but no idea how to move beyond that without tearing my hair out and wanting to give up completely. I genuinely feel like a mentor would give me the direction and boost I so desperately need in order to crawl out of this hole I've fallen into. 

I apologize for being long winded but I hope I've been clear in how I feel and where I am on my path. Thanks for reading.

Edit: Even if no one is willing to volunteer time to some rando on the internet, I'm willing to take any and all advice/suggestions from those who have been in a similar situation. Or anyone in general, really. I'm desperate."

It is their understanding that I don't know any python, and they are fine with that.

Instead of sitting back and waiting, I've started learning. I've read some docs, played with some code, and did googles python class with the activities. I've also used the built in unittest module a bit--still have more work to do here, and looked at other testing frameworks like nose and py.test.

What else should I do to prepare myself? I've watched several python talks hosted by google on youtube to get a feel for the python way of doing things, but am looking for insight on what else I should take a look at before my first day.

I am a 3rd year Computer Science student and am going to be interning for a big company here starting in late May. I am super excited, but also kind of nervous about it. I met my supervisor last month and he has been emailing me about some of what I will be doing over the course of the summer months.

Here's one of them: 

John,
I wanted to connect with you and let you know we are excited to have you join us this summer for an internship.  We are working through project assignments and activities and have aligned you with my team.  I lead our integration team for SAP which includes cross-functional SAP efforts, escalation and problem management, IT process and metrics, and working with our business partners and super users. We have a lot going on and are glad to have you join us this summer. 

Best regards,

My supervisor



Now my problem is this... I have not worked with SAP at all. In fact, I have rarely heard of it before he emailed me and I did a few google searches. However, I feel like I have learned a lot from the many classes I have taken at my University. 

Classes taken:

Java I            Operating Systems       Database Management Systems       Discrete Math for Computing
Java II           Networking I                VBA Programming in Excel              Data Structures with Python
Java III          Networking II               Computer Assembler/Architecture    Calculus I and II


As you can see I have taken no SAP classes. I have checked out a few books from the university library that are introductions to SAP, but from what I have seen it is a very broad broad field. I am not too worried because I informed my supervisor I have had no experience with SAP. He said that's perfectly fine and that the first week or two is training anyway. 

I am a good student with a good GPA and am a hard worker. Does anyone have any advice for me in what I can further do to get prepared for my first REAL job? Mowing lawns and laying concrete the past 3 summers don't count in the Computer world I'd assume :P I'm thinking some of the SQL statements and concepts used in my Database class will be useful? Any experts out there in SAP or Computer Science field with some experience that could help a young student out? Also any other advice on anything is great!

#Questions

* Are there any other sections / pieces of information that I should include?
* Is my language too formal / not formal enough?
* When submitting, should I send it in .doc format or .pdf format? I've heard that .pdf is better.
* I've read online that a cover letter should be a separate document. Would you agree with that? (Do you have any tips for what I should include in my cover letter?)
* If I send my resume to a company, what should I be looking for? As a current high schooler (with my credentials), what should I set my bar at? Unpaid internship? Paid internship? Job?
* Is there any other advice you would give me given the circumstances that I am in?

Thank you for reading and/or helping me out! I really appreciate it!

I am considering majoring in CS but I haven't decided yet. 

I have little programming experience aside from the fact that I have taken two programming classes in high school (Advanced computer math and AP computer science). These classes covered only basic java programming (Arrays, Arraylist, Greenfoot, processing, PracticeIt). I didn't completely suck but I don't feel like I excelled in these classes either. I don't think these two classes alone are a fair representation of the CS as a whole, and I would like more exposure to the field to see if it is right for me. 

I have a whole summer before college that I plan to be productive in. I have a job to earn some money and save up for a laptop. I plan to start reading and exercising. I'd love to add CS to this list if possible! 

What advice do some of you CS veterans out there have for an upcoming college freshman? What is there that I can do over the summer to expose me to CS and maybe help me become a better programmer overall? Perhaps i could get a jump start on college and teach myself some programming? I feel like only good things can come from this because if I find that I don't like programming very much then I'll know before I even get into college that CS is NOT right for me. 

Is there anyway I could get an internship or something similar with little to no real programming experience? If not, what paths should I take to ensure that when 2017 rolls around I'll have much more experience under my belt? 

Any forums or communities I could join? Events I should check out? Anything would beat sitting at home during summer and twiddling my thumbs! 

I greatly appreciate your help reddit! Any general ideas/advice are greatly appreciated! "

I walked by this new hip ramen restaurant and figured now was the best time to try and get one seat at the bar.  After 10 minutes, I was seated in within a minute, I see this petite hot Asian women walk towards me.  I took a double take and realized it was an intern that worked at my old firm, Sara.  She was wearing tight blue pants and semi sheer white blouse with a blue bra underneath.  She was incredibly hot with the outfit and makeup.  When Sara worked at my firm, she seemed mousey and always had very conservative and bulky sweaters on.
As I spun on my stool to greet her, she came over and said hi and gave me a hug.  She was there with two other friends who seemed disinterested in her conversing with me.  I explained how I was no longer at the firm due to it being bought by one of our competitors and I was paid to leave with a non compete.  I instead bought a house, my long term girlfriend broke up with me, and started a consulting firm where I funnel clients to my former firm…..all was good.  Sara was finishing her senior year and continuing on at the same school for a graduate program.  She asked if I wanted to join her and her friends, but their disdain led me to say no.
As I waited for my check, I saw Sara and her friends leave and she waved.  I paid and left and headed to my car around the corner and saw Sara standing at the bus stop.  I asked her why she was waiting for a bus just off campus.  She went on to explain that her friends wanted to go trolling at frat row and she wasn’t up for it and was going to head home.  She was housesitting for a professor in the hills and was waiting for the bus.  I asked her if she would like a ride, and she declined.  I said “it was nice to see her” and began to walk away, she changed her mind and decided to take me up on my offer.
After a 10 minute ride into the hills above the campus and some catching up, we reached the house.  Sara invited me in to check out the view.  I figured I had no other place to go, so I accepted.  The view was amazing.  It overlooked the campus and the whole town.  She offered me a drink and took me on a tour of the rest of the house.  A few minutes later I found myself on the deck of the master bedroom holding my drink.  I took a sip and it was straight rocket fuel.  She apologized and offered to get me some more tonic.  I took a big sip to make room for the tonic and handed her the glass.
As I was watching out over the town, I heard her approaching me.  I turned to grab the drink and saw that she was no longer wearing most of her clothes.  Sara placed the drink on a table and continued walking towards me.  She was wearing blue panties and her blouse which was fully unbuttoned.  Her firm little breast and erect nipple held the fitted shirt in place.  Just as I was opening my mouth to say something, she placed her finger on my lips and shushed me and told me to relax.  Her hand slid down my arms and placed them on the railing.  Then she traced her fingers over my chest and worked the down to my pants.  She navigated the belt buckle and buttons rather quickly and my pant dropped to the deck with a thud of my cell phone and keys.
I watched her lower down and grab the base of my boxers.  As soon as she pulled them down to my knees, my cock sprang out and greeted her face to face.  Her petite hand gripped and began gently pumping my cock.  She looked up at me as her lips met the tip of my cock.  I watched as it disappeared into her mouth and then she shut her eyes and began to rhythmically pump and suck my cock.  After about a minute she looked up at me and told me that she wanted to make me cum.  Then she started working on the shaft and my balls, then quickly went back to slurping and pumping my cock in her mouth.
She then stopped and looked up me and suggested that we go inside.  She closed the doors behind he and walked towards me and leaned in for a sloppy wet kiss.  Sara the gave me a gentle shove onto the bed and climbed on top of me.  My cock was pressed against her pussy with only her soaked panties separating them.  She began to grind on my cock like we were in high school.  I lowered my head to her firm breasts and began nibbling on her nipples which increased her moaning.  She was intent on keeping control of the situation.
I began to slide her blouse down her arms when her wrists got caught in the cuffs.  Instead of taking my time and unbuttoning her cuffs, I decided to take control.  I tugged to tighten and twisted the blouse to bring her arms behind her. I slid my hand down the back of her panties and palmed her ass and began to apply pressure to her grinding motion.  Sara began to moan louder and quicken the pace.  Within a minute her breathing quickened and she let out a squealish moan and her crotch got soaked. 
She planted me with a big kiss between her panting and asked me to untie her.  I gave her another kiss and picked her up and laid her on her back on the edge of the bed.  I placed my finger on her lips and shushed her and told her to relax.  A worked my way down to her soaked panites and hooked my fingers around them at her hips and pulled them off.  Sara assisted by lifting her legs then spreading them when her panties were fully removed.  Her tight little slit glistened on the edge of the bed.  I lowered my head and began eating her out.  I concentrated on her clit and flicked the base of her slit with my finger.  Never pushing it inside of her, just teasing her.  Moments later, her breathing quickened and the moaning start, and again she squealed and moaned to organsm. 
She asked if I was going to untie her yet.  I flipped her over on her stomach without saying a word and picked up her hips until she was able to get her knees on the edge of the bed.  I began to untwist her blouse and couldn’t resist teasing her pussy with my finger.  I gently slid up and down her slit.  Sara rocked back at the perfect time and I watched my finger bury itself inside of her tight pussy.  I was just about to unsnap her cuff button when I decided to give her two fingers and again she rocked back and forth with my fingers going in and out of her.  I took my left and and began to work the button as I guided the tip of my cock up her slit with my right.  She began to rock back and I watched the tip of my cock disappear in her tight slit.  Her breathing tightened as she realized that it wasn’t my finder and she began to moan.   As soon as I unbuttoned her cuff, I placed my hands on her hips and began to press my cock inside of her.  With her arms free, she braced herself as I thrusted in and out of her tight swollen pussy.
I pulled out and turned her over.  Sara moved back to the center of the bed and spread her legs, inviting me to continue.  I climbed on top of her and slid back inside her and continued thrusting in and out of her.  She wrapped her arms and legs around me began to moan, which progressively got louder and louder followed by a loud “yes!”.  She had just soaked the bedspread.  I rolled over without ever pulling out and she began grinding on my cock.  Sara told me not to cum inside of her and as soon as that was said, I could feel my cock was ready to explode.  I pushed her off my cock in mid thrust and she maneuvered her head over my cock and began to pump it.  The first spurt hit her in the face and after the second she lowered her head and began suck the rest out.  She was intent on cleaning up the cum that had flowed all over my cock. 
After a while of dozing off, I decided to leave and Sara walked me to the door and told me to keep in touch.  I gave her my phone and she dialed her number.  It was definitely one that I wouldn’t be erasing."

* Is my language too formal / not formal enough?
* When submitting, should I send it in .doc format or .pdf format? I've heard that .pdf is better.
* I've read online that a cover letter should be a separate document. Would you agree with that? (Do you have any tips for what I should include in my cover letter?)
* If I send my resume to a company, what should I be looking for? As a current high schooler (with my credentials), what should I set my bar at? Unpaid internship? Paid internship? Job?
* Is there any other advice you would give me given the circumstances that I am in?

Thank you for reading and/or helping me out! I really appreciate it!

4i388j,32,2016-05-05,My boss [50sF] hired me [24F] knowing I didn't have experience. I was fired for not having experience.,woeispea,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4i388j/my_boss_50sf_hired_me_24f_knowing_i_didnt_have/,"I'll try to explain this as clearly as possible, though it might be hard because my mind is seriously scattered right now.

Background information:  I graduated with my Bachelor of Fine Arts degree a few months ago.  I have been suffering with mental disorders since high school. Anxiety disorder, depression, OCD, eating disorder.  My early years were very hard and continued to be hard until I sought help for my eating disorder November 2014.  Since then, I was able to maintain a healthy two year relationship, graduate college and find a job in my field. It should also be noted that I live in what can be considered the biggest art capital of the world.  



On to the problem...

After graduating college, I started the dreaded job search.  I was looking for an entry level position in a gallery.  I was able to get galleries to show my work, but it was difficult to find interviews because of my lack of experience. Considering the location, it was extremely competitive and took a very long time to find anyone to even have me come in to talk.  I graduated from a school that is highly regarded and everyone told me that it would stand out.

After months of sending out my resume and going on interviews, I finally found a place that would hire me.  I'll be honest, it was definitely not my first choice.  It was a completely different form of art that I am not familiar with, however I see beauty in everything and considered this a great opportunity and a way to attain experience.  I was told I would be paid salary (that was much higher than other galleries), paid vacation, health insurance, the whole deal.  I was so happy that I was able to find something so good for my first real job out of college! 

The gallery director seemed nice and she told me she has no problem that I don't have experience and that she has helped others by ""hand-holding"" (her words).  She was very adamant in finding out how serious I am about the job.  She made me come in for a trial day and I later had to write her an email explaining how much I want the job, how I am serious (considering my previous jobs were hands-on studio art positions), and how I wanted to make this a long-term career, (something she said was necessary during the interview).

I got the job and started working the following week.  My first day, I was trained by the intern [20s F].  The director was not in all day so I was unable to talk ask her all the questions I had planned.  I wanted to find out my salary, information about health insurance, what forms I needed to fill out... etc.  We ended up talking a few days later about those topics, though I still was not given any forms or packets with information.  I continued working because I was afraid to speak up.

Fast forward a bit... I am more comfortable in the office and I know my way around a little better.  Last week we were preparing for an exhibition where the artist designed pieces specifically for our gallery.  On the day of the event, a new girl [20sF] showed up.  I was told she was hired to work that day for the event.  We got to talking and I found out she just moved here from Paris to find a job at a gallery.  She also explained how she worked in previous galleries and how she knew some people at this event. Spoiler: she takes my job.

This past Tuesday, the director came to me 30 minutes before I was supposed to leave and said we needed to talk.  She started by saying how everyone in the gallery loves me and appreciates having me there, however, French girl has much more experience than me.  French girl worked in many galleries.  French girl used to work with an airline service. French girl speaks French.  French girl has more experience and for this position, I need someone with experience.

Although I was floored, I had a feeling something bad was going to happen when this girl showed up.  I had no idea what to say.  My brain was not connecting to my mouth and I could only say ""ok."" and then asked if there was a part time position because I wanted to salvage whatever I could... to which she said, ""of course! I need someone to organize my own personal files at my apartment."" (rage)

That night I was a wreck.  When I went to work my eyes were noticeably puffy, but I forced myself to go anyway.  Things have gotten significantly worse.  I am given meaningless tasks, such as picking up her dry cleaning or returning her shoes.  It is incredibly disrespectful.

I also realized today that she was, in fact, not paying me in salary as she initially stated.  She was instead paying me hourly (minimum wage, none the less) and I did not get paid for the one day I had to take off when she promised paid vacation days.

Anyway, I'm posting here because I want some insight into what I should do next.  I am getting so much conflicting advice, I don't know what to do.  My boyfriend is very adamant that I say something and stand up for myself.  He says that I should just go in tomorrow, get my paycheck and leave.  My mother, on the other side says that I need to stick it out and get on her good side so I can have a recommendation.  She says that it's extremely necessary that I have a recommendation considering how hard it is to get a job in this field.

I am so stressed and sad, I really don't want to go back, but I also don't want to ruin my future career if I get in a bad situation with my current employer.  I want to stand up for myself, but my anxiety literally makes me unable to form words.  I can make up a million excuses, but in the end I'm still jobless and screwed over.


TL;DR My boss [50sF] is firing me [24F] for not having experience, even though she hired me knowing this information.  Should I continue my last two weeks and continue part time or should I stop going all together and look for a new job?

4i3j4a,0,2016-05-05,Should I do a masters? Where? (CS),good_eugooglies,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4i3j4a/should_i_do_a_masters_where_cs/,"I unexpectedly did better than I thought (I thought I would legitimately fail 3 of my classes) so I think I stand a decent chance at a masters if I don't fuck the next 2 semesters up (3.9 GPA, Sophomore, listed as an author on a conference paper). I intend on using this summer to prepare for the GRE and better internships for next spring and/or summer. I want to focus my goals as early as possible and be realistic.  

I'm in CS, and I don't go to a well ranked school - I'd like to get a ML/CV/NLP or related masters at a decently regarded school (UNC and Duke on the low end, Columbia, Penn, Harvard, CMU, Stanford for the reach), but I don't know what tier I should be aiming at. I should be clear that a significant portion of my interest in doing a masters is because I would really like a better school on my resume, and because the fields I'm interested in aren't studied at my current university. 

Additionally, I'm not sure what part of my application I should focus on - is it reasonable to focus on research instead of more relevant Statistics or Pure Math courses? I'd like to get a first-author paper published before I start applying. Additionally, are coursework masters worth it? I'm confident I can secure interviews at at least 4-5 of the companies I can work at (Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft) but doubt I can at the up-and-coming ones (Airbnb, Dropbox, Uber) that could have a bigger payout. 

My research mentor is more favorable to the PhD route, but I'm not sure if that's for me. I'd be taking out loans so cost isn't much of an issue, but I'd like to work for Google/Facebook/Uber/$Hot_PreIPO$ when I graduate.

I was accepted into a research program for my school this summer.

Next summer I do plan on getting an internship from a local company, but I am hoping that the research and a standard internship will be enough to put me ahead of other applicants.

I had a part-time tutoring position until January, where I was hired as a paid part-time intern at a tech company.

I thought this was my first real position doing what I loved: web dev.  I was underpaid and now that it has ended, I don't have anything waiting for me.  I at least have a good reference but that hasn't helped me so far.

I updated all online profiles and added projects to my GitHub and every small or startup company I apply to has either rejected me or not even bothered to respond.

I live in a small midwestern city and the opportunities for an entry-level web developer are dwindling.  As I get more and more rejection e-mails, without an interview, I find that I am slowly losing my mind and cannot sleep.

This has been going on for a month.  I am not writing this to beg /webdev/ for a job, but to instead ask if I should either keep learning and updating projects on my GitHub full time or if I should get a part time position (tutoring or something more embarrassing) to at least help my dwindling savings."
4i3x89,10,2016-05-06,*Advice* Should I Leave my Church?,True_Whit,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/4i3x89/advice_should_i_leave_my_church/,"Hey folks, I'm unsure where to proceed.
In my first year of university, after developing an interest in Orthodoxy following my initial connection to Christ through evangelical Pentecostalism, I joined an Anglican Church near my University. I feel add though I grew so much there spiritually, and it had an incredible impact on my faith. While they used Anglican liturgy, the music they employed was more evangelical, (which appealed to me) and the Church was incredibly accepting. I feel as though last year I grew leaps and bounds with my faith.

This year, I really feel as though I've stalled. While I began the year by getting baptized I don't feel as though I was given much to explore so I could grow in my faith beyond Sunday services. The Young Adults group seemed unconcerned with real discipleship and building on what we knew. Being an ""accepting"" Church, I feel like certain ideas and ways at looking at God that are not in line with a Christian theological understanding (i.e. pantheism) could be talked about and not condemned or even challenged for the sake of openness. I feel as though the real importance of living through Christ and building that relationship was neglected, when I needed that time to have someone willing to invest in discipling me, in expanding my knowledge of the Bible, and incorporating Him into my week beyond Sundays.

I've made so many connections there. I'm now chairing our Parish council and I finished our student Internship program where I did work with those experiencing homelessness in the community drop-in centre located in our basement. In addition to getting baptized I thought that this would be the place that I would get married in with my partner, and the place where our children would potentially grow up. Now I'm unsure if this is a place where I'm going to be able to grow spiritually in the way God wants me to.

I'm scared of leaving. I'm scared of turning my back on a community that loves me so much, and one that I love in return. I'm scared of turning my back on a pastor who has been an incredible spiritual mentor and guide to me. I'm also aware of the fact that our young adult and music pastor is moving on soon and that things could radically change in our church, potentially for the better, potentially for the worse.

I've also been visiting an Anglo-Catholic church during weekdays which has really sparked my interest. 

I'm unsure what to do reddit. Could you please pray for me and please give me advice?"

4i3yso,2,2016-05-06,I'm (21/f) upset that my SO (21/M) seems to forget about me,driedflowers2,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4i3yso/im_21f_upset_that_my_so_21m_seems_to_forget_about/,"Long time lurker, first time poster, and on a throwaway. 

My SO (M21) and I (F21) have been dating for about eleven months now. We met online and did the LDR for a couple of months, until I moved to his city to go to school. He wanted me to stop dating other people and be exclusive, and until that happened he didn’t want to talk (first red flag but I liked how much he seemed to care). Sense I was living in a distant city he checked out a house for me and I signed the lease trusting his word, it was crap and I found out months later that he chose this house because it was close to his (second red flag). When moving in I did not answer my phone for at least three hours while I scrubbed the bathtub and such, turns out he walked to my new house to make sure I was okay and when he saw lights on he left (third red flag but I though this sort of thing was sweet). The next day he comes when while my family was here to visit and brought flowers which was great.

He pretty much lived with me for that summer and fall semester, which I liked most of the time. The only major problems were that we wouldn’t have enough sex for my taste, and he would get very cold and moody when stressed (which was often). Additionally he asked that when I go out that I text when I get places, I shut that down because I like privacy and it is a hassle, we settled that I would just text him when I got home. On the bright side of things he is very sweet in knowing that I need to get out of the house so he usually takes me somewhere so I can see nature or socialize. 
Before we had started dating he had decided that he was going to move 6 hours away for his mandatory internship, he wanted to be able to help his little sister and help support his mom, I thought it was sweet and fully supported him. I was under the impression that sense I have at least a year left of school that he would move back after the internship, I was wrong. He accepted a job close to his family. After about three weeks of not seeing him because he was busy we tried to arrange something over a weekend and he drops a bomb on me that if I came to his city I would have to stay in a hotel because he did not think it was good for his little sister to have me stay the night. I understood I just thought it was weird that after several months he just now decided this. I was also under the impression that he would get his own apartment so that in the future I would be able to stay for longer periods of time but he is now making it seem like he is just going to live with his family for the first year or so. 

After over a month of not seeing each other and being lucky to talk 20 minutes on the phone each night he came to visit for my birthday and to pick up his cap and gown for graduation. He arrived with flowers and a big hug for me which was really great. We had a good time the first day, but the second day he was stressed out for a big test he had to take and he took me to get a pregnancy test sense I had not menstruated in almost 4 months (normal for being on birth control). I convinced him to take a break from studying and go bowling with me. He was pretty much a jerk the whole time, barely said anything to me. The morning he was going to leave he asked to see the gift I had made him for our monthiversary/ graduation/ getting a job. Then, he left.

I remember that his birthday was when we first started dating but I still bought him a pocket watch and baked a cake. Nothing too fancy, but I guess that I kind of expected him to buy or make something for my birthday. Especially sense he got a female friend of his a gift card and another friend a small gift and a cute card. After about a week I confronted him about the lack of a gift. His excuse was that birthdays were never a big deal in his family and that he could have either mailed a gift or he could have come to see me which he thought would be better. 

He drove six hours to see me, took me out to eat, and gave me flowers which is all really sweet. I’m just so frustrated because half the time he was here he in a bad mood. Additionally he gives the other women (his friends, Mom, and sister gifts), and even though I have brought it up multiple times he has not changed his Facebook relationship status or posted pictures of us. The Facebook thing is not not a big deal but makes me feel like he is trying to hide me, because after dating for so long it is still professional to post modest pictures of you and your girlfriend, and to make matters worse he still has pictures of him as a teenager with his ex. He would also stop holding my hand because he saw one of his professors.
 
There is much more to all of this which I’m sure is being left out but I can’t sleep and I just need some advice.

I am a student at a large reputable university in the Midwest. I'm going on almost 6 years attending and while I have been putting in a lot of work the past 2 years here, I screwed up my first 3 years living the college life a little too hard.

My goal is to get some kind of audit internship over the summer or at least for next Spring because firms do recruit heavily at my school. I am not very good at interviewing, but I am fairly intelligent (I think) and I can be outgoing once I get to know people. So what I guess I'm asking is what can I do over the summer to get experience in this field if I don't land an internship? I have applied at Robert Half Staffing but I'm getting pretty down on my prospects so far. I'm 24 years old so I feel like I'm kind of behind the game but I'm ready to work for it.

4i45s5,0,2016-05-06,Accepting a Second Job Offer?,Armadillidiidae,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4i45s5/accepting_a_second_job_offer/,"I wasn't sure where to post this, so I hope its okay to put it in this subreddit.

Recently, I have been searching for summer internships, more specifically, supply chain internships (as that is my college major). I found one opportunity that seems perfect, it would be working for a very large and professional corporation, directly in their supply chain department. It's pays well, and would not be a very far commute. However, due to their size, the process of hiring takes a long time. It has been a total of two months since I first sent my resume in to them. I passed the phone interview, and know that I did very well during the in-person interview. 

Of course, in the meantime I applied to other internships. I interviewed with another, smaller, company for a more general business/ sales position. I wasn't expecting it, but within the same day of my interview, they called back and offered me the position. I missed the call and they left me a message, so I had the chance to call the first company back. I asked how far along they were in the hiring process, since it had been over a week since my interview. They profusely apologized, and said they were still conducting interviews. 
At this point, I felt that it would be unwise to turn down the second company's offer, as there is no guarantee I'll be accepted by the first, and I really do not want to be a cashier for another summer. I've signed forms and gone through drug/ physical screenings for the second company. I'm supposed to begin working there in two weeks. It's by no means a bad opportunity, but there's no denying that the first company's would be best, since it is exactly related to my major. 

I understand that I still don't know if I got the position, but if they happen to call back and offer me it, am I supposed to turn down an ultimately better opportunity because I already accepted another? I would feel like a real sh*tty person to tell company 2 that I quit when I just told them I would work there, but I know it would be better for me to work at company 1. What should I do if get that offer? I feel extremely conflicted about this."
4i490i,71,2016-05-06,I [25F] just started a new job and my employer [50F] doesn't find me valuable,s0ylatte,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4i490i/i_25f_just_started_a_new_job_and_my_employer_50f/,"I could really use some advice right now. I began a new job 3-4 weeks ago as a ""social media / marketing"" person for a small retail company and as we were supposed to have a talk about pay raise (I was on a trial) my employer informed me that she doesn't feel I am making her money thus I am not valuable to her business. Just a note that this is an hourly position.

From the beginning: this employer (Jan) found me through a website that had my resume posted on it. I was really excited because it sounded like a perfect first. She was a small business and really wanted to begin to build her business and I could help her do that.

I immediately began to update all of Jan's social media, since she had no presence as well as update a weekly newsletter to her clientele. I really did not have a lot of guidance from Jan since she personally told me that she just wants me to do it without bothering her. I made sure to have a daily post and to keep customers updated on events a week in advance as this was my usual tactic for updating people.

One thing that began to bother was that the day I immediately started the job, Jan received a called from a former intern (Megan) of hers who was fired from her big job (I'm not sure if it was marketing) after a few months of being there and asked if Jan was hiring. Jan informed her that she just hired me but if it didn't work out, she would let her know.

Well, Megan never went away. She continued to text Jan and offered to work any days that she needed extra help. Jan said she felt bad for her and hired her for a few events. This is where it gets confusing. 

Event 1: Jan asked if it was okay with me if she let Megan work an event with her and invited me to event to attend. I told her I would come support and scope out other vendors for fun. I am technically not a sales person, so I should not be working at events anyway. The next couple days she apparently asked Megan if she took photos at the event. Megan responded, ""Didn't s0ylatte take photos?"" And Jan gave me a long speech  that as her marketing person, I should always be taking photos and updating Facebook with them. I told her I agreed, but felt uncomfortable since I was not paid to be at event and was not working at said event. Should I have taken photos? 

Event 2: Jan informed me that she would like to work on some type of media / marketing kit for us to give to people / businesses she is selling to. I was excited and began working on the project. As the only employee with multiple hats, the kit would take me longer than usual. I began with two opening pages, one about the brand itself and the second about our quality of product as well as our retail program details. Fast forward to a couple days later when Megan (ex-intern) and Jan are working on a show together. Jan informed me that she showed Megan the first page of our kit and Megan replied that ""it wasn't a marketing kit"" at all and I blankly stared and responded that she showed her one page of a package that would be 6-8 pages in total.... Jan said she agreed with Megan and we need to rework ""everything"".

Today's events: After working most of the week alone since Jan had to be at a couple shows, I had a pretty good sense that something was stirring. Jan was in a really strange mood and was being really erratic about my work. She had me send out my 4th newsletter email (we've had over 20 people unsubscribe since the beginning of the week) as well as create a discount flyer for the entire building as a promotion. After I created and printed the flyer, she said ""okay go pass them out"" and went back to her computer. I did as I was told, and at the end of the day when I was about to leave she asked me to sit so we can talk about our plans for the day.

So, now to the TLDR: 

She sat me down and told me she was unhappy because my social media posts / newsletter emails were not directly making her money thus she does not want to continue to pay someone when they do not make her money. I informed her that that isn't how social media works, since I really am not a sales I will never be directly making her any money. She is constantly going behind my back and talking to her ex-intern who wants my job and the intern is giving her ""professional advice"" that undermines me and my work. She gave me a speech that I need to start thinking like a consumer and send over Facebook posts constantly through the day and basically shove the brand down people's throats.

I'm at a loss for words. I have two job interviews next week for lower paying jobs but I feel really abused. "

* I 100% am planning to live and work in the Socal in Orange or LA county. As a result one of the reasons I am leaning towards Irvine is because it would *seem* logical to network from a school located in soCal as opposed to NorCal. I for example would absolutely love to intern at Blizzard Entertainment.

Do you guys think this geographical factor will play a big role?

* My chances of personal success over at a school of such higher standards compared to Irvine. Not saying that Irvine will be easy or anything, but I am guessing that Berkeley would be considerably more difficult.

I would love some advice regarding this matter."

Her resume said that she knows how to use Microsoft Word, which is true in the sense that she knows how to type words into it. I asked her to make edits to a large document, and after she made edits I noticed a ton of issues with formatting. I was going over some of them with her, and her eyes just got really big when I explained things to her like how to make different section headings. I pointed out that a table was way over the margins, and she agreed, but then just kind of stared at the screen. I said that she should adjust the table so it doesn't do that, and she asked what I meant by that. I adjusted the columns so the table fit on the page, and she gasped in amazement.

WTF is this? I'm 30 years old, she's 24. I just assume that people who are younger than me know how to use Word, and are generally more tech savvy than I am. At the end of the meeting my intern said she was sorry, that she thought she knew how to use Word but now she realizes she has a lot to learn. I shouldn't be angry, part of an internship is learning new skills. But for me these things are basic skills that she should have come here with. It's fine, and she's been Googling a lot of things and learning how to make formatting adjustments. I'm just weirdly frustrated about this and needed to rant."

I was able to land a third internship this Summer and that is really the only positive thing about my current situation. 

I ended up taking a Manufacturing job last semester because I plan on working as a Manufacturing Engineer BUT I ended up working on average 30 hours a week and it was the worst semester ever, I was stressed all the time and my performance was bad.

I am more down and depressed now than I have ever been. I have been struggling with money for the last 3 years and this company offered me 16 bucks/hr + housing stipend, so I jumped on it.

I am so sick of working this God damn stupid jobs that pay between 9-12 bucks an hour and never being able to get ahead financially.

Anyways, my senior year has been the worst year so far for all the reasons mentioned above, so I just wanted to give you my perspective.

4i74ky,3,2016-05-06,I'm somewhat new to electronics and I'm trying to power five brushless RC motors with a deep cycle marine battery (as opposed to the standard LiPo). Wondering whether the battery will be able to supply enough current? (Among other things),jaerixon,AskElectronics,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/4i74ky/im_somewhat_new_to_electronics_and_im_trying_to/,"I've been in the midst of a small quarter life crisis (can't find an internship, feeling like I haven't really learned anything in school) so I'm ironing out my angst by taking on a hefty summer project. I'm trying to build an Underwater ROV. The electronics element has been the most challenging part for me to figure out. While I have learned a lot, there are still some things that I can't quite wrap my head around or find an answer to. Even if you can only answer one of these questions, I would be extremely grateful.

Anyhow, like the post says I'm going to be using five brushless DC motors, sort of like this [1000Kv Brushless Motor](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__57479__2210N_1000Kv_Brushless_Motor_AR_Warehouse_.html?strSearch=2210%201000Kv) from HobbyKing. The page specifies that the motors are capable of handling a max current of 11.2 A and a max voltage of 11V. I'll have five motors, so I'll need five times that amount of current (11.2*5 = 56A). The RC LiPo batteries make it easy to figure out whether or not they can handle this since they list the discharge rating, a value which describes the maximum current the battery can spit out. But for my purposes, I don't really need a LiPo battery. It isn't going to be in the ROV, it's just going to be up on the boat with me, so I can utilize a much bigger, much heavier battery. I think a deep duty marine battery would best suit my needs, like this [X2Power Deep Cycle 34M Battery](https://www.batteriesplus.com/battery/marine-and-boat/deep-cycle/bci-group-34m/sli34agmdpm), but I can't figure out whether or not it can handle 56 amps at one time. All it says is ""Voltage:12, Cold Cranking Amps: 880, Capacity 20hr: 68AH"".

Now, I believe the Cold Cranking Amps is just a measure of what it can output temporarily when you first start it, like for trolling motor or something. It isn't an indicator of the steady output.  The Capacity is simply how much amperage was expended over 20 hours until the battery went totally dead (I think?), so the 3.4A per hour. I also know that figure is somewhat theoretical because of [Peukerts Law](http://all-about-lead-acid-batteries.capnfatz.com/all-about-lead-acid-batteries/lead-acid-battery-fundamentals/peukerts-law-and-exponent-explained/).

My second question regards the voltage. The motors maximum voltage is 11V, the battery I want to get would be 12V (probably more when fully charged). I've read that the main concern is the wattage, not the voltage, so if I just don't run the motors in excess of that total recommended wattage, I'd be fine. It's still so close, is there really that much to worry over? Each motor will also be controlled by one of these [electronic speed controllers \(ESCs\)
](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__37945__HobbyKing_YEP_18A_2_4S_SBEC_Brushless_Speed_Controller.html), which also have a voltage limit. All they say is ""Input Voltage: 2-4 cells li-XX or 6-12 Ni-MH/Ni-Cd battery"". Again, I assume I'll be alright, but I don't know for sure?

My questions:

1) Is there anyway I can tell whether or not that battery will be able to support the current requirement for all of my motors? 

2) Do I need to be concerned about going over with voltage?

Thank you again!

4i7i0e,3,2016-05-06,Advice on trying coding as a hobby and possibly as a career option.,Crack_Lemon,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/4i7i0e/advice_on_trying_coding_as_a_hobby_and_possibly/,"
**TL:DR at edit of post at the bottom!**

Hi everyone!

Before I start, I would like to say that this is my first time posting on reddit so please go easy on me! This post is more of a personal one too! If you can bear reading through it.

After much consideration I felt that it would be helpful for me to seek help from the people of reddit and the internet, as most of you would probably be able to provide some good advice and insights. In this post I will be asking more for guidance rather than asking what type of coding to pick up. But I will get to all the details. So let me begin!

To start, I will tell a little about myself. I am 24 years old, turning 25, and I am a recent graduate with a major in Digital Marketing. I live in NYC and went to school in NYC. I currently work as a driver for Uber (to support myself) and I also kinda intern at a small videography company. I am an avid gamer and I always loved working with computers and reading about all sorts of computer-tech related stuff.

I ended up going to a business school for my undergrad and even in the first few years I was pretty undecided on my major until I eventually picked Digital Marketing, as I felt that traditional marketing would be too boring and that Digital Marketing would be more closely related to the modern and evolving tech, such as social media, mobile, and etc, and it would be much more interesting and interactive. Due to circumstances in my undergrad years, I was not able to intern for companies like other students were, and was only able to intern after I graduated. I graduated in June of 2015 and I started interning on November of 2015. However, I feel that the place I intern/help out at is not really providing me with the experience and hands-on stuff that I should be getting. My duties are pretty much helping my boss with establishing her brand more and helping it gain awareness, by revamping the website, social media, and etc. I feel as if I should be getting my feet wet a lot more to see if I truly like the field or not; to see if I can do Digital Marketing as a career in the future. So now I am a bit worried and questioning myself, my major and my future career, as to whether I should stick to marketing or find something else and basically almost having a quarter life crisis. 

Now to get to the point. A couple years back a my old roommate gave me the idea that I should pick up coding/web development and see if I like it and where it would take me. I ended up buying a book but I never really got started on it due to work and school. Now that I am finished with school and have a bit more time to spare, I felt that it would be a good idea start learning to code, mainly due to the demand of the field and my questioning of my own major. However, just a few days ago, I had a long discussion with my friend, who is a developer and has been programming since like 10, about the whole ""Learning to Code"" thing. He feels as if I want to learn to code just for the money, that I don't have a drive for it and desire to actually do it. His argument is that if I really wanted to do coding, I would have finished the book long ago and already be doing coding, instead of making excuses and off-putting it. Instead, he feels that I would be wasting my time with trying to learn code and instead should look for better internships for Digital Marketing or even take a few career choice exams and see what I truly like. He also mentioned that me wanting to try coding is like me wanting to try out ""Spanish"", and it just doesn't make sense. His belief is that coding itself has much more to it than just learning it; that you need a drive for it, a desire, and the ability to spend hours upon hours learning about it, figuring it out, and etc. He simply feels that I will be wasting my time doing it because it's the ""hot new thing"" and should think about it much more seriously.

My stance was that I just want to try it out, see if I like it and if I end up liking it maybe proceed to making more of a hobby out of it and maybe a career out of it. I feel that there is no harm in learning something new. I am aware it is a lot of effort to pick up a language and learn. But I don't see it as being a waste of time. My argument was that learning to code is also a good skill to have in general. I also felt that without even trying it, how would I know if it is for me or not? 

We ended the discussion shortly after and just ended up talking about something else. But it kinda bothered me the next day, so I felt the need to ask more about it, hence this post! 

I am very well aware of the fact that if I end up not liking it, I would have lost plenty of precious time that I could have spent doing something else. But, personally, I always had a desire to be more involved with games, rather than just playing them. My plan is to learn the basic HTML, CSS, Javascript just to get an understanding of web development, and maybe proceed into learning Java or Swift, cause I do have some ideas for phone apps. I also would like to maybe even make a game of my own somewhere down the line.

So if you're still with me after the whole story, I would simply like to ask for your suggestions or opinions on the whole matter. Is coding something that I can try to learn; to see whether I like it or not? Would there be any harm in doing so? Is it possible, for a complete beginner with zero knowledge of it to make opportunities out of it and maybe set my life into a different direction?

I appreciate the help and I apologize in advance for any grammatical mistakes (lots of personal thoughts and ideas to pour out the first time!) or if this is in the wrong section!

Feel free to ask any questions too!

Thanks!

EDIT:

**TL;DR:** 

**I'm a recent undergrad in Digital Marketing trying to get feet wet in the field to see if I like it or not, but things are not going too well.** 
**Thought about picking up coding a while ago but couldn't get to it because of school &amp; work.** 
**Now that I graduated, I have more time to try it out, but a programmer friend of mine is saying I will be wasting my time and that me wanting to try coding is like me wanting to try out ""Spanish"", and it just doesn't make sense.** 
**I feel as if there would be no harm in learning the basic languages and see if I like it and if I end up liking it maybe proceed to making more of a hobby out of it and maybe a career out of it.**

4i83bf,17,2016-05-06,It's been 4 years now...,kellytensei,Letsnevermeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/Letsnevermeet/comments/4i83bf/its_been_4_years_now/,"I've read others' experiences and finally felt comfortable enough to share my own here mostly for support and comfort knowing that I'm 1) not alone and 2) not to blame because I kinda feel like I am. It might be a little long because (as you know from the title) this has been going on for about 4 years now. I'll try to keep it as concise as possible (I'm sorry if it's confusing, its coming from memory). 

It started the summer of 2012, I had gone back home from law school and had a summer internship. I normally kept my head down, got my work finished, and walked to my mom's office to get a ride home. I knew a few people at work, mostly old-timers with permanent positions there. The few that were my age I knew from high school. My office sat right in front of a communal office supplies cabinet that people would often grab file tabs, binders, pens, etc. from. 

One guy, we'll call him Neil, would very frequently need supplies - so much so that I would often notice him looking through said supply cabinet multiple times a day. I just brushed it off (ignoring that ""something is off"" vibe that you often get). One day, he finally approached me and introduced himself and asked if I wanted to grab dinner with him. I was hesitant and set my boundaries clear that under no circumstances will I ever date a coworker -- because let's be real that gets really messy -- and if we were to grab dinner it'd be casual with other people from the office. He agreed and assured me that he had no intention of crossing that line and said he respected that I wanted to keep my dealings with my workmates professional. Comforted, I agreed and went out with him and other people we worked with. 

The next week, he again asked if I wanted to grab dinner and maybe a movie with just him alone. I felt uneasy, probably should have listened to that instinct, but I again reiterated that I don't date coworkers, but that I'd grab a bite to eat right after work (no movie) as friends. Again, he agreed, said he understood and that was that. After we finished dinner and I was about to head back to my mom's car, he stopped me and told me he loved me then tried to kiss me. I'm not sure if more alarm bells could've gone off in my head at that point, but I pushed him away and told him that not only did I make my boundaries clear, he needed to and said he would respect them. I then went through the hospital so I was in a public place, found my mom's car, and went home. 

The next day, I went to work as usual when Neil high-tailed it into my office, shut the door behind him and began yelling at me for declining his advances. Pretty much just going nuts. Since my boss is also a family friend, I didn't really know what to do and didn't want to start causing drama in the office. I calmly told Neil that if he didn't lower his voice and leave, I'd call our head of security and have him escorted out. The threat seemed to work as Neil then left without a word. I went about my day, and turned my phone back on as I was about to head to my mom's. It was then that I started hearing chime after chime coming from my bag. Texts from Neil began pouring in from literally almost every five to ten minutes of the day. 

I had no idea what to do, no idea what would make him think that he knew me enough to love me, and/or no idea what would make him fixate on me like that. 

I kept my head down for the next couple weeks in an effort to pacify him until I was able to hop on my plane back to school. Throughout that time, it was a constant back-and-forth between him yelling at me that we were going to get married, I'd be his housewife and future mother to his four kids and him berating me for only wanting to be friends with him (which wasn't even true at that point). Two weeks finally went by and I left to go back to school, thankfully, thinking that I would be able to cut him out of my life for good.

He kept calling incessantly, leaving voicemails yelling at me then voicemails crying because I wouldn't pick up the phone. I finally blocked all numbers he would call from and had a few months of peace. 

A year later I went back home for the summer again. Within a week of me being back, I got an ""anonymous"" delivery of red roses to my parents' house. Yes, they were from him. He got into my social media accounts and monitored my movements, which I found out later. I've seen him outside of my apartment, outside of my classes, gotten ""anonymous"" flower deliveries at my door. This has continued even until maybe about a week ago. 

I've gotten notes slipped under my door, one from a notepad I keep in my apartment, though commercially available. I've gotten notes printed through my e-printer. I found a program on my computer and figured that was how he was monitoring everything. Once I removed it, everything went quiet, which is how it stayed for a couple of days. Then my car got broken into. No word from the police if they have any information on who it was. Everything has been quiet since. A little unnervingly quiet. "
4i85jn,3,2016-05-06,[Rant] Losing Motivation and Anxious about my Future,insomniac96,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4i85jn/rant_losing_motivation_and_anxious_about_my_future/,"I'm getting really stressed, and unsatisfied with my life as it is. I'm a 19 year old in community college, and the social environment is depressing to me. I'm stressed with the prospect of transferring, and I'm anxious I will be rejected to the universities I applied as a freshman. Even though I have a higher GPA in college than high school, involved in student government, have an internship, and clearly know what kind of career field I want to enter after college I still have a lot of self doubts. It doesn't help that as an extroverted guy most of the people at my college are commuters, and the only social group around me are international students who tend to stay self segregated. Even though on paper my life may seem like it is going well I constantly feel like I am a failure. I know its not good to have a cynical, defeatist attitude like that but I feel isolated, and unmotivated. Its hard to not think I'm a failure when I live in competitive Silicon Valley, and attended one of the top public high schools in California. When I see a lot of successful people at four years, and I am reminded that I am a community college student my self esteem drops. My Mom has always pushed me academically, and I feel like I am not measuring up to the high expectations she has. My Mom is a stereotypical Asian tiger Mother who wanted me to attend the top universities in the US like Yale, or U Chicago. My Dad attended an Ivy League University, and I have a inferiority complex that I won't measure up to my peers or parent's success. I realize this obsession over academic success might be obnoxious, and nerdy but that very obsession causes me a lot of stress. I also struggle with my sexuality. I'm not sure whether if I am bisexual or gay, and constantly feel confused about who I am attracted to. My Mom is religious, and holds homophobic views. So I can't even be open with my personal life within my own family. I know I need to address my self esteem, and anxiety issues but I was raised in a family where I was told to suck in my emotions. I don't feel like I have an outlet to express my emotions. Being bipolar while most of the time I present myself as calm, and collected I'll have some emotional meltdowns. Still most people wouldn't assume I had emotional issues because I'm good at hiding my issues, and attempt to present an image of confidence around other people. I realize most of this post was self wallowing, but I really would appreciate any advice how I can work on my self esteem, and take life less seriously. I also need to get more sleep as I get 4-5 hours of sleep(hence my username). Lastly I recognize I come from a privileged background, but I feel my family isn't supportive of me emotionally as my Mom will silence me if I bring up any of my issues by telling me to ""suck it up"".  Instead of suggesting I get counseling, or psychological help I'm left on my own to self help myself. I get that I am an adult, but I just wish my family was more supportive. Thank you for reading, and I'm sorry for ranting. I just feel overwhelmed right now. "

I started No-fap last year during my internship and for a while I made lots of progress. I went back to college and the progress continued but towards the end of the semester, I got depressed and binged a couple of times. During the winter break, I got back my motivation and did better than I have ever done in my sobriety and mental strength but eventually the depression kicked in and now I am going through the binge stage all over again. 

The main reason I binge is because I have lost hope that I can change. I have tried everything possible but I just keep relapsing. When I go 15 days without pornography, my life becomes so boring and it seems like the only thing I do everyday is fight my addiction. I want to be able to live my life and fight my addiction and do the stuffs I enjoy like reading blogs, playing video games and programming but these always contribute to my relapse. I have had several different gameplans but I still keep failing. It is very difficult to keep going and picking yourself up after trying everything and still failing. Now, I have decided to join this sub-reddit and hopefully, it would help me in my fight against my crazy addiction."

I was just going to do odd-jobs like building computers, preparing spreadsheets, taking notes at meetings, assisting where needed. Near the end of my first week, my supervisor told me she was going to have me help someone with daily tasks as well and that she'd send her by to meet me.

At the end of the day, a lady approached my desk with a sheepish grin and introduced herself. ""When I heard your name, I was so excited,"" she told me. ""My son's name was (my name), but he commit suicide last year."" I wasn't sure how to respond, so I just told her I was sorry to hear and looked forward to working with her.

The next day she offered to take me to lunch in the cafeteria. In addition to telling me about her history with the state, she also told me about her son's drug overdose and how it had impacted her and inspired her to work towards saving others from following the same path. At the end of lunch she said she wanted to introduce me to some of her former co-workers in another branch of the building.

She took me to meet a guy and introduced me by name and as the new intern. When the guy heard my name his face turned kind of smug like he was about to make a joke and give me a hard time, ""Well, how does it feel working for your mother?"" As the lady's mouth fell open, I could see the wheels in the man's head turning and, looking from me to her, his expression switched from pleased, joke-cracker to horror as he realized his mistake. They both began to stammer incoherently as he looked to his desk and started shuffling papers around. ""He must be confused -- let me introduce you to so-and-so,"" she said, ushering me out of the room. As we left I could see the man look and stare at a spot on the wall, face contorted by regret. Apparently they had worked together prior to her son committing suicide and he had completely forgotten.

Edit: originally it wasn't clear that I shared the same name as her son -- changed it to be more clear after /u/MrChewtoy made the suggestion."

I applied for internships and was unsuccessful at getting any. This left me with the option for summer school or individual education(certifications). Summer school would not allow me to graduate any sooner so I went with the certification route.

Background: I am looking at progressing into cyber security and/or related parts of technology was wondering how to best spend my summer(outside of already full time job). Currently I am Security+ certified.
For the cyber defense club at school I have created configured a multi host virtualization cluster. I am wondering I should get certification like Offensive Security Certified Professional(OSCP), Certified Ethical Hacker(CEH) or a vmware related certification. The other option would be to get a certification on linux because I do not have a lot of experience with linux. I am asking being you(community) have years of experience and know what system administrators need and what system administrators like to see when hiring people. This could be the wrong place if so let me know and I could move/delete it.

TL;DR: Summer is here. Going into Cyber Security. Do I take OSCP, CEH, VMware ceritication or get a linux certification? And your advice?"

I am a junior CompE student at a small top 50 engineering school in the North East. This semester I applied for a technology internship at a medium sized financial services/trading firm in PA. Interviews were tough (online coding exercise, developer phone interview, full day on-site) but somehow I pulled through and received an offer, which I accepted.

The internship itself seems great. The company itself seems very well regarded in its field, compensation is through the roof (40+/hr), and their internship program sounds great. However, I have heard (after accepting the positions) that firms like this generally treat their tech interns as second citizens compared to trading interns. 

Also, I have been hearing a lot of talk from my professors that FinTech is not the best industry to be going into for Computer Science. Most of what I have been told advises applying for positions in either large, well known technology companies or looking for some great startups to intern at. 

Does anyone have any advice on this? Any personal stories from people who have had experience in Financial Technology? I am doing work with data analytics this summer, however are there some areas that one in the industry would be better off specializing in?

Looking forward to your input! Thanks!

Now, the way I booked the tickets, I fly to NY and then to Europe before coming back to the same NY airport and flying to Chicago the same day. I would prefer not to take a huge bag during my travels and now am unsure about how exactly to make sure my luggage is in Chicago. 

I have a few options and was hoping for some new ideas that I didn't think of yet, any help would be appreciated!! 

1. Airport storage. 
This seems to be the easiest option, as I would have to only check in the bag twice(on my first and last flights). However since I am gone 14 days, this price will be around $150-$200. 

2. Shipping my bag to Chicago 
I'm not exactly sure the best way to go about doing this. If anyone could recommend any website they've used that would be great!

Now the guy said I can pay my deposit on the day after I arrive, but I have to get my 1200 deposit back from the person after me.

He said: I get my deposit now from you and i paid it to the one that stayed here before me

This sounds a bit impractical here, especially that I won't be in Europe anymore by the time my contract ends.

Original post:
I will arrive in Vienna soon for a summer internship. I found a room through a Facebook group. I've spoken to the person offering the room and looked at the condition of the room through Skype. We had an agreement. However, I was asked to pay a deposit of 1200€ in advance to secure the room. I can get it back when the contract ends. 

I had rented a room in Germany before. I didn't pay the deposit until I actually got to meet the landlord in person. I am from outside Europe and want to know if it's a common thing to do in Vienna. That's a big chunk of money to have to pay to a stranger. Thanks a lot!"

We never spoke with each other in class,  but I always tried to look over at you whenever I could.  I know it's childish, but I had a crush and I was too awkward to say anything.  

Fast forward to the end of semester.  We've still never spoken a word to each other in class, but one day I got a friend request on Facebook.  It was from you.  This kind of never thing never happens to a guy like me.  A short 5'6 guy who struggles with self esteem and can't talk to strangers has the girl he has a crush on friend HIM on Facebook?  

Holy shit.  This is too good to be true.  We could have never spoken a word to each other, but just getting that friend request from you was enough to make me happy for the entire summer.  

But I knew I couldn't blow this chance.  I had to say something.  I had to sack the fuck up and message you.  I had to ask you out.  A chance like this comes maybe once in a lifetime.  It sure as shit hadn't happened to me before this point, so fuck it, it may never happen again.

I did it.  I messaged you.  I asked you out to coffee.  You said yes.  Holy shit.

The coffee date arrives.  You look amazing.  We sit and talk for 6 hours. You had so much to say and you laughed at the dumb things I said.  I ask you if you're hungry.  You are.  So we get pizza and spend another hour or two talking.  8 hours with you and I knew I was hooked. 

""She's a senior in college."" I tell myself later that night while laying in bed. ""I know she's moving in a week.  Don't get too attached you fucking idiot.""

We're texting throughout the rest of the night.  You're all I can think about.  

""You've never seen Superbad??""

She comes over to my apartment the next night and we watch Superbad.  We talk in my bed for another 6 hours.  It's 5:00 AM.  I want to kiss you but I don't know how to initiate the kissing cannon. ""Fuck it man, just ask her. She's in your bed at 5:00 AM. She's into it."" 

I asked to kiss you.  You said yes.  We made out for a while.  I took you home because you had a final exam at 8:30.  2 hours of sleep. Classic.

I invite you over the next day.  You come over.  We talk for hours.  We make out for the other hours inbetween.  You're incredible.  I've fallen for you.

""Hey man, just have fun with her while you can.  It's fun to have a fling for a week!"" my roommates tell me. 

We see each other for the next few days, texting during the times we are away from each other.  Every time I kissed you I fell harder and harder. I'm into deep.

It's Friday/Saturday (today/tonight).  You went out with your roommate to a bar to celebrate graduating from college.  You asked me to pick you up, so I did.  We went back to my place.  We chatted, we kissed, we watched Moonrise Kingdom.

It's 4:00 AM and we're laying together.  My arms wrapped around your waist, your arms wrapped around mine. We're not saying a word.  It's perfect. 

But we both know what we're thinking.  This can't last forever.  You're leaving soon.  And so am I.  Although I'm a junior in college, I have an internship in another state this summer, so I won't be around, and you're moving to Tennessee for a job.  

The weight of reality is crashing down upon us as we hold each other in our arms.

We begin to talk about it.  This is the first time we've brought it up.  I cried a little.  But my head is propped up over your head so you can't tell.

We talk about it for a little bit then it's time to take you home.  I know I'll see you tomorrow, but after that it's goodbye forever.

I could talk about how you make me happy. I could talk about how much I love when you smile that you push your tongue up. I could talk about how you actually make me feel good about myself.

But that would only make me even more sad.

I wept in my car after I dropped you off tonight.

**[i made a post before outlining differences in my partner and me. please read it for full context!](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4i2eg1/i_20f_feel_like_my_partner_27m_is_from_another/)**

i have always felt slightly off around him. for example,

* he will go days without contacting me, even though i voiced how much it bothered me

* he has made me feel like an inferior before and admitted to losing respect for me

* he doesn’t flirt with me and wants to “own” me

* he either gives the bare minimum in a conversation or ignores texts

* he gave me a lot of attention before we got back together, and now practically none (probably because he “got” me so he doesn’t need to “work” for me anymore)

* he is very direct about sex and asks me for photos out of the blue

* he is very closed off emotionally and doesn’t share much about his personal life, asking about my life a lot but rarely sharing anything about himself

* he has a volatile schedule and doesn’t really keep me in the loop

* he (used to) give(s) off a sociopathic vibe sometimes

and more things i probably can’t remember!

i decided to give him the benefit of the doubt because a) not all of those things are warning signs b) i have severe trust issues in general and i might be applying them unfairly to him c) some qualities could just be part of his personality d) he does do things to try to keep me in his life (again, see my original post).

i have always had a tumultuous relationship with him, swaying from trusting to doubtful of his intent. we had a quasi-conflict recently, and, after some consideration (from friends and my previous reddit post), i decided i should finally end things with him.

i wanted to retrieve an article of clothing of mine from his house. it felt like he was holding onto a part of me because he had my item for almost a year now and never returned it. there were many times i wished i had my clothes, and it just reminded me of painful memories with him (since we were apart for a long period). i know it’s a silly idea (i should just let go it go and count my losses), but i felt like retrieving it would give me the confidence to follow through with my decision to end things with him. i really like him, so i felt like i needed it to be “whole” to break things off.

i didn’t want to tell him i was going to get my clothes, because he would have told me to just wait for him to come back from his travels. i didn’t want to see him in person to tell him i was done; i wanted to just retrieve it and leave. i know this was a horribly stupid mindset, but i almost felt a compulsion to do this.

he has two houses. when i asked him about my clothes before, he said they were at his second house (which i have never been to) and that he would return them when he visited it.

because he is currently abroad, i figured he might have airbnbed this house. i decided to visit it, following the address he gave me a while ago. the family living inside told me they didn’t recognize him and he definitely didn’t live in the neighborhood. this felt off (why did he give me a dead address?), so i decide to go to his original house (the one i spend nights in). i figured there was a slight chance my clothes would be there.

a roommate of his i never met before let me in when i told him that i was here to retrieve clothes i left at his place. in his room, i noticed some photos on the wall of my partner and another girl, one of which was them intimately in bed together. he didn’t have those photos up when i was with him (last i saw him was ~2.5 weeks ago), and i felt kind of sick. i looked in his closet, hoping i’d find my clothes. in the middle of his shelf in his closet was a card from someone calling him “husband/boyfriend.”

i didn’t really read it out of respect for privacy and because i was kind of too in shock to even intake it. all i know is that it was dated a few months ago (definitely in a time frame where we knew each other), and it was intimate. nauseous, i leave the house.

my partner texts me shortly afterwards. the condensed conversation goes something like this:

&gt; “don’t message me. if you go to my place again, i’ll call the cops.”

&gt; “are you married?”

&gt; “no. you’re a stalker. i’ll call the cops.”

&gt; ""i went to your house to get my clothes, but there were intimate pictures of a girl on your wall. she referred to you as husband in a card dated recently.”

&gt; “that was an ex. i’ll prove to you i’m not married.”

&gt; “why is she on your wall? why did you take the photos down when i was with you? why does she call you husband? can i talk to her?”

&gt; “yes, after i come back. now stop, i’ll call the cops for stalking.”

&gt; “i didn’t do anything wrong. i was let in and i didn't go through your things. call the cops on me then. you can cheat on someone if you want; it's your life. but you withheld that information from me. yes, i’d like to talk to her when you’re back.”

&gt; “i’m not responding anymore.”

i took his bluff because i was confident he was seeing someone else. calling the cops would have just put his infidelity in the limelight. some of my friends are scared for me, though, because he is rich and can be very ruthless. they think he might actually litigate me. should i be worried? i don't think i did anything illegal.

the best case scenario is he cheated on me with a girl while we were still technically exclusive but long-distance. when he tried to get back together after our falling out, he “neglected” to mention her, saying he disappeared simply because of his busy schedule.

the worst case scenario is he has a girlfriend or wife who lives abroad and i am his mistress. not unlikely, seeing as he has money and travels regularly, disappears on me without much word, and is closed off about his personal life. last i saw him was about 2.5 weeks ago, so we also see each other infrequently.

i’m not sure what to do now. part of me wants to get the full story from him, but i doubt he’ll tell me. part of me thinks i should contact his wife/girlfriend. part of me thinks i should just drop everything and move on.

**tl;dr: discovered my “partner” may be seeing someone else and possibly married when i went to his house when he wasn’t there. what should i do?**

**edit: you all are right. he manipulated and gaslighted me a lot. he is scum and not worth my time. i think he could literally be diagnosed for psychopathy.**"

Hi folks,

for our small office i would like to set up a completly new pc-system consisting of 3 pcs and one server.

We mostly do 2D-CAD work so the actual build shouldn't be to expensive. It would be great, if we could get a build for 500€ each without monitors, peripherals and OS.

I would like to build 3 new systems and out of the old ones a storage server, but that will be a story for another time since the current server still works fine.

**Part Draft:**

I never really build a pc from scratch. I don't know if i just should get a specific prebuild pc, but i also would like the challange of building a new system.

All in all the main factor for the pc should be **cheap, high single thread performance and ram**, since the only thing the pc is used for is 2D CAD and general office stuff. 

So below is a list of components that i think could be ok, but i would really appreciate your advice and improvements.

The Unicorns are last years finalist of the GermanBowl while the Raiders are the reigning Austrian champs and are the ""sister team"" of the Oakland Raiders, they have a loose connection where the Euro team sends coaches to California to intern and the Oakland Raiders assist with marketing and equipment (blocking sleds, etc) sometimes they send their cheerleaders for big games and on one occasion Willie Brown visited Innsbruck (Euro Raiders home town)

Both teams consist mainly of European amateur players with some American ""Imports"" as they call it, some are former D1 players, some played for FCS teams and others played in lower divisions.

The level of play is comparable to good D2 teams, on a good day they might keep it close against lower level FCS teams.

If you have further questions, I'm gonna try to answer most of them.

I'll be working as an operations engineer with a leading cloud computing and e-commerce company. I plan on getting some work experience before applying but I'm interested in an MBA for the potential to move into a more strategic management position or into a business development role.

Background
Work experience: I'll start working with the above stated company in June, I plan to stay there for at least two years. I've also interned in sales engineering, IT, and software development.

Extra curriculars: President of computer science professional society, brought speakers from Google, Amazon, IBM, etc. on campus for recruiting and networking events. I know of 9 people out of a graduating class of 15 who got jobs or internships specifically because of these events.

Undergrad school/major: American University, Computer Science

Other education/coursework: N/A

Race/nationality: Asian and white
Sex: M

Stats
GMAT Score (include breakdown!):
Undergrad GPA: ~3.5, not final yet but this shouldn't be too variable

MBA Info
Goal of MBA: Move into strategic management or business development. I enjoyed sales engineering but I wanted the chance to get my hands dirty in a more technical capacity earlier in my career. I'm not entirely sure an MBA is the best way to do this, but that's part of why I'm posting.

Target schools: MIT and University of Michigan seem to have programs that are best suited to my personal style of learning (""action oriented"") but at this stage I don't have any strong preferences."

I've been living in Dubai for over 3 years now as a student and just finished my final semester and currently doing an internship. One of my main issues is finding a place for rent at a considerable price which I'm aware that rent in Dubai is crazy expensive. I've been living in Marina in a studio that is facing JBR and the price as you can guess is pretty expensive for a studio. I've been looking for the past year for a 1 bedroom apartment in either Marina or JLT as its close to where I study (currently work) that would be between 8k to 9k monthly but I haven't found one that is worthwhile or that doesn't come with over the top agency fees. I know that getting a place on a yearly basis would be cheaper but at the moment it would be more convenient to find something on a monthly basis. I just wanted to know where else might I be able to find places for relatively better prices than the ones on Dubizzle if there is.

Any advice on this would be appreciated."

If it is the best route to take, should I target specific internships freshman/sophomore year such as tech company internships? I understand that consulting and banking firms generally don't take 1st/2nd year interns. Any advice would be appreciated."
4ibzv8,1021,2016-05-07,"My [20F] boyfriend's [22M] parents [late 50s, M/F] not-so-subtly keep trying to set me up with his brother [25M]",HeatherBBB,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ibzv8/my_20f_boyfriends_22m_parents_late_50s_mf/,"My boyfriend is sort of the black sheep of his family. His parents really like me, from the night they've met me they've always said I'm such a great girl and all that. At first, I was overjoyed--it's always great to have your SO's parents like you! And for some time I was super happy. 

I've always been an overachiever, so I'm super busy. I play tennis and soccer, I have an internship with a consulate, I do very well in school and love to study poetry and linguistics, so I also speak several languages. I'm someone who constantly needs something to do not to get bored. And my boyfriend's parents know all these things and always tell me how dedicated and hard-working I am. And again, at first it was great because I was glad my boyfriend's parents liked me! 

My boyfriend, on the other hand, is not at all an underachiever, but also not an overachiever. We both go to a really good university, but he got in because of sports initially. He's never been a stellar student, but he does well. He's a great guy. The issue is that his brother is an overachiever: Harvard for grad school, brilliant, and super dedicated to everything. And both from what my boyfriend has told me and from what I've noticed, he's clearly the golden child. 

So for the first few months I've known them, things went well. The first red flag came during a dinner when his mom said something about how I'm almost ""too good"" for my boyfriend. That was a weird comment, but I didn't think much of it. Then, the comparisons to his older brother started. Every chance they got, they made some comparison between him and me about how we were both doing this or that. Then one day, his parents told us about how his brother was going to be in our city for the weekend and had an extra ticket to one of my favorite bands, and that I should go with him, my boyfriend's brother! Just the two of us. I politely declined and made up an excuse, but I told my boyfriend about it. He said it was weird but if I wanted to go I should've gone, but I wasn't going to do that. 

Then while he was in town, my boyfriend's brother texted me to meet up for lunch or something while he knew my boyfriend was in class. This was more innocent so I agreed, because he's my boyfriend's family, and the whole lunch he was badmouthing his brother. 

That was about a year ago. 

Also, I'm Latina, so my boyfriend decided to take up Spanish, which I really appreciate. Then his brother took up Spanish as well, conveniently at the same time my boyfriend did, and his parents kept contacting me to meet up with my boyfriend's brother to help him practice (even though he lives several hours away). But again, this can all be taken kind of innocently as well, so I've been reluctant to put too much thought into it. 

Last weekend, however, his family came into the city to visit and kept talking about how my boyfriend's brother and I look so cute together. When my boyfriend was in the bathroom, they asked me if it was ever annoying to have a boyfriend who wasn't quite as smart as me. I was livid, but I brushed it off as a casual question and tried to pretend to stay calm. At the end of the night, his mother asked me to take a picture with the brother and posted it on Facebook, as well as a few other pictures of the group, but not one picture of me and my boyfriend together. And the caption of the picture of me and his brother was ""an absolutely adorable couple, love you [my name]!"" His *mother* wrote that. 

Since then, I decided it was time to bring it up to my boyfriend. He said he'd noticed it but it's best to ignore it because his parents and brother are always trying to take stuff away from him. He told me not to worry about it, he can handle it and he doesn't want to start conflict, but it's bothering me too much at this point. I love my boyfriend, but I don't want to cause any tension in the family. It's just so uncomfortable and sad, especially since he's such a great guy who I truly love, and it pains me to see his family treat him like some placeholder and me like some trophy for their other son. I'm just so pissed and confused, I don't know how to confront this with his parents. My boyfriend doesn't want to start anything, and neither do I, but I feel like I have to talk to his parents and brother about this. 



   
**tl;dr**: For the past year and a half, my boyfriend's parents have been hinting that I should dump my boyfriend and be worth his older brother; I don't know how to confront them about it (or if I should). "

If you want to know why exactly, feel free to ask. At this point I am locked into finishing up my Biology MSc but I am adapting my course work to include more programming. My internship will be building a simulation in python of virus spread by mites in bee colonies, I am considering trying to turn it into a web application (for fun and for portfolio) after I’m done with my MSc.  During my thesis I was ‘forced’ to learn Matlab on my own and I loved it. Programming is magic; this complicated, fast and wonderful machine does exactly want I tell it to do, it’s delicious. 
In my free time I also learned some LaTeX and did some basic online python courses to prepare for my internship and I’m following a course in the next period that will include more coding in python. My knowledge of CS concepts such as networking and big O is limited, but I am a fast learner (and love learning) so I expect this will be fine. 

*What I am not interested in*

Fast track, high pressure and competitive environment with long working hours. Working on networking, sysadmin, mobile, QA and bioinformatics.

*What would be my ideal job? Keep in mind that this is a mid-long term goal (3-5 years).*

Part-time work week (32 hours), decent pay, relaxed atmosphere, enough time at work to learn new skills and keep up with new developments (I do love learning). If I am comfortable with my skills I’d like to transition into remote working (for similar hours). 
Perfectly fine with earning a moderate income, since me and my girlfriend are both frugal it’ll leave us enough to save and live comfortably (for our standards) while having free time for personal projects.

How useful is a STEM degree in pursuing a junior software developer role? 
What is the job market like in the Netherlands?
When should I start applying for jobs? 
What field and type of business (start-up/medium/large) would best match my ideal job?

He is really attractive, smart, independent, mature and confident. He has all his life together and he knows what he wants for the future. I like him a lot.


But he said he didn't want anything serious because he has trust issues, he has a lot of commitments like school, internships. He has never had any serious relationships before because he just doesn't trust anyone. Also he believes that we are too young for relationships. However, as a guy, he admits that he has the desire to be with girls (not just sexually), but at the same time he doesn't want any commitments.

I like him and I have feelings for him. I want more than a sexual relationship. However, if I say no, I may lose him. I asked him how many friends with benefits is he planning to have, he said he only has time for one. So basically just me and him having a sexual relationship without commitment.


I don't know what to do. Would he develop feelings for me and even date me if we spend more time together as FWB? He said he had trust issues, then would be trust me if I stay with him long enough, as FWB first?

Today I have the last bill signings of this term. Thank you for letting me serve as your Governor, it has been an incredible experience. However, I am not only here to say thank you. Due to an IRL internship over the summer I will not be seeking re-election as Governor of the Midwestern State. Tonight I say farewell to this wonderful state and it's citizens. Thank you for granting me the privilege of serving. 


Here are the bill results. 

-----

**B015: Midwestern State Franchise Tax Phaseout and Repeal Act**

I have chosen to sign this bill. This bill will help ensure that the Midwest doesn't unfairly target small businesses. We must take extra care to protect our small businesses and the heritage they represent. Thank you to /u/SovietChef for sponsoring this excellent legislation. 

____

**B011.2: The Midwestern State Symbols Act**

I have chosen to sign this bill. I am happy to announce that the Midwestern State officially has state symbols! I look forward to seeing their implementation around the Model World. 

-----

**B016: The Midwestern State Wage Theft Database Act**

I have chosen to sign this bill. The people of the Midwest have the right to understand the ethics of the work environment they are stepping into each day. If a employer is convicted of withholding wages the employees have the right to know. This bill will ensure fair play and equal treatment across the workplace, and I am happy to see it passed. Thanks again to /u/SovietChef for this topnotch legislation. 
____

**B017: Bank of the Midwestern State Establishment Act**

I have chosen to sign this bill. Here in the Midwest we are lucky to have a balanced budget and surplus. Now we have the chance to establish a Bank of the Midwestern State to oversee economic growth in our state. Thank you to /u/SomeRealShit, our Secretary of the Treasury, for writing this brilliant legislation. I look forward to seeing the Bank of the Midwest put into action.

That concludes our signings for today. 

Thank you,

4icz7v,1,2016-05-07,A recollection of my life and current situation,sheenisli,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4icz7v/a_recollection_of_my_life_and_current_situation/,"So this is just me recollecting my memories, and despite of what my parents have done, their actions are understandable. A lot of the beatings and verbal harassment were all triggered by my stupid actions and decision makings. Both my parents made many sacrifices for my sake, and it was me, the ungrateful child, that pissed them off to that point. At times, my parents may be narcissistic, but usually not the case. 

So my life started off fairly well. I was born in Zhengzhou, a city in the center of China with both parents in highly respectable positions in society. My early years were great, with kindly encouragements and lots of time spent with my parents.
Later to when I was around 5 or 6, my parents had made plans to move to Canada. Things started with my mom doing internship projects in Vienna, Austria and later my father would travel back and forth from Beijing to study English and fill out applications in preparation for immigration. Little did I know at the time, my father would come home from English class, play with me till I fell asleep at 10pm – 12am (pretty late bedtimes for a kid lol) then study his ass off late into the night before having to go to work the following day. The day when we moved came, and we departed for Canada – carrying everything that we could for our new life in the West. We settled in Toronto, in a little apartment that we shared with another tenant. 
I was too young to understand the hardships that my parents went through when we first arrived. They had no jobs, almost no relations, and a little kid with only $20,000 to last us through god knows how long. As I was told by my father, he would commute from downtown Toronto all the way past Mississauga by transit (taking about 3 to 4 hours to commute) to work at a factory paying less than ten dollars per hour at the time. The jobs were also unstable, he would often jump from job to job within weeks of working there. My mother on the other hand, managed to find work in hospital labs due to the few precious connections that she had.
I ended up going to grade school and I was immediately put into a foreign environment. I had no idea how to speak English, and what’s worse, the teacher taught French (mandatory in Canada) in English that spoke none of. So ya, I basically ended hating French because of that, and thank god I didn’t have to learn it past grade 9. But anyways, life carried on, and I graduated grade school in grade 6. During that time, my marks (though didn’t really matter in grade school) were pretty atrocious, but my parents read little into it due to how early on it was in my life. Then came middle school, and my marks, though not as bad (in the 70s and low 80s) were not on par to what my parents were expecting out of me. So occasionally beatings would occur (per usual to immigrant families and their children). But it was understandable, as both my parents were top of the grades all the way from their juniors all the way to university and expecting good study results from me was natural. 
So we moved several times to allow me to go to certain school in Toronto, and I ended going to high school at North Toronto Collegiate Institute. And pretty much at that time, my life started going to shit. I ended up with teachers who were extremely prejudice towards certain students, and guess what, one of those students was me. This affected my mental health greatly, and my grades dropped severely. This obviously led to more beatings from my parents, and some verbal abuse was thrown in there. This obviously did not help my mentality and grade 9 ended in a disaster. As the advancements of my high school years went, the physical beating started to let down, but instead led a rise of verbal abuse. Amidst the family friends whose children had far better grades, my belittling of me along with further verbal abuse from my parents only took a turn for the worst. For the first time in my life, suicidal thoughts came into my head (now on a frequent basis). This positive feedback loop continued all the way to grade 12. 
By my final year in high school, both my parents managed to secure well paying, stable jobs, and even managed to buy a decently sized house in a well off neighbourhood. Since our family’s financial situation was brightening, I thought maybe the processes of my life repeatedly going to shit might finally come to an end. Turns out, #neverlucky. Everything continued as had been going, and with my grades, I barely managed to get into University. 
Now that I’m 18 and completing first year, just as I thought I did alright in my classes, I discovered that I had failed 2 courses - oh my fucking god, my parents are gonna nwahiwoeifjnwailgkjnawrlgkjnarg. And it turns out I was right. I took the worst beating I’ve ever taken from my dad – which left me bruises and scratches, and frankly lost all hope in my future. The two courses that I failed, I must take now in the summer, and the condition set for my parents was that I had to do very well in both of them to even be allowed to stay in the house. So ya I might get kicked out by the end of this summer. 
Sorry I made this very long, but one way to describe my life is that of a playground swirly slide, at the bottom of which lies a steaming pile of dog shit.

4iday2,4,2016-05-08,"I don't know if I'm lucky, smart, or just optimistic.",girlfromchicago,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/4iday2/i_dont_know_if_im_lucky_smart_or_just_optimistic/,"There are so many fucking ways in which I was lucky.

* I was lucky to be born into an upper middle class white family in the US.

* I was lucky to be born to legitimately *good parents* who love me, love each other, and are good at parenting.

* I feel lucky to be a reasonably attractive woman with an hourglass figure and very few body image hangups.

* I was lucky to have a college fund from my grandparents, and not need to take out student loans.

* I was lucky to get into my first choice college (by the skin of my teeth)

* I was lucky to stumble into a set of friends during orientation, and always have someone to hang out with on a Saturday night.

* I was lucky to get to go abroad 3x in 3.5 years, and lucky that it actually made financial sense to do so.

* I was lucky to have a parent who owned their own small business and could give their daughter an ""internship.""

* I was lucky to find a job at a startup, and lucky that they still hired me after I screwed up the interview a little.

* I was lucky to fall into the kind of job where there's beer in the fridge and an opportunity to do cool things.

* I was lucky to not have to worry about finding a job after college, because I already had an offer from my current company.

* I was lucky to find an apartment in a great neighborhood below market rate.

* I was lucky to work for a company with same-age coworkers who I actually want to hang out with outside of work.

* I was lucky to live near a exec at my company who is now my carpool buddy and effectively my mentor.

* I was lucky that a side interest of mine lead me to fall into another social group immediately after college, and lucky that those people turned out to be so awesome.

* I was lucky to find a boyfriend who (in addition to all of the actual reasons I love him) has a hot accent and a high-powered job.

Everything just sort of lines up for me. In college, I used to think that I was so lucky but I was so so worried that I had peaked.. I had these great friends and good grades and everything just seemed to be working out for me. But I was so so worried that I had peaked. That I was going to get into the real world and life would go downhill. And yeah being 23 is hard. I absolutely have days. But compared to most of my same-age friends, my life is fucking stellar. When my same-age friends complain about student loans, dead-end jobs, moving and struggling to make new friends, struggles with their parents, health issues, etc., I can sympathize but I can't empathize.

And yes, I know that I work hard and I should at least get partial credit for the fact that I have friends. But still so much of it feels like luck.

And it's a little terrifying because I keep wondering when it's going to fall apart. When I will have exhausted my supply of luck and life will start throwing my curveballs. Like I know that's a fucked up attitude to have but I feel weirdly guilty for my luck, and have for years.

**I lead this charmed life, and I feel like one day the spell will break and things will stop working out for me.**"
4idbfm,1,2016-05-08,Need advice on leaving frustrating tech job in the middle of a big project,JobAdvicePlease321,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4idbfm/need_advice_on_leaving_frustrating_tech_job_in/,"I'm in a bit of a bind. I work for what I think is a decent sized company. I started working there as an intern before graduation and then was made a full time web developer about 2 1/2 years ago. I really was enjoying the work but over the past year the workload has begun to frustrate me and no one seems to care. Let me state that this company has never had an in house web dev and I'm an intermediate PHP programmer at best. That is the only real web programming I know. 

I have been mainly building ecommerce sites using an open source shopping cart solution and trying to maintain several other sites I built at the same time.

At the moment I'm in the middle of a large project. I'm building a very large ecommerce site as the lone developer with a few outsourced helpers from India. Up until this point I was 95% responsible for gathering and formatting product data(70k items and climbing quickly), programming the site and managing a few other large projects unrelated to this one. The boss is constantly on me and nitpicking everything about the site(and my other works) and adding more and more features that I honestly can't program on my own and it's hard to find people that can reliably help me. I feel like I was given impossible deadlines and the stress of meeting these deadlines, long hours without lunch and the constant emails about my work all hours of the day and night 24/7 is taking its toll on me mentally. I have actually talked about killing myself and I feel like a total tool for even saying this because I have never felt that way in my life. I have student loans, rent, car payment and I'm about to get married. I can't sleep because I'm constantly thinking about work, I can barely eat and I'm beginning to take it out on my woman when I get home(she's a great person and doesn't deserve this). On top of all of this I'm still making an entry level salary and honestly if I was making twice the amount I still don't think I could take this job. I have voiced my concerns and was told ""I don't care"" or ""I'll just find someone else to do it"".

Let me say that my boss(owner of the company) doesn't know the complexities of the things he asks for and constantly tells me ""It's easy, I can do that."" and that to me is the most infuriating part. He thinks he knows web development but he's a business man not a developer. Here's and example. He discovered ""inspect element"" in chrome and asked me to literally build a copy of a site he found online. I told him it would take me a couple weeks to build. ""Just copy all the code from inspect element"" he says and acted like I was lying when I told him it doesn't work like that. Anyhow, the list goes on and on and on. 

For the past couple weeks I have been job searching and have actually had a promising interview a couple days ago and have a couple more interviews lined up for next week. The one thing that I do like about the company are my coworkers and manager. We all have an awesome relationship and actually met up outside of work sometimes. I just want to leave though and move on to another job with less stress and demanding work. I feel like a pussy and like I want a pity party but it's not that. I'm burnt the fuck out and need to leave for my own mental health.

My delamma - Would it be wrong for me to put in my 2-weeks(after I find something else) and dip out leaving them with an unfinished project that they are really counting on? I know it would take them quite a while to find a dev to pick up all of my projects. I'm depressed and hating life right now but I don't want to fuck my coworkers over. I just need to lookout for my own well being even if that means taking a pay cut.

Tldr: Overwhelmed, frustrated and burnt out web developer  that wants something new but in the middle of a long project that will most likely drag for another year or more. my mental state is in serious decline and I'm interviewing for other jobs. Am I a dick to put in my two weeks and leave projects unfinished?

Typed all of this on my phone. Please forgive my long list of errors. "

I don’t really know how to bring up how bad I feel, so please bear with me.  I’m 38 years old, my marriage is failing (or has failed) miserably, despite all my efforts.  Years of effort on my part to be a good husband have been pretty much flushed down the drain, and I’m sure that’s the source of a lot of my pain, along with various other catalysts. 

I’m not the sort to try to find fault for bad situations in others, and I take full blame for any wrong-doings I may commit, but I honestly don’t know how much more I could have done to be a good husband, short of being rich and/or have movie-star good looks.  I paid attention, did the little things to keep her happy as well as the big.  She had control issues (probably because she was the victim of a rape years before I met her), and so I bent and contorted and broke my back to be what she said she needed when she said she needed it, but it was never enough.

I know that’s not my fault.  I know it’s not necessarily her fault, either, although I could have done without the cheating.  I don’t know if the fact she was never really mean about it makes it less bad, but she’s said that it was nothing I did that made her be unfaithful.  She’s said I was the perfect husband, and wasn’t even sarcastic about it.  And I know I was, because I never worked so hard at anything else in my life than trying to keep her happy.

We were happy for a while, but she can’t stay happy.  We have a seven year old daughter, and I think that kept things pleasant for a while, but the more independent our kid got, the more my wife started to drift again, until finally she was no longer happy or able to try to be.

Twice she’s asked for a divorce, but then took it back.  Two years ago she stopped any kind of physical contact with me.  Shortly after that, I moved to the couch (thanks to having a two-bedroom apartment), and that’s where I’ve been since.  Well, I graduated to a camping cot and a memory-foam mattress topper a couple months ago, and I die inside every time I think of it.

I can’t move out because we don’t have enough money between us for me to be able to afford my own place and all the accompanying expenses plus be able to make sure my daughter is fully provided for.  So I’m stuck.  And I’m dreading the day my daughter grows up enough to realize that what is going on isn’t normal.  I wanted her to have a complete, happy family, something my wife and I never had growing up.  It was one of the main reasons I was willing to be so patient with my wife.  But now, every day is another day closer to my daughter’s heart being broken, and the thought of that crushes me.

I almost wish we were at each other’s throats, but when I stopped fighting for us to stay together, she almost instantly became a lot easier to live with.  And while I know it’s her guilt for putting me through all she has over the years and is trying to make my current living situation as painless as possible, it’s just keeping me emotionally confused.  I have a knee-jerk reaction of hope after any kind act she does for me.  And then, of course, the instant let-down when I remind myself that she’s just being nice because she feels bad about actively destroying my life.

I had cancer 8 years ago and almost died.  Another two weeks or so without action and my stage 3 cancer would have probably gone terminal.  Two major surgeries on my neck in two weeks (the first of which almost killed me because an intern nicked the carotid artery sewing me back up), and two weeks later I was back at work.  I was working through a year of chemo and a month of radiation.  I never took the time to recover, and life has been one obstacle after another since.  I didn’t think at the time it was a big deal, but these days I feel like maybe I didn’t take enough time to focus on myself and heal.

Ever since then, finances were south of red despite my working almost 80 hours a week, and my wife working full-time.  Four years ago, she went back to school for a third degree that she could actually use to get a job, and in the process had to quit her job, making me responsible for almost all of the money coming in.  I was working 100+ hours a week, losing my mind and having to juggle expenses and loans.  I worked my ass off, hustling extra work wherever I could, and not having any sort of a sleep schedule.  18 months later she graduated and got a great new job and I guess since my usefulness was basically over, that’s when I got kicked to the curb.  

We’re just finally back to being able to keep some of the money we make, but easing that pressure barely did anything to diminish how shitty I feel.  

It’s a physical pain, and these days it’s constant.  It feels like any smile I have is forced because I just can’t feel happy anymore.  I always feel on the verge of tears, and sometimes I catch myself welling up without even realizing it.  

Anything good that happens is immediately overshadowed by all the crap, and I can’t bring myself to feel good about anything.  I’m stressed out from work and home.  I don’t have anywhere to escape to because my bedroom is the living room, and any time I get to myself is at the whim of the two other people in the apartment.  I live on one end of a couch, a folding cot, and some of the pantry where I keep my clothes.  I go to bed and wake up each morning with a reminder of where my life currently is.

I don’t have anyone to talk to.  I stopped talking to anyone, which was easy because the only friends I had were my wife and people on the internet.  They’ve been trying to message and text me, but I can’t bring myself to even read what they say, because I know I’ll feel worse for it.  It’s not their fault, and I appreciate their concern, and I feel shitty for dropping out, but I can’t people right now.  All I have to talk about anymore is how crappy everything is, and I don’t want to be *that* friend.  

It’s not healthy, I know, but I also know I would be a terrible friend, and no one else should have to deal with what I’m going through right now.  Everyone has their own problems, and I don’t want to be a burden to them, especially since I don’t have it in me to do the same for them.

I miss physical contact.  Even at the worst of times, my wife and I were still physically involved.  I used to kiss her goodbye every morning and tell her I love her.  These days we don’t even say goodbye when one of us leaves for work.  We just walk out the door.  Just another reminder about my life first thing in the morning that I could do without, but my ever-diminishing pride won’t let me be the first one to break that silence.  I get hugs from my daughter every day, of course, but of course that’s not what I mean.  (And before anyone tries to offer up “live for your daughter” as advice, I already am.  It’s just not enough to make me happy.  I do everything for her, but I need more than that.)  

Of course, I live on a cot in a living room I pay $1100 a month for, so even if I were to go out and find someone willing to touch me, it’s not like I have anywhere to bring them.  Plus, thanks to my hectic work schedule, stress and depression, and my sleeping arrangement, I’m in the worse shape of my life with no real time or energy to get to a gym.  I’ve never been this fat, but even on nights I’m not working, I’m not able to get to sleep because of insomnia from being in my head too much.  I spend way too much time playing video games these days because it’s all that helps me escape my own thoughts for a while.  Add to it all that thanks to cancer surgery and treatments, my neck is all scarred up and my mouth looks like a meth addict’s.  All I have is personality, and I’ve gone and lost that, too.

I feel so alone.  I keep wanting to reach out, but I have a hard enough time just writing this out anonymously to post a wall of text most people won’t bother going through.  I’ve been wanting to do this for weeks, but this was the first time I’ve been able to really sit down and spell it all out.  I’m already socially awkward enough on my best days, and I’ve never been one to have a lot of friends, but I’m okay with it.  I just don’t have anyone to confide in now.  Opening up on a personal level was never a strong point of mine, either.  I have a hard time convincing myself that my problems actually matter.

It’s just really bad now.  I’m not suicidal, because if anything, I could never do that to my daughter.  I just really need to stop hurting.  It’s getting in the way of everything, and it’s getting far too difficult to put on a normal face every day.

Today is Mother’s Day, and I guess in a way it’s what has me posting this, because I spent time today making sure she’d have a good one.  I did it for my daughter so she could have something to give her for mother’s day, but I made sure it was something she’d like, and I’ll be taking them to a nice restaurant for dinner.  And part of me is proud that I did that, but the other part is pissed off because it feels weak that I would look out for her happiness even after everything she’s done to make me unhappy.  But I did it anyway.

I lost a hometown friend to suicide, I lost my main friend group because I ended a 1.5yr relationship during the previous semester/ winter break, and due to layoffs at GTRI I lost my main source of income, a student assistant job. The stress weighed on me so much that I feel like my immune system took a toll because I was sick several times throughout the semester.


I started with 5 classes and, knowing I was suffering, I dropped to only 2 on drop day but I ended the semester with what looks like 2 D's (what I saw in T-Square) in 2 major classes. 


I'm a junior and throughout my time at Tech I've been mostly an A and B student (1 C) with 12 to 14 hr course loads. After drop day I tried to seek help for depression off-campus by making an appointment with a psychologist to become a patient, waiting a month for said appointment, only for me to see them and then have them tell me that they were no longer accepting new patients and to try another place. I then tried to find another under my insurance, but no place could see me in time for me to get real help before the semester ended and now I'm going for a summer internship in CA and I've already made an appointment for me to see a psychologist there.


I'm asking for advice because I'm at a total loss on how I should go about seeking help from Georgia Tech/ reporting my depression and asking for some type of forgiveness. I never went to the GT counselling center because I was told I'd be told to seek help off-campus anyway. What do you guys suggest I do and what experiences have you had before? "

I have been accepted everywhere except Waterloo CS which was my first choice and I cant quite decide which one to pick out of these two options. Please help me decide.

I am more interested in the software field than the hardware, its not that I don't enjoy physics or sciences. Its just that I prefer software and theory based math. I want to work in the software field but it may be nice to have hardware related options in case I change my mind, I am very career focused and don't exactly care about grad school or research opportunities. 

The only reason I liked Waterloo is because of their career focus, their industry connections, and their startup scene and things like entrepreneur option. It feels that Waterloo has a lot to offer in terms of career opportunities. The most appealing thing is their coop program which I hear almost everyone gets a job from. I also hear that towards the last work term, almost everyone who put an effort in ends up working at their desired type of workplace, whether that is a big company in silicon valley or a startup that gives a lot of freedom. 

I understand that toronto offers a lot of opportunities as well(PEY) and students can do internships during summer but it doesn't feel nearly as comparable in terms of opportunities due the amount of companies that reach out to waterloo through their jobmine. I hear that students from Waterloo get an insane amount of interview practice while toronto students find it much more difficult scoring interviews because its not as spoon fed as Waterloo. I have heard that it is difficult but possible to score interviews in first and second year at toronto while at Waterloo my friend got tons of interviews in his first year and many offers. My problem is that if I end up going to Waterloo I will probably have an insane schedule learning all the hardware stuff while I will end up going in the software field regardless. Another problem is that engineering will not give me flexibility to do side projects and the I fear that the course load will be insane. 

In terms of campus, location, and my personality, Uoft is a much better fit. I personally found Waterloo to be quite dead when I talked to engineers or visited the campus. In comparison, Uoft gave me a much more enthusiastic vibe and the diversity was quite appealing. Most importantly, there is a lot more to do around the campus. I am an outgoing person and the C. Eng program at Waterloo seems very busy and in all honesty depressing.

Sorry for the long post, I am just so unsure about which one to pick. Any insight would be appreciated.

tldr: toronto campus and life is preffered. CS is more flexible and more in line with my interests. Waterloo has more career opportunities. Spoon fed Coop system. Even first years score tons of interviews. I can still go into software field from C. Eng. but have to take a lot of stressful courses that I don't want to. More learning on the job. good jobs by the fourth work term. Toronto harder to score interviews and have to hunt more. Waterloo entrepreneur options and startup scene.

4iepf1,79,2016-05-08,New grad in ICU [One year later],CalescentNocturne,nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/4iepf1/new_grad_in_icu_one_year_later/,"Hello fellow nurses!

I see a lot of students and aspiring RNs posting on this sub and one topic that I hear discussed is new grads in the ICU. You'll hear many different sides but I just wanted to share my personal experience. 

I literally just finished my last day of work. I have been with the US hospital for 12.5 months, so almost exactly a year. We were a large hospital and a specialty floor so I saw a lot of shit. I started as a new grad with a BSN. I moved very far from home for the opportunity, and in retrospect I'm glad I did. 

As a student I always thought I wanted to do ED. I knew I was pretty energetic and loved excitement, so emergency medicine caught my attention. As I continued through school I discovered a deep interest for the complexities of patho. As I learned more and more about different types of nursing, ICU began to become my new priority and I ended up pursuing this as my senior internship. 

My first day in the ICU I knew immediately I loved it. It was terrifying, there was so much I didn't understand, so many learning opportunities (spoiler, I'm a nerd) and much excitement to be had. As a student I was safe; I didn't have any of my own responsibilities and could just sponge up the whole experience. Eventually I gained some trust from RNs to do menial tasks and perfected the 'fly on the wall' approach to seeing new things. 

Flash forward a few months, NCLEX stress and bs, even more stressful job searching, couple interviews couple let downs, on a plane, in a new city, interview, apartment hunting, job offer. 

Before I knew what I was really doing I packed whatever I could fit in my car and started a new life, new job, new everything.

My first day as an RN in the ICU was terrifyingly awesome. I didn't sleep much, how could I? I was about to get paid for doing what I'd been paying to do for the last few years; the psychology of it all was great. At first, I was very cautious. Everything scared me to touch and I always had to watch someone do something before I would do it. My orientation was three months full time, 12 hr dayshift. My preceptor and I got along extremely well, so that really helped the process. 

Every single day I learned something new and I still continue to. I know that is so common to hear, but that's because it's so true. And just when I'm feeling smart, there's always something to make you feel humbled because you never would have seen it coming. Doctors would love to quiz me on things to see how well I knew my patient (hint: they love objective information). I made it a point to ask everybody questions. Always introduce yourself, compliment people, smile at them. Even if they're miserable people they're caught off guard by that and will be nice back especially since they don't know you. You're no longer a fly on the wall, but now a person on the unit, a coworker.

People get used to you. You learn, you adjust. I went home and studied everyday for the first month. I'm not kidding, every single day I wasn't working I was determined to know what I was doing. I started knowing things other nurses didn't, or had forgotten. I was still the newbiest of noobs but I gained respect from some. 

After three months of orientation I was on my own, with my own two person assignment. Now however, I'm on 12 hour nights. Learning a whole new crowd was a bump, but I sort of knew people already from shift report so it wasn't bad. Night shift was my jam. The nurses were younger, the doctors were somewhere (sleeping...?), and management was never a thing I had to worry about. Things were chill because the mentality is different at night. 'Fix them during the day and keep them alive at night' or 'we'll see how they do overnight' were common ideals with the large team of providers that are only rounding in the daytime. Our poor night doc was always overwhelmed, which gave the nurses a lot of responsibilities. 

One year later and I feel very comfortable in the environment. I'd say after about 8 months my enthusiasm mellowed wayyy out and the job became a job. Even though I had exciting days still, a lot of what I had viewed as exciting turned into monotony which progressed to boredom. This might sound awful but I would secretly wish for codes or for someone to decomp. just for something new. I wish death upon no one, but I'm just saying if it's gonna happen, I wanted to be there. 

By the one year mark, I was ready to move on. Could I have learned more on the unit? 100% yes for sure. I would have continued to learn everyday. But I'm stir crazy in both my personal and professional life and made the decision it was time to go. 

I'm travel nursing now in the ICU but that's a different story altogether! Many people discouraged me from starting in the ICU as a new grad, but I was persistent. I had many things line up for me to make this experience possible, but if it can happen to me, it can happen to you. If the thought of studying after work or annoying your entire staff with any and every question you can think of is not appealing to you, then ICU may not be a good fit. Floor nurses, ED nurses, every type of nursing has a totally different mentality. There is no better or worse, just what is more fit for the environment. Obviously I'm still a new nurse, but I'm riding my one year wave right now and it feels great so let me roll with it. 

For anyone who actually read that, much appreciated! I planned on this being a brief post but it became very therapeutic for me so thank you for listening. Maybe I helped give someone some good advice/inspiration. The profession is quite intricate but truly a brilliant job decision in today's world. I'm excited to see what my second year has to offer and I'm hopeful that you find your own niche if you haven't already!"
4iewnq,1,2016-05-08,Please critique my insurance resume,SnackyFace,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/4iewnq/please_critique_my_insurance_resume/,"http://docdro.id/mtaRyqL

This is my new resume that I have been working on since I've developed more experience. The internship is there because otherwise I have to show a 1 year gap in employment- I feel this would be better.

The insurance industry for underwriting likes their continuing education so I made a page outlining what I've done. If you have suggestions on what to do with it please let me know. I was thinking of potentially putting a ""skills and technology"" section in there to talk about things such as windows, microsoft office including excel with formulas &amp; pivot tables, and CRM software. Would it be reasonable to make that section underneath the education?

Any feedback is greatly appreciated, thank you!"

Probably on some clothes that I wore, and it spread onto my skin. No big deal. Just got prescribed some cream. 

But Nmom knows 'what's best for me' because 'she cares about me'. This includes her saying that the fungus is probably in my clothes that are on my carpet. I don't wear the clothes that are on my floor, because I have to wear professional clothing for my internship every day, so I just stick with the clothing in my closet. But that must be the cause! it can't be anything else! Even though I don't wear those clothes anymore. Okay then. 

And the carpet is FULL of fungus, because of the clothing. She would know, and I wouldn't. Okay then. 

She washed my clothes and blankets because fungus may be on them. Whatever. No big deal. But then she puts them on the carpet. The same carpet that MUST have fungus everywhere. I point this out and 'Oh. Well, maybe it's not in the carpet.' So... Which is it? 

The blankets are still really damp, they were not dried properly. She refuses to try and dry them again. They can create some mold because they are that wet. And guess what mold is? If you said a type of fungus, you are correct! This brings us back to square 1. 

She then wants me to remove the sheets on my bed that she said I could have, and put the damp ones on my bed. I said 'No, because they are wet' She said 'It's not that big of a deal.' I replied ' If you need sheets, why don't you use the ones that you just washed?' Silence. No reply. Well, except the fact that she left the house without saying 'Goodbye'. 

Okay. Thanks, Nmom. "
4iffz0,2,2016-05-08,Keep beater (and possibly repair) vs. new car?,rfinder1,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4iffz0/keep_beater_and_possibly_repair_vs_new_car/,"TLDR: **Skip to second paragraph**. First paragraph is my budgeting habits and some background.  I have a beater, which needs a ton of repairs.  I will have ~11k from internship in order to buy a new car for comfort, reliability, and most importantly ease of mind.  Should I buy the new car OR get a shop to repair the old and invest the money?

___

I have read X amount, what do I do with it? I don't plan on starting an emergency fund (parents are helping me for the bare necessities, I am under their health/dental insurance). I don't impulse buy, I usually shop online and I sleep on buying decisions (for several days sometimes). I put 1k from my part-time job into a vanguard retirement account and 500$ into savings. **I am a college student with no debt and will have an internship in the fall that pays 20/hour for 5 months (about 85 days) (not trying to brag; this, I think, will be important later to my decision-making).** This equals approx. 14k, so that you guys don't have to do the math (if u want to feel free).  Housing payments during internship will not come out of my pocket. Generally, I will pay only for groceries/food which, based on my current habits, cost ~$250-~$350 approximately.  I don't eat out often, maybe once/twice a month never trying to go above 10-15, I get lunch meals below 5-7 dollars, and I almost exclusively shop at Aldi's purchasing only the essentials (buying snacks twice a month or by necessity to stave off hunger).  I will cap spending at 400/month for food, gas at 40/month, 1k or 200/month buffer for random things like having fun or going out which automagically reduces **my gross income from 14k to 11k.**
____

I want to portray myself as a very frugal, money-conscious, person. Also, my parents will me ~8k to help pay for a car but I have seen their finances (80k income combined, no debt/mortgage) and I want them to spend as little as possible, considering they pay almost 8k for me being at college for two semesters.

**This is what I need help with.**

I have a beater, which needs several repairs: coolant leak, transmission fluid leak (both near the radiator), and generally fearful of transmission giving out (learned this with scare stories online).  I bought it for $3,000 since October and drove it for a good 5k miles. I spent $100 on maintaining it myself so far. I regret buying this car.

Because of my comfort level with this beater, I want to let it go for a newer car that will have warranties (that has depreciated in cost EXTREMELY, yet, ironically, extremely reliable). I plan on purchasing a 1-3 year old model of a car to take advantage of the depreciation and still have warranties. I hope to ""loan"" interest-free money from my parents (who are willing) and pay it off when I complete my job. First of all, a reliable car will get me to work CONSISTANTLY vs the beater which may break down at any second (costing me implied costs of employment, losing income, and bad references).

It may sound extremely clear to get the new car, but here are the caveats:

*   I want to learn how to repair my car for personal satisfaction.
* I hate negotiating with people.  I just want to see the price and pay that price, no hidden costs, no commission pressuring. I want **WYSIWYG**.
*  I don't know what to do with my old car. 
* My parents can't help me find or sell  something, since they live in Hawaii, all of this will be happening in the South.
*  Are there any reliable cars being sold at the 11k price-point with several year warranties (about 2yrs minimum)?
* Should go to the shop, pay the 1k-2k car repairs for this beater, hope it runs smoothly, and invest the 11k?"

I unexpectedly did better than I thought (I thought I would legitimately get a B in three of my classes) so I think I stand a decent chance at a masters if I don't screw the next 2 semesters up. I intend on using this summer to prepare for the GRE and better internships for next spring and/or summer as well as work at the internship I have already. I want to focus my goals as early as possible and be realistic. 

Profile: 

* Current sophomore in CS, school ranked ~50. 

* 3.9/4.0 GPA, 4.0 Major GPA (One A-, B, C+, everything else A's and A+'s). 

* Listed as an author on a paper that will be submitted to conferences soon, my own project next semester. Project is on Security and ML (my contributions are fairly minimal, to the pipeline). 

* Targeting 3 - 4 industry internships by the time I graduate at 2 - 3 companies (no big names yet, hopefully next summer). 

* Taking GRE in the fall or next spring - SAT wise I was 700M, 800CR (strange for someone in engineering yes). 


Currently I'm looking at the following schools: 

Target: 

* UNC-CH

* Duke

* UW-Madison

* Penn State

(Last two with PI recommendation, who has connections at both). 

Reach: 

* UWash

* Columbia

* UPenn 

* Harvard CSE

* CMU 

* Stanford 

My primary impetus for wanting to do a masters is: 

1) Learn more about topics that aren't well covered in the CS program in my own undergraduate school, like Machine Learning, NLP, and Computer Vision.

2) Make up for my undergrad school's relatively low ranking, name recognition and recruiting ability for the ""hot"" ""startups""  and financial firms (Oculus, Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, Citadel, Palantir, 2Sigma). However, we/I have good connections with Microsoft, IBM Research, Google, NVidia and the like. *IMO, this is the weakest reason to do an MS*. 

**Note**: I have already brought up many of these questions with advising at my own school and my professor, but many are steering me towards PhD programs or are not knowledgeable about admissions requirements at higher ranked schools (which is fair of course, they do vary quite a bit). 

Questions: 

1) What schools are completely out of reach? Are there any that I should consider?

2) I like research, but I currently do *not* want to spend 4-6 years on a PhD, so I'm going for a MS instead. The conventional wisdom on this subreddit appears to be that MS programs are *generally not worth it* if a visa isn't involved. 

3) Should I focus in on a research Masters or a coursework Masters? Is a coursework Masters even worth it immediately after college?

4) What would the timeline be for graduate admissions? I intend to also interview at Big4 + Local companies before I graduate as a fallback - if I receive offers from one, would I have enough time to weigh a graduate admission as well, if that does happen?

5) If I do a coursework MS without fellowships, could it still pay off with a higher starting offer at an established company or startup? My current interest is in an ML Scientist position or similar, but I know many of those are PhD's only. 

6) If I'm not targeting a PhD, how much will my current coursework concentrations matter? I intend on taking all of the Computer Science classes related to ML/NLP/CV available, but I have only taken the major requirements for Math and nothing more. Would it be worth it to take Differential Equations, more advanced Statistics *purely* for purposes of admissions for a coursework masters? What about for a research masters?

I end up at my best friend's house, and he has seizures now so he constantly wants me to drive over there. He doesn't put gas in my car, he refuses to get a reliable part time job, he sits on his ass all day because he's depressed and sad. Which I totally fucking get, because I went through that for three months last summer after a break up where I didn't want to get out of bed. My dad kicked me out of the house a shit ton last summer just because I didn't have the kitchen perfectly spotless when he got home. My point is: a lot of his depression would be taken care of if he kept himself busy and distracted. But he doesn't listen, saying he doesn't want to plan anything until he knows what's wrong.

""I don't want to have a seizure at work."" 

I understand that, but you have to do something besides whither away in your house. You just lost your driving priveleges because you've been lying to your family about your seizures. 

Its showering every day, cooking yourself food, getting out of the house that will help you. Not wallowing around smelling like shit and spending your mom's money on stupid shit. 

Thanks, by the way, for sharing the sex we had with your family and tell them that I was your, ""cum dumpster,"" all last summer. I slept with you because I was hurting and wanted to feel better. I will not sleep with you again. 

You're my best friend. I should be able to talk with you about anything. But you freak out the minute sex is brought up. Or anything that you don't like. I tried to talk to you about this asshat guy and all I got was, ""I'm too tired to care right now.""

von diesem Wahlergebnis wurden wir überrascht. In der vergangenen Koalition haben wir vieles geleistet und auf den Weg gebracht: Wir haben Familien durch das neue Vaterschaftsurlaubsgesetz gestärkt, jedem einzelnen durch das Cannabiskontrollgesetz zu mehr Freiheiten verholfen und nicht zuletzt die EU, deren Parlament wir heute gewählt haben mit aufgebaut.

Mit Bedauern nehmen wir wahr, dass die Wähler diese Leistungen nicht in dem Maße gewürdigt haben, wie wir es uns erhofft hatten. Mit Freude und Engagement hätten wir erneut den Kanzler gestellt und Deutschland weiterhin verlässlich führen wollen.

Doch blicken wir in die Zukunft. Der heutige Abend verlangt ohne Zweifel eine interne Aufarbeitung. Danach hoffe ich, dass die CDU und ihre Mitglieder mit neuem Elan und größerer Aktivität in die neuen Aufgaben gehen, die sich uns stellen werden.

Eine Entscheidung über die Beteiligung an einer Koalition haben wir am heutigen Abend noch nicht getroffen. Wir werden, wie vor der Wahl angekündigt, mit denjenigen Parteien sprechen, mit denen wir inhaltliche Übereinstimmungen vorfinden und gleichzeitig intern entscheiden, ob wir die nächste Legislaturperiode in der Regierung oder in der Opposition verbringen wollen.

Zum Abschluss möchte ich betonen, dass /u/quillsandsofas und ich trotz des schlechten Ergebnisses unsere Parteiämter nicht aufgeben werden. Wir wollen daran mitarbeiten, die Partei zu neuer Stärke zu führen und weiterhin das zu vertreten, was uns bei der letzten Wahl stark gemacht hat: Eine Politik frei von Ideologien, die die Zukunft dieses Landes und der Menschen im Blick hat.

Ich danke von Herzen allen Wählern und Wahlkämpfern, die für ein besseres Ergebnis gearbeitet haben, aber trotz allem hoffentlich weiter zur CDU stehen werden. Selbstverständlich gratulieren wir auch den übrigen Parteien, insbesondere Linkspartei und FDP zu ihren Ergebnissen und freuen uns auch weiterhin auf konstruktive Zusammenarbeit!"

On the other hand, I could just get my BS and work for an IT field and have the company pay for my MA (if not I could try to get it on my own), I will rather do programming than any nuclear-related stuff so I have built this table.

I am trying to decide what I should do vs what I think I should, how to ultimately decide ? I know the final decision will be mine no matter what people say but if anyone of you has ever felt this way and chose something over the other, what was the deciding factor and do you regret not doing something while you had the opportunity ?"

With that being said, my parents constantly bad mouth each other to me and my siblings. To the point where I just feel so uncomfortable.

Recently, I needed someone to watch my puppy because he was sick and I had prior responsibilities. Since it was near my dads house, I asked my step-mother to do so. She didn't mind at all. Being that the responsibilities had to do with my mother, I was forced to bring her with me to drop my puppy off. No big deal. But when I came to pick him up, my mom was in my car and my dad and step-mother freaked out at me for bringing her to their home. I understand them being upset, but I didn't have another choice.
This led me to realize how much my father abandoned me for his new family. He has gone on multiple vacations with her kids and I have never been invited once. (In a span of 7 years.)

On the other hand, I have my mother who is single and has very few friends. I'm currently living with her while I finish up my degree because it's cheaper than having rent while I finish my internships. I constantly express my plans on moving somewhere else in the country because the town I live in is one big retirement city and I want to try something new. She makes me feel like shit about it because I am ""leaving her all alone"" and that she ""might as well die"". It's an extremely negative environment for me but I don't really have a choice until I graduate.

With this being said, I am considering cutting both my parents out of my life. I've been going to therapy for the past 4 months to help deal with the stress of them. I love my parents and would rather them support me and not bring me into their negativity but I think their stubbornness will not allow it. I'm about to start my career as a teacher that I have worked hard for over the past few years. (I'm a 4.0 student)

Am I wrong for feeling this way? Is there a better option?"

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

Moving from a laptop to a desktop. The computer will mostly be used for 3-d Cad modeling for engineering purposes, some computer programming, Lots of multitasking for homework purposes and some light gaming with games like kerbal space program, fallout and skyrim.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for?**

I'm not very informed on graphics and frame rates as the majority of gaming I do now is on console. However, I would expect to run fallout and skyrim with as good and better graphics and FPS then my Xbox one.

I have lurked around for a long time here and this is my first time posting. I am a PhD student in a STEM field at a top 5 research university. I just got an offer for an internship from a pretty big company. They are offering $30/hour which is just about average. After doing some research, I have put down a good list of reason making my case about why I should get paid more; I'm asking for $33-35/hour. 

Some additional info: I presently make the graduate student stipend, which is about the same when considered per hour. Also, I do not have any other offers. 
 
I would like to know if it is common for student interns to make negotiations or will there be any possibility of them withdrawing the offer. 

Thanks. "
4igu5e,10,2016-05-08,[Hiring] Graphic designer to create stylized word art,trindyco,forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/4igu5e/hiring_graphic_designer_to_create_stylized_word/,"Hello, we're looking to hire a graphic designer to create an eye-catching, stylish, and modern stylized word art of the phrase ""**Be a Part of Something Bigger This Summer**"". There may be another more accurate term to describe the type of design I am going for, but my description is going to have to suffice for now. I have provided examples from around the web that I like, and that you can draw some inspiration from. You'll find those links below. I have also included a link to a graphic I made (that everyone seems to dislike, and I dislike as well) as an example of what not to do. 

The purpose of this graphic is to replace the existing hero image on this website: https://trindy.co/hacktern which is a web page that promotes our team's summer internship program. It should invoke a sense to the reader of wanting to be a part of something larger than themselves. The graphic will also most likely be used in some ads that promote the website. 

For the most part, you have a good amount of creative freedom here, provided you stick to the core idea of what I'm trying to accomplish. The actual phrase itself must remain unchanged however. You may use any fonts you'd like, as long as they are easily legible both at larger and smaller sizes. Capitalization is also up to you, should you find that certain words look better all caps or all lowercase, etc.. I had the idea that the word ""bigger"" should be just that, bigger than all the rest of the words. This seems to make sense to me, but I'm not a pro graphic designer like you ;p 

We do have some colors that are a part of our color palette already, you can find a link to our brand colors below. Make a best-effort attempt to at least work in some of these colors, although I understand if it's not possible to incorporate all of them. 

Requirements for final deliverables: Must be created in Adobe Illustrator or other vector graphics software. You can send me an .ai, .eps, or .svg file. NO Photoshop PSDs or other non-vector format files. If you're using custom fonts in the artwork, convert them to outlines please and document all the fonts used, in case we want to know what they are. *We're looking to have this completed very quickly, within the next day or so if possible. We're willing to be flexible on the timing, to be realistic of course.* 

Payment details and budget: *We're looking to spend about $250USD on this single graphic.* Payment via any way you choose, as long as it accepts PayPal :) Upwork sucks, but if that's what you want to use, I can do that too. We always pay on-time, usually within minutes of accepting the final deliverable. 

Please PM me with your contact details (Skype is always preferred for us), an estimation of the time and cost you think it will take for you to complete the work including a delivery date, and examples of past work of your own (link to portfolio is fine). Extra kudos if you show me examples of similar word art that you've created, or that you think match the style of what we're going for (don't have to be your own). 

**Links:**
Some ideas of what we like: http://imgur.com/a/5X5mA

My friend devised a plan in which I slowly start moving my stuff out of the house and by graduation I should be able to say sianara to my family. My problem is I don't know if I want to move in with my friend. Her family is amazing and very open and welcoming however her boyfriend and his best friend are already practically living there. They keep clothes in her closet to change into after they get off work. And I don't mind them. I work with her BFs best friend so I know him pretty well and I used to work with the bf. But I am reeeeeally not a people person and I've almost always had my own room and currently my own section of the house so I never really have to deal with people being near me when I'm home.

I don't want to come crawling home 2 weeks into this and have my mother treat me like an even bigger piece of shit than she already does. I don't have any money saved because my hypocritical mother makes me pay for everything (she chastises other parents that make their kids pay for things that a parent would normally pay for but the second I got a job she started doing the *exact same thing* ) and I really just don't know what to do. Will I get sick of my friend? Will I blow up at her? (I will probably blow up at her annoying ass younger brother, he's 14 and acts 8) Will my friend decide I'm not worth helping and tell me to leave? How much money will her mother ask for?

So I met this girl last year and we really hit it off but after some time she went away on an internship abroad. I didn't give it much thought except the fact that she was showing many IOI's  and that I was kinda in to her.

Fast foward, she came back an I set up a coffee date between the 2 of us and it went very well, lots of bantering and flirting etc.

One day later I text her that I had a good time to which she replys that she really enjoyed it and that we should do it again.

I wait one week while texting her (in her texts she seems really interested but sometimes takes some time to answer) now and then and ask her out on a dinner date.

She said she already had plans with her friend that day and that she was kinda low on money that month and asked if we could reschedule for next month for a coffee date (this month).

Right now I'm kinda confused, cause she seems interested in her texts(even in that last text she was nice and said that she was sorry for not replying earlier) but i didnt take this last text very well. I told to give me a call whenever she wanted to go out.

Trp tells us to be show interest and go after what we want but also tells us to be the flame not the moth. So I don't know if I should text her and try to set up a date or just wait for her to text me(and if she doesn't, next her).

What's the Trp course of action guys?"

* Beginner Programmers who lack CS fundamentals (OOP/DS/OS/Algorithms/Multithreading/etc)
* Anything in between 

I'm especially confused because some of these full-time junior developer positions seem like they require less knowledge/skill than an intern at a decent company. And then some people say New Grads are Software Engineers but not Junior developers...?

Do some companies just not have full-time Junior developer positions at all?

To compound the matter, the same individual graded the Eagle's draft as roughly a B/B+, while the lowly, hopeless Cowboys only earned a D. 

I understand being a homer, but I pity Philly fans, and this troll in particular.. It must be depressing watching your organization leverage two years worth of premium picks on what will be their 3rd string QB, all in the wake of Chip Kelly's Internship as a GM. 

The Cowboy's defense in 2015 wasn't bad, and it certainly wasn't the issue, health was. I like what the FO did in this draft, not just for the obvious (Zeke), but rather the later rounds: Tapper was very underrated, Prescott has a chip on his shoulder- and unlike Johnny Football, I think he puts in the necessary work &amp; preparation to become a starter, Brown &amp; Frazier both had 4th round grades from the Cowboy's scouts &amp; Gathers is low-risk, high-ceiling- imagine Antonio Gates' ability + Jason Witten's mentorship..

The plan had been for a 6-month contract with a possibility of turning full time if things went well. At my recent performance review, I was informed that they were not interested in keeping my on board after the contract ends. They said that my work has been fine, but that my shyness makes me a non-asset to the office environment. I quite like my routine of showing up around 9, eating lunch at my desk, talking only about direct work things, and leaving at 5. 

I got through school like that, socializing only with a very small group of friends. Concerned teachers tried to 'fix' me a several times over the years, but I always got good marks and was reasonably happy so just ignored them. University was even better- I studied engineering at a big 'degree factory' school where no one could have cared less as long as my fees got paid.

It feels like I'll have to fundamentally change my way of being in order to succeed as a professional. That seems futile, but I don't see another way. I chose a technical career where I just analyse data and write code all day. I thought my limited social skills would suffice in that kind of environment, but seem to be so wrong.

I've made a some good friends, but most of them moved back to their own country, so no chance for networking there. I barely scraped by with a few months volunteering in hospitals. I've got a high GPA in grad school, but that doesn't matter when I don't have experience. 


Health administration is great, if you know people, and you are a naturally social butterfly. 


I'm considering just dropping everything, and beginning fresh with computer science. Programming and math is one of the few things that makes sense to me. 

Throughout grad school, I thought about dropping out but kept going through. A part of me is telling me to just cut my losses and move on. Does this make financial sense? 



**TL;DR:** Finished grad school in health administration, no job experience in a non-technical field that requires lots of networking. I didn't network due to severe depression, so I can't find job. I'm thinking about dropping this Masters degree and moving on to computer science, which is something I love and can be really good at.

Using a throwaway here because friends know my primary. Also, I'm going to be a bit vague on the place/jobs because they're rather specific. 

I'm graduating this weekend, and up until last week, I didn't have a job, which was causing me quite a bit of worry. I have since received a job offer, but I'm not sure if I should take the job or not. Hopefully you all will be able to give me some advice from an outside viewpoint I can't otherwise get from friends or family.

To begin with, I've been in a relationship for around four years, and we had both discussed where we might want to live. We decided together that we wanted to live in a city that fit both of our wants and that we could get jobs in. At the moment, she has an internship lined up in the same city that I have a job offer, but as internships go, there is no guarantee that she will have a job there at the end of it. On top of that, she has one more semester to finish school which is in a completely different part of the U.S. than the city we had decided on. Also, and this may be the most telling thing, when I received the job offer, I wasn't relieved like I thought I would be. The job is in a very expensive city and is far away from my family. I'm having a hard time looking at this from an objective standpoint because on one hand, I do really care for my girlfriend and I do think we have a future together, but on the other hand, there are a lot of unknowns and chances that I would be taking by accepting this job. 

I know this sounds like a fairly easy decision to make, but I don't want to look back and wish I had taken a chance; however, I also don't want to get to the city and it end up being a huge waste of time and effort. 

Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance!

My older sister died my freshman year of high school and I have been battling what I'm sure is undiagnosed depression. 

This is my second year of college and I'm sitting on a fabulous 2.0 GPA because I have failed math classes and having to retake math oriented chemistry because I didn't get a good math foundation in high school since my teachers were all sports coaches who didn't give a shit about actually teaching us. I found out about a month ago that I didn't get accepted to the university I applied to, the one closest to the school my girlfriend is going to. 

I was a computer science major. I had wanted that since I was in Jr. High. I just had to change my major because there's no way I can do those high level math classes. So I switched to information Technology and I've actually enjoyed it. I've gotten over my major change. 

I feel worthless. I don't know what to do. Everyone I'm friends with just has good grades with minimal effort. I have to struggle to get out of bed in the morning and force myself to be interested. 

My internship is on the line since I had to reapply recently and im afraid they're going to give me up for some other person with a 4.0 with no experience so I won't have that. I'm afraid my girlfriend is going to leave me because I'm a fucking loser. All my friends are going off to university. I have no idea how to, or even if I can, reapply to the university.

Im not fucking stupid why does a number indicate who I am?

Unfortunately, I’ve found that a lot harder than I’ve expected it to be. Freshman year, I tried going to club meetings during the first week or two, but wasn’t really putting effort into getting to know people and talk to them, which in large part is due to my horrible social anxiety that made me afraid to speak up. It was the same thing in classes and on busses. FWIW, I’m not into the party scene; I have zero interest in frat parties, although I do often enjoy “parties"" with a small group of people, even if I’m the only one not drinking. I got along with my roommates and met some other cool people on the floor above me, and spent lots of time with these guys throughout freshman year, not really expanding my social circle much — but I was alright with that, because I was still enjoying myself.

Sophomore year, things became much worse. I did join one club because my friend is in it and he encouraged me to, and I got along with many of the people there, but still was (and still am) fairly reserved at meetings and events and didn’t/still don’t really talk to the people I met there outside of club-related stuff. I allowed myself to get terribly isolated — my friends from freshman year just wanted to sit in the room and play Smash Bros Melee all day every day, which was ok for a little but I quickly grew tired of it, and I spent most days in my room, doing homework and watching TV on my computer and not really talking to anyone outside of my roommates. Wasn’t meeting girls or new people in general, but I thought the only way to not let the feelings of extreme loneliness and social anxiety bother me was to run away from them entirely. My grades were good and that was what I was mainly focused on, so I didn’t really make an active effort to change. This continued throughout fall semester junior year, when my friends from freshman/sophomore year basically stopped invited me places for reasons I still don’t understand. I had basically nobody besides my 3 roommates and a couple of other people.

One day, around November this year, I got into a fight with one of my roommates and he stormed out of the room (we quickly made up, but that’s besides the point). While he was gone, I broke down in tears, because one of the only people who I truly felt like I had made a genuine connection in my 2+ years in college with was so pissed off at me, which really hurt. My other roommate, who knew this whole story, saw me breaking down like this, and recommended for me to get help, because he knew how long this had been going on for and knew that I couldn’t run away from this stuff forever, and he was right. 

So at the beginning of this past semester, I called up CAPS and explained a lot of my issues — social anxiety, wanting to meet girls (and guys too, but to a lesser extent) but being held back for reasons I couldn’t really explain at the time, and feelings of hopelessness and loneliness. Through individual and group sessions, I did make a lot of realizations and made some noticeable improvements. I talked to people at events and stuff (girls and guys) and even had a study session with a girl in one of my classes during finals. This summer, I’ll be working as an intern during the week (albeit an internship I only got because of nepotism) and am looking to volunteer at an animal shelter on weekends. I’m also going to keep going to individual sessions at CAPS once a week.

Before anyone asks, yes, I have reached out to some friends to talk through these things as well, and will take their advice to heart more than the advice of strangers on the internet. And yes, I know “I can’t make friends” posts are very common, but most of them are from transfer students or underclassmen, so I’m a little more panicky in the sense that I feel like I have less of an excuse, if that makes sense. All of that being said, the reason I’m posting here is because I’m looking for as many different perspectives and avenues for advice that I can possibly think of. Basically, a lot of my major concern is that I finally have a better idea of how to go about things, but I’m terrified that I might be too late. I allowed social anxiety to ruin my first 3 years of college life, and I can’t take that back. There are maybe 4 or 5 guys and exactly one girl that I can say I’ve truly developed good friendships with here, and zero romantic interests. I have an idea of clubs I might want to join for next year — is it too late to really form connections with people at clubs as a senior? While finding a girlfriend isn’t my #1 priority in this, i’d be lying if I said it wasn’t a huge motivator. Is it something that could be attainable in such a short period of time? I’ve only really pursued two girls in my life romantically before, and I have very little experience and knowledge in making connections with them (and yes, “treat girls that you’re attracted to like anyone else you come across”, I know, yadda yadda yadda). So while I’ve made good progress, I still feel like I have a really long way to go, and I’m not sure if I can get where I want to be in such a short period of time.

I realize this probably comes across and overly neurotic and paranoid, and it probably is, but whatever. One thing I’m focusing on is not giving as much of a fuck what random people think of me, and you reading this are just another one of those people, so if you think I’m a neckbeard loser who’s destined to die alone, whatever. Anyway, I’d just like some advice and assurance that I’ll be okay and that I might be able to turn things around before I drive myself insane, as it’s become increasingly difficult to focus on school and class, causing my GPA to take a moderate hit (although I’m still satisfied with what I have). Thanks a bunch if you managed to get through all that, and I appreciate the advice in advance.

**TL;DR: Lonely rising senior who fucked up my first 3 years of college socially. Have made improvements but am concerned I’m too late and am just looking for reassurance.**

Also, to any upcoming freshman or underclassman reading this: don’t let this happen to you. Make an effort in getting to know people sooner rather than later, because if you don’t, it’s gonna hit you like a ton of bricks later on.

I am 34, I live in Brisbane, I am a qualified plumber and drainer I have worked 6 years on oil and gas drilling rigs and 3 years ago I went back to school and gained access to university so I could go back to the oil and gas industry as an engineer with experience. 

But I have a feeling that a traditional trajectory of university, internship, then job might be unrealistic for me, especially at my age. 

As I stated before I wish to get back into the oil and gas industry but spending another 3 plus years in a class room is too much. 

So reddit community what suggestions do you have?

I just don't where to begin? I want to get back to the resources sector but where do I start?

Thank you.

So I’m finishing up my junior year at a large state school in the Northeastern US and I’m feeling pretty depressed about things, and would like some general advice.

Basically, I’ve always been painfully shy throughout middle school and high school; I had some good friends, but very few I saw outside of school. And it took me many years and countless crushes to ask a girl out, and when I finally did, she never really took me seriously as a romantic interest.

Having a hard time making friends in college isn't that uncommon, but it's more common for transfers, underclassmen and commuters, so I've kinda fell into panic mode more than people with those ""excuses"", if that makes sense.

4iil7o,1,2016-05-09,"My [20F] boyfriend [21M] of 2½ years is spiralling into a depression, and I don’t know what to do anymore.",DreThrowaway22,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4iil7o/my_20f_boyfriend_21m_of_2½_years_is_spiralling/,"Hello /r/relationships. Throwaway because my man knows my username.

My boyfriend and I have been together for about 2½ years now, and our relationship has been pretty great. We’re both university students, so we understand the reality of time-consuming workloads, exams, etc. We also study in two different cities, about 2h away from each other, so we only see each other on weekends, usually 2-3 times per month. We love each other very much, and we both hope to remain together for many years to come. 

Now here comes the problem. For over a year now, my boyfriend has been feeling down. He is consistently discouraged, which he claims is because of a culmination of things :

* He studies excessively hard and doesn’t get the results he wants.
* Even if he works part-time and gets money from the government, he can barely make ends meet. He refuses to ask his parents for money.
* He always needs to think about building an appropriate CV in order to get work in his field of study (participating in research, lab work, internships, etc), which is a great source of stress for him.
* His apartment is often a pigsty and he gets very little help from his roommate, which puts him in a persistently bad mood. 

He has been dealing with bucketloads of stress for over a year now, and he escapes it by playing video games (namely League of Legends). It occasionally happens that he’ll play videogames entire evenings, despite his workload. He claims that, these days, it’s the only thing that makes him happy anymore.

During this time, I’ve done what I can to help him. Whenever I had spare time, I’d help him clean his apartment and prepare meals. I’d encourage him in his studies and hold him when he needed to be held. I would do what I could that was within my capabilities.

Now, after a year of this lowered mood, I’m starting to get exhausted to a point where I become irritated at the smallest of things he does. For example, when he gives an exasperated sigh, I just groan. When he acts more or less « mopey » as a product of his discouragement, I begin to respond in a passive-aggressive tone. 

Despite the fact that I do what I can to help my boyfriend, I haven’t been all entirely helpful in this situation, especially in the last months. In a way, I’m also a source of stress or conflict. These days, I complain that he doesn’t give me enough attention, and I frequently get emotional over it. I’m excessively insecure and my biggest fear is that he’ll leave me for someone else. He’s already had a crush on one of our friends, so I know that it isn’t impossible for it to happen again. I’m consequently always asking him if he’d be happier with someone else. I know that it drives him bonkers when I act this way, but I’m working on it. I have a history of generalized anxiety disorder, and I’m currently on low doses of anti-depressants. I also frequently hurt his feelings without meaning to do so (I’m excessively expressive about my thoughts and feelings, definitely to a fault) yet he often doesn’t tell me until days after the hurt has festered into bitterness.

It almost feels like he has a black thundercloud over his head, following him around all the time. What drives me mad is that he doesn’t seem to want to help himself. I told him he should see a psychologist for his stress, depression or whatever he’s going through, but he refuses because it didn’t work for him in the past. I told him he should start exercising, but he says he doesn’t have the energy or the willpower to do so. I tell him lots of things, but it seems to frustrate him that I won’t stop trying to get him to change his lifestyle habits and the like.

In a nutshell, my man seems to be spiralling into a depression and I’m definitely not helping. It’s creating lots of conflict between us and it’s driving us apart. We just got off Skype and it came close to a break-up. I don’t know what to do anymore. 

I’m thinking that we should take a small break in order for him to get his thoughts back in order. I’m also thinking of calling his parents to inform them of his psychologically fragile state (I get along super well with his parents, and they’re very supportive of him. He just doesn’t want to burden them with his problems).

What do you guys think? I’m very terribly lost as to how to proceed.



---   
**tl;dr**: My boyfriend seems to be suffering from a depression, and I’m trying everything I can to help him but to no avail. We seem to irritate each other more than anything else, and this is causing a great deal of conflict between us. What do I do to help him?

Some features I enjoy are obviously USB3.0, a hdmi port, a SD card slot, a clicky keyboard, metal casing, decent battery life, location of the ctrl key is very important to me (very bottom left key; not one in from the left like the lenovo thinkpads). I dont need all the fancy stuff like the fingerprint reader and the touch screen.

I understand it's impossible to get all these features in a $700 or less laptop which is why I would like your help finding some options.

4iisxs,6,2016-05-09,"Me [26 M] with my coworker [23 F] of 4 months, generally bad relationship, looking for advices",Mergendil,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4iisxs/me_26_m_with_my_coworker_23_f_of_4_months/,"We came from the same school and I suspect she had a mild romantic interest (looks, body language...) toward me. She is muslim, very introverted, with one other muslim friend (which also had mild romantic interest but more straight-forward).

I wasn't really interested, never really had long exchanges with her before. I just returned the smiles, happy greetings and small talk


Beginning of the year we both got a job at a startup (begin at 5 people, now 10) and we were all smiles for a few weeks.

He job is project management and she implemented excel planification based on a tool she learned in school, I offered advices on why it was not adapted and how to adapt it but she didn't took it well. The rest of the team agreed that the tool wasn't a great fit but we complied anyway to show good will after she had a small breaking down on me saying that I wasn't trusting her skills.

On the end of the 1rst month 2 of us (not her) had to submit an important document to the local government for subventions, and I got overwhelmed by the workload as the other guy wasn't available the last two days before the deadline (lack of foreshadowing from both of us) and I asked her and my boss for help to finalize the document. She went and re-wrote the entire  thing herself (without telling me, but it was good work) and broke down on me again telling me that it was my work and not hers and I was abusive and whatnot. I stayed calm and just thanked her for the help, and yes it's my fault I should have planned ahead.

The most recent disagreement being a new intern that needed access on the shared folders to work on things. Administration of this folder was originally mine but I gave it to her as she wanted to re-organize the files. She wasn't here at the time, so I gave the access to the new guy myself (only the folder he needed)

She noticed the change, got angry and told me firmly (using short mails) that I had neither the right nor the authorization to do that. After a brief talk with her face to face (on my initiative) that didn't got anywhere, I've asked my boss who told me that it was allright. I informed her that it was okay and stopped mentioning the subject.

The same thing happened after we hired a secretary to help us on support tasks, he needed access and she wasn't there to give it. After validation from my boss that there wouldn't be any confidentiality issue (you never know) i gave it to him (took me 30sec)

Today yet again she noticed the change and got angry, sending the same short email. This time I didn't bothered to reply and directly got up to talk to her and we had an short argument (same reasons from her) in front of 2 there colleagues. 
Feeling that she was getting really angry I decided to stop arguing especially in front of the others, and gave her a list of my points by mail, which she has responded by ""Do ONLY YOUR work"".

The other colleagues supported me and told me that she was being unreasonable. 


I feel that the issue is coming from her personality (She only does her dedicated work and that's it, unless specifically told by our boss, and not without complaining.)

While I often go help others out of my way, working weekends if it's reasonably needed (she doesn't which is okay, but she also tell us that we should not do it).

Last week (before the latest disagreement) I asked her to meet me outside of the work environment to talk but she has yet to respond on this invitation. I asked her again today, she dodged the question, along with insulting me in front of our boss.

I'm seeking advice on how should I handle the matter in order to solve the situation. I really enjoy working there
   


**tl;dr**: Coworker being strict on her ""I only do my work, you only do your work"" principle, I don't agree with it and help others when needed. Things got heated and she's not open to direct communication. I'm seeking advice"
4iiyfr,3,2016-05-09,Relapsed after 5 years without self harming,velourity,selfharm,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/4iiyfr/relapsed_after_5_years_without_self_harming/,"I'm kind of curious if anyone is like me and has had a very long term but short burst issue with self harming? 

I used to scratch myself with sharp objects (just less than a cut) when I was extremely depressive in middle school. I struggled with social anxities and was bullied often leaving me wishing I wasn't around anymore. While this is where I started having suicidal thoughts I could never go to the extremes, despite the strong urge and so the harming began. I was noticed by my mom at some point or other and lied about being scratched by someone's cat. Surprisingly she dropped the issue entirely, at first I was relieved but then became even more distressed that she had suspicions and did not intervene. About 2 years later I gathered to courage to ask her to help me set up a therapy appointment as I had been depressed for quite some time without any healthy outlets. She agreed but never followed through and to this day I've never been to a therapist for any of my problems. 

About 4 years after I first started harming I became involved in an abusive relationship. I was 17 at the time and still stayed in it for a year because I don't think I realized the warning signs and then I felt trapped and unable to escape. He would yell and threaten to hit me constantly, I cried everyday and at a point eventually relapsed into self harming again. The idea of me hurting myself seemed to upset him, and feeling trapped and hurt it felt refreshing to hurt him for once. This was only a two time incident and I stopped soon after and eventually was able to leave the relationship.

I'm currently 22, a year from graduating college with my bachelor's for graphic design. I haven't thought about cutting for the last 5 years, even though I've had several pits of depression I've been to push myself through it. However at this point, after so many years of constant unhappiness and loneliness I feel like I'm at the brink of a mental breakdown. My suicidal thoughts have been more active than ever (another board I know) and not too long after a fight with my boyfriend (mostly one sided from me, I kind of just snapped) I told him about how I'm sick of being constantly unhappy. We have been dating for two years, he doesn't work so we don't get to date often, we end up spending time in the same room I contemplate ending my life in. He also doesn't have a car so all of the financial and travel responsibilities end up falling on me, I know he's trying but I don't see any change in site. I feel like an unintentional sugar mama, I always end up buying him things even though he insists I don't because I feel guilty I'm eating dinner and he's eating instant ramen. On top of that I'm crumbling under the pressures of school, a required internship and a job I hate but stick with because I need the money. I want to stay with my bf and would like to live with him some day but I feel like the future is so far away and I'm afraid I won't be able to get a job post graduation and I'll still be living at home when I'm 25. The home is the root of my depression so I need to move out. Everyday I go to sleep at 6 and wake up around 2pm spending most of the day in my room/bed and becoming stir crazy from the lack of human interaction. Sometimes I'll go a day or two without physically talking to anyone, it's been driving me crazy. I honestly wish I had friends who I could share my interests (I mostly watch anime, movies, play some video games) with. I just honestly don't have anything in common with the people I went to high school with anymore, so we've lost touch and I'm to anxious to try and meet anyone else (I've made no friends in my 4 years of college; I commute vs. live on campus). 

Tonight after fighting the urge to throw myself out the window, I resorted to heavy scratches with scissors and an x-acto knife instead. I would be lying if I said it didn't feel therapeutic but I know it is an awful habit and a difficult one to hide. I've never talked to another self harmer. What are some good alternatives? Are there any hobbies that you enjoy that help with depression? I'd like to try and work out but I'm terrified to go to the gym. I'm going to try baby steps and try to prevent another replapse from happening in the future."
4ij05u,10,2016-05-09,Does Excel remember what he calculated previously in a formula ?,ImperialBattery,excel,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/4ij05u/does_excel_remember_what_he_calculated_previously/,"Hi guys, I've got a quite short question about how Excel does calculations.

Let's say I use a formula, a big one (eg a VLOOKUP on a table with 30k+ rows), *twice* inside another formula (typically : IF VLOOKUP(*there*) returns this, then VLOOKUP(*there*)).

Do you know if Excel is programmed so that it remembers that it made the calculation the first time, and therefore can use directly the result from some kind of intern variable ? Because I don't want the VLOOKUP to be calculated twice, considering the time it takes.

I know I could calculate the VLOOKUP part in another cell and then have the 'IF' part refer to that cell, but I'd like to keep the table as straightforward as possible (I won't be the one using it).

I hope the question is clear. It's not really a problem but I didn't know how I could Google that. Thanks !

(PS : I'm using the VLOOKUP function as an example, I usually try to use its alternatives)"

I started out 3 months ago . Worked for two weeks was put on break and started again three weeks ago. Technically on paper I've been here three months but I've only worked a little over one. On ny resume I'll put three if I leave though.

My job includes about four hours of commuting through the worlds busiest city. Its an entry level job with pretty bad pay but I need the experience. This jobs also trains me so that I clocked in hours I wasn't working and on the commute. I've cleared up half with mt boss and trying to clear up the other half so I can't get sued. Its basically a mess that's caused me a large amount of anxiety.

I've been clocking half to an hr early on the way and leaving early and clock in out late. I was trained that way but It felt wrong so im clearing it up with my boss.
 however.

I keep seeing internships for $15 an hour and recently got called in for an interview for an Internship with a huge company( I have no idea if its paid)

Basically im going to go in. If its unpaid and I get it ill see if it fits into my schedule. If not ill decline. Im also signed up for another IT course so its oe or the other.

But in the event that its paid....how do I go about this? Do I say during the interview that im employed?  Can I asked if its paid? If so how?

Can I ask my new employer to give me two weeks to finish up my old job?"

I'd be grateful if any of them could be answered. It seems like some answers may depend on the individual, but thought I'd ask anyway to hear some personal experiences. 

Background:
I'm 23 year old female and was diagnosed with hypothyroidism when I was 18. Doctor decided to test me when I told her thyroid issues run in my family and that I was waking up with the bottoms of my feet numb and tingly. I'm on a low dose of levothyroxine and my dose has never changed. 

Questions:
1. I'm still having symptoms. Most people I've talked to can tell they've missed a dose of their medication because their symptoms will begin to return. However, I don't recall my symptoms EVER going away. I have almost all the textbook symptoms, but the most bothersome is fatigue and circulation issues. I got my levels checked (Free T4 and TSH) in February and everything was in normal range according to my primary. I don't recall ever getting any levels checked except for Free T4 and TSH. Could the results be wrong? Has anyone ever had symptoms despite having normal levels? 

2. Is it wise to go to an endocrinologist rather than my primary? Is there something they could tell me that my primary can't? 

3. One symptom I've always had is circulation issues. Specifically, various limbs (arms and legs) will completely fall asleep particularly when I, myself, have been asleep. Is this a common hypothyroid symptom? 

4. I've also been experiencing hair loss. I have very thin hair. Every time I run my hands through my hair and when I wash my hair, there's always strands of hair coming out. I dyed my hair 3 weeks ago to an unnatural color, they had to bleach it. Since then my hair has been falling out more than usual. It's starting to stop though. I'm gonna be dyeing it again this week to a natural color because of an internship. Is the coloring what is causing my hair to fall out or was it the bleach? I'm just paranoid about ending up with bald spots or something. 

5. Final question, I know hypothyroid is more common in females over 40 (usually have had kids by this age). I'm worried about infertility. If I was medicated appropriately would the possibility of infertility be gone completely (at least from a thyroid perspective) or is that always a possibility of you have thyroid issues despite being medicated? 

Thank you for anything you can tell me!  "

First, thank you so much in advance for your time and your help.
Currently, I am attending school in the midwest but I will have a free summer next summer (2017) before my senior year. I absolutely love the Orange County area, and am interested in the possibility of a summer internship out there. I feel that there will be a broader range of opportunities there as opposed to here in my state. I have family friends in the Laguna Hills/Mission Viejo area that I will be able to stay with, so that is not a concern.

I am currently studying Political Science with minors in Spanish and Latina/o Studies, and, ideally, I would love to work with some type of nonprofit that does social justice work. I am unsure of where to start. Could anyone give me some guidance towards nonprofits doing that kind of work in the area? I have looked at the SoCal ACLU but it looks like they only take law students. I'll take a look at anything! 

tl;dr : College student looking for a summer 2017 internship experience relating to political science/Latino communities and social justice

Thanks again!

I've been working at a company as a software developer full time for a year now. I initially started as an intern and they hired me after i graduated. The problem I am facing is that my senior software team is in another time zone, about 2 hours behind me. There are only 2 other junior developers at my location and we sometimes need guidance and its not always easy getting in contact with the 3 senior developers at the other location. 

Lately I've been feeling like my development has been hindered by the fact that i cant just walk over to someone to ask simple questions/ask for advice. Dont get me wrong i google like a mad man and only approach them if i am significantly stuck or just need general advice about our code base. But they are not always the quickest to reply which leads to down time and just general demotivation. Sometimes i just end up browsing reddit for long periods of time because im just waiting and hoping they will get back to me. Sometimes I literally have tasks in our tracker that are just so vague and i need to talk to the lead to get more details out of him, but i cant get in contact with him. 

I will say the company is planning on hiring a Senior level developer at this location to help this situation.

But I am wondering if i am being too dependent on help of others?
Should i be working even harder to finish my work without their help? 
Or is it normal to be pretty dependent when you're still new to creating actual software in a team environment?

I personally feel like after a year i should be way more comfortable than i am, but lack of guidance is the issue...

Thanks guys!"

4ikjx4,1,2016-05-09,"Soon-to-be college senior feeling lonely, depressed, and anxious, seeking some advice.",RULonely2016,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4ikjx4/soontobe_college_senior_feeling_lonely_depressed/,"Throwaway here. So I’m finishing up my junior year at a large state school in the Northeastern US and I’m feeling pretty depressed about things, and would like some general advice.

Basically, I’ve always been painfully shy throughout middle school and high school; I had some good friends, but very few I saw outside of school. And it took me many years and countless crushes to ask a girl out, and when I finally did, she never really took me seriously as a romantic interest. I came into college and saw it as an opportunity to get a fresh start, and had certain expectations for myself — I’d be able to make new friends, meet a girl, and expand my social circle. Unfortunately, I’ve found that a lot harder than I’ve expected it to be. Freshman year, I tried going to club meetings during the first week or two, but wasn’t really putting effort into getting to know people and talk to them, which in large part is due to my horrible social anxiety that made me afraid to speak up. It was the same thing in classes and on busses. FWIW, I’m not into the party scene; I have zero interest in frat parties, although I do often enjoy “parties"" with a small group of people, even if I’m the only one not drinking. I got along with my roommates and met some other cool people on the floor above me, and spent lots of time with these guys throughout freshman year, not really expanding my social circle much — but I was alright with that, because I was still enjoying myself.

Sophomore year, things became much worse. I did join one club because my friend is in it and he encouraged me to, and I got along with many of the people there, but still was (and still am) fairly reserved at meetings and events and didn’t/still don’t really talk to the people I met there outside of club-related stuff. I allowed myself to get terribly isolated — my friends from freshman year just wanted to sit in the room and play Smash Bros Melee all day every day, which was ok for a little but I quickly grew tired of it, and I spent most days in my room, doing homework and watching TV on my computer and not really talking to anyone outside of my roommates. Wasn’t meeting girls or new people in general, but I thought the only way to not let the feelings of extreme loneliness and social anxiety bother me was to run away from them entirely. My grades were good and that was what I was mainly focused on, so I didn’t really make an active effort to change. This continued throughout fall semester junior year, when my friends from freshman/sophomore year basically stopped invited me places for reasons I still don’t understand. I had basically nobody besides my 3 roommates and a couple of other people.

One day, around November this year, I got into a fight with one of my roommates and he stormed out of the room (we quickly made up, but that’s besides the point). While he was gone, I broke down in tears, because one of the only people who I truly felt like I had made a genuine connection in my 2+ years in college with was so pissed off at me, which really hurt. My other roommate, who knew this whole story, saw me breaking down like this, and recommended for me to get help, because he knew how long this had been going on for and knew that I couldn’t run away from this stuff forever, and he was right.

So at the beginning of this past semester, I called up my school's counseling center and explained a lot of my issues — social anxiety, wanting to meet girls (and guy friends too, but to a lesser extent) but being held back for reasons I couldn’t really explain at the time, and feelings of hopelessness and loneliness. Through individual and group sessions, I did make a lot of realizations and made some noticeable improvements. I talked to people at events and stuff (girls and guys) and even had a study session with a girl in one of my classes during finals. This summer, I’ll be working as an intern during the week (albeit an internship I only got because of nepotism) and am looking to volunteer at an animal shelter on weekends. I’m also going to keep going to individual therapy sessions once a week.

Having a hard time making friends in college isn't that uncommon, but it's more common for transfers, underclassmen and commuters, so I've kinda fell into panic mode more than people with those ""excuses"", if that makes sense. Before anyone asks, yes, I have reached out to some friends to talk through these things as well, and will take their advice to heart more than the advice of strangers on the internet. All of that being said, the reason I’m posting here is because I’m looking for as many different perspectives and avenues for advice that I can possibly think of. Basically, a lot of my major concern is that I finally have a better idea of how to go about things, but I’m terrified that I might be too late. I allowed social anxiety to ruin my first 3 years of college life, and I can’t take that back. There are maybe 4 or 5 guys and exactly one girl that I can say I’ve truly developed good friendships with here, and zero romantic interests. I have an idea of clubs I might want to join for next year — is it too late to really form connections with people at clubs as a senior? While finding a girlfriend isn’t my #1 priority in this, i’d be lying if I said it wasn’t a huge motivator. Is it something that could be attainable in such a short period of time? I’ve only really pursued two girls in my life romantically before, and I have very little experience and knowledge in making connections with them (and yes, “treat girls that you’re attracted to like anyone else you come across”, I know, yadda yadda yadda). So while I’ve made good progress, I still feel like I have a really long way to go, and I’m not sure if I can get where I want to be in such a short period of time.

I realize this probably comes across and overly neurotic and paranoid, and it probably is, but whatever. One thing I’m focusing on is not giving as much of a fuck what random people think of me, and you reading this are just another one of those people, so if you think I’m a neckbeard loser who’s destined to die alone, whatever. Anyway, I’d just like some advice and assurance that I’ll be okay and that I might be able to turn things around before I drive myself insane, as it’s become increasingly difficult to focus on school and class, causing my GPA to take a moderate hit (although I’m still satisfied with what I have). Thanks a bunch if you managed to get through all that, and I appreciate the advice in advance.

We’ve both recently returned from internships abroad (in different countries) and so she hasn’t got a job and recently found out because she was abroad for a certain amount of time she can’t claim money in order to help with rent. She feels that she has to run away from everything and thought that would help her heal but she texted me today saying that it hadn't. I know she misses me and I know that she still loves me and I'm not ready to give up on our relationship yet.

We both met at a training week before we went abroad for internships in different cities. We didn't immediately hit it off but started talking on facebook and became very close. Over the next few months that closeness turned into romantic feelings and we fell for each other, she even stopped seeing a guy that she had met over there for the opportunity to be in a relationship with me when we both got back even though we live at opposite ends of the country. Which was a massive deal because she hasn't been in a relationship for years, in the past she's been horribly messed about by guys and I fully understand why she would have trouble trusting again. Things haven't always been easy and we have had some serious rough patches but I'm completely in love with her.

To add in some more context as to why she might have felt she had to leave me, I also have depression. Unlike her though I haven't been on anti-depressants for years and generally have a good grasp of things, but sometimes things will get me down. I know the idea of carrying anyone else scared her when she struggles so much with herself. I definitely didn't help the situation when we broke up and I fell into a serious dark place again, not just because we broke up but because it was a straw that broke the camel's back type situation where I have a lot of other unrelated things happening in my life that I won't get into.

I understand from just describing it and from the outside looking in it looks like an absolute train-wreck of a relationship, but when we're together there's no problems at all. She's told me even after she dumped me that she always felt safe in my arms and that I always made her believe that everything was going to be okay. If I had been presented with this situation with anyone else I'd ever been in a relationship with I'd have accepted that things were over and tried to move on but things with her were always different. I'm fully convinced that she's who I'm meant to be with, I've never felt the way I feel about her with anyone else.

I may be misreading this but this feels like a defence mechanism and she’s not committed to leaving me, she till texts me and has told me that she doesn’t understand why she’s doing it either. I understand that my issues contributed to her decision and I've decided to see a therapist again and go back into therapy, but I know that I still want to be with her.

I just need some advice or to know if you guys think I even stand a chance of getting her back. The thought of never seeing her again and never knowing if she’s okay is not one that I’m even willing to comprehend right now.


**tl;dr**: Girlfriend left me last week, due to her mental health issues. Not convinced she doesn’t want to be with me, just a panic move due to situation. I still want to be with her. Help?"

4il0b1,1,2016-05-09,12 Years on with a few spurts off... now on to the rest of my life,SamOnTheeLam,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/4il0b1/12_years_on_with_a_few_spurts_off_now_on_to_the/,"Hey Reddit! First time posting and well…this i likely to be a long one. (TL;DR: at the bottom)

As everyone else in here has done, I have decided to embark on life of greater clarity, motivation, control, and overall responsibility; without marijuana. My story is a kinda ridiculous and I’ve come here to tell my story as I never have before, in an effort to hold myself accountable and maybe get some support along the way as well.

When I first started smoking in high school (around 2005), I used it as a way to make friends, expand the mind, and wash away some of the stress that was coming from home at the time. I had been forced off to boarding school my sophomore year and when I came back the next year, I was hungry to smoke as much as possible. At first, everything was great but i quickly started hanging out with people I necessarily shouldn't have and because of this I alienated many of the people I should have been hanging out with. This didn’t, bother me though, I had FRIENDS! And it was wonderful. Well shortly through my junior year, I was arrested with close to a quarter pound of really bad weed I had decided to sell. (Not to mention I got this weed through money I had briefly borrowed from my dads dresser drawer without him knowing) Well I played the good kid card and managed to get drug court but still didn't change my behavior and almost got kicked off of drug court for being with a friend as he was getting set up in a sting operation. Through some lawyering I stayed out of jail that time to only be arrested shortly after being released from drug court, again for pot. I was put on probation and proceeded to play the system by smoking for a brief period before quitting 2 weeks before my next test to allow myself to get clean. Well, I played and lost….ended up spending 8 days in jail on a 15 day sentence shortly after high school graduation….

Left for college and after going through the legal system back home, I was so excited to be free and able to smoke as much as I wanted as long as I was “smart” about it. So I proceeded to smoke myself silly for the entirety of my freshman year, I even bought and sold weed for a bit with scholarship money I had received from school. It was “awesome”. I cruised through college easily enough, but I can’t help but feel like I missed quite a bit along the way. My most active year was when I was living in the fraternity house and NOT smoking as much. The rest of my college career consisted of partying, music festivals, selling, and overall just being stoned all the time. So I get through school, no internships, a 3.0, some alright jobs, and overall a very vague sense of where I was going. I flounder, I get a job at a coffee shop, it sucks, so I decide I’m moving to Colorado. Well right before my half assed idea is to go through, I get caught in a speed trap and they find my bubble hash and arrest me for 2 misdemeanors (possession and paraphernalia).

Well here is things when things start to look up for a little. I get a good lawyer, I get clean, i begin volunteering and I secure and actual, real live, big boy job. Life was great, I was feeling more confident than ever and I was finally realizing how great life could be without marijuana in my life. I felt like a superhuman version of myself and I couldn't believe what I had allowed marijuana to do to my life, the thought of going back to my old ways was ridiculous and i could never see it happening again….

So here I am, 2 years after that point. I moved to Colorado shortly after relapsing  to pursue a life in the mountains and not have the fear of being busted for pot sitting over my shoulder. I was reclusive and not near as active as I should have been during my first season here, so I decided i’d go and figure thing out with my best friend while traveling around central/south america. Well my mind didn't get any clearer there as we decided to smoke the whole time (besides cuba) and even almost got in trouble a few times. (Confronted by a cop in Panamà and shaken down by police in Medellin, Colombia [it’s legal here but we didn't know]) I continue down my path of addiction as I get back and continue to smoke up a storm and move in with two roommates who smoke constantly here in Colorado. 

I’m 26 and I’ve found myself in a position where I’m really not that good at any particular thing besides maybe smoking weed. The only habit Ive really developed is the habit of smoking. I’ve never had a job over 7 months. I constantly get down on myself for smoking and constantly try and quit. Overall I’ve realized I have way more to offer the world and can do way more than just be a stoner. I always find myself reasoning to myself why I smoke, making excuses. And at the end of the day, I’m tired of making excuses and not taking responsibility for who I am. Weed did many great things in the beginning but I ended up turning it into an identity vs an activity and I can’t let it define me anymore. I’ve seen my potential and I’ve realized many of the long term effects it’s had on my life and I’m ready to try and turn those around and truly realize my full potential without this godawful crutch. I’m stronger than it and I know I can do it. For the first time ever, I’m quitting for myself and not because I have to, I’m doing it because I know I can do better.

Weed can work for some, but I’ve realized our relationship is unhealthy and it’s just not for me anymore. Twas a “decent” run, but I’m stoked for the future and what it holds w/o weed.

TL;DR: Started around 2005, many arrests and a lifetime of wasted time later and I am finally ready to quit for myself."

I completely acknowledge that I was given an advantage from birth, because my parents are wealthy, that has totally shaped how I grew up and has a lasting impact on how I go through life now. 


Both my parents are physicians. I got my undergrad degree from a decently prestigious university and I'm fortunate to not have any student debt, since they were able to pay full tuition. Since the age of 18, I have always had a part time job during the school year and a full time job or internship during the summer. Nonetheless, my parents paid for my housing and gave me a monthly stipend for groceries all through college. 


Out of college I got a job at an international advertising agency, as an account coordinator. Entry level positions at ad agencies have a reputation for being quite low (that's just how the industry is), and I make about $36k a year. 


My parents and I had a discussion on how my finances are to change now that I am working and on my own. Basically, until I am 25, they will continue to pay for: car insurance payments, health insurance (this is actually until 26 because of Obamacare), and my cell phone (I'm on the family plan). All other expense, including food, rent, utilities, etc, I pay for myself. 


I've been dating my boyfriend Carlos for almost 3 years. His lifestyle growing up was entirely different from mine--his parents are Mexican immigrants, he comes from a large family, and he grew up with very little money. He studied computer science and works as a programmer, and currently makes $65k a year. But he also has student debt and other expenses that I don't have. 


**The problem:** Carlos and I were talking about potentially moving in together and have been discussing how we will split finances. I gave him my budget, and he laughed it off, saying that a girl like me can obviously afford a much nicer place to live. He then showed me some of the places he was thinking of, and I told him that I can't afford it.


Basically, Carlos isn't taking me seriously at all. He has been saying some hurtful things about how I just like to ""create adversity"" for myself, and that my parents would happily chip in for rent if I would just bother to ask. And, he's right, I'm sure if I made a solid case for it they would help me to cover rent, but I have no interest in doing that. We've already agreed to how my parents are going to influence my finances, and they're not going to pay for rent or food, and that's that. He then pointed out that if I was actually interested in being a ""real adult"", I would be paying my own cell phone bill. 


I don't understand why he's being like this. He's been putting pressure on me to talk to my parents about rent. He's also started making comments, often, about how I don't have ""real problems"".  Once I made a comment about being stressed about work, and he laughed it off again, and told me that I don't even have a real job. 


**He was not like this, at all, when we were in college together.** This has been completely new behavior, and I think it's attributed to the fact that we're not in a college student bubble anymore, and are now actually talking about things like work and money. 


What do I do?


   
**tl;dr**: I grew up wealthy, my boyfriend did not. I don't have any student debt, my boyfriend does. BF also makes $30K more than me a year. My parents don't pay for my rent, food, or other big expenses. My boyfriend and I want to move in together, but he wants me to get an apartment I can't afford, and just ask my parents to pay the difference. I don't want to do that. "

4il54j,9,2016-05-09,Just found out I failed my prelim. I am really depressed you guys,gsughtr,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/4il54j/just_found_out_i_failed_my_prelim_i_am_really/,"I've hated this school ever since I've been here. I feel like 3 years of my life have been completely wasted. The quality of instruction is awful, there is no personal attention, I still don't even have an advisor because nobody seems interested in supervising me. The department gives me no support. There is no sense of community among the grad students. All of my time and energy has been sucked up by the stress of coursework and exams and deadlines, and the one thing, the *one thing* I came to grad school to do-- ***my fucking research***-- is now going to be delayed *another* three months while I prepare for the retake.

I just feel like it's a scam. Like doing research will always be a carrot on the end of a stick that I chase while they use me for teaching. The field I came here to study doesn't even *have* an exam. I have to take one in a field that is nearby, but fairly disjoint, something that I am not very interested in, at least evidently not enough to be able to absorb enough for a PhD exam. I am starting to even lose interest in my old field. Coming out of undergrad, I'd published in top journals, first authored, had many different projects going, was super excited about my work and my future. But now it's been so long now since I've worked on my them that I don't even remember half of what I used to know. Everything has been sacrificed to just not fail out in the face of this rigid, one size fits all structure, while scraping by on &lt;16k/yr, watching my skills atrophy. The more time passes, the more I don't know how to get the enthusiasm back that I had before being crushed by the lack of freedom and terrible culture.

There is a growing bitterness in me that I've been duped out of what should have been the best years of my research life. I've stopped thinking ""I am..."" and starting thinking ""I used to be...""  I know this negativity has been affecting me. I let myself get optimistic again, then something will happen. The admins will write me a nasty letter, or I'll do worse than expected in a class, or I'll be refused for another internship (nobody seems to want me anymore now that I'm in grad school, not sure what happened to all the offers after the BS). I'll have to spend the next week stressed and fighting off negativity while getting less work done than I need to be. It's a cycle that prevents me from having the successes I need to sustain this war of attrition.

I can't leave, though. I don't know what else I could even do with my life if I left grad school. The interesting non-academia places to work in my field (silicon valley, national labs, government, etc) seem difficult enough to get even with a PhD. I have a really hard time with the idea of starting over in industry at the same place as I would have if I'd never gone to grad school (or worse, since an MS makes jobs harder to get, even if they are higher paying), or put much effort as I did into undergrad. If there was a Plan B, it was going non-academic after the PhD, not leaving grad school. And I won't, anyway. I am too stubborn. The only way I'd give up is if I was forced to. But I'm still miserable.

Guys, I'm feeling pretty negative. Is anybody succeeding at grad school after feeling as negatively about their situation? How did you break the cycle of resentment?"

Working a desk job so I can literally study all day which I plan to do from about 9-5.

So I'm going into my senior year as a CS major, but because I transferred into the program late I haven't yet interned or gotten any solid experience/resume items. My dream/goal is to work my way into the security field, preferably on the offensive side of things, and I'm also considering infosec grad programs upon graduating in a year. 

Having said all that, my plan this summer is to improve my resume in a way that will help me get into one of these grad programs and/or help me get hired in a security-related field upon graduation. This way I can focus on my studies in the Fall and intern in the Spring to round out my resume trifecta of GPA, professional experience and personal experience. I'm hoping to acquire the Security+ and at least one other cert, which I could use some input about. I've heard the CEH is outdated and the CompTIA's are irrelevant, but I've also heard some positives about both as well. 

I'm also hoping to work on some kind of application/project with a focus in security that I could use as a senior project, or at least add to the resume. I've got some ideas for this but would welcome any suggestions. Lastly, I'd like to participate in some kind of competition/conference if I can develop my skills a bit further, but that's more of a wish list item.

So can anyone offer input or suggestions as to how I might plan my ~3 months to achieve these goals?  "
4il5tu,2,2016-05-09,SP4 now or wait?,Zeltu,Surface,https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/4il5tu/sp4_now_or_wait/,"Hi there!

Currently I am going through a different school system in Denmark. It's a long and complex explanation, so I'll just make it short. I am going to be a data technician, while I am completing college/high school at the same time.

My education requires an intern ship, which I have got in Rosti Group. They provided me with a nice Lenovo laptop. But last week they implemented some new security features, which kinda kills the laptop for my school usage.

I end this school period end of June, and then I am back to work.

I thought of buying the SP4, but with only 2 months left of school, I am a little curios about buying it. But then again, I could wait for the next line-up (School starts again after Christmas)

I tried making some kind of PRO/CONS - But it didn't help me.

I like how portable the SP4 is because I have to travel 3-4 hours in train everyday.

TL;DR Intern ship provided PC, 6 months after blocking everything for me. Needing a new device but not sure if I should wait for the SP5"

[Full story here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4hpina/research_vs_internship_for_this_summer/)

Short story. I'm very unqualified: 2.7 GPA after this semester. Major gpa will be same. C- in computer architecture. I go to [this school](http://www.aus.edu) (ranked ~#400) outside the US. (I'm American though).

I could have great LoRs because most professors think I'm smart (competitive programming experience) but that's all I have going for me.

A professor has given me the option of doing research (unpaid) for him over the summer. In his word he'll give me some projects he doesn't have time for to work on. 

I'd have to decline a paid internship offer from Accenture here in Dubai for that. I was originally planning on using that second internship to help in securing a good full time job later.

What do you think my chances for getting into lower ranked schools for masters is. If it's not good I should probably just stick with my internship and go into industry after I graduate."

I'm looking for someone to write a software package to implement statistical methods for the analysis of genetic data in the R programming language. The outcome from the internship would be co-authorship on a software package that should be on CRAN/Bioconductor, and potential first authorship on a short paper describing the software package (software package is the priority, but if you have time to write the paper too, that'd be a bonus). Ideally, you would have experience using the R software package, but general programming in any language is more important than specific knowledge of R. Would be suitable for a mathmo interested in biostatistics, a compsci/natsci interested in bioinformatics or quantitative genetics, or anyone interested in programming. Ideally you will have 2+ months to dedicate to the project. Any less, and it's not really worthwhile, unless you already have experience with R. Can supervise remotely once the project is up and running, but would be ideal if you can be based in Cambridge (and you'll get more out of the experience) - I'm based at the Dept of Public Health and Primary Care on the Addenbrooke's site. Not sure of the details about pay, but I'm sure we can sort something out - although you'll have to arrange your own accommodation.

4ilvik,1,2016-05-09,College Student in Need of Some Advice!,Sealky,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4ilvik/college_student_in_need_of_some_advice/,"Disclaimer: I am not a very good writer so I do apologize for that in advance.
Some background: I am a 22 year old living in the Silicon Valley attending the San Jose State University. I heading into my fifth year and will be graduating next spring of 2017. My parents live ~60 miles away from me and are not in a financial situation to provide any assistance (nor do I expect them too). I made a decision to attend this university for numerous opportunities in the Silicon Valley. I work full time as a hockey official, which pays about $2000 a month on average. My income varies on the amount of work available in the region. I love working, but it's beginning to conflict with my school schedule. I have found that moving into my upper-division courses that I need to allocate more time to studying rather working those late nights or all weekend. If I choose to get full rest and a healthy human being, then my grades start to slip, but if I choose to just put my head down in the books and just work, then my health starts to suffer (anxiety, weight, etc.) I need to stay on a 15 unit/semester workload to graduate on time. I cannot take classes during the summer, because unfortunately my financial aid does not cover for summer/winter courses and I cannot afford to pay out of pocket. I am okay with this, gives me time to recover and enjoy my vacations/work an internship. Now, you can probably picture the dilemma I am in. I am needing more time to focus in books, but I need to maintain the income in order to pay for my living/books/etc.
Here is my current financial situation:
Income=~$2,000/month (non-taxed, I am 10-99)
Rent and utilities=$700/month
Credit Card Payments=$150/month
Gas and groceries=$300 month (I travel a lot with my job)
Money put away for taxes each month=$250-$300
No car payment, my parent gave my their car when I left for college (thanks mom and dad)
Phone and car insurance= $300 a month
School=~$8,500 a year including supplies. The school gives me $6,500 in loans and I receive a $1,000 a year scholarship. I pay the rest of out pocket.
So this leaves me with about $300 a month for any emergencies and for my social life. I choose not to party much, because I cannot afford that lifestyle and I have realized the effects it has on my body.
I have spoken to a few financial advisers and they told me that I should consider a loan from my bank. I have spoken to Wells Fargo numerous times and they told me that I would need a cosigner for a loan. My parents do not qualify to cosign because of their past financial history, so I would need to ask someone else. I feel like asking someone to cosign is putting that person at risk. I do have a job lined up after college, and even if worse comes to worst, I have my hockey officiating job to lean on. I really need some financial help for this last year of school. I need some money to lean on just in case I am injured at work (there is no compensation if I am injured because I am private contractor) or some other emergencies occur. I don't want to stress about having to work so much to pay for all of my bills if I have a busy month with projects/tests/etc. I am just looking for about $5,000-$7,000 for my last year. What routes can I go?
Thank you in advance for all of the advice.

Edit: I do not qualify for any grants because of my parents income. "
4im75f,2,2016-05-09,Should I drop out? [Might not be what you are expecting],blackfireize,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4im75f/should_i_drop_out_might_not_be_what_you_are/,"I am just going to get right to it.

Currently, I am 19 and a ""pre-junior"" (ie 3rd year) at Drexel University studying CS (Drexel is a 5-year program with Co-Ops for those that aren't familiar).

I am somewhat unique in that I had a 'real' internship with Lockheed Martin and a DoD contractor while in high school and spearheaded several research projects at the latter--it is long story but I'll explain if you want. 

I have always been self-taught with respect to CS, I started when I was in middle school and continue to teach myself every day. To my own amazement, I have never really been challenged by any of my CS courses. I maintain a strong 3.9 GPA and have never gotten less than an A in any of my CS courses. The courses included a data structures and algorithms course along with math courses like Linear Algebra, Multivariate calculus etc ...

I've always felt like dropping out but I never really had the ability financially--it just would not have been feasible. But. Right now I am on a Co-Op for Drexel and am working for GEICO (15 minutes could sav....). Not in love with the work at all. However, my employer is willing to do something I only mentioned jokingly--increase my salary and give me a full-time position in exchange for dropping out and instead pursuing an online degree in my spare time.

The money is good, yet I am unable to come to a sensible solution to this, as I can't decide which is a better option for me. Notwithstanding any external considerations like my parents and friends, if you were in my position, what would YOU do? For me, I am leaning toward going with them. But I am worried that an online degree will not carry the same weight as a ""traditional"" degree and so if/when I decide to leave, I'll be at a disadvantage when looking for a different job.

Thanks in advance."

In my personal opinion, as a standalone game, I can not imagine it being very fun. As an addition to CAH (along with other 3rd party expansion) though, it has the potential for some hilarious combinations. My next game night is this coming Sunday, so we will see how it goes.

4ime55,2,2016-05-09,Offer after internship as a freshman?,buffprogrammer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ime55/offer_after_internship_as_a_freshman/,"I've given my 2 weeks at my steady job to begin an internship in a nearby city. I'll be starting my sophomore year of college (workings toward an Associates in CS at the moment) in the fall. I'm relocating to live with with my sister so bills will be minimal, but I'm a little worried about only having 3 months of steady income. I won't be able to go back to my old job. My girlfriend does have a decent job and I will have at least a few months of a cushion saved up.




My main question is how likely is it, if I work hard, to get some sort of full/part time offer after this? I've done a few side projects and studied a lot outside of school, so I would say I'm not an ""average"" freshman/sophmore. At the same time I feel it's unlikely for me to be hired at this point. If I don't get an offer, should I just apply for a standard retail job to get me through till next summer?



Just looking for some advice on what you might do if you were in my shoes.



Thanks"

I'm wrapping up a semester of being a full time student and a proctor.  I'm also on day one of a three week internship that is very demanding.  I have 16 papers to grade before tomorrow so I'll keep this short.

I'm having a final bowl with my girlfriend tonight, and then I'm done.  I've been a heavy smoker (upwards of three times a day, easily going through a gram or two a day) for about a year now, and was a habitual smoker for about a year before that.  I've been on some form of drug my whole life, starting with pain pills when I was in high school.  Trees have been my way of getting out of that (and drinking,) but now it's time to take a break.

I haven't been sober for any length of time in my adult life, and I'm really nervous about how to cope.  I'm not sure I can handle the stress of being 'present' all the time.  If anyone has any ideas for a newly sober person to do to kill time and destress, let me know.  I'm thinking of just walking, reading more, and maybe writing.  We'll see how it goes.  I'm not so good at managing my depression without trees, and I am not wanting to fall back into old habits.

I need to see what a clean me is like, and I know I can do this.  I will officially own nothing and have no contacts for anything after tonight, and I can't wait to see how long this last.  I am going to try to definitely make it to 2017, but we'll see."
4imuh7,4,2016-05-09,Course in Python or C?,imnevilwalrus,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/4imuh7/course_in_python_or_c/,"Hey Geo Careers! Sorry for the text wall...

Background: I am in my senior year (environmental science BSc) graduating in December, and I just landed a summer student hydrology internship. I don't want to get ahead of myself, but if I was offered to continue to work in the Fall my class schedule would need to change to accommodate part time work (with an hour commute). They expressed this as a possibility, obviously contingent on many factors (grants, my availabilty, demonstration I'm not a dumbass, etc). I technically only need 2 more courses (6 credits) to graduate, but I was going to get a geology minor to fill up my course schedule in my last semester. I have taken a ton of Geo courses already for my major but not quite enough for the minor as well (need just 1 more, was going to take 2 to be full time). I was really looking forward to this one last course in particular.

I'm toying with adding a Python or C course to my roster, as the remaining course I was going to take for the geo minor is at an awful time for a work commute (noon). This would also free me up to a Tuesday &amp; Thursday only class schedule, with MWF open to work. I had a long internship in an environmental informatics group so I have been exposed a good amount to SQL, R, GIS, and Python. I believe this made my application stand out for my current summer position.

Question: Would an official C or Python course make me more valuable to either employers or professors at a grad school? If so, which language? Or should I not bother and take only the 2 courses I need and get out? Should I take Calc III instead (or as well)? I post this here because even though my degree is Env. Sci. I plan trying to get into grad school in the future for hydrology (which I figured the Geo minor would be beneficial for in the first place).

Thanks in advance."

We’ve both recently returned from internships abroad (in different countries) and so she hasn’t got a job and recently found out because she was abroad for a certain amount of time she can’t claim money in order to help with rent. She feels that she has to run away from everything and thought that would help her heal but she texted me today saying that it hadn't. I know she misses me and I know that she still loves me and I'm not ready to give up on our relationship yet.

We both met at a training week before we went abroad for internships in different cities. We didn't immediately hit it off but started talking on facebook and became very close. Over the next few months that closeness turned into romantic feelings and we fell for each other, she even stopped seeing a guy that she had met over there for the opportunity to be in a relationship with me when we both got back even though we live at opposite ends of the country. Which was a massive deal because she hasn't been in a relationship for years, in the past she's been horribly messed about by guys and I fully understand why she would have trouble trusting again. Things haven't always been easy and we have had some serious rough patches but I'm completely in love with her.

To add in some more context as to why she might have felt she had to leave me, I also have depression. Unlike her though I haven't been on anti-depressants for years and generally have a good grasp of things, but sometimes things will get me down. I know the idea of carrying anyone else scared her when she struggles so much with herself. I definitely didn't help the situation when we broke up and I fell into a serious dark place again, not just because we broke up but because it was a straw that broke the camel's back type situation where I have a lot of other unrelated things happening in my life that I won't get into.

I understand from just describing it and from the outside looking in it looks like an absolute train-wreck of a relationship, but when we're together there's no problems at all. She's told me even after she dumped me that she always felt safe in my arms and that I always made her believe that everything was going to be okay. If I had been presented with this situation with anyone else I'd ever been in a relationship with I'd have accepted that things were over and tried to move on but things with her were always different. I'm fully convinced that she's who I'm meant to be with, I've never felt the way I feel about her with anyone else.

I may be misreading this but this feels like a defence mechanism and she’s not committed to leaving me, she till texts me and has told me that she doesn’t understand why she’s doing it either. I understand that my issues contributed to her decision and I've decided to see a therapist again and go back into therapy, but I know that I still want to be with her.

I just need some advice or to know if you guys think I even stand a chance of getting her back. The thought of never seeing her again and never knowing if she’s okay is not one that I’m even willing to comprehend right now.

tl;dr: Girlfriend left me last week, due to her mental health issues. Not convinced she doesn’t want to be with me, just a panic move due to situation. I still want to be with her. Help?"
4inamv,9,2016-05-09,How to overcome indecision and fear?,wecountthose,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/4inamv/how_to_overcome_indecision_and_fear/,"Right out of undergrad, I was offered a job, and with nothing else available, I accepted. Day one, I regretted it, and it took me two years to figure out my next step and work up the courage to quit. It took a huge toll on my mental health and confidence.

&amp;nbsp;

One year later and in a new city, I’ve had a couple internships and have been without a job for three weeks. I still have only a vague idea of the career I want to pursue, which has paralyzed me in many ways from seeking out opportunities, since I’m not sure what to look for. Beyond that, my experience in my first job (and throughout college, really) has made me indecisive, scared to take one wrong step that might put me back at square one.

&amp;nbsp;

Example one: I was offered a retail position today, and I took it, but I immediately regretted it and am considering backing out. I have money saved to float for a few months, but I applied thinking the extra cash would be a smart idea. I know it is my prerogative within reason to quit at any moment if I get a permanent offer, but the process of doing so, possibly much earlier than they would have hoped (it’s a temp position), is already making me anxious. Did I act too soon? Should I have given myself more time to find something permanent?

&amp;nbsp;

Example two: I’m afraid of taking a position and hating it again. I’ve done so much reflection, so much exploring, and I know that at some point I will just need to *try* something, but the thought of ‘wasting’ all that time and energy just to quit and look for something completely different sounds not only scary but exhausting. Where do people find the mental capacity to ‘find their passion’ through trial and error? (for the record, I do network, talk to people, try to learn as much as I can about different career paths, but…hearing and doing are different things)

&amp;nbsp;

tl;dr: I’m scared to take a wrong step career-wise. I have commitment anxiety. Help me get rid of it?"
4inctz,1,2016-05-09,Advisors comparison in Gatech,meowoodie,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/4inctz/advisors_comparison_in_gatech/,"Hi, everybody. I would like to ask for a favor. 
I'm going to do an 3-months internship in Gatech. There are two professors have offered me the internship. But I have no idea which professor is more suitable for me. 

Prof. Gil Weinberg, the director of school of music. We had a nice talk on Skype. He told me he was trying to find a Deep Learning researcher to help him in the study of music, and my experience is good fit for his group.
Prof. Yao xie, an assistant professor in ISyE. Her research interest is Big data, and we have a good match, but we didn't talk too much, so I have not enough information about her. It seems that she read my CV, and gave me the offer immediately.

Talking about myself, I'm a graduate student outside of America. I major in Computer Science. And My research interests include Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Mining. I hope this internship experience would give me a big help on applying PhD program in 2017.

The thing is both of the professors are great. I don't know how to make this decision. You know Prof. Weinberg is famous but I don't know is it appropriate for me to do ML research in School of Music... 

Is there anyone could help me out of this? Any suggestion is appreciated."

- **Physical Description:**										
										
To look at Daiyu Feng, a bystander might question if she were actually a statue, save for the twitching orange black-tipped fox ears atop her head. She stands at a respectable 5'6"" and is just coming out of the gangly teenager stage. Daiyu usually keeps her long black hair tied into an elegant waist-length braid. Her stoic, alabaster-skinned face rarely changes expression, save to raise a thin black brow or purse pink lips. Wide and alert, her eyes are as dark as her hair. Though she wouldn't admit it, her nose, somewhat flat and wide, is eminently boop-able.

Of course, if one gets to know her, one discovers that her meticulous hygiene and makeup are because she has nothing better to do in her free time and her hairstyle and length were chosen so she doesn't have to risk a bad, easily-mocked haircut. In terms of clothing, she wears a thigh-length, black-edged orangey-rose tunic modeled after Chinese hanfu, tied with a white sash. The tunic's long sleeves nearly cover her weapons, which she rarely removes, and as she usually has her hands clasped in front of her partially obscure black leggings and charcoal boots. Black jade foxglove earrings dangle from each ear.									
										
										
- **Weapon:**										
										
Although Daiyu's emeici are not distinct in any way from each other, apart from being worn on separate hands, she has named each one separately. On her right hand she wears Clarity, on the other she wears Obscurity, together called Reason. Daiyu usually uses her fire Dust with her left hand. Reason appears to be a pair of new-penny copper, flame-engraved rings, one on the middle finger of each hand with a retractable black rod tipped with a spearlike head, attached to black gloves which half-cover her middle fingers and entirely bare her other fingers. A dark grey foxglove flower cluster is embroidered in the palm of each. To assume ranged function, Reason swaps the spearheads for Dust-imbued darts contained within the weapon.										
										
In terms of fighting style, Daiyu relies heavily on not getting hit, as displayed in her Semblance. Once she spies an opening, she dives in for a surprisingly stabby punch. In combat, she dodges along a spiral path, waiting for the perfect moment.
										
- **Semblance/Aura:**										
										
Empyrean - 1 AP

Even the delicate wings of a butterfly can set a hurricane in motion. Empyrean operates on these principles, turning Daiyu's dodging into a formidable weapon. With every spiraling step away from a blow, she stirs the air into a slightly greater frenzy before unleashing powerful gales to buffet her enemies. Yet like the often-indirect wind, this artificial windstorm doesn't strike the target of the original attack, but instead spills out into the surroundings. The breezes around her ruffle her flowing sleeves and sash for a vaguely otherworldly air. When she releases a Current, it glows deep orange, creating the effect of tongues of cold fire.

Effect: When taking a defensive stance Daiyu may activate her Semblance, enveloping her body in a light breeze.  Instead of doubling her defense, this defensive stance increases her defense by [Semblance].  If she is attacked this round and takes no damage she gains one Current around her.  She may have up to [Semblance] Currents at one time.  At any time she may release these Currents as part of an attack, which allows her to also attack anyone, other than herself and the target, within a 2 Yard radius of the target with the same attack with a penalty equal to 6 - [number of Currents] (only applies to the secondary targets)									
										
When unleashed, her Aura resembles a crackling flame, a la 'foxfire.'
										
- **Backstory:**										
										
Daiyu grew up in Atlas, where she developed a reputation as 'that one kid you can get the answers from,' when she was remembered at all. Her mother, Xue, and her father, Zhu, were happy enough with this, since it meant they'd have at least one child still around--Bai, her older brother, was an accomplished Huntsman. And honestly, they didn't really expect much out of as shy a girl as Daiyu. She could work for the Schnees as they did, selling Dust, and be safe. At the advice of some of Bai's teachers, who reasoned that such an excellent Huntsman would have a sister with great potential, they sent Daiyu to a combat school when she turned 13. After all, she could learn to defend herself and wasn't obligated to attend Atlas. They didn't expect her to like it.

When Bai became a Special Operative, he grew distant from the family, colder and more callous. Daiyu saw less and less of the gruff but kind brother she had known and more of the consummate professional as he stepped more fully into the role. Her parents were happy, if worried, to have a son with such a high position, but clung to their daughter, who faded away in turn. One day, when she was around fifteen, Daiyu tapped her brother on the shoulder, only for him to reflexively whirl to strike her down. It was then that she discovered her Semblance, flinching away and instinctively releasing a Current to knock him away. She slipped away from the ensuing argument to the library and continued to do so as stress mounted in the household.

In those musty-smelling stacks, Daiyu discovered stories that fostered a new idea in her--she could escape the worries of her family by attending a school in another kingdom. Still, she held out hope for being a Huntress in her native kingdom, a better, kinder one than her brother. But her dream was rudely interrupted after Bai snapped on the battlefield, wiping out a horde of Grimm and collapsing. The day he came home, mute and unresponsive, her parents announced they wouldn't be sending her to Atlas mere months from graduation, mere days after her seventeenth birthday. Shooed away so her parents could tend Bai, Daiyu designed her first weapon, a katar/crossbow called Mercy, for the value she hoped to maintain in Atlas Academy. As a last-ditch effort to convince them to let her return, she presented it and her dreams to her parents.

They refused. She was of the wrong character, they said, and besides, couldn't parents have one child undamaged? Confused, she asked without expecting an answer what had changed since she enrolled. Finally Xue answered that neighbors had begun to gossip, to wonder why one Feng child had all but become a robot and criticize the other, who despite combat training had the spine and strength of a jellyfish and took teachers' valuable time for questions on theory. The Fengs were loving parents, but the threat of losing their daughter coupled with growing communal ridicule was too much.

Daiyu fled in tears. Huddled up against a bookshelf, she reached a moment of clarity--she wanted to experience and document the world beyond Atlas, true, but more than that, she wanted to stand on her own two feet and prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that she had a more noble character than the gossips. What better way to do that than become a Huntress anyway, somewhere where she wouldn't have to endure the pressure cooker of her community? That night Daiyu scrapped her blueprints for Mercy and designed what she had found that night--Reason, logic and purpose together. She named the right hand for the moment that had led her on her path, a discovery of Clarity, and the left hand for the seclusion that had led her to her passion, Obscurity.

Daiyu secured permission from her family to waste her time at a place where the neighbors wouldn't gossip about her potential failure, Beacon Academy. She set off a few months later, leaving behind a story of an internship at an overseas branch of the Schnee Dust Company. Now she aims to soak up all the knowledge Beacon has to offer, to learn from her teammates and secure an invaluable place in the world. If only she could get past her (entirely correct) suspicions that her parents expect her to fail out and return to them before she even sees battle.										
										
										
- **Personality:**										
										
Face of stone, heart of tissue paper. This phrase sums up Daiyu Feng. She folds under criticism--persuading her family to let her go to Beacon took so much out of her than she now torments herself more than they ever would have over how destined she is to fail. Brilliant, Daiyu loves to answer questions and solve problems, but also hates to be wrong, and so she rarely reaches out to people out of fear that they'll find her stupid and reject her first. You can forget about her ever asking for help, since she's scared of seeming weak or stupid. Despite her insecurities, Daiyu is proud of her intelligence. She is sweet and studious, but often overly formal, made even more cautious by her brother's instability.

4ingy7,3,2016-05-09,My ambition is gone,shuxz,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4ingy7/my_ambition_is_gone/,"I've waited way to long to write this, but I thought its about time I should. Sorry if this ends up being really long, I'm just letting out everything that I've been feeling for years, and just want to be happy again. First off, to provide some background information, I'm a junior in high-school. Many of my views are different from my parents/peers, such as entrepreneurship, work, college, religion, and so on. I have so many goals and ambitions, but I never finish or execute them, and always feel very bad at myself because of not doing it. My ideal life is to first work in my teens, gain information from a couple mentors I have and possibly intern at their places for a bit, and start my own company. It's my most important goal that I think about everyday. With my parents and family forcing college on me, its one of many things that really saddens me and brings me down. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against college, but it's just disappointing that my parents would rather dump money into college (which in the first place, would not be the best for someone interested in entrepreneurship), have me get a bullshit degree, and work a job, rather than see me start a business. It breaks my heart that they would be happier seeing me go to med school or law school and be in that repetitive lifestyle instead of seeing me start a business and work my ass off at a young age. Also as I just got diagnosed with ADHD and GAD a couple months ago, I've now realized how it has affected me so strongly. I do notice the good in it, such as being interested in so many things and starting different ideas/pages/sites, but I noticed how hard it really is to live with. I worry every single day about my future, thinking of college is worth it, if its all going to go to waste, if my parents would let me drop out, if I would be happy, what I would do after... These are all my thoughts daily. I myself hate wasting time, and I really can admit I'm ambitious, but so many things stop me from it. Even after going to 6+ therapy sessions, my therapist admits I am indeed depressed. I feel like therapy isn't working either, but I am still going to give that time. Usually everyday I will wake up and do homework literally. If I finish early I would just go in my room and sleep for hours. I have so many interests like photography/design, social media marketing, cars, fitness, but I don't have the slightest interest/motivation to do any of them anymore. My mind is just dull and I never feel like I am in reality or present. I know my parents would not let me get on anti-depressants as I already take Adderall for ADHD, which they barely accepted. Sometimes I might feel a bit lifted or motivated for a bit, but that feeling goes away quickly. I've tried forcing myself to walk or go to the gym, but I always just feel weak and out of it. Everyday I wake up just waiting to go back to bed, and I literally don't see the point in doing anything. I haven't posted on my photography account's social media's or updated its website, I haven't got started on my potential clothing brand, I haven't gotten around to selling some things around the house, haven't caught up academically in school... These are all things that I remind myself but never seem to finish, and I always end up getting so fucking pissed at myself. I always swear at myself and accept the fact that I'm a fuck up. I just feel trapped, liked I'm not advancing or going anywhere. I have all these expectations and goals for myself, and not achieving them makes me worry so much every single day, and on top of that I worry about my future and how I don't have control over it. I think to myself what if what my parents want me to do doesn't work out, what if I'm not happy? I already dislike highschool enough... I've always wanted to be more independent and live alone. I always tell myself I'll get a job and work for a couple more years, then start up a company in my late teens/early twenties working 100 hours a week, as long as it's something I enjoy. I always lie to myself when I say this, because I know I'm going to be forced to go to college with the same repetitive cycle of school... People think I don't have any dreams or I'm ""lazy"" or not ambitious (such as my parents), but it's exactly the opposite, I'm willing to sacrifice my time to work my ass off to create something that I love and enjoy, and for them not to accept that but instead dump money into more education makes me extremely sad. I feel like they've already accepted the fact that my ADHD slows me down enough, so they just say they want me to be ""happy"", yet force college on me and always compare me to my friends saying ""Why can't you get a 4.0 like this guy/girl"", and they never seem content to what I do. The only thing they acknowledge is my academics and never seem satisfied. Even after get diagnosed and medicated, I raised my GPA from a 2.0 to a 3.0, but don't even see appraisal from them. They never even focus on my other accomplishments, for fucks sake they don't even know my photography brand name. They don't care about the IG pages I built up to 25,000+ followers, my websites that I designed, the graphic design work that I get payed for, my interest in trading stocks, starting a clothing brand, etc... I just feel trapped and unable to express my beliefs, and feeling too limited and not having the passions that I truly love to be recognized, rather than the formal education pushed on me that is barely relevant to my future. I don't even want to go to the gym, post photos, take photos, start sites/brands, etc. My life is basically a repetitive cycle of homework, hours of sleep/crying, and worrying non stop. I can't think of the last day that I can say I was truly happy. I think about death everyday, I would never attempt suicide, but the thought of not being alive is always in mind. Sorry for the rant guys, thanks to whoever reads this.

What are they trying to do?,wtfpopo123,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4iniiu/one_company_interviews_me_every_year_and_then/,"I am a CS student in my senior year. There is this one company (Cisco) that keeps interviewing me every year since my sophomore year. I have had 3 interviews (for internship) with them in the last 3 year (1 each year around summer time).

The first interview, I didn't have much hope because I was only a sophomore and only had taken beginner CS classes.

The second one in my junior year went great. But they still rejected me... well tough luck. I got an internship with another company that year (w/ Cisco's biggest rival).

The third interview, I was pretty confident. I had taken a ton of CS courses, a ton of projects and 1 full year of internship experience. And the interview went great. Still rejected...

1 week after rejecting me 3rd time. They again invited me to apply for a full-time position and said that I am on top of their list. They want to interview me around the time when I graduate in December.

My question is, why does this company keep rejecting me? and if they have rejected me so many times, why do they keep interviewing me?"

4ins4f,6,2016-05-10,Just finished assessment: waiting to hear diagnosis. Freaked out a bit.,Twice_Distilled,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4ins4f/just_finished_assessment_waiting_to_hear/,"Hello, Reddit. Been reading posts in this subreddit all evening and you all seem like supportive, thoughtful people. I thought I would share my story. 

I've been convinced I've had ADHD for years. Every single teacher in elementary and middle school asked if I had been tested for it. My mother, naturally, gave the runaround. ""He's just bored. School isn't challenging."" I'm sure she just didn't like the idea of me on medication -- an irony, to be sure, since my whole family are addicts of one kind or another. But, je divague. 

After being a failing student in middle school and a mediocre one in high school (my graduating GPA was 2.3) I did a couple of years of professional work (I'm a director in the theatre) and went to college. College, surprisingly, was much easier than high school. But during college I had some depression issues and went to a therapist, who conferred with an MD and put me on Adderall for several months. 

This. Was. The. Best. Several. Months. Of. My. Life. 

I was so happy, all of the time. My socks matched. I didn't lose my house keys. I remembered to feed myself and my dog regularly and got out of the house far more often. I wrote and published my first book. My grades stayed acceptable and consistent. For the first time in my adult life, I felt like a fully-functioning, normal human. On roughly 20mgs a day of Adderall, I didn't run around like a hopped-up Superman; I was just finally competent, engaged, and so happy. 

The MD was firm in that it was only meant to be a temporary thing to keep me active while I dealt with some life circumstances (bad relationship ended traumatically). Then I went to grad school. Grad school is even EASIER than undergrad for someone like me: reading and critically engaging theory in your field is work, but it's very pleasurable and, like all cerebral masturbation, really is done on your own time. Ergo, I have a 4.0 for my Master's Degree. However, I felt the same problems I faced in my younger years: I find myself not doing the work much of the time. Instead I fill the gaps with well-constructed bullshit, skip chapter readings I know I can fake, and otherwise deny myself the full benefit of my education because I am distracted, bored, and mentally rebellious. 

So I decided to go into my school's counseling center and get tested for ADHD. The first thing they looked at, obviously, was the fact that I have a 4.0 in grad school and seemed skeptical. The doctoral intern doing my tests really didn't seem impressed with my humor nor terribly sympathetic with why I was there. She was distant and didn't exactly radiate empathy as I tried to explain the struggles with what I am certain is ADHD. Trying to get my report cards from elementary and middle school was a failure: it appears they are not on file anywhere. All I could really do was tell my stories and take the tests. 

The tests, I swear, I did my best on: some days I nailed them, some days I struggled, and it was impossible for me to tell whether or not my performance was indicative of what I know is going on in my head on a daily basis, the kind of inability to focus, remember, and apply myself in a way that constitutes a fully engaged and competent life. 

Anyhow, I finished the testing last week. The intern said she would compile her report and look it over with her supervisor and call me back in to tell me their diagnosis. And, to be rather honest, I'm freaked out about it. I know a lot of college students try to fake ADHD symptoms to get drugs, and that is absolutely not me, though by the intern's cold shoulder I feel she probably thinks this. All I know is that I can't remember what day of the week it is, basic appointments, most people's names, and when I sit down to do work end up staring at the wall for a while instead. So many of the symptoms I've read in this subreddit and in the literature concerning ADHD *and* seen in my previously diagnosed friends applies identically to me. 

So, anyhow. I guess I'm just hoping they come to the conclusion I feel is right and will give me the help I need. Did anyone else feel this way between testing and diagnosis? Did anyone *not* receive a diagnosis the first time and seek a second opinion? I'd love to read any thoughts and advice on this and hear more of your stories as well. Thanks so much for reading, and many apologies for the length. "
4io6yw,2,2016-05-10,Advice Needed :(,futurecivil,civilengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/4io6yw/advice_needed/,"So I am entering my last semester this fall and wasn't able to get an internship. Last summer, I wasn't able to get one either. Instead what I needed up doing was working for a sub contractor, where they primarily worked on installing catchbasins for the city. My job duties included job price calculations, inspecting sites, making sure the material was delivered to the sites, and some other things I can't remember. (There was an engineer but he quit a month before I worked there haha. ) 

Now since I didn't get anther internship, should I go back? They were paying $15.00 an hour, and the work was not bad. But I feel that I might not be learning key things that will benefit future related jobs. 

I guess what  I am asking is, could you guys tell me what was/is something that is crucial for your internship/job? For example some friends told me to work on my autocad skills. Others said they did things like surveying( and generally be familiar with the equipment). thanks for your time guys. "

4iofi1,3,2016-05-10,"My [26m] fiancée [23f] found her dream job (30k + com, part time of about 30 hours, non-profit, double what she makes now) but we would have to relocate if accepted.

This job, if she's accepted, will end up us having to move to her home town. Is it worth the risk for a part time job and me losing out on a well paying job?

I have been working at my current job, a very well known and big IT company, for over 3 years now and got hired as a paid intern. The benefits are amazing as they have great insurance, stock, great 401k and I start witH about 30 days vacation up to a max of 45 in 2 more years. 

Fiancée currently works as a cake decorator. Part time and minimum wage. She has been out of college for over 2 years now and has been dying to find something that she went to school for. This job that popped up is perfect. Everything she's wanted in a job after graduation. Something that deals with her anthropology major. She would be leaving her current job for a double increase in her pay, but it's still a part time job and a company that started in 2012. 

If you need more info I'll edit the OP.

TL;DR: Is it worth loosing my well paying job for us to move so she can work at her dream job that's part time?

EDIT:

Questions Answered::

**1. Has she actually been offered this job?** No, but I want us to be prepared financially, look at some options for the 'what if', and to have more information for the talk.

**2. Savings?** No. Only have savings for the amount of one pay check. Have been slowly, but surely, saving up for the 3 months expense. Been having lots of help with /r/YNAB and /r/personalfinance.

**3. Why do you live where you live?** Was at school here, got an internship with current job, and when I graduated they gave me a full time position. That’s pretty much why I live here.

**4. Does she want to be near hers, or is the job just coincidentally there?** Job is coincidentally there.

**5. A city that you hate?** Kinda, but I can honestly manage. I think this would be too selfish of me to think like this if it means her being at her dream job. And as long as I’m behind a computer and coding, I’m more than happy.

**6. Did you guys ever see yourselves living somewhere else? She probably knew her field was small...did you ever discuss the possibility of relocation?** Yes and yes.

**7. You have a job with a lot more security and benefits than hers, but you also seem more marketable. Could you get a similar job in the new place? Are there other opportunities for her where you live now?** I don’t see why there wouldn’t be opportunities. It would be moving to the next big city in our state. Resentment would be me not being able to find a job with the benefits and with the amazing people I currently work with who have helped me out through a lot in my life! But, that’s a risk I’m willing to take, as now a days, getting a raise is by jumping ship… I guess I should also mention, that depending on my boss, I MIGHT have the opportunity to work from home and keep my current job. She doesn't really like doing that but if she won't do it full time, should could possibly let me work from home for a few months until I find something in the new city.

**8. Is she considering things other than just possible income for her?** Not really focused on income. More focused on the opportunity of it being something she’s always wanted to do and it falls in line with her degree. She has been struggling trying to find something that hasn't been retail after graduating college with a degree.

**9. How far away is it? While not ideal, would there be a way for her to move home for 6 months/a year and work there while you stay at your job?** 2 hours away. It's in her hometown so she can stay with her mom while she saves up. And yes, this is what we’re planning on doing if she gets the job.

During work hours, when everyone is at their desk, I am afraid to approach them to start a conversation as they might find it unexpected and weird as I seat 4 desks away from them. Also, truth be told, I am afraid of my colleagues judging me as I have kept to myself for the past month and suddenly introducing myself to the interns will be out of the ordinary. 

So, I have been planning to start a conversation with them at the pantry or lift lobby when they leave for lunch or after work, however I have yet to bump into them.

Should I wait for them to leave and follow behind them in order to start a conversation? Will they notice and avoid me? Or should I just wait for the opportunity to present itself?

This has been bothering me so much as I feel that this is the perfect opportunity to break out of my shell and make some friends at work. Please help me guys, would appreciate any advice. Sorry for the long ass post. 

P.S. They are a guy and girl and are always together, where ever they go. I am not sure if they know each other previously from school etc.

4ioqw4,0,2016-05-10,I'm scared that I'm in an emotionally abusive relationship,butt_er_s,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/4ioqw4/im_scared_that_im_in_an_emotionally_abusive/,"sorry in advance that this is such a long post, I'm kind of hurt and I'd really like some advice 

I've been with my boyfriend for two and a half years, and we've had our share of arguments but it seems like recently everything that we argue about ends up being my fault. He will get angry and tell me I have ""serious issues"" and that I am incapable of being independent if I say something when he flakes on our plans to do stuff with other people. He tells me the same thing too when one of us is away, like over the summer he had an internship, and I text him too many times. I've started noticing that when we fight, even if its over something trivial, he always tries to make me feel like I'm the scum of the earth and attacks me very personally and tells me that I have severe fundamental issues and that's the only reason that I could be the way I am. We don't live together but we stay with each other most nights, and are planning on living together in a house with other people next year. We're also in the middle of finals, which means that he's been meaner than usual. This morning I asked if he could accompany me on a five minute drive to drop something off (I didn't want to walk because I have two painful slipped disks in my back and having the flu makes everything hurt, and I wanted someone else in the car so I wouldn't get a ticket) and I asked him not to get mad at me for asking, but he got really angry and started telling me that he doesn't understand why I can't walk because even if he was deathly ill he would walk. And then I mentioned my back and he said, ""you hurt because you don't exercise. You never do. You're literally at the bottom now,"" at which point I just left to do shit myself (didn't get a ticket!). When I got back he apologized and said he's just ""stressed out."" Tonight, we were studying together and I constantly asked him to stop bouncing his legs because it's really loud and distracting. He snapped and started yelling at me for hating on him all night and being such a horrible person and taking advantage of him, etc. When we get in fights he also tries to make me feel as if I take advantage of him all the time and that I do nothing in return for our relationship. He told me that he has to chauffeur me all the time and cater to my needs and then told me he was upset that he had to take care of me last week when I was sick. I just packed up my stuff and walked back to my own apartment. 

Recently I've been noticing that he does fairly often, almost subconsciously trying to make me feel as if I owe him the world or something because he does so much stuff for me and is apparently so supportive of me emotionally and I just take advantage of him and don't give him anything in return. I don't even know if it counts as emotionally abusive behavior but it's just so tiring. I know that I don't treat him the way that he accuses me of treating him, and I do put in a lot of effort into making him happy and comfortable. It's not a one sided relationship; he doesn't do everything and I don't do everything. But it's just started to feel less and less worth it because he makes me feel so often like I'm worth nothing. He also lies a lot, especially about drug usage. He's lied to me about using cocaine when I told him that it made me feel uncomfortable when he used it (because he would way overdo it), and when I asked him to stop smoking weed for one month because he was high all the time he agreed to and then got high anyways, but he made sure to put on cologne or something to mask the scent. He also hides the fact that he chews tobacco and stuff from me. I'm not against him doing drugs as long as he's careful about what he does, but he always overdoes it, even before he knew I was uncomfortable, and after I told him. 

Sorry this is so long. I just needed to get all this out and I still feel like there's so much I want to rant about.. He's my first serious boyfriend and we've been together for all of college and have talked about staying together. We really understand each other and we usually get along really easily. I'm just starting to think that even though I love him so much, he might not be a good person for me to be with. And I don't want to break up with him, even though sometimes I feel like it would be better for me, which kind of scares me."

This is actually my first post on reddit. I am a reader for many years now. This time, I am really hoping to get some help from you guys.

I am very fascinated with products that come from Silicon Valley. I have the feeling that all the cool stuff we are using today were developed there yesterday, so all the cool stuff we will be using tomorrow is being developed right now, right there. Especially, Tesla. The first time I drove that car it was amazing. I had the very same feeling when Steve Jobs came up with the iPhone. I mean, Nokia built great mobile phones - as Audi is building great cars. But the iPhone was a revolution, not an evolution process. These words are just to give you an idea of my passion towards well designed products.

My name is Simon, I am 27 years old and have just graduated from a German school in mechanical engineering with a masters degree in energy management and process engineering. I have been travelling through Asia since February and I am now travelling in the states until mid of June. During that time I found out that I don't want to go the ""easy"" job way in Germany. I would love to start my career in the United States. I will be in San Francisco for at least a week to meet some people I know, hopefully to learn about interesting companies in Silicon Valley who would be interested in hiring me. 

If you would be willing to meet me for a cup of coffee and tell me about your experience in the Bay Area, I would be very happy. The thing is, that I don't know how it works in the states in general. Should I go the official way to apply for a job? How can I make sure I share my passion for certain things with the HR dept, since I won't be in the states for too long? Can I just walk into Tesla's headquarter and tell them ""Hey, I'm Simon, I'd like to be your next intern"" or would that be a really bad idea? Is there any chance to have a guided tour in companies in general? Find out what they do and how they do it? As you see, I am asking for advice here.

Looking forward for replies ;-)

Thank you reddit."
4ip93m,0,2016-05-10,Finding an internship as a game designer : The struggle ?,Droms,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/4ip93m/finding_an_internship_as_a_game_designer_the/,"Hi everyone, I hope I'm in the right sub.

I'm on my 4th year of study in a game design school (*Supinfogame*, it's in France) and this June I'm supposed to find an internship. Many friends already found something with ease but most of those are artists. Indeed most of my class (Game design) really struggles to find anything, and of the few that did find an internship, most of them are almost unrelated (Q&amp;A for example). 


I don't really know if it's dependent on the country but, at least in France, I've seen two main tendencies : 

* On the one hand you have really small developpers with really shady practices (""1.5 month internship which could end in somekind of unclear Freelance status""; 3 employees and looking for 5 interns for the summer ...)

* On the other hand you have big developpers like Ubisoft which simply aren't interested in taking a intern for 4 month when he's going to spend 2 months learning the home engine and the way everything works)


And here I am struggling to find something that fits me (I study Game Design but I'm more interested into anything ""in-engine"" like level design and building) or even find something at all. I've looked at what most people recommend so I made a portfolio with past projects and mods I worked on (Although I use an ugly wordpress I'm working on a real website made with Muse). 

The tip that everyones tells is to make contacts, and I have a few contacts but they all work in big AAA studios which have no interest in a 4 month internship. 

So here's my real question : Does anyone has real good advice on how to position myself regarding an internship offer (I would love to ""get my hands dirty"" and work on level design, but should I still apply for a pure ""game design make documents"" type of internship?)? Should I value some of my skills more than others (I have after all the same education as my classmates, should I insist more on things like modding)? Should I apply for intenrship outside of France ?(Because it apparently cost a lot to make a stranger work in, let's say the US or UK).

I'm sorry for the not really well written message, I'm a bit lost and stressed even though I'm just in the same case as most of my classmates, thanks for you time anyways :)

4iq7xx,107,2016-05-10,My [27 M] friend's GF [27 F] is dissing me behind my back,JackAndJillUpTheHill,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4iq7xx/my_27_m_friends_gf_27_f_is_dissing_me_behind_my/,"I [M 27] have been friends with Dan [27 M] since college. We are roommates now, and we live outside of Boston. His long-term girlfriend Lexie [27 F] lives in Providence, where Dan is from.

Lexie is dissing me behind my back now (details to come), and the only reason that makes any sense starts about three years ago when Lexie introduced me to her friend Lauren, a med student at Brown. We liked each other, but med students don't have a lot of free time, I was working a lot, Boston and Providence are about an hour apart, and so finding the right time and circumstances to get together just didn't happen. We saw each other maybe three times over the course of a year, and every time we were hanging out with Dan and Lexie, not out on a date. Nothing ever happened between us.

About two years ago, Lauren got out of med school and her best internship offer was at a hospital in Minnesota. Before she left, she called me, told me she was moving to Minnesota, and said we should have one real date before she went. I thought it was little odd, but I wasn't seeing anyone, and there was no reason *not* to do it, so I went to see her the next night.

We went to a little bar that had a folky-type guitar player/singer and then we went back to her apartment. One of her roommates was there and we all talked together until about 1am. I said it was time for me to leave 'cos I had an hour trip back to Boston, but Lauren said I should drive back in the morning. The roommate disappeared, and Lauren said very clearly there would be no sex involved, she'd just feel better if I drove home in the morning. I thought she was worried I was too drunk to drive, but I'd only had 3 beers over the course of 5 hours, on top of a big meal, and I am 6' 2"" and I was not drunk at all. She pulled out the couch and I slept there.

Sometime in the early morning, Lauren woke me up by climbing under the covers with me on the couch. She said I was too much of a gentleman and she had been waiting in her bed for hours for me to come in. I was completely surprised, it was a real WTF moment. It never entered my mind to go to her bedroom! Meanwhile, though, she was topless and making it very hard to resist, and even though sex wasn't on my mind at all when the night began, it was really starting to seem like a very nice option.

Afterwards, she said she wasn't looking for a relationship, she was going to Minnesota and we'd probably never see each other again, that it was just a fling, she was horny, nervous about uprooting her life, etc., etc. Leaving a few hours later, I was pretty awkward and she thought that was funny.

About a month later, she called me and we had a good talk. She said it was incredibly stressful being an intern, but things were going well, and she hoped I forgave her for ambushing me that day, and she thanked me for giving her a good send off (her exact words, the best I can remember). I told her I was glad to be of service, and I hoped that everything went well with her internship. We haven't spoken since.

A few days after that call, I don't remember exactly when, Lexie called me, she was pretty irate, and said that Lauren told her everything. Her basic complaint was that I had taken advantage of Lauren, and I told her that was very far from the truth, that Lauren jumped on me when I was sleeping on the couch, etc. I didn't think it was any of Lexie's business, but Lauren was her friend, and she had tried to get us together, so I tried to show her that I didn't do anything wrong, and anyway, there was no problem because Lauren was fine with everything that happened. By the end of the call, Lexie seemed to have calmed down and accepted that I hadn't taken advantage of her friend.

I thought the issue was dead and buried, but last night I found out that for the last 8 months, Lexie has been dissing me to Jill, a friend-of-a-friend of hers who is now my girlfriend. As far as I know, Lexie didn't tell Jill any details about Lauren, but she did say that I was selfish, inconsiderate, someone for a smart woman to avoid at all costs. Jill was getting to know me during that time, and not seeing any of the traits that Lexie was describing, and she finally decided that Lexie was full of shit and dissing me for some unexplained reason, not because I was actually a jerk. I am really lucky that Jill didn't write me off after hearing Lexie's opinion of me.

I am not sure what to do now. I'd love to tell Lexie to stop dissing me behind my back, but I don't want there to be any friction between me and Dan, and more importantly, I am in a really good mood and I don't want any drama in my life, especially now. I am angry with Lexie, but I can ignore that. The thing that is going to bug me is not knowing why she did (is doing) this.  

**tl;dr**: I found out last night that my friend's girlfriend is dissing me behind my back for no good reason. Not sure what to do, if anything."

* How is a candidate that has just finished his undergraduate studies seen? I see that some of you have years of experience. I will most likely have one internship this summer, maybe one next summer (for the Fall 2017 entrance it wouldn't matter anyway) and a 3.0 GPA (my current GPA). Would I fall short of the requisites?
* Do you know if it's allowed to pursue the OMSCS while pursuing another masters in a different institution? From what I read, it's not possible to be accepted into the degree if you already have a masters in CS.

I've always wanted to go to grad school, because I genuinely love learning. 

I'm considering pursuing a CS career rather than being a mechanical engineer. I realized all my favorite projects I've worked on involved software. Specifically, at my internship, I programmed a sun tracking robot for a high altitude balloon payload. I loved the process of creating an algorithm, debugging, and improving it. I'm also great at math. So I could definitely see myself working in software. 

If I were to get an MS in CS, I would definitely have to spend some time taking prerequisites. It will also be tough to get into a great school, even with my GPA and experience, since my BS is in Mechanical Engineering. Honestly, the idea of getting a second BS appeals more to me. I would be able to take my time learning the fundamentals. But from a little research online, it seems like most people recommend going straight for the MS if one is coming from an engineering BS.

Since this is for a grocery-esque type company, and I have 'experience' in grocery (I work part-time putting merchandise on shelves in the drug-store half of a grocery/drug-store chain) he suggested being an ""operations intern"" where I would walk around their store basically troubleshooting their computers and kiosks.

Right now I'm in my second year of Network &amp; Security Engineering (university of applied sciences in the Netherlands). I love it, programming, ISO network layers, security it's fucking awesome.

I'm facing one problem though. At school I'm quite good at programming. Especially Java and C. Most programming project are 7/10 or higher. Those projects are always in group between 2 and 4 people, to improve our collaboration skills. Last period had an internship at a web dev company. Worked there as a front end dev, not my thing but learned a lot. My supervisor said I had a lot of dedication and self discipline. 

So looks great, right? The problem starts when I'm try to program on my own. Like building a prime number finder that saves it results in a database. I just don't know where to start and when I got something: how to expand in a controlled way. I start to over engineer it like crazy with UML and ER diagrams for the simple C application and accompanying database. I just don't get really far and abandon the project.

4ir7ly,3,2016-05-10,Looking for advice,veggieswillsaveusall,dietetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/4ir7ly/looking_for_advice/,"Hello, all! 
I have looked through a few pages of this sub, and feel that my situation and questions are unique enough to warrant their own post. If you feel that another post would answer my questions, please feel free to direct me to it! This might be a bit of a wall of text (I’ve been thinking about these things for a *loooong* while) – so I apologize in advance!

&amp;nbsp;
Background: I’m 26. I hold a BFA in Theatre Performance. Years ago I wanted to be in the circus so I went and got a performance degree and then actually went to circus school for a while. I totally burned out and decided, about 3 1/2 years ago, that I didn’t want to do it anymore. I moved back to my home city (Richmond, VA), and spent some time trying to figure out what was next. I landed on, of all things, farming. I’ve now been working on organic farms since early 2012. I’ve worked for a state wide organic advocacy agency, a small family farm, and I currently run a 4,500-person volunteer program for a non-profit farm which grows over 130,000 lbs of organic produce annually for distribution in low income, low access areas. 

&amp;nbsp;
Which brings me to the present moment… I’d like to head back to school! But I have NO idea where to begin. I see a lot of different paths in front of me, and I am confused about which to take. I know that I want to study nutrition, however, without a solid background in science I feel like I am floundering a bit. Ideally I wouldn’t need to complete an entirely new bachelor’s degree – however, many science &amp; math classes during my undergrad years I tested out of/they weren’t required courses, so I don’t actually have credit for things like BIO 101 or CHEM 101 on a collegiate level (thanks AP Science courses!). Side note: The one thing I have on my side here is that my soon-to-be husband is a professor at a local university, and I can take classes there for free once we’re married. I could, theoretically, do an entire BS in Biochemistry for the cost of lab fees and books. More specifically, I could get some of the gen-eds or pre-reqs out of the way (things like BIO 101 or CHEM 101) there, and then move into a dietetics or nutrition program. QUESTION 1: IS AN ENTIRELY NEW BACHELORS DEGREE THE PATH I SHOULD TAKE?

&amp;nbsp;
Once university near me does offer a dietetics [certificate program](http://www.agriculture.vsu.edu/files/docs/dietetic/certificate-program-plan-of-study.pdf) for folks who already hold a bachelor’s degree. It’s an accredited certificate program and satisfies the curriculum needed to apply for a dietetics internship. QUESTION 2: DO CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS HOLD UP AGAINST TRADITIONAL UNDERGRAD DEGREES? 

&amp;nbsp;
Other option: There is an out of state college that offers online MS degrees in Nutrition. No pre-reqs, which I will admit is weird for an MS degree. They certainly offer suggestions of classes they think you should have… but it seems a little off to me. The curriculum there looks GREAT: organic chemistry, nutritional biochemistry &amp; physiology, statistics, etc among their core curriculum PLUS a track in Human Clinical Nutrition. QUESTION 3: ANY THOUGHTS ON AN MS DEGREE WITH NO GRE OR PRE-REQ REQUIREMENTS?

&amp;nbsp;
Ideally here, I think I would get the certificate, do the internship, and then get the MS. That track is the cheapest, would take the least amount of time, and would award me the degrees and certifications I require. QUESTION 4: DOES THIS SEEM LIKE A REASONABLE IDEA? (IE – AM I TOTALLY CRAZY?)

&amp;nbsp;
Any advice… wisdom… gems? I appreciate anyone who took the time to read this through. If it’s any consolation, I’ll be heaping this information on a career counselor this Friday, in the hopes that she can help me suss out the possibilities as well. THANK YOU!

4ircfn,0,2016-05-10,Too early to start studying?,_Arcane,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/4ircfn/too_early_to_start_studying/,"Hi, I'm currently a senior in high school and am going to school for Actuarial Science and either double major with computer science or minor. I've been on this subreddit a lot lately and it seems that the ability to get jobs and internships is based on the number of exams you pass. I have my summer essentially free besides my work, so I was thinking about starting to work towards taking an exam. I took AP Stats and AP Calc this year and got pretty good grades in them, so I think I could get the concepts, but I'm just worried that if I take and pass an exam by Octoberish that when I get into the job market in 5 years I might forget the material that I need to do my job. I'm not sure if it would be the right call or not, I just have a lot of time this summer and want to put it to good use.


EDIT: I was also thinking about mastering excel too but I'm not sure how useful that would be."

I recently received a phone call that I'd be receiving an internship offer within the next few days at Samsung. However, I'm also scheduled for a second interview next week with a hiring manager at Qualcomm, whose position and location is much more enticing than Samsung. My first interview with Qualcomm went really well, and although I don't want to be overconfident, I am fairly certain I have a good chance at receiving an offer with them as well. 

My predicament is that when I receive Samsung's offer, I'll have at most a week to accept or deny. I'm worried that I won't have a proper chance at my second interview with Qualcomm before time is up for me to make a decision on Samsung. Should I try emailing Qualcomm with my situation and see if I could get an earlier interview? I know I should be grateful I've even received an offer, but being this close to working at Qualcomm I hate that how I'll be spending my summer may only come down to a few days difference. Any advice would be appreciated!"
4irkf8,2,2016-05-10,Police Certification,MorroClearwater,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/4irkf8/police_certification/,"Hey guys, 

I'm having an issue regarding getting a police certificate and I was wondering if anybody has some information that could help me out. I've been trying to get this sorted for about a month now to no success and if I don't get this sorted soon I'm going to be down almost €2'000.

I'm doing a TEFL Internship with ImmerQi, and I've gone through most of the steps, however, to get through the next section, ImmerQi need a background check. I've applied for this through my local Garda station but I have been since informed that I need a 'request' from the Chinese Embassy to access the information. My friend, who applied at the same time to a different Garda station required no such document and has already received his certificate. 

ImmerQi have no idea about any of this, and when I contacted the Chinese Embassy they said they don't know about anything to do with this and can't help me. Does anybody here on Reddit know anything about this or have come across something like it before?"
4irm3i,14,2016-05-10,Engineers/Producers in Ohio - does anyone know where the opportunities are?,Red_PillCosby,audioengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/4irm3i/engineersproducers_in_ohio_does_anyone_know_where/,"Hey r/AudioEngineering! I'm about to finish a B.S. Communications - Music Production and am feeling pretty defeated by all the hype surrounding my program / promise of work that drew me in (since this ""career"" is turning more into a glorified hobby for many of the masses flooding the program).

I'm certainly not your average-joe musician. Started piano lessons at 8 and played numerous recitals (including All-Ohio Piano Ensemble twice) and played for composer Robert Vandall. Then got in the percussion program at school at 10 (around the same time my uncle started me on guitar and bass) and played a year of bass, then guitar, then piano in the high school jazz ensemble while playing in our renowned percussion ensemble all four years. At 18, I accepted a gig teaching piano for a local lessons studio for some 15 students (for chump change) while I took the assistant musical director / conductor / pianist role for our college branch's production of Little Shop of Horrors. Here at main campus I spent a semester studying as a dual major BA guitar, and played in the jazz combo, then 2 semesters in the big band after I dropped. 

I grew up around an ""old gun"" who spent his glory days in live sound and video, with a stash of Sony Betacams and Allen and Heath boards, Cart machines, Ampex reels, you name it... I was no stranger to the old gear in the first place. I'd also started learning Ableton in high school to self record with my indie band at the time. 

So I've gotten well acquainted with Logic X / Pro Tools in my program and even Max MSP. I know plenty of your typical mic set ups for singer songwriter / acoustic guitarists, speaker cabinets, piano, hip hop vocals, kit, full bands, whatever. Though I haven't set foot in a studio for a while, I'm competent to cut you a semi-pro mix over my Mackies &amp; Sennheiser Cans + Sonarworks Reference 3. In my time playing guitar I've become quite good at setups as well, and am no stranger with schematics or a sautering iron. I'm also an Audio Engineering Society member. The two portfolio productions I'm finalizing are a public domain melody featuring 9 school of music singers over my playing (arranged by a friend in the composition department) and an original copyrighted jazz composition by a regular contest winning  pianist from France, headed to Berklee on a full ride. 

My issue right now is that everyone in Academia said I need to focus on unpaid internships (that don't really exist in my area) to add value and experience to my degree, but the big wigs that visited campus said it was unwise to give free work to people that are just using you for it. I also worked under the impression that my portfolio mattered more, but the big wigs said they just look at your resume and experience. 

I really think I could make a decent producer, and feel I could bring arranging and cowriting to the table as well as custom sound design... but there aren't too many bands in my area that I could even start charging for home recorded demos. Any of the ones I've been put in contact with (I have a promoter buddy who has a sizeable roster) have jerked me around and bailed or screwed me out of studio time... They generally feel they are too good to take criticism or input on their songs and look at me as next to worthless, since everyone that buys a two channel interface and an entry level large diaphragm condensor is an ""engineer"". 

Has anyone with my degree made something of themselves in the studio realm here in Ohio? Can anyone offer me advice to get my foot in the door? I would rather bust my ass in a studio 70-80 hours a week for mcwages than compete for a ""live sound gig"" running cables. I've worked my whole life rounding myself out to live this dream and realize the business is dying, and that I have vast competition with half my skillset and more schmoozing ability. Am I being an entitled millenial? Should I shut up and give up and go run conference sound (aka let's help 8 other people setup 1 dynamic mic at a podium or clip a lapel on somebody and sit there for 5 hours to make sure nothing goes wrong)."

Should I have handled it differently?,dracis09,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/4irrz6/ex_contacts_me_after_36_days_of_nc_should_i_have/,"My [22F] girlfriend broke up with me [22M] almost 2 months ago after being together for almost a year. The relationship got complacent, I started being a little needy and I sort of made her the center in my life. I realized after a few weeks post breakup all the mistakes I started making the last few weeks of the relationship and even admitted them to her. I told her I was willing to work on this weak behavior but she wasn't ready too start a ""new"" relationship although she couldn't say she wouldn't want to in the future. She said she wanted to focus this last month or so with her friends before they all left the city after graduation. We both finished college finals last week and she graduates in a few days. We will both be in the same city for a whole another year but we are currently in different cities for the summer. She contacted me the last night of finals(4 days ago) asking me how finals were, when do I start my internship, and about my surgery that I had yesterday(she was in a very upbeat attitude as well). The conversation lasted over two days in which she didn't respond to my last message Saturday but responded back Sunday evening. I made sure I ended the conversation and I said ""well I'm about to get my stuff together and crash so I'll catch you later!"" (because I was waking up to have jaw surgery early the next morning). I'm confused on why she texted me in the first place and if I handled this properly. Its now two days post surgery and Im kind of surprised she hasn't texted me. I do like hearing from her and I do want her back but I am FINALLY at the point where I know I am going to be happy with or with out her. Although my heart was broken, we ended on good terms and it was necessary if ""us"" was going to make it for the long run. Should I ever reach out to her or do I still let her continue to reach out to me? This post surgery stress/depression is kinda getting to me... I was heading in a really good direction til this but I KNOW I will be on top of my shit come 1-2 weeks from now."

I lurked this sub a lot and I'm pretty passionate about cs.   
 
I'm studying at the ""best"" public university here but I don't know if US employers would look down on my resume because of my school. When do you think I should start applying for internships, should I still apply if there is a slim chance I get in? I should probably stick to big companies willing to deal with my visa I suppose? A friend of mine interned at Microsoft last summer with a J-1 visa. 
    
Is it realistic for me to think I will get an offer and move to the US as soon as I graduate or am I just being naive?    I wanted to study in the US but for reasons beyond my control I have to support myself financially and I would have to use all my savings to study there instead of studying here for free.

My school is ranked 100-150 worldwide. [Here are the courses I will be taking, if anyone cares I can translate them](http://www.fciencias.unam.mx/licenciatura/mapa/104/1556).

I got this in the mail today for what I will be doing for the summer:

""IT Application Services- Assist with application and web development""

Does this mean I will be involved with app/web development? It would be a pleasant surprise if so. Otherwise, I want to know what it actually means. I have looked at my managers linkedin profile and he doesn't seam to be a developer but an experienced manager and system's analyst. 

Other interns had the task of :
""Security- helping to develop new infrastructure initiatives""

this sounds way more exciting to me . would it involve a lot of development stuff?


EDIT: what can I do to prepare myself for this role?"
4irzir,0,2016-05-10,A Little Concerned About My Experience,PC_MeganS,peacecorps,https://www.reddit.com/r/peacecorps/comments/4irzir/a_little_concerned_about_my_experience/,"So, I just submitted my application to the Peace Corps a few days ago.  My country selections were Vanuatu, Mongolia, and Eastern Caribbean (I was disqualified from most countries due to my ADD medications and the fact that I've only had a year and a half of high school Spanish, so my options were fairly limited when I factored in the sectors I could match).  I did put any sector, but I did select countries with either a Youth and Development program or an Education program.


I've been browsing this forum for the past week, and I'm becoming increasingly concerned that my work experience just doesn't cut it.  Some people here have incredible amounts of experience.  I've been thinking seriously about this decision for about a year, but I haven't had years to build up a resume specifically for the Peace Corps.  I have a backup plan in case I need more focused experience, which involves me working as a server in the evening and then continuing refugee/immigrant tutoring for ESL.  I'm hoping this would add a little bit more to my resume.


Here is what I have on my resume so far (clearly not written like this on my own resume).


**My Education**

University of Denver, degrees in both International Studies and Journalism; minors in History and Hebrew


**Youth and Development related:**

* Unit Head at a summer camp, June 2015-August 2015; I basically ran an entire age unit all summer, which included 20 staff members and 90 campers each session (with 3 sessions each summer); this involved developing, implementing, and overseeing both unit programs and all-camp programs (some of which had to be educational)

* Counselor at a summer camp, summers of 2010, 2011, and 2012

* Taught kid's art/sewing classes also in the summer of 2010

* Volunteered with a children's day camp when I was a Girl Scout  in high school (two summers, I believe)


**Education related:**

* Tutored refugees and immigrants for citizenship courses, March 2016-May 2016

* English language instructor at a Turkish summer camp, June 2014 - August 2014 (also Youth and Development relevance); this actually adds up to nearly 350 hours spent with English language learners, and every activity had to include some sort of English instruction aspect (as well as creating lesson plans)


**Miscellaneous work experience:**

* Public Programs intern, Aspen Institute; this one is actually this summer; it's a lot of logistics and coordinating various events

* Marketing intern/volunteer for a Denver nonprofit that brings international visitors to the US through the State Department, January 2015 - June 2015 (3 months for credit, 3 months volunteer work)

* Reporting intern for the Jerusalem Post, June 2012 - August 2012


Plus, I worked part-time all throughout college (at one point, two jobs).


My abroad experience includes a total of 7 months in Israel and a total of 7 months in Turkey.  I have experience working professionally in both of these countries.


I am highly proficient in Hebrew, but I have a basic proficiency in Turkish (these languages aren't going to get me anywhere, I know; but they show a dedication to learning foreign languages).


I was the cofounder and treasurer of my university's Model Arab League, I was a participant in our Model UN, I was a contributing writer to my school's newspaper, and I was a cofounder of our Spoken Word Club.  I was a student ambassador for our Media, Film, and Journalism Studies department.


I earned my Silver Award as a Girl Scout in high school (which does require a pretty significant amount of volunteer hours).  I'm CPR certified, as well.


I'm just very concerned that my experience isn't quite tailored enough.  I've been reading about people with much more specific experience getting rejected.


If this is the case, do you think spending 6-8 months as an ESL tutor would strengthen me enough as a candidate?  It's through a catholic charity, and they do provide ESL training.  I mean, I'm going to do it either way because it's fulfilling and I'm doing something positive for my community.  But, I'm wondering if there's something else I could do if that doesn't seem to be enough.


Sorry if this is some sloppy writing.  I had to type this out pretty quickly.  Thanks for any insight!"

A friend of mine recommended me Reddit IT careers sub and just have a couple questions.

I'm attending CSUDH as a college student and about to graduate from the Program Bachelors of Arts in Computer Technology.
Also during my years I build up work experience.

At my school campus I was a Computer Lab Support Assistant for 1 year then left.

Then I got hired at a call center for a few days ( got fired, well I can't meet their unpredictable schedules)

And then a Month later got hired working for a school district IT Intern mostly as a Field Tech and a Help Desk Agent.

I been a paid intern here with the school district for 2 years and I do love the work.

In a couple of days I should be graduating with my Bachelors Degree.

So am I ready to take on the IT World with my experience? What jobs can I qualify for? 

Is there something else I could have done maybe? 
Also Im graduating from CSUDH, its not really the most big named school but its valided and would employers care where I graduated from?

My GPA will be 2.5

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes.

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

Experienced PC builder. Build a handful of personal PCs, including my latest mITX watercooled one. I move 2-3 times per year for internships, school, home, etc. and even though my mITX is small and portable, I'm not a fan of moving it since it's watercooled, I'd like to avoid re-hooking everything up when I do move around, and, I guess I'm just looking to build another PC! It's a hobby of mine and I tend to build one every couple years. This time around, here's explicitly what I'm looking for:

* I have a 980 in my mITX with a 3440x1440 monitor; in the summer, I'm usually gaming on an old 1080p monitor; so I'm looking for a **low budget** system that'll hit **60 fps** at **1080p** on **medium settings** with **modern games**. With my experience with PC building, I foresee myself spending **$350-500**, since I already have everything else, this is *just* the tower. 

 (Note: Another thing I am considering is using a laptop with an external GPU, e.g. [Razer Core](http://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-core), but I am skeptical of performance I'll gain from that. It seems gimicky; while the GPU *may* not be the bottleneck anymore (can anyone give me information on how bus speed via thunderbolt as opposed to PCI-E affects GPU benchmarks? Does it even matter?), laptop CPUs aren't great either. So I feel like I'm going to notice significant FPS drops when game effects are performed on the CPU; Looking at you APB, when people threw grenades, the smoke particles were rendered on the CPU, which made my laptop shit the bed. Is this technology better now?)

* **CASE**: This is probably the part I'm having the most trouble with. There are obvious, small-scale cases designed for portability like the [graphite](http://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Graphite-380T-Mini-ITX-Portable/dp/B00LA70SKO), e.g small cases with handles and such designed for portability. *However*, the more interesting discussion lies with these kinds of cases: [Bravo](http://www.xoxide.com/chieftec-bravo-case-vesa.html) (as asked in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/19ig19/is_there_such_a_thing_as_an_ultraportable_gaming/) thread 3 years ago in /r/buildapc) Can anyone recommend/have experience with cases like the Bravo? True portability as it includes the monitor?

* So here's what I'm thinking: If you're on a budget, AMD carries more weight in the AMD vs Intel decision; I think a 4-core+ AMD CPU would be sufficient. What about one of these?

 CPU: [Vishera](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819113286) or [Kabini](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819113364)
* GPU: Since I typically don't constrain my budget on gaming builds, I've been going NVIDIA. Now that I know this is only to game at 1080p, I can really skimp with a medium-level GPU. I'm not sure about AMD cards, but could anyone recommend the AMD equivalent of GTX 950/960? (NVIDIA users would probably agree with me that the 50-60 series is capable of 60fps/1080p gaming, correct?)

* PSU: Since I'm powering a mid range GPU/CPU, I anticipate I can get something around 350-450W? I think that should be sufficient.

* RAM: 16GB DDR3 should be sufficient and appropriate for my budget.

* I have the rest of the components already picked out.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

* 1080p
* 60 FPS
* Medium settings
* Modern games

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

$350-500

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

United States - NewEgg/Amazon

So this takes place late-2000s, I'd just finished college in a medium-sized US city and offered a job from my internship company ""Orangered"" (a small IT contract company of ~30 people). This was my first break from retail and in IT. 

Details have been altered for readability, names have been changed to protect the innocent and the guilty, and any similarities found to real events are *completely* unintentional. 

Our cast of characters:

* Myself: fresh college grad and PFY

* Susan: HR and classmate from college

* Dave: Owner of Orangered IT

* Jack: Senior support tech

* Arnold: Support tech manager, ex-Army Drill Sergeant (unconfirmed)

* Randy: Developer

* Jim: Security specialist

&gt; * Internal monologue. We occasionally see eye-to-eye

**Part VI**

The symptoms were very much reminiscent of a type of malware I'd read about. [One of reasonable historic note in IT, even](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm). While that one had plagued networks 20-ish years ago, SalesClient had found a more modern version of something quite similar: a piece of malware that constantly replicated itself until it inhabited all unused drive space. I sent our senior security guy Jim a sample of the worm, mostly so he could find an updated definition to get their antivirus to par in stopping this. 

And SalesClient had put it on their file server, and spread it to nearly all of the office. 

OtherSalesClient was mid-transaction. From my limited exposure, SalesClient used some software tool to make transactions and documentation on their local machine, but when they clicked Save it would upload their changes to a database on the file server. All transactions required a time and date for transaction submission as a sort of 'close time', and when this particular time and date came up the software would make the transaction charge and send an email with a receipt to the customer and SalesClient. This let everyone work on separate things simultaneously but still have a centralized compilation of all sales data, and clients are charged when their purchase would take effect. From my Google-Fu, any orders that weren't submitted while the software isn't running will get backlogged and sent at next possible time. 

I explained the situation as best I could to SalesManager. While he seemed upset about some random malware getting past their firewall and antivirus, he had confidence this was to prevent something more disastrous. He manually ran a current summary report of the file server and knew something bad would be happening soon if I didn't intervene, and gave me the all clear. I disconnected network from their file server and had all suspected infected in the office disconnect from the Intranet, then started the tedious process of clean-up. 

Partway through cleanup, Jim sent me a batch file that killed the running process and cleared up remains of the malware, which cut down cleanup time significantly for end users instead of taking their machines down and running malware removal software from another machine. The file server took the better part of four hours to clear off, while a user machine was closer to 20-30 minutes. Luckily, I was able to do a lot of this work in parallel. 

The users were cleared a little before close of business, but I had to hang around a little longer so I could get their server back up and running for tomorrow morning. SalesManager leaves me the key to lock up when I'm done and I do so once I've finished up and checked connectivity. No word from Jim, or anyone else from Orangered. I decide to drop off my work supplies back at the office and check my email before heading home.

While I was cleaning up the mess, reconnected their file server, deleted the suspicious email and sent out an explanation to the users of how to treat suspicious emails, I got the typical message from Dave:

'Client had unexpected downtime per your actions. Send a report of this incident by close of business today.'

Not a soul was left in the office. 

By now, Jim from our security team had nitpicked a fair amount of the sample I sent his team and I had a full analysis from someone far more knowledgeable than I regarding the type of malware this was, I had the source identified and had probably the most bullet-proof report I'd ever written for Dave regarding any issue I'd encountered with Orangered. Things honestly couldn't have been better from our response: I'd been onsite before we recognized this as a network incident and even prevented several workers from getting their machines infected. No data was lost, but two business hours were considered downtime for their server, the rest of the time was outside their normal hours. 

My 4-page report detailing the incident was summarized to one short email from Dave:

""So why did you take down the file server for this? The uninfected machines could have kept workflow going while you cleared off infected PCs.""

I honestly didn't know how to explain this. Dave *owned* the company, I would have expected him to understand this was a measure to prevent spread before we had identified what this was. 

*The next week*

There's no slots for taking the Security exam outside of business hours, so I schedule to do it over my lunch break. After a gruelling 40 minutes, I get back and finish the day. My results are emailed to me the next day: 95% (one question missed). Quite acceptable. I forward this to Susan as well as a photocopy of the expense. She sends me a congratulations for being the first to finish a certificate since our meeting and says the reimbursement will be included in next week's check.

Still no word on that raise, though. 

Rather bothered by the fiscal situation, I decided to take a look at that feedback for tickets we reviewed to see what was being used against me. I'd setup the new Orangered Helpdesk Software on a virtual machine we'd just setup weeks ago, and since the old Orangered Helpdesk Software wasn't compatible I archived all of our old tickets in raw text on the virtual machine for reference. The file was quite jumbled, but I was able to search for the blocks relevant by ticket numbers. 

What I found was ... concerning.

&gt; So, the ticket was closed on 28 May, SalesClient sends feedback 29 May. But a day before our meeting in mid-June, a user named MisspelledSalesClient edited the feedback from positive to negative and left some vague complaints.

  This is my first text post on here, but I've been following a few subreddits for a while now. I apologize if this is just another annoying career advice thing, but I've been putting it off posting it here because I've read a lot of other peoples and I want to make sure I'm putting the right information at there that I think would be helpful for you all to help me.

  I am looking for career advice and here are the basics about my educational background and some personality information to help you all get a sense of where I'm coming from. 

* **Background**

* I am an INTP. I've tested INFP maybe twice, but for the most part, I test INTP and relate most to this type. 
* I am currently a year from graduating college. *BA in Anthropology/Minor in ""Creative Work""/Honors College*.
* In high school I wanted to be first a neurosurgeon, then a neurologist, then ""not really sure, but some type of physician"" 
* Senior year of high school came and after doing some clinical rotations at a pretty non-eventful suburban hospital, *I decided that there were a lot of things I didn't explore whilst in high school that I was interested in*. Went in as a bio major, but switched quickly before classes started to Political Science (decided, let's be a lawyer! and then the idea kind of wore off). **Political Science --&gt; Graphic Communications** (Graphic Design basically. Because I've always loved art, but the studio hours and my inability to manage my time [[will cover this part later]] really messed up my sleep schedule and started to affect my mood/mental health. We're talking really bad sleep paralysis almost every night, bad eating habits, bad thoughts all around) **--&gt; Anthropology** (took an intro course in cultural anthropology, fell in love, wasn't 100 percent committed to being an anthropologist per se, but I LOVED the curriculum). My Creative Work minor was out of curiosity and seemed to supplement the Graphic Design major pretty well, but in all honesty, I stuck with it even after changing my major to Anthro because I just really enjoyed studying art philosophy. Like REALLY enjoyed that. 
* Time management thing: After a bit of research, I've come to the conclusion that I probably have ADHD. But apparently it affects women differently (was completely unaware of this until now) and after reading about HOW it affects women and after talking to someone about their experiences and their late diagnosis at 30-something, I have come to realize that I am almost 97% sure that this is what causes me to....idk. Do the thing. The thinking out a concept thing for like an hour in the shower sitting in the tub and then following all the points it leads me to for another two hours as like everything that needs to be done goes **very very undone** Crazy messy room. Really hard time organizing things *(although I have recently gotten better at this)*. And really hard time with procrastination. I hope to talk to my physician soon to discuss treatment. 
* If any of you are aware of Dabrowski's Overexcitabilities: My main overexcitability is sensory. Second is intelligence. (I think this helps to better understand affinity of the arts)



**The Nitty Gritty**

Now that we've gotten the introductory over with, here is my problem right now. And I hope you guys can relate and offer some friendly advice or possible areas to do more research in. 

As an almost senior, I am fast running out of ideas for my next move. I am still not set on a career really. My mother has convinced me to give medicine another try. (Except her advice is to go into nursing because it's more immediate and I'm running out of time really). I entertained this idea for a little while, but I'm still not entirely sure if I'll enjoy being an RN. I'm currently interning in curatorial research at an art gallery, but I'm not really that sold on that either. In fact, both of these things I mostly have to feign interest in in order to convince myself that these are viable options for me. (Bad I know, but the anxiety of not knowing is very overwhelming right now). 

As of now, I am enrolled for another year of college (technically will be my fifth year) so that I can take nursing prerequisites for a nursing program that I would enroll in after I take a year off to teach English in either Spain or France. Also I think it's important to note that my mom is suggesting nursing to ultimately become a nurse anesthetist which I know is definitely jumping the gun a bit which is why I'm trying to sort all this out. Make sure I'm doing the wisest, smartest thing. 

I figured advice would be more comprehensive if I put down what I've done and what SPECIFICALLY about it that I like, share a brief conclusion of what I came up with in terms of finding a commonality with all of them and then see what you guys think.

* **Medicine**: again, I've interned at a private family practice office in a pretty rural setting and I really did not like it at all. Mostly geriatric patients with a LOT of prescriptions and refilling prescriptions and I just can't handle the ideology behind that...if that makes sense. 
      I also participated in a year of clinical rotations at my high school my senior year at the suburban hospital. The only parts I remember/enjoyed was pharmacy because the people seemed laid back. And the OR of an ob/gyn department during a C-Section because surgery is like oh my god amazing to watch and be even remotely apart of. **Me likey the guts and the blood and the opened body and the buzzing energy of everyone's fast thinking brains**. I also visited some hospitals with my class closer into the city and I really enjoyed that environment. *So I didn't really like the suburb or private practice stuff, but being in the medical center and watching open heart surgeries was really the most interesting/amazing thing about the hospital*. I've also taken an art philosophy course where we visited the hospital weekly (long story) but that was very interesting to hear about the humanities side of medicine. And again, really like the environment of being in like a huge medical complex. 
------   **It has occurred to me that the real basic reason as to why I find medicine fascinating is because the human body seems so complex and infinite in the way it works or can possibly work.** (I believe this is why neurology interested me the most about medicine because it's so multifaceted and the information we know is continuously changing and growing). I think this is why the private practice and suburban hospital didn't work for me because it seemed to lack a certain stimulus? And then of course being able to more or less master that subject material. Or always being on the cutting edge of new information that affects HUMANITY, is like yes. That's the sweet spot for me right there. Also I like the idea that in medicine the results seem very immediate. 

* **Art**: I am *kind of* an artist. I've always drawn/painted as a kid. Got a scholarship for an art course at a pretty prestigious art school over the summer. But really, I think I just admire creativity, more than I actually enjoy doing art? I think this has MOSTLY to do with my childhood. My father composes music for symphonies and orchestras and I think growing up in that environment really inspired me. But again, studio work isn't for me and I only want to paint as a hobby, not as a career. But I really enjoy discussing the human spirit through art. And I enjoy the philosophy of that. **But I'm finding that the art industry (at least the traditional visual art industry) is not for me.**

* **Anthropology**: I like studying the human spirit, again. Or ""the human condition"". **Very big fan of futurology**. I like to take individual situations across time and space and analyze them to understand like larger ideas? If that makes sense? I like taking little pieces of information to understand more complex phenomena. And life. Life is wild/interesting, so that's always fun to understand --someone else's perspective of life and how they clash and what we historically tend to do about it and how we can do that [living with each other with seemingly different ideology] better. And studying anthropology is studying a large enough system of information where you can really draw from an endless arsenal of stuff. It's like infinite, never boring, always changing. I also like studying peoples movements and migrations and literally I can talk to myself [like actual talking out loud in my room] about this subject for a very long uncomfortable time. I recently took a physical anthropology course on human variation (first scientific anthro course since my intro one which I definitely got a D in) and got an A because the subject was more detailed and somehow more interesting this time around? Really enjoyed thinking about the prospect of genomics. But still, even with the science part, the most important part to me was that it still had very strong social significance. 

-----------------------------------------------------

**In all** My friend (INTJ who seriously is the best at listening to my like endless thought vomitting) and I have come to the conclusion that **I ultimately seem to be strongest/am happiest when I get to theorize. And the topics I enjoy theorizing about have to do with the human condition, futurology, humanity etc. But I would really like to make that theorizing APPLICABLE in some way.** I just really enjoy thinking, but ultimately at this stage in my life (because like let's face it, **I want like a very nice sizeable income for ideal lifestyle purposes**) I need more help doing. 

Okay wow this is SO long, and thank you for bearing with me through that (if you have). I am so open to like any advice. Even if you feel the need to give me a reality check honestly. I appreciate honesty. **But career advice that could perhaps COMBINE these areas of interest and still have the thinking aspect to it as well is the ultimate goal here**. Because anything I do, if I'm not able to think by way of theorizing, analyzing, reflecting, it will get very boring and dull to me. (As evident through other jobs/internships I've had)

THANKS. 

Okay thanks again!! Let me know if anything needs more clarification for you guys!

**TL;DR**: INTP majoring in Anthropology, minoring in Creative Work, has some medical experience via high school internships, shadowing, clinical rotations and experience in art field, but not sold on them as career yet. Looking for career that encompasses theorizing on subjects such as the human condition and futurology but in an APPLICABLE way.

Okay thanks again!! Let me know if anything needs more clarification for you guys!

**TL;DR**: INTP majoring in Anthropology, minoring in Creative Work, has some medical experience via high school internships, shadowing, clinical rotations and experience in art field, but not sold on them as career yet.

4istp8,2,2016-05-10,Entering Film industry with very little production experience.,145aluissa,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/4istp8/entering_film_industry_with_very_little/,"I've always been interested in the film industry. In high school, I did mostly production work but when I got to college I became more interested in the business side of film. My major was English with a film studies focus and I involved myself in activities at school where I either learned to promote films on campus, worked with film non-profits, or worked with film festivals. However, after graduation, I've been having trouble getting more involved in the industry, finding work, and gathering connections. The specialty areas I'm mainly attracted to within the field are casting, producing, and film marketing/audience research. I even considered grad/business school; however, after going through the application process and being denied, I've realized it's probably not financially worth it.

My questions are:

&gt; Have you ever entered the field with very little film production background? If so, how did you stand out from the bunch/gather connections?
&gt; Is graduate school worth it considering the specialization I want to engage in?
&gt; If production experience is necessary to succeed in the field, how best can I attract employers with my resume and interview and where can I find internships that don't require you receive school credit or prior production experience?
&gt; Lastly, if I were to go into film marketing, would exploring marketing in other industries and gaining more professional experience better my chances and finding a position in my desired industry (film)?

Thanks in advance!"
4isu7u,0,2016-05-10,I [21M] really need to be a good friend to my struggling friend [20F] that I am attracted to. I am also in a committed relationship with my hopeful future wife [21F]. I really need some perspective.,brokenWingThrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4isu7u/i_21m_really_need_to_be_a_good_friend_to_my/,"I am a 21 year old male in my last year of university in the American Midwest. In high school I struggled with crushing loneliness and a dependency on painkillers (hydrocodone). I am now doing better after a personal epiphany and turn around of my life, and I can consider myself a mature, productive and incredibly happy person.


I have recently reconnected with a friend, Allie, from high school who is going through a difficult time. She attended college for one year before dropping out due to poor grades and bad drinking habits. Her relationships with her parents was incredibly strained. After her father said she was the source of her family's pain, she went to California for a year or two to try to get her life sorted out. She regularly attended AA and met with a therapist. She made quite a bit of progress, and she has since moved back in with her parents, and she is enrolled in community college. She will be transferring to a four year state university next semester yet does not yet know what she wants to do with her life. In the meantime she has still been struggling. She does not have any real friends she can talk to. Her relationship with her parents has improved dramatically, but it is still strained. She is currently in a toxic relationship with a possessive guy several years her senior. She knows the relationship isn't good for her, but she feels like she has nobody else.


Upon learning this, I realize the absolute best thing I can do with her is be her friend. I know how devastatingly crushing loneliness can be. We have been in different cities for the past few years, but we have kept in touch via text, call, etc. This summer we will be in the same city for an internship I have and after graduation in December I plan to move there. I have told her that we will be friends and do things together, and she can tell me everything that will be on her mind. I genuinely enjoy her company, and it's not often that you really get to be a good influence in someone's life. I know this promise is incredibly important to her.


Here comes the tricky part. I am in a committed relationship of 2.5 years with a wonderful girl, Jenna [21F]. We plan on getting married when we settle into our careers and mature more (probably when we are 24 or 25). I could not be more satisfied with our relationship. However. Allie is a good friend of mine, but I am attracted to her. I had a crush on her in high school, but it never came to anything. I asked her out on a date, she basically said no, and I moved on. Our friendship cooled, but we kept in touch. She seemed (and still does seem) to idolize me a little bit because she thought I was some enlightened soul (our common interests are philosophy and the arts). SPOILER: I'm not an enlightened soul.


I am prepared to be her friend, but I am also aware of how feelings can form when deep emotions are shared. I am naturally attracted to people I feel like I can help. I realize how damaging and poor a relationship based on a desire to ""fix"" someone can be, but I do tend to become infatuated with the ""little birdie with the broken wing"" that I can nurse back to health. I do not want to lose sight of the most important friendship in my life, Jenna. If I ever must choose between Allie and Jenna, it's Jenna in a heartbeat.


I am prepared to be a good friend to Allie over the summer, but I'm preparing myself. **I have no illusions about fixing her or the problems in her life.** However sometimes just being a friend is necessary. I've prepared the following ""rules"" for myself and our friendship in my mind.

- I'm going to insist she returns to meeting with a therapist.

- I'm also going to encourage her to continue looking for other friends.

- I'm going to continue telling her frankly that I don't think her current boyfriend is good for her (when opinion is solicited), but it is not my place to dictate her life.

- Jenna already knows about our friendship and our plans for the summer.  I will never hide what I talk to her about or how much time Allie and I spend together. I have not yet disclosed that I am still attracted to her.

- I do not think Allie knows I am still attracted to her, and I will never tell her.

- I plan on introducing Allie to Jenna as soon as I can, but it is likely that we will still be hanging out one on one. I hope they become friends, and I think it will reduce a lot of questions in everyone's mind.

- I am not going to fix her, and it is not my fault if she continues to struggle.


I still feel nervous. I would really appreciate some input. Please let me know what you guys thing. Some unbiased perspective is definitely needed.


**tl;dr: I am becoming closer friends with a high school crush who is going through a really tough time. I am naturally attracted to ""broken"" people. I am in a healthy, very happy relationship that is truly the most important thing in my life. Allie really needs a friend, but I need to set my priorities and set my emotions before that happens.**"
4isvf4,1,2016-05-10,CMV: I disagree with H1B visas,137946852,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4isvf4/cmv_i_disagree_with_h1b_visas/,"Today at work, the intern was telling me that in a few weeks he will graduate college. He will than have at most 4.5 months to find a job in the US that will sponsor him.  I could honestly not find much sympathy for him.  He took advantage of the education system in India to gain a Bachelor's degree, then came to the US for his Master's to take advantage of the higher pay here. 

For a US citizen, the costs here could be $200k for a bachelor's, and $80k for a Master's, less scholarships.  Call it $150k.  

I understand, and according to this site &lt;https://www.classbase.com/News/The-Cost-of-Higher-Education-in-India-62&gt; that bacahlor's degrees can be had for very little money in India.  So, that would be effectively $80k for the Master's, less scholarships.  Call it $50k.

Now, how can a US citizen expect to compete for salary with someone with 1/3 of the debt load coming out of college.  I understand that legally companies must pay the H1B's ""Fair Market Value"", but realistically there is little oversight.  So, someone wiling to work for less salary with equivalent qualifications would of course be attractive to companies.  In my view, this rives down salaries in the STEM fields in general.  This, in turn, leads to less students enrolling in STEM programs because they are not wiling to work, or not able, for the salaries that are offered.  I would suggest that without the H1B program, STEM salaries would rise, and more students would be willing to undergo the relatively intense schooling required to get into such fields.

&lt;end&gt; &lt;supporting links below&gt;

google search for H1B IBM gave these as links, generally negative, and accusing of abuse.

&lt;http://www.cringely.com/2015/06/15/the-h-1b-visa-program-is-a-scam/&gt; ""an H1B cost roughly 1/3 to 1/4 the cost of a comparable American""

4isw63,1,2016-05-10,"I've [21/m] been in an amazing relationship with a girl [24/f] for 3 years, and feelings for a friend [21/f] are confusing me",Kgrimes2,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4isw63/ive_21m_been_in_an_amazing_relationship_with_a/,"I've been dating the same girl [24/m] (let's call her B) for almost 3 years now. We had been really good friends before that, too. She's a great match for me [21/m] and we have made some amazing memories together.

Over the last 3 years, I've been studying at university. During my time there, I've gotten close to several people, and one girl [21/f] in particular (let's call her K).

K is very similar to me in a lot of ways, which is, I think, part of the reason we make such good friends. She's very smart and driven, which is something that I admire. She's super fun. Not to mention, she's really pretty.

I would be lying if I said that I've never been attracted to K. I find smarts to be really attractive, and she's got plenty of them. However, K's got plenty of problems that make her not too popular among most people (she has a really bad temper, gets very easily offended, throws fits, etc.). I've been willing to look past those problems, though, and so we've got a really decent friendship going on.

Both K and B (along with several of my other friends) just graduated. It's been really hard on me, because (essentially) all of my friend base was one year ahead of me in college. So, on top of the fact that I lost (essentially) all of my friends, I was working full-time, was a full-time student, and was trying to maintain a healthy relationship with B.

About three weeks before graduation, I broke down. I'm on Zoloft for anxiety/depression, and it didn't seem to help anymore. All of the sudden thoughts flooded my mind--it really began to occur to me that I was probably never going to see a lot of my friends again. That broke my heart.

I started thinking about K and all of the amazing times we've had together. Then I started thinking about how I'm not going to see her much anymore.. and the idea of that scared me. Really bad. I started getting depressed, cried in the shower, and couldn't concentrate on studies. This was finals week, by the way. I talked to my doctor, and he bumped my 100mg of Zoloft up to 150mg to get me through the week until I could get to my hometown and visit him.

The drug increase didn't seem to help. I kept getting so, so sad at the idea of not seeing K anymore.

It started to affect my relationship with B. I have such an incredible relationship with her and I genuinely want to spend the rest of my life with her. I had planned on proposing to her this summer. But now I feel guilty because I'm having these emotions about K, which I can't explain--am I crushing on her? Am I infatuated? I don't really find myself sexually attracted to K (if I weren't in a relationship with B I might be, but I have zero intention of breaking it off with B because I have it so good).

I love being around K and get excited whenever she texts me or gives me a call. Her jerk boyfriend broke up with her over last summer for no reason. Now they're thinking about getting back together--and I told her that she deserved someone better, someone who wouldn't break her heart in the first place. I asked her why she thinks it's a good idea for her to get back together with her ex, and she says she has none.

Can someone help me make sense of the emotions I'm going through? Is it normal for me to be experiencing these emotions about a best friend graduating?

I'm back in my hometown now, and things aren't much better. B's back in my school town doing some summer teaching, so I don't get to see her all summer. My dad's a public figure in my hometown, and he's under attack by the press for something he did. I'm gonna be flying to a different part of the country for an internship, too, so I'll be away from my family soon, too. TLDR, life's shitty right now.

I hope someone can help me make sense of these emotions and help me decide what I need to do--or think--to resolve these emotions.

Thanks all."

:--|:--
[Hello Pieter. I'm a medicine student, one day maybe I'll become a doctor. I'm in the hospital as an intern every day, and I see a lot of patients with many different stories. There's a question I always wanna ask them, but never get the chance to do, so I'll try with you on this ama.  How do you see your future? Does the word ""future"" mean anything to you, if so, what?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d30ie5y?context=5)|I see my future short term, obviously. Hours, days, weeks. No summer vacation, no thoughts about a meeting in a month (except that wake/party/riot I'm giving), no conference trips. It's like when you're driving a car down a great long desert road and you know you're running out of gas, and it's a matter of when, not if. There's no big city waiting for you, just beautiful scenery, and hopefully the car will run out of gas somewhere pretty.  In hospital it's even more so: all ""normality"" ceases to exist and you focus just on the ticking clock and the minutae of pain and medicines, discomfort, needles, round-the-clock blood pressure and oxygenation measuring, and so on. There is no future until just before you are released and even then it's measured in ""how long before I get home."" 
[Pieter,](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d300rri?context=5)|Hmm, good question. I've been deliberately accumulating material for my kids to read and think about, for years. It was part of the reason I became a writer, and the main reason I wrote a book like The Psychopath Code. For instance I've kept a diary since my daughter was born, addressed to her, and will give it to her in printed book form. She'd lose a USB drive. A book is easier to hold onto.
[In your blog you mention your young children and the resources that they'll have to see you, such as Youtube recordings. You have been very organized in transitioning the ZeroMQ project over to the community over the last several weeks. As with the community, are you preparing archives, books, or other materials (digital or analog\) for your children? If so, what are you archiving and in what formats?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d300rri?context=5)|Yet the most important gift, I think, for my children, is what I've taught them over the years about self-reliance, standing up to bullies, exploring the world without fear, and taking responsibility for creating order out of chaos. They are young and will forget me, especially the youngest (five), yet I'd like to believe the last years (and we spent every possible moment together, doing so many different things) are deep inside them and will be the main resource I pass on to them.
[Thanks again for all your hard work and contributions over the years.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d300rri?context=5)|Even this, dealing with incoming death, is something they'll watch and learn from. Everything is a lesson, if you are equipped to learn. 
[If you don't respond well to chemo what is the estimate doctors have given for how long you will live?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d30juz6?context=5)|A few months, is their guesstimate. They don't really know because this is a rare case in the West. Some background: read [/u/mrynx](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d3090qx)'s comment about opisthorchiasis being a neglected disease. This is what caused my cancer as far as I can tell. It's a killer of the poor in SE Asia and almost unknown in the west. There is little data on it, especially for metastasis (I was so lucky to have it removed surgically the first time).
 |So what do we know: the cancer is aggressive and grows fast. It does not generally respond to chemo. It is in both lungs. (I haven't seen the PET scans yet, just got a copy of the CT scans...) I'm already coughing and every few hours my lungs get clogged up and I need to cough to clear them until I vomit. It ain't pretty.
[Have you considered giving yourself a non-zero chance of continuing by getting cryogenically preserved?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d303th1?context=5)|Someone asks this question in every thread I've done, with two meanings. One, to give myself a non-zero chance. Two, to preserve my DNA to help my descendants understand if my cancer had a genetic basis.
 |The second is sensible though doesn't need cryogenics. Though in my case the cancer most likely came from eating raw fish from a farm in SE Asia somewhere. Liver fluke, charming little animal, produces carcinogens so it can munch on the tumors. Bile duct cancer is a leading cause of death for 50+ men in many SE Asian countries. I assume cheap raw fish made its way into sushi I ate somewhere along the line. No genetic disposition except ""being male and about 50"".
 |As for non-zero chances, I find it almost obscene to waste time and money and hope on such things.
[Has the new diagnosis changed your day to day life in any dramatic way?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d3002ez?context=5)|Yes, the change has been dramatic. I've been so heavily involved in the free software community for instance. One of the first things I did was look at all my responsibilities and assets, and try to find safe homes for them. Then I made that happen, and have now mostly stepped back from e.g. the ZeroMQ community that's been my main focus for years. It was really nice to see how other people, my friends, took over and took charge.
[I'm sorry to hear about your diagnosis and prognosis. You say that your family loves you and they support your decision. Have you discussed with them how they want you to die? Are you at all concerned that they might support your decision, but wish you were making a different choice? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d3008jw?context=5)|We went through the process with my father, who died on Easter this year, euthanasia. It was clear to everyone how well that worked. I mean in terms of the social group, family and friends, as well as the technical details of dying. So different from the heavy, miserable, stunned atmosphere at funerals. No drama, no suffering, just goodbyes and passing sadness.
 |Perhaps if we'd not been part of that, we'd be less sure as a family. Personally it would have been harder for me to make this decision. Yet after that experience, we're all agreed, and honestly, anyone who told me they'd rather see me rot and suffer from massive organ failure, out of some 'principle', I'd probably ask to leave and never talk to again. 
[Honestly, if your 12 year old said ""daddy, i'm not ready. try a little longer."" you'd asked them to leave and never talk to them again?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d30227t?context=5)|Is that how you interpreted what I said? It seems an unrealistic scenario and I was thinking of adults making moral judgments over others, not my kids asking me for one more cuddle.
 |Have you ever been really sick, in hospital, with tubes and machines all over? I have. It is a feeling of utter helplessness. You are trapped and it's small acts of defiance that keep you going. To some extent, the decision that this is the moment to end things is such an act, as I saw with my father. It gives you control back over an intolerable situation. Perhaps not for long, yet it's there, solid, determined control. And that is how I want to die, not the unconscious victim of circumstance.
 |There are some people I know who object to euthanasia on moral grounds, and frankly, I see that objection as so selfish and unempathic that it flags such people as ""toxic"" to me. If they would try to talk me out of it, I'd have them removed. Similarly if someone asked me to try prayer, I'd have them removed.
 |Children aren't equipped to assert such views on others.
[Am I correct in thinking you are going the same route as your father in being euthanized? If so, will you have anyone three with you? What do you want your last days to be like?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d306ml6?context=5)|Yes, given that my cancer will spread down from my lungs into my stomach, then to my digestive system, meaning I'll be unable to eat and will be in real and constant pain, and will lose weight and then start to have circulation problems... I will go the same route as my father.
 |I'll let anyone be there who wants to be there. That's a personal choice I won't influence. My kids, I hope, will be there so they see death close up and it loses its mystery and dread for them.
 |I hope my last days are well drugged up. :)
[Back in 2009 I was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in my sinus and was given the bleak statistics of my not so bright future.  For once in my life I thought, well shit, 2009 and science can't do shit for cancer yet? That sent me running to so called crazy/alternative therapies, and kind of glad I went against my own way of thinking to get cured.  In addition to the standard therapies, did you look into alternative treatments for your problem?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d30hlu1?context=5)|I'm not interested in that, for various reasons I've tried to explain in my article ""A Protocol for Dying"". The main one is pure skepticism. I don't disagree that some people will survive after getting alternative treatments. However some people survive even the worst diagnosis, without any treatment at all. You can't call it science until you have control studies and sufficient data. ""Alternative medicine"" is just wishful thinking, as afar as I'm concerned.
 |As for a tumor in the sinus, I'd hope that could be removed surgically, since cancer isn't fatal unless it cannot be resected, and spreads. 
[That sounds like a pleasant way to go :\) I know you haven't requested the euthanasia yet, but have you made any final plans on what you want to happen on your death bed? songs to be played, last things you want to say,...](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d304jvs?context=5)|&gt; I have no last words.
 |Also, next month I'm organizing a wake/bbq/riot/party at my place and I expect a hundred or so people to turn up. Should be fun. :)
[I do feel like this is also the perfect opportunity to leave a few pranks here an there for when you're gone.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d3050vd?context=5)|Well, say I've set up a few pranks... I'm hardly going to reveal them on Reddit, am I? :)
[Can you set up an automatic generator to post it after your death? (have you ever read Daemon :p? \)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d3064ns?context=5)|I don't really have any pranks. Seriously.
[How's it going?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d300370?context=5)|Honestly, pretty good. I'm mostly cheerful anyhow, yet the diagnosis and reality of dying in the near future has put an edge on it, my mind is super active. Last week I wrote a new book (Social Architecture), taking pieces of writing I'd not yet published and editing it into shape, formatting and publishing. It took an hour and a half total. So it's going pretty well, I'd say. :) 
[Are you exploring any new treatments in addition to chemo? I recently saw an innovative treatment involving genetically modified viruses that allowed the body to have an immuno response. Might that be an option if it's available? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d30hs7n?context=5)|My oncologists are exploring other potential treatments. There are some research clinics that have programs. I'm not familiar with the details. Since I'm in good health apart from the cancer, not a smoker, etc. I would qualify. As for looking for experimental treatments myself, no. Too much work and cost and without the support of my doctors, no way to know how real it is.

I am currently on a coop term, can I apply to jobs for the Fall term while on Coop? 

I am supposed to be on a study term in Fall of 16'  but incase I find a good internship, I don't mind talking to the advisor and doing a coop term instead.

I am doing this because I feel that I don't have much time for preparing for interviews while the study terms.But I am relatively more free during my work terms. I am a CS major. 

Is this possible?  Has anyone done this before ?

Thanks!"

I was an intern at Nickelodeon studios.

Note the word ""was"".

As it turns out, arriving to work drunker than a skunk is a big no-no in the corporate rules.

However, even though I attempted to fuck a printer in my drunken madness, they rehired me as a assistant janitor, thus I was allowed to have access to the building.

About a year after my little incident with the printer, the studio went digital, so they were getting rid of all the tapes they had left over from old series. I stole some videos from the trashcan. Many tapes had no title written on them, some did, and the ones that did has some weird titles to them. I got a copy of ""Hope is lost"" and ""Squidward's Suicide"" and a unaired episode of Jimmy Neutron titled: ""Jimmy Neutron Happy Family Happy Hour"".

After acquiring these tapes, I went to my apartment, where the door closed by itself.
Sp00ky.

It was late when I got to my apartment, so I took a shower and went to bed.

Such tension, such wow.

While I was sleeping, I woke up to see a clown with wide lips standing over me holding a knife.

""Go to sleep."" he said.

""Fine let me take a piss first"" I said.

I started to make my way to the bathroom. When I entered the room, a guy was preparing a ice bath and a holding some fishing string. He appeared to have no eyes. The clown entered the room and bellowed ""JACK, YOU NEED A BETTER WAY TO PAY FOR YOU MEDICAL DEGREE THAN SELLING STOLEN KIDNEYS!""

Jack turned and yelled back ""Fuck you Jeff! You pedophi-""

""I AIN'T A PEDO!""

""YOU SURE ACT LIKE ONE!""

I had enough. I left the room and tried to go to sleep.

No dice, the angry couple started throwing things. I heard my mirror shatter, my toothbrush being thrown into the toilet, and repeated tearing of my towels (I guess they were trying to strangle each other with them).

I wonder why my neighbors didn't hear this.

Knowing that I wouldn't be able to sleep, I walked over to my closet so I can get dressed. I turned the knob AND A SKELETON POPPED OUT.

I need to put that anatomy skeleton in a U-Store-It. I bought it at a garage sale for 6 bucks.

Oddly, skeletons were the only thing they sold at the sale.

I got dressed, put on my shoes and got ready for work.

Then I remembered that it was Saturday.

I don't work Saturdays.

""Fuck"" I said.

The brawl in the bathroom quieted down, so I went to see what happened to the contestants. I opened the door, and looked inside. I pulled my shopping list out of my pocket and wrote:

&gt;HACKSAW

&gt;SHOVEL

&gt;TARPS

&gt;QUICKLIME

&gt;BLEACH, LOTS OF BLEACH

&gt;RENTAL MOVING VAN

&gt;MANY TOOTHBRUSHES

&gt;NOTE TO SELF: TRY TO FIND SOMEWHERE WHERE NOONE WILL NOTICE THE DIRT PILES.

&gt;AND FIND A U-STORE-IT FOR THAT DAMN SKELETON.

After preparing my half-assed undertaking job. I closed the door and put in ""Squidward's Suicide"".
Wasn't really interesting; Squidward fucks up a concert and later commits suicide. I could make better with google images of Spongebob, MS Paint, and MS moviemaker.

After watching the tape, I got another video out. I suddenly felt hungry so I walked over to my fridge and opened the door.

EVERYTHING WAS COVERED IN A RED LIQUID.

""SHIT, MY KOOLAID!"" I screamed.

Since all my leftovers were now punch-flavored, I decided to make some eggs. As I got my pan ready, I saw a piece of crumpled paper laying between the stove and the counter.

I pulled it out.

It was a map of River Country; a Disney park that got something in it's water. Saw a video of a schmuck who accidentally drank some of that water back in '11. The guy turned into a Freddy Krueger lookalike before dissolving into a puddle like the hobo on the toilet in ""Street Trash"". I had no use for the map, so I just threw it in the trash.

After eating my breakfast, I watched the Jimmy Neutron special.

It was better than the Suicide vid; Jimmy bonds with his dad after his dad murdered his mom. His dad is then promptly decapitated by a aggressive pizza.

It's better than it sounds.

As soon as the video ended, I heard a knock on the door. There was a large green man standing at my front door. He smelt of onions.

""Do you want to become a brogre, laddeh?"" he asked.

""Is that a scientology thing?"" I asked.

""No.""

""Goodbye""

I shut the door in his face.

I started up the next video.

The green man smashed through my window, whipped out a 12-foot dick, and promptly sprayed my couch with green cum. It smelt like onions. I looked at the man and said ""I'm gonna sue your ass and your cult and your-"".

&gt;He slaps me across the face

&gt;He forcibly makes me bend over.

&gt;He whispers ""Shrek is love, Shrek is life""

&gt;I say ""Shrek is Drek""

&gt;Drek flies through my other window

&gt;The ogrelord charges his nemesis

&gt;The ogres fly out the window to begin the battle of the century.

&gt;Drek is love

&gt;Drek is life

I quickly cover my broken windows with cardboard. I pull out my list:

&gt;GET COUCH CLEANED

I opened my closet, SKELETON POPPED OUT, and grabbed a folding chair. I begin to watch ""Hope is Lost""

""Hope is Lost"" is fucking terrible.

I spend the next 4 hours watching NSFW lost episodes. Some good, some bad, all just plain weird.
I got tired of watching crazy shit, and I went to Taco Bell for some lunch. When I got there, the workers seemed to be working on something, and there was a strange smell emitting from the bathroom. It smelled like a mix of blood, semen, and diarrhea. A employee walked out of the bathroom holding a baseball cap with a pine tree illustration and a pink sweater. Both had smears of red, brown, and whitish goo.

Must of been one crazy-ass party.

There was a discount on all the tacos, so I bought two Frito Burritos. The meat had a strange taste, I guess they tried a new seasoning.

The Taco Bell had a television mounted on a wall. The TV was tuned to a News Station broadcasting the trending news.

According to the news, Shrek and Drek have been fighting for hours. Thousands of homes and businesses have been leveled by the exchanges of fists of the Ogre titans. Brogres and Drogres have been in a fierce firefight in the ruins of the buildings.

This was taking place in the next city over.

This was all being broadcast by FOX news, so I took this with more than a grain of salt.

I tried to escape from crazy shit on television only to be exposed to a bigger amount of crazy shit on television.

Since I was in town, I bought everything I needed for the undertaking of the results of the earlier clash of the titans. I drove the moving van to a nearby U-Store-It and rented a space to keep Mr. SKELETON.

While I was there, I saw that there was a flea market at some of the Storage Units.

I bought a copy of Majora's Mask.

Y'know, like all flea markets have that game.

A radio broadcast came on saying that the Clash of the Ogres started to near the city and everyone should go home and kiss their asses goodbye.

The guy who sold me the game started to yell to some guy named Ben, but I paid him no heed.
I arrived at my apartment and got out my N64. I put in the game and the TV said ""You met a terrible fate haven't you?""

I turned off the game. The bastard sold me a shitty ROM hack!

I turned the TV to the news. According to FOX news, Evil PATRIXXX convinced Shrek and Drek to sign a truce. The truce stated that if a one of the ogres should come across the other during a brogre enlistment, they should contact EVIL PATRIXXX so they can reach a agreement to prevent another catastrophe. Their latest showdown cost thousands of lives, hundreds of homes, and millions of taxpayers' money. The city had to commission mass burials for the dead.
At least they didn't destroy my apartment.

Another thing came on talking about the disappearance of two kids at a Taco Bell. They showed pictures of a kid with a baseball cap with a pine tree illustration on it. They also showed a picture of his sister; in many of them she wears a pink sweater. I thought about calling the missing children hotline to tell them that the missing kids had a incestious party in the bathroom of the restaurant, but I'm sure that the Taco Bell employees were aware of that and told this to the investigators."

4ivp2m,78,2016-05-11,My [26 F] roommate [24 M] is changing our moving plans at the last minute for a ludicrous reason at his parent's request and it puts me in a very tough/impossible spot. My options?,roomiepulledtherug,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ivp2m/my_26_f_roommate_24_m_is_changing_our_moving/,"Last year, I interned and roomed with two people, one of whom turned out to be an awesome housemate and friend, we'll call him Robert. I became close with both him and his family, who are good people and have been wonderful to me. I would consider them to be like my own parents, and I love all 3 of them to pieces. Staying up and talking to his mother is one of my favorite things, we get along very well.

We have not been living together the past few months because we were hired on after our internship at the same place, but at different times, so I moved back to this city after Robert did. However, when I did, we agreed that when his short lease was up, we would room together again. Both of our leases are up May 31st. I have spent the past several weeks looking for a place quite relentlessly - I've made dozens upon dozens of phone calls, twice as many emails, organized a massive spreadsheet and been on the phone with his parents answering their questions as well. I got sick with the flu in the middle of all of this and didn't slow down the search once. It paid off, and I found us a perfect house very close to work and within our budget. 

One of the requirements we'd discussed was that the place we choose be available immediately, as we both wanted to move before the end of May. Him, because he is miserable where he lives now, and me because I have to go back to a city four hours away to pick up all of our furnishings - including Robert's bed - which are stored at my parent's house. My current place is furnished. Because I need my parents' help with this and because of their schedules, I have one weekend to do this in - the weekend of the 22nd. My father is being laid off from his job, that is his last normal weekend off, he is working his second job memorial day weekend, and is job hunting and taking what he can get for June, so we have no idea what his schedule/availability will be like in June. Since I have to request my own schedule changes so far out, we went ahead and requested that I have that weekend off to move since it's the only time we KNOW we will be able to do it. Robert knew all of this going into it and I made it clear from the start that moving before the end of the month was important for me. We had even found a place before this house that we LOVED, but it wasn't available until June 1st - and we had to agree with each other to be OK with not having any furniture for a while. We were actively removing places from our search that weren't available immediately for this reason.

Anyway. I was working out the details with the landlord of this house, and he wants it to be occupied as soon as possible. Perfect! I discuss the weekend of the 22nd with him and he says that's fine. I tell Robert the good news. Except... his parents now have a problem with it. You see, Robert and his parents HATE his current landlord (and I can't blame them.) His parents argue that if Robert moves out of his current place early (they had to pay last months rent as part of their move in costs), then they're essentially ""giving"" the landlord ""free money"" by paying for the place but leaving it unoccupied. Therefor, Robert is not allowed to move until the 1st, on the off chance that he moves early and this landlord immediately re-occupies the place and makes money on top of his rent. 

We went back and forth for a while, Robert argued with them for the longest time, and his father finally agreed to allow Robert to move early IF Robert could get his landlord to agree to return his deposit in full in exchange for Robert moving early. I said there was no way this would ever, ever happen. Of course, the landlord said no way and is now being argumentative about things inside the unit that he wants to take out of the deposit. So his parents have dug their heels in and said that no way can he move before his current lease is up. They know the circumstances surrounding why I needed to move early.

Robert's mother called me last night while I was helping them sort out their application and brought up the move in date again. I re-iterated that I cannot change it (also, we might lose this place if we change it, he wants it occupied NOW, and this city is very, very hard to find housing in) and why. She then asked me, since I want to move early, can I pay the first month's rent on my own? I was floored. I didn't even know how to respond. ""I... I guess I will have to figure something out if you... if I have no choice..."" I couldn't believe it. She went on to say something about how they just took a vacation and they just don't want this landlord to get ""free money"" out of Robert leaving this place early... I was so mad I didn't really take in the rest of the conversation at that point.

I told Robert and his response was basically that the prorated first month would ""only"" be ""like $400 more"" and that they aren't going to let him move early like me. I told him that I needed to think about what was said to me that evening and that changing things up on me at the last minute like this is a total dick move, that he and I had a plan for a reason and now I have to decide what I'm going to do about it.

So my question is, how in the hell do I handle this? I can't do the first month by myself - I'd have to set up all of the utilities on my own and pay those as well on top of the other costs of moving. I'm not asking him to pitch in for the uhaul that's moving all of the furniture that he needs (I'm furnishing the place) nor am I asking for anything in exchange for that fact that I did 100% of the legwork of finding us a place to live (not an easy feat in a very populated, expensive city.) 

I can't help but feel as though his parents are being very petty, and are putting this whole ""can't give Landlord free money"" thing above allowing us to move, to the point where it's going to damage our relationship. I'm still floored that they are being so stubborn over NINE DAYS and that they think he can move all in one night in the interest of not leaving his old place unoccupied, for the sake of not letting his old landlord make an extra dime off of it. 

I am also considering telling them that we need to stick with the original plan Robert and I agreed on, or I need to find a new roommate and he can figure out a place on his own. Too harsh? I also feel as though this is HIS argument to have with his parents, not mine. I am still recovering from the flu and working a second job, I have enough going on without arguing on the phone all night.
   
**tl;dr**: Roommate and I agreed to move into our new place on the 22nd, his parents come back at us and say he is not ""allowed"" to move until the 1st because leaving his old place unoccupied is essentially giving his current scummy landlord ""free money."" Then they ask me to pay for all of the first month expenses on my own since I'm the only one who will be moving early. How do I get across that they're being absolutely ridiculous and unfair without ruining our relationship? "

I didn't really have many options at the time when initially looking and sort of got too used to the job and decided to stay longer than I should honestly. I should've left when their idea of a ""raise"" was $25 extra a month. 

I don't even know what sort of job I want now. I'm getting kind of tired of programming honestly, or it could just be the job I currently have zapping all my enthusiasm I had for it previously. I think I'd enjoy Information Security, but I'm not even sure where to start with all the certificates available and even then, would I need to start back at square one for my career and get an internship job in the field before even attempting an entry level job? I also thought of trying to find a decent federal, state or local job to get some loan forgiveness for my student loans.

All I know is 30k a year with my student loans creeping up every year is not going to work out. What's really funny is that I had more money in my bank account prior to graduating than I do now and it's only going lower and lower. 

So, am I in a funk at my current job, or do I just need a new job entirely? Any advice would be appreciated."
4iw6e5,0,2016-05-11,Software Engineering Internship vs. Tech Consulting full time gig vs. BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY??,abacona,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4iw6e5/software_engineering_internship_vs_tech/,"Hello, (sorry for  the annoying title)

I'm a CS major, but have only been programming seriously since around February.

* GPA between 3.0 - 3.2
* Have internships that *sound* good (android at a startup that no longer exists but I didn't learn much (I've since learned a decent amount of Android though), IT position at Fortune 100 with little coding but I can make it sound decent)
* Won a few prizes at pretty big hackathons, and I am pretty passionate about tech in general (especially startups).

I signed an offer as a tech consultant in one of the industry's stronger firms (we'll call them Company A) in Sept/Oct 2015 (I'm graduating in 2wks) which is located in my small midwestern city. Nothing wrong with that, but I've been dreaming of working in the Bay Area since I was a kid. My skill set has improved 100% since I signed with them, I went from only coding for class to attending hackathons and doing side projects/learning.

I just got offered an unofficial remote internship at Cisco doing Front End Software Engineering (which is definitely one of my preferred areas), paying $20/hr for 25 hrs/week for 3 months (extendable to 6 months).

Here's my dilemma. My friend at Company A told me that his training last year (3months) was extremely easy, but they will make it a little more difficult this year (still 40hrs/week or less I'm assuming). Am I ok to work at Cisco simultaneously during my off time / weekends for their 3-6mo period? Or should I renege on Company A and work for Cisco from home until I find a cheap place to stay in the Bay Area (and potentially ask for more hours / intern housing assistance)? I am in the process of finding free/super cheap accommodations in the Bay Area (friends/family) just in case I need it.

Some additional information:

* Company A also has a branch in SF, but I'm pretty sure it'd be a year or more before I could transfer to that branch.
* Cisco knows I have a full time gig with Company A and that I intend to work at both simultaneously
* Company A does not know that I have an offer with Cisco yet
* Cisco does not know whether they will/will not have funding to take me on full time after the 3mo/6mo period
* If I finished my training at Company A (3months), there's a chance I could leverage my position with Cisco to get them to transfer me to SF (and use the additional reasoning that all of my family is in the process of moving out there, which is true)
* I'm not sure whether to tell Company A about Cisco now, in a month, after Company A's 3mo of training, or after 6mo (and just stay in the midwest working 2 jobs until then)
* Under no circumstances will I give up this opportunity to work with Cisco, unless an even better offer came along. I'd rather renege on the full time offer than pass this opportunity up. I don't want to be a consultant, I want to be an SE and eventually maybe a PM. 
* There is nothing in the offer letter / NDA from Company A that says I can't work at another company. (Just that they don't want me to bring other companies' deivces/secrets to Company A).

I guess I would just like the security and additional pay of keeping Company A on deck and doing both jobs simultaneously.

The ideal situation would be to work both for 3mo, then either transfer to Company A's SF branch or extend my internship with Cisco. If I stayed with Cisco, I'd be living in the bay area and interviewing in the area for a good chunk of my internship period (especially if I'm only working 25hrs/week, lots of time to apply/network and do side projects). My worries are that Company A will find out I'm working at Cisco and fire me or something. If I did get fired from Company A (but also still have Cisco), how bad would that be? Can people find out I worked for Company A if I don't tell them, or if I only list Cisco during that time? What would the consequences be in the future?

Am I crazy to even consider working at both? I feel like it would be an exercise in work ethic too."
4iwb29,5,2016-05-11,"[Advice] for Law Students Seeking Internships, from a Solo Practitioner.",MediocreResponse,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/4iwb29/advice_for_law_students_seeking_internships_from/,"Hi /r/LawSchool. I'm a solo practitioner doing transactional law in a major metropolitan city. I've been practicing law for five years and have had my own practice for four years. Several times a week I get emails from current or would-be law students seeking internships with me. Since I end up having the same conversation with the same types of folks over and over again, I thought it might help to inform a larger audience as to how I respond to these inquiries, so you can understand my perspective and implement that information into your own efforts. 

As a solo practitioner, I simply don't have time to train a newbie - period. I can't afford to. I'm already running at full capacity all day long just trying to support myself, much less someone who doesn't offer any immediate benefit to me. Federal internship laws don't allow interns to do any real substantive work, and as stewards of the law, I don't want to violate any laws protecting against slave labor. In short, an intern would both a burden and a liability to me.

Also (and this is equally important), I have no interest in working with a stranger! I've turned down people I actually know in real life, why would I suddenly take an interest in someone I've never heard of before? I'm a very socially active person too, so if we haven't met at a local industry networking event, I have to wonder why not. Networking is every attorney's lifeline to clients, referrals, jobs, and professional colleagues, especially in the beginning of our careers.

To compound the problem, I don't work a traditional 9-5 schedule. I have a regular office, but I work primarily from home. I haven't even met most of my clients in person because we do almost everything over the phone and email. Most of my day is spent hovering over my laptop drafting contracts and emails, or talking on the phone trying to land my next client. I don't require help with this. If I needed help with anything in my firm, it would be a professional phone answering service with 24/7 access, or an accountant to manage my financial records, or a marketing company to handle my advertising. In other words, I don't need anyone to do any kind of legal work (I only WISH I had more legal work to do myself!). Rather, I need people who specialize in non-legal niche areas of business like accounting, marketing, SEO, web design, social media, etc.

Which brings me to the point of this post. What's the #1 thing every company needs to survive? Clients. How do companies attract clients? Through marketing. What's the #1 marketing tool in the year 2016? Social media and online presence. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, websites, etc. THIS IS WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE AN ENORMOUS ADVANTAGE. I'm at the northern-most tip of the millennial generation, and I still think it's a pain in my ass to try to keep up with all of these platforms, to constantly learn new technology, come up with catchy things to say on a regular basis, find industry relevant articles to post, respond to comments/feedback/retweets, etc. I simply don't enjoy it. I'd rather spend my day giving clients legal advice, but I can't do that unless I have clients, and I can't have clients if they don't know I exist. If a law student came to me right now and said, hey, I see you only post to FB once a month, or I see you haven't tweeted since February, or hey I see your website is missing this-that-and-the-other, or hey here's a list of articles that got published this week that your readers might be interested in, I can help you improve in these areas... Omg, I would hire that person in a heartbeat (as in, I would actually pay them to do that). I don't want it so much that I'm proactively searching for it, but if it showed up at my doorstep, I'd be interested.

I suppose the moral of the story is (to steal a phase from JFK), don't ask what the lawyer can do for you, ask what you can do for the lawyer. If you're not sure what that is, try to get the lawyer on the phone or out to coffee/lunch and ask them to assign you ONE task to prove you can be an asset to the company. Hopefully that one thing will be enough to get your toe in the door. 

Best of luck out there. I know it's a tough market, and the system for training new lawyers doesn't make any sense at all, but this is the reality of my experience, being five years out of law school. Cheers."

Currently I'm getting ready to take my 802 A+ exam at the end of the month.  Other than messing with computers on my own I don't have any professional experience.  After my exam I will be looking into getting an internship likely in computer repair.

Data recovery interests me and I would like to do clean room recovery.  Is there a specific cert route I should go down? I looked at the cert flow chart pdf but I'm not sure if the route for hardware would be applicable or not.  Is there a certification for this? I've heard of Scott Moulton's (My hard drive died) recovery class - has anyone done this and what has been your experience? Has the cost been worth it? Has anyone done a class similar to this? Along with the learning experience it would be great to have a piece of paper that shows I'm not a dumb dumb in this area.

Like the title says I'm a graduating senior with a 3.6 GPA with a double major in BS Computer Science &amp; BA in Political Science from a small private school in the Pacific Northwest. I always thought I was going to be a patent lawyer, but I recently decided to enter the work force for a couple of years and then perhaps apply to law school later. 

Due to this, I have no tech internships. And frankly, I believe my coding skills aren't as high as they should be as a soon-to-be graduate (next month). 

Right now, I am hugely stressed out about finding a job. I know I'm late in the game for everything, and I have no experience. From reading this sub, I know I am in some what of a hole. I'm also pretty busy with finishing up classes for the quarter and working at my part-time job (retail) to pay for my daily living. Therefore, I need to use my time as efficiently as possible to maximize my chances of getting hired. Currently, I know C++, HTML, PHP, and Im beginning to learn Ruby on Rails independently. Should I be using my time learning this new language or focusing on studying up for the tech interview? Or perhaps trying to build something?

Also, should I even bother applying to jobs? I feel like if I were to take on a tech-interview right now, I would fail miserably. Do I look for a post-grad internship? Do those exist?

Please help me out! With graduation fast approaching I'm really freaking out!"
4iwny3,69,2016-05-11,RT Podcast - #375 - Answers Thread,gafgarian,roosterteeth,https://www.reddit.com/r/roosterteeth/comments/4iwny3/rt_podcast_375_answers_thread/,"**Which has the bigger universe, Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones?**

This debate has made the rounds, in various forms, across several subreddits and other sites since what seems like the Second, possibly even the First, age (see what I did there :P ).  Surprisingly, despite how many times it has been argued this seems to be one topic which the internet seems to, more or less, agree on ( 0_0 ) &lt;--- Emoticon, callbacks FTW.  So here's the summary.

It depends on the concept of ""universe"".  Based on the context, I would assume that the podcast discussion was on the size of the universe as a whole, regarding the character and story depth, and not the physical ""size"" of the universe.  The consensus seems to be, when discussing the fleshed out mythos and character depth behind the stories, that Tolkien is the ""father of modern fantasy"" for a reason.  Across the 18-ish books dedicated to Middle Earth and attributed to him, Tolkien created entire species' histories, spanned thousands of years of history, and created entire languages from scratch to support his mythical realm.  Perhaps George R. R. Martin said it best:

&gt; There are many different kinds of writers, I like to use the analogy of architects and gardeners. There are some writers who are architects, and they plan everything, they blueprint everything, and they know before the drive the first nail into the first board what the house is going to look like and where all the closets are going to be, where the plumbing is going to run, and everything is figured out on the blueprints before they actually begin any work whatsoever. And then there are gardeners who dig a little hole and drop a seed in and water it with their blood and see what comes up, and sort of shape it. They sort of know what seed they've planted — whether it's an oak or an elm, or a horror story or a science fiction story, but they don't know how big it's going to be, or what shape it's going to take. I am much more a gardener than an architect.

While he didn't actually ""say"" that Tolkien is an architect, I think we can all agree that there have been few authors that could be MORE of an architect than him.  Notably, only 6 of the 18 books were published in his lifetime, with the additional 12+ books being posthumously published by his estate with material from random notes and half-finished stories.  If that isn't ""blueprinting"" then I'm not sure what is.

HOWEVER, if the podcast were in fact speaking about the physical size of the world then the argument becomes a bit more disjointed.  If we mean the size of the actual ""world"" these stories take place in then it is relatively widely agreed that both take place on a planet roughly the size of Earth.  If we mean the physical continents/countries the characters are physically in then Essos probably barely eeks out a win…though that would include the size of the seas as well.  If we are looking at actual square miles of walkable land then it is probably closer to a tie again.  Either way, I don't believe that this is actually what was meant during the discussion anyway so….Tolkien wins.

**Keyboard lights up as you type?**

There have been several keyboards that have had some type of variation on this feature so it is tough to say exactly which one is being referenced here but Corsair seems to be at the forefront of the technology and Gavin is likely referring to their Cherry MX boards, of which they have many.  [Here's the link](http://www.corsair.com/en-us/gaming-keyboards)

&amp;nbsp;

**Vive cost equal to the cost of every console currently on the market?**

Not really sure where Gavin was going with this, even through simple off the cuff math, counting only ""next-gen"" consoles, and not bothering to adjust for inflation, the statement is just blatantly not possible. $300 (Xbox One) + $350 (PS4) + $300 (WiiU) = Roughly $150 more than the Vive.  Adjusting for inflation, the Vive ends up being about $500 cheaper than all three.  It's possible that Gavin was only talking about the PS4 and Xbox One, which would actually be a little less than the Vive, but, arguably not by much, and without any actual games to play on them.

&amp;nbsp;

**Lord of the Rings wooden block camera?**

This refers to the use of a VR rig during the choreography of the CGI scenes.  Basically they planned all blocking for full animated sequences; for example, the cave troll battle from Fellowship of the Ring.  With the CG representations of the characters involved placed into a template scene with correct scaling, Jackson and Randall Cook, director of animation for the film, wore VR goggles and moved around the ""scene"" with a motion captured box.  I was unable to verify if this was in fact a block of wood.  I would say it is certainly possible but I would imagine moving around with a wooden block could potentially get tiring after a time, depending on the size of the block.  Either way, a 3D ""virtual camera"" was ""attached"" to the block and that camera's virtual feed was piped through the VR goggles allowing Cook and Jackson to experiment with camera angles and sweeping movements through the virtually created 3D environment.

&amp;nbsp;

**Do taxi companies have apps?**

Some do.  There are several companies across the world that have taken Uber's lead and created their own applications to help manage, track, and streamline their customer's experience.  One dev company has even hopped on the SaaS wagon and built [TaxiStartup.com](https://taxistartup.com/) which builds a white label application for established taxi services to use without having to go through the process of designing or building their own app from scratch.

&amp;nbsp;

**Worst taxi companies in the world?**

While I wasn't able to find a list of ranked companies, I was able to find a few lists of worst cities to use the local taxi services.  Rounding out the top 5, worldwide, are Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Rome, Italy; Bangkok, Thailand; Paris, France; and New York, USA.  Having used Uber in two of these places personally (Paris and New York), I can tell you that, at least concerning New York, this is absolutely true.  NYC Yellow Cabs are way too hit or miss and if they can tell you don't know Manhattan they will absolutely take you down 7th instead of 11th when going south.

&amp;nbsp;

**What is taxi ""tunneling""?**

This is a legitimate issue with cab rides from the Vegas airport to the Strip.  Basically it is a tunnel running under the runways which merges to I-15 and is an unnecessary detour for most Vegas destinations since Swenson is a more direct route.  Based on a 2012 state audit, nearly 1 in 4 fares were ""long-hauls"" (a taxi driver purposely going on a longer route to increase the fare) and resulted in nearly $15 million of overcharges.  Because of this the Nevada Taxi Cab Authority has made some decent strides towards enforcement but the visible routing and GPS determined fares of Uber and Lyft have put pressure on the taxi companies' wallets where the NTCA couldn't possibly; since they are legitimate source of market competition and not a regulatory entity with limited resources.

&amp;nbsp;

**Who's on Wikipedia?**

From what I've found, there are currently only 12 Rooster Teeth personalities with their own Wikipedia pages.  And several other links for various personalities which actually link back to more generalized Rooster Teeth pages.  These 12 are: Burnie, Barbara, Colton Dunn, Gavin, Joel, Matt, Michael, Monty, Geoff, Griffon, Gus, and Meg.

However, Kerry does have an [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4210310/) along with several other RT people!

&amp;nbsp;

**Interns had sex on the moon?**

As Gus confirmed, in 2002 an intern at NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center had sex on a bed covered with moon rocks.  To clarify, the rocks were UNDER the hotel mattress…so it’s a bit less strange as they were probably just hiding them there while on the lam.  Along with the moon rock fornication, Thad Roberts also made off with Martian meteorite with the intention of selling all of it on the black market.  He, and his co-conspirator intern girlfriend were captured as part of an FBI sting in Orlando.  The story has been recorded in a book by author Ben Mezrich, who also penned Zuckerberg's biography, The Accidental Billionaires.  In 2011, Sony Pictures optioned the book as a movie but no additional info has been provided since and it is likely dead in the water.

&amp;nbsp;

**Number of people on the moon?**

24 astronauts have flown to the moon across 9 missions.  Of the 24, 12 actually landed and walked on the moon.  Not only were those 24 the only ones to go to the moon, they are also the only human beings to have gone beyond the ""low Earth orbit"" threshold (about 2,000 km).

&amp;nbsp;

**Average ejaculate distance?** *(A bit NSFW but trust me you got the least of it…my eyes burn…)*

There has been surprisingly, or perhaps unsurprisingly, way too many ""scientific studies"" on this and the agreed upon average range seems to be about 7 - 10 inches.  However, a single man, Horst Shultz, owns the record for the greatest distance, height, and speed of ejaculation at 18'9"", 12'4"", and 42.7 mph, respectively.

&amp;nbsp;

**Slug bites off its own dick becomes female?**

As usual, Gavin nails this.  Slugs are simultaneous hermaphrodites which is an adult organism that has both male and female sexual organs.  Because of this self-fertilization or sperm exchange is not uncommon.  Banana slugs specifically, it is possible for slugs to become stuck together during mating.  If wiggling fails to separate them the male organ will be bitted off and it continues to be a viable female mate.

Other organisms which are simultaneous hermaphrodites include, Earthworms, snails, and a few species of fish.

&amp;nbsp;

**Which animals mate for life?**

Gibbon apes, Wolves, Termites, Coyotes, barn owls, Beavers, bald eagles, golden eagles, Condors, Swans, brolga cranes, French angel fish, Sandhill cranes, Pigeons, Prions, red-tailed hawks, Anglerfish, Ospreys, prairie voles, black vultures were all THOUGHT to be among the species of animals who ""mate"" for life.  However this has all come under scrutiny recently and now the biological scientific world is relatively split on whether this is more a matter of convenience and territorialism, as Miles suggested, rather than a dedication to a partner.  While there are likely specific pairs within these, and potentially other, species who do in fact mate for life in nearly every observed case, there has been infidelity by one or both partners at some point.

The only species on the planet we can say with 100% certainty DO occasionally mate for life are humans and that is more likely due to our perceived moral consciousness fighting against the baser primal instincts.

**PlayStation controller model differences?**

There have been many variations between the various PS4 controller models.  That I was able to confirm.  However finding a comprehensive listing of their details proved difficult.  I was eventually able to find [this](http://www.psdevwiki.com/ps4/DualShock_4) insanely comprehensive list of Dual Shock 4 controllers which hopefully provides someone somewhere with insight."

So I'm a new college graduate. I've been working an internship for the past several months and I hop on full-time (with more pay) starting next month (along with moving to a larger city). 

Recently I poured over all the material here and made a game-plan. In some cases I'm ahead of the game (no debt whatsoever, I'm lucky) but in some I'm behind (my place of work doesn't offer a 401K or anything like it).

Currently I plan on stashing away 20% in an IRA after I build a three-month safety-net. So I have three questions:

1. Should I calculate the 20% before/after taxes? (I'm doing post-taxes now)

2. What do I do with money leftover after I fill my IRA? I don't have a 401K I can throw back into. Should I build my safety net to be larger? 

3. What's the best way to save for toys? For example, I really would like a new car but I'm not hurting so bad for one that I need to take out a loan for one immediately.

Also, I could potentially save more than 20%. I vastly overestimated my monthly expenses and still have money (albeit, just a little) leftover. 

I'd really like to be able to retire before I'm 65. If you have any questions feel free to ask.

Thanks guys!"

I'm a very active person and have a lot of hobbies outside of coding, so I'm wondering what type of job in the computer science field would suit me, if there is one.

I like to be up and walking around. Throughout high school I was in sports, but outside of class and sports I spent 90% of my free time playing computer games (at a very high level, I'm very competitive). Now that I'm getting older I've spent barely any time on my computer except to code or read reddit. Instead I've moved my time to things I feel are more productive, like playing guitar/drums, improv, weight lifting, boxing, or training for marathons. I don't go out to socialize much anymore unless my girlfriend makes me (lol), but I would consider myself a good public speaker.

I still enjoy video games, but I have a hard time playing them for long periods now without feeling guilt. I value my time a lot more and spending hours playing a game makes me feel like I'm stagnating with my progress as a person.

I chose computer science as my major for many reasons, and the main ones are because of the job security and pay. I'm an ambitious person and like having the opportunity of possibly running a company, or developing my own games, or something along those lines.

My question is, what type of job should I be looking for after I graduate? I might be able to get a very good internship in about a year or so, my junior year. I have been considering trying to grind out and try to get a job at a place like google; I've though about switching my major to Computer Engineering (I recently built my own computer and really enjoyed the process); I've also thought about trying to get a job somewhere in the gaming industry.

4iwy1d,2,2016-05-11,Is this a solid backup setup for a small business?,BackDatAssUpppp,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/4iwy1d/is_this_a_solid_backup_setup_for_a_small_business/,"Hi all,

I'm in the middle of piecing together a new backup solution for my small business. We're in the fashion world and have 6 employees, but we're growing reasonably quickly so I'd like to build a new backup system to ensure all of our files are safe as can be.

Current Setup - All files are currently just on my computer, my business partner's computer and synced to the cloud with Dropbox. Certain folders are synced via Dropbox to other staff members computers too. That's all we have in place at the moment, eeek.

Some facts:

- We currently have ~60GB of files synced to Dropbox. A lot of photography, graphics, Photoshop/Illustrator files, PDFs and videos. All of our company's files are stored within Dropbox folders, other than the files mentioned in the next point...

- We also have 2 x external hard drives (one in the office, one off-site) for every photo/video shoot we do. This holds all the raw footage + photos, plus the edited versions &amp; editable files too. These files normally total ~100-200 GB, hence why they aren't all in Dropbox.

- I'm looking for something solid that doesn't take a crazy amount of setup time or technical skill. It can't be something that requires tinkering to get it working again every few weeks.

- Everyone in the office uses a Mac at this stage.

This is my current idea for a more solid backup solution, can you tell me if you think it'll work? Is there a better approach than this?

- Continue syncing all company files from our computers to Dropbox. Upgrade Dropbox account to have unlimited file recovery. This creates Backup #1 of the company files and eliminates the possibility of an intern overwriting/deleting files from within Dropbox.

- Purchase a [Synology Desktop NAS](http://www.ebuyer.com/742675-synology-ds216j-2-bay-desktop-nas-enclosure-ds216j?gclid=CMGp-Lrr0swCFWoz0wodnn4LiA#fo_c=951&amp;fo_k=1a8d2dbe364eaf19d9ebcd8e329257a6&amp;fo_s=gplauk?mkwid=s_dc&amp;pcrid=51482423219&amp;pkw=&amp;pmt=) with ample storage. This will automatically sync with our Dropbox. We'll also store a copy of each drive we take back from a photo/video shoot on here, making them remotely accessible. This creates Backup #2 for the company files, and backup #3 for the photo/video shoot files.

- Backup all the NAS contents to the cloud with [CrashPlan](https://www.code42.com/crashplan/) to create Backup #3 for the company files, and backup #4 for the photo/video shoot files (but just cloud backup #1 for the photo/video shoot files)

What do you think? Is this enough? Is there a weak link somewhere? Am I being an idiot? Is this overkill?

Hugely appreciate your advice!

I can't stand it. 


So many things happen daily. The thing that just happened now has to do with my mom wanting me tutor someone. A mother posted on the fucking Facebook Town Locals' page looking for a Spanish tutor, and since I'm minoring in that, my mom decided to answer and say I'd do it. So now I'm supposed to call the lady after 5 today. This bothers me for a couple of reasons. 

1.) While I was looking for an internship for the summer, my dad made a comment that I probably won't find one since every job I've ever had my mom has gotten for me. This is COMPLETELY untrue. She got me one job the summer after my freshman year bc she knew the lady. Working in a finance office. 
2.) I don't like my mom feeling like she's doing me any favors. 

Anyway, I said I didn't want to do it. And I was cold about it. Right now she's sitting in front of me HYSTERICALLY crying saying she can't handle being handled so coldly by me. She's acting like she's having a mental breakdown... Saying ""I CAN'T HANDLE THIS TREATMENT"" and shit. I'm sick of her acting like the fucking victim. She's literally laboriously breathing... Fuck. 

I keep saying ""Mom, I don't want to talk right now."" And she keeps saying ""WHY? WHY? WHY? PLEASE TALK TO ME"" ""So you don't want to talk about it? You just want to have this relationship?"" And crying. ""I CANT LIVE LIKE THIS. I feel bad and I don't like feeling like this"" 


Yep, I do want to have this relationship. Bc every time I let you in and tell you things, you throw them back in my face at a later date. I don't want to have a fake relationship. I dislike you so much. 

Holy fuck. I was just completely keeping my cool but then she started crying/whining (literally whining like a dog) so I said ""HOLY SHIT CAN YOU STOP CRYING IN MY FACE? What mother cries at their fucking child begging them to make them feel better??"" Then she got up and ran away and is leaving in her car.. And now I feel so horribly cruel and like I'm evil. 


Wait now she just came back. Now she's saying that she doesn't believe that she was that bad of a mother that I don't want to have a close relationship with her. And crying. Wow... Fuck. I wish she'd stop fucking crying. 

I keep telling her that I don't want to talk and she keeps screaming ""WELL I DO!!!!"" 

Now my dad just came home and she just put on a crying face and went down to see him... So now I'm about to get torn another asshole by him. 


My entire fucking life she has been so fucking cruel to me. And now that I don't want to talk to her and I want to distance myself she's freaking out and has mental breakdowns in front of me. Almost daily. 


I can't even name the ways that she has hurt me... She has called me a selfish maggot that sucks off of her parents, a slut/tramp/whore and how it's so sad that I seek attention from guys to feel better about myself, how pathetic I am, how sad it is that no one wants to be friends with me.... The list endlessly goes on. But let's just forget about all of that and move on. 


I can't forget about that stuff. It has affected me so much. 


Now my dad is coming up the stairs... fml


Edit: She came back up and said ""You know what? You're just like someone I know. Everyone says it and everyone knows it. And you're gunna end up just like her."" 

Prolly referring to someone in our fam. Who knows. She always says shit like that. Welp, I was doing so well and kept my cool but lost it after she came back up and said that and wouldn't leave me alone. I started crying and screaming at her to leave me alone. And she happily just trotted off. That's all she wanted. 


I feel so sad and alone right now... Like I'm evil and cold. I've alwaaaaays felt so cold. I don't think I am though bc I can be really loving to certain people. I dunno. This sucks but it'll be okay someday. It helps writing this shit out/venting. It's gunna be a long month."

To give some context, I have only started to get into and learn more about finance over the past month or two. I'm currently a university student on a 1 year paid internship and going to go finish up my last year of my undergraduate degree in the fall. By the end of my degree I'll probably have around an OSAP debt of around $50,000. I only began reading ""The Wealthy Barber Returns"" and opened up a TFSA account at TD about a month ago.

Being said I am currently trying to change my account into an e-series account. Would it be wise for me to continue putting in the minimum amount of money into the account or should I hold off until I get a real job and paid off my OSAP.

Secondly, is it wise or unwise or even possible to pay off my OSAP straight away via  line of credit from a bank? My parents have given a suggestion of mortgaging their property (condo apartment) to pay off the debt and I pay the mortgage instead.

Much Appreciated!"

So, for context, I'm currently wrapping up my third year of civil engineering undergrad at a midsized engineering school outside of NYC.

Since my sophomore year, some pretty bad personal things have happened (brother died, grandmother died, dog died...) and I think these events may have left me (among other things) a bit burnt out and apathetic towards academics. That, coupled with perhaps taking on a little bit too much over this past year (three internships in the past year, research, leading EWB at my school) has left me, as I've said, burnt out.

 My GPA has fallen from a 3.8 to around a 3.5. But more importantly, I just feel completely unfulfilled with what I'm doing. I thought I would be excited for the future, entering the work force or pursuing grad school, but now I'm filled with either dread or simply apathy.

Because of my poor academic performance, I'm also really afraid I won't get the future I want, if I eventually decide what that future is... I really wanted to pursue grad school, UC Davis mainly, but now I'm concerned I won't even get in. And that's really just adding to the dread for the future I'm already experiencing...

I guess what I want to know is, have any of you ever felt this way? Burnt out, in a hole, not sure how to get out or get inspired again?

Thanks.

My fiancé was offered the job, and we've chosen to accept it. I'm hoping to be accepted at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities for the fall semester, if not I can still take classes online at Madison College and raise my chances for the next semester.


Hello. I am trying to figure which potential school has a better undergraduate business program specifically for marketing majors, or if they are equally comparable:

-UW Madison School of Business
or
-Carlson School of Management (UM Twin Cities)

I am from the Madison, WI area and had originally planned on applying to UW Madison as I am currently a student at Madison Area Technical College for transfer, however, my fiancé may be being offered a new job in Minneapolis (he's a software developer) that has better work and salary, and we will have to decide whether to move for the job or turn it down, and my education is a major factor in this decision. We are not willing to live apart during my schooling. I hope to minor in graphic design as well, but do not know that that is feasible due to the coursework not necessarily overlapping.

(I am currently applying to both, and if I get in one and not the other, well that's an easier decision haha)

I guess my questions for these two colleges are:
-Which school gives a more comprehensive program?
-Which school I am most likely to get able to get a job in marketing right after graduating?
-Which diploma looks better on a resume?
-Which school has more/better internship opportunities?
-Which school has more/better networking opportunities?

I hope to be able to get into either of them obviously, but also do not know how feasible getting into them will be. My ACT score was a 30 and have gotten straight A's this year on my return to college, which is great, but I may be held back from my first attempt at college right out of high school, when I was not going for a business major and had many mental issues. I went to UW Stout for one semester, was kicked out for poor grades, then went to Madison Area Technical College for the spring semester and failed all my classes there as well. That was Fall 2011 and Spring 2012. My life has changed significantly since then and I will be completing my degree without issue no matter which school I attend.

(I do not care about what the cities are like, sports, parties, or dorms)

Any information about these questions or about elsewhere I can find the answers I am looking for is appreciated!"
4ixozq,3,2016-05-11,Summer internship questions. I got the internship!,LetsEatGrandpa,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ixozq/summer_internship_questions_i_got_the_internship/,"Hey guys!  I'm a CS student just finishing up my sophomore year at a university where I live. I have no experience in the field and so far have only done basic Java programs in school. Other than school and helping my brother build a gaming PC 3 years ago, I have minimal computer experience in general (but I am extremely excited to learn).So I met a guy that is the Director of IT for an architecture company on Saturday. We talked a bit and he asked what my career plan is. I told him I would really like to find an internship so I can get hands on experience. As luck would have it, he has room for an intern in his office and would like me to consider a summer internship there. Uhhhh dude... Let's do this! So we exchanged information and he said he would call me Monday morning. I've been disappointed enough times in life to know not to get excited at that point. Monday morning comes and I get the call! He wants me to start ASAP. I went and took a tour of the office that very day and started working the next day (yesterday). So far everything is extremely chill, but I have learned a ton already (though probably just things you guys would see as basic knowledge). We have a small team, just 3 of us total. Basically so far the only tasks we've done are getting computers set up with the correct settings and software that the architects need and we also answer any computer related questions that may come our way from anyone in the office. 

On top of the experience I'm getting, this is also a full-time, paid internship. I also feel like the amount I get paid does not reflect my knowledge at all (as in I get paid way more than I feel I deserve). But hey, I'm a broke college student so I'll take what I can get. 

I would really like any advice that can be given to me at this point. What can I do to be more of an asset to my company while I'm at work? Are there resources I may not be able to locate easily online that can help me learn faster? If anyone has been in a similar situation, what is some advice I can use to maximize my experience the next 3 months? "
4ixphx,2,2016-05-11,It's over for me,xxs02,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4ixphx/its_over_for_me/,"I'm 19 years old, coming from France. I'm going through a very hard time right now and I'm feeling I'm gonna die soon, even if I don't suicide.

I've had a complicated childhood, my parents used to live in Paris and had a pretty good life, but then after a chain of events they ended up having to live in a small town with around 200 people, and I'm born at that moment. My parents were not happy together few years after, not because of me.. I think, but they ended up being alcoholics. While I don't think it hurted me that much, I guess it changed me at some point.
My principal source of despair while I was a kid comes from the fact I've always been rejected by people. I do have Algerian origins and the least I can say is that in my town people were not open minded, and kids follow what their parents says, so I ended up being insulted by a lot of them.

I had the chance to have my mom, who gave me education at home before being 6 years old, I learned a lot from that and I was a bit in advance on other people, which did not helped to connect with other kids.

At 10, my parents broke up for good and I moved with my mom, to a medium-sized city in South France. I was gonna enter in high school and it did put me a lot of pressure on my mind, knowing that I've been rejected and that the climate in high school is catastrophic. I wasn't wrong when I got rejected again by my entire classroom. Starting from that, everything fucked up.

I started to not go to school, a few days per months, then a few days per week, and then weeks after weeks. In the meantime, I wasted my time on online games. It gave me a lot of hope, because I was able to ignore my sadness a little and try to hope for a better future.

I changed high school a year later and the same problem happened. I've then got put into a system that they call ""home hospitalization"", I believe it's the good translation. I've had an educator who came at my home and brought me to school, spent time with me a day in a week to do activies, like going to see a movie, learn to cook.. But nothing did changed what was happening.

Then at 14, they decided to send me to a medical center. It wasn't a psychiatric hospital, but we had therapies about it. This is the time my suicidal thoughts started to gain a level. I got rejected as well in there and it was very hard for me. Near the end, some girls sympathized with me and they were awesome. Unfortunately, when I came back home, I fastly got back again into my problems and stopped contacting them, as it was bringing me pain.. I regret this a lot.

I've tried to go back at high school for my last year, I was still rejected but I tried to get over with. I lasted 3 months and I never got back to it ever since. Somehow my hospitalization has been stopped after that, I wasn't even in the legal age yet to stop the school but I guess no one cared for a kid who wasn't able to go to school, that it was too late.

Few months later, an happy event happened to me, something that changed my life. I got to meet someone, on a online game, that I spent time with and enjoyed a lot discussing with him. I did fall in love with him and so did he. It's an event I never expected to happen and I was happy like I never did ever before. But it ended up bad as well, because we were too different and even if we had real feelings, I think it's because we were both very lonely back at that time so we somehow sticked together..

I did reacted very badly to that and started to have more than just suicidal thoughts. I did not attempted suicide but I know I was very near to it. I also had homicidal thoughts as well, because he brought me a lot of pain, I felt betrayed, abandonned, and I wanted him to suffer for that. However it didn't ended up at all like this. After a few months of near-harassment, we talked like friends trying to reconnect. A few months later I knew I was still in love with him but he wasn't at all, so I stopped talking to him. This was 2 years ago. This means we talked ~1 year after breaking up.

6 months later, I was still in a bad mood but wanted to find someone to have some good time with -as in sex-. I met a guy (let's call him David) through a website and we saw each other the week after. He's been really nice with me, and I was very happy to see him again. As it was a few months after I stopped talking to my ex, I didn't felt like I wanted to necessarily be friend with him, or at least, I needed some time to do so. But he was so very nice with me that I couldn't resist. For me, he is a real friend, someone I can go out with, have fun with when I'm not in a good mood.

The first 3 months were awesome and it's the only 3 months I considered myself being really in a good mood, like a teenager should be, because it was real, it wasn't on Internet. But since the end of 2014, he started to make himself distant. He have mental problems as well, problems that I can't help him because I can't understand, I tried however to help him, but you can't change someone alone like that.. We used to meet at my home almost every week, but since then he didn't come. We stopped talking to each other multiple times, as we were both source of stress to each other, seeing him being in a bad mood was making me sad as well.

In September 2015, I started a professional training for web development, something I think I would never have been able to do if he wasn't here, because I couldn't focus enough on my life.. During that time we stopped talking to each other again, this time I initiated it. We stopped until January of this year, and we both felt very bad for that event, I told him I never want to ever feel that again, that I was caring about him and he is important to me.

We saw each other again a couple of time, and everything goes wrong again. He learned that his neighbor was gay and in a break up. He went to meet his neighbor and sympathized. His neighbor however, is an hyper-possessive guy. David spent 4 hours with me a few days after, telling me that he couldn't handle him, that the guy was nice, but very annoying because he felt being watched constantly. I spent those 4 hours trying to tell him to stop everything before it goes too far. He never listened me.

They are now in couple, BUT David tells me he don't feel like being in couple, he stays with him because he is not as sad as he was before meeting him. I didn't realized it at first, but since 3 weeks now, I'm feeling like I'm totally losing him. I've called him 3 times and he told me that he was caring for me, that he wasn't forgetting about me, but that he don't want to stop with his neighbor, that I have to wait until he finds a way to see me. I've tried to trust him, and I was supposed to see him last week, as well as this week. The reason I could see him is that his neighbor was going to job internship. A thing that didn't happened at all because his neighbor decided to drop it.

The result now is that I'm back feeling totally useless, totally unpowerful over that, I don't know what to think .. Does he love him ? Does he cares for me ? Does he wants to still see me ? Or is he just doing like with his neighbor, wanting to see me but wanting to get me out at the same time ?
I know some people might think that I should just stop talking to him because he is very complicated. Sometimes I think that's true. But he is the first person in my life I consider a real friend, the first person I consider having happy time with, I can go out at restaurant with him, and this is important for me.

If I lose him, I'm scared to do something unforgiveable. I feel terribly bad and I try to not push him too hard because I'm scared to lose him forever if it annoys him. I'm spending days after days in my bed, without eating and drinking the minimum possible, because I feel like I don't worth living if noone cares for me. I can't handle losing someone like him at all, I know I can't. Even if he don't stop me from being sad from time to time, he brings me a fair balance to not being all screwed up, he brings me a certain peace with myself. And I feel like I already lost that. I feel like something broke between us. I know it will be very hard for me to trust him again because until now I didn't realize it would hurt me to bad to lose him.

I don't know what to do.. I have nothing else to do in my life. I can't focus on my own future when such events happens. I have no one else to talk with. I never felt that lonely and ""on the edge"" that much before.
I don't feel myself good with my own body. When I met him I was doing 88 kgs and now I'm doing more than 120. I took all that weight because when we were not seeing each other last year, I had nothing else to do but eating to compensate. And now I'm fat as fuck and I don't know what to do to go back.

There is so much to say.. but I think I already wrote enough, I know it might miss a lot of information but if you really need them you can ask me. I'm asking for help, if someone ever felt the same way as I do right now, and what can I do.. I consider going to his home tomorrow to try talking to him because I need to know if he still cares for me, I need an answer before doing anything stupid. Please, I beg you, whoever you are, to try understand me and to talk with your heart about your own experience..

**EDIT**: I would also add that David don't seem to understand what I'm going through, despite what he says. He think I'm just jealous, which is a bit true at some point, but it's so much more than that ... He think I'm being thinking only to myself when I tell him that he should stop with him. I told him by SMS yesterday that I don't think he does understand me, as it is the kind of thing you need to live yourself, and that if he did, he would react differently. He didn't answered since then. It's someone who is really scared by the death, that's why I'm not telling him I'm having suicidal thoughts, but if he was in my role, I'm pretty sure he would be as broken as I am and that he would try to save our friendship.. At least if he does care for me.

**EDIT 2**: I would also like to add, that aside from all my social problems, I do have problems to enjoy the life itself. Already back when I was a kid, I was constantly bored all the day, I could not put a single effort of doing something .. Watching TV ? Nah. Reading ? Nah. And it's pretty much the same today. I got interested enough to watch a TV series that is about to end, and so far it's the only reason for me to wake up from my bed in an entire week, so that I can spend 1h watching it live ...

I'm interested in computers, video games, everyone thinks I'm even addicted to it. The truth is that I don't.. It helped me when I was in high school to run away from my problems but today I can't run away from it. I don't get any fun being on a computer and when I'm not I tend to even feel better. But then there is nothing else for me to do.
I tried to play a game I've expected for, thinking it would bring me some hope like I could before, but it ended up being even worse for me, because I was losing almost every games, and it just make me think about all my failures in life. I can't handle defeat and loss, it's too hard for me anymore.
Life always seemed so annoying for me. Everywhere I go I see happy people, and knowing that I'm not, it just keeps me depressing even more...

The only recent event I've been happy about was when David took me to my first ""fireworks party"", I don't know the translation I'm so sorry. It's basically my city did an event where they launched fireworks for 15 minutes. I've never saw it before and he made it possible. This was awesome, I miss him so much when he was like that ..."

For summer 2016, I'd like to try learning another programming language, but I'm also looking to pick up a job to get a car and just be more independent overall. 

Should I try to make an app or learn another language or anything like that? I've also looked into learning a foreign language, but I don't know how much that would help me as far as CS careers/internships are concerned. I don't think I've done anything remarkable or that's resume-worthy, so what should I do in regards to that?

Across the middle east Pan-Arab sentiment stirs in the wind; from Egypt it's tendrils coil out across the sub continent stretching into Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and no more has it gained more traction than Syria. The ""SSNP"" government of Syria was incredibly unpopular and propped up only Soviet military forces, with a faltering economy and none of the political tact of Adib Shishakli, Maamun al-Kuzbari's popularity was only decreasing. Eventually members of the largely Ba'athest military and an umbrella of national parties began meeting in secret, plotting the downfall al-Kuzbar's regime. On the 12th of April the military surrounded the Senate and the Presidential Palace with artillery and tanks demanding the surrender of the government to a military transitional government. The military sent tanks taking over radio stations and key choke-points surrounding the Soviet military bases. From their positions at the radio stations, the army announced the dissolution of the civilian government and the beginning of the revolutionary military government. The newly reformed national parties sent out death squads across Damascus and Aleppo to execute members of parties declared ""dangerous to the state."" This includes the almost total decapitation of the Communist and Kurdish parties and the decimation of the SSNP. The new government has given the Soviet forces 48 hours to leave Syria or be forcefully removed.


**Sudan**

The Sudanese civil war still remains a stalemate for the most part, while some local forces begin to mobilize with arms from Uganda and Ethiopia the conflict is still a war of survival for the Equatorial corps and the Sudanese military still remains in control of the vast majority of countryside. The military meanwhile has turned on it's own government when General Ibrahim Abboud took control of the government in a military coup to end ""the state of degeneration, chaos, and instability of the country."" He has brought about some economic recover, lower the price of Sudanese cotton and selling off an excess bumper crop but his regimes remains shaky at best with support mainly coming from the conservative countryside.

**Kurdistan**

The Kurdish tribals in Turkey and Iran followed the example of their Iraqi brothers. Initial uprisings in Van and near Batman ended with the Tribals being beaten back into the mountains where they had the advantage. A number of left-wing groups were formed fighting out of the Zagros mountains under the umbrella name ""Kurdish Workers Party"". Based out of the Qandil region near the border the Kurds are fighting on their doorstep using their knowledge of the Terrain against the numerically and technologically superior enemy. The Turkish government have mostly responded with repeated bombings of rural villages and mountainous cave systems.


The Kurdish forces in Iran attempted to meetup with former elements of the Republic of Mahabad. They go about reforming elements of the Peshmerga, meeting with Shekak tribals, gaining the support of the PDKI. Eventually they were ready and began a series of attacks throughout the region, uprisings in Salmas, Baneh, and Sardasht attempted to grab hold of major cities and road systems but just got forced back into the mountains. They now take cover in mountain villages only occasionally able to attack the government forces due to lack of weaponry.
The Iraqi uprising meanwhile is still going somewhat well, the Iraqi forces maintain control of the roads and major cities but the Kurds more or less maintain control of their ancestral homeland in the mountains. All Iraqi attempts to root the Kurds out have been tactical success but strategic failures, while a Kurdish offensive gained tenuis control of Akre. The Assyrians have continued their campaign against both the Iraqis and the Kurds, having begun a process of ethnic cleansing in the Nineveh plains. Relatively well armed they had initial success against the poorly organized Kurds and unprepared Iraqi army but after a second major Iraqi offensive the Assyrians were forced into more conventional guerrilla warfare tactics.

**Turkey**

The Turkish government led by the Democratic party were caught in an awkward position, they had previously supported the USSR and the Kurdish uprising in Iraq, but now with the tides turning against them they have few places to turn. So on the 27th of March a handful of military officers staged a coup against the democratic party removing them from power. The Great Turkish Nation:

 *Starting at 3:00 am on the 27th of March, the Turkish armed forces have taken over administration throughout the entire country. This operation, thanks to the close cooperation of all our citizens and security forces, has succeeded without loss of life. Until further notice, a curfew has been imposed, exempt only to members of the armed forces. We request our citizens to facilitate the duty of our armed forces, and assist in reestablishing the nationally desired democratic regime.*

In their place General Cemal Gürsel became intern president and snap elections were held with the Kemalist party finishing almost 8 points ahead of the disgraced Democrats. The new government seeks closer ties with the west and is willing to rejoin CENTO and possibly NATO.

**Indochina.**


The Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia was seen less as a liberation and more as an attempt to establish hegemony over a nation they previously [considered annexing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/48jc3b/event_division_of_the_united_republics_of/) The military campaign started off quite well, with the Vietnamese forces pushing through the lightly defended Ratanakiri and Mondulkiri provinces. Most of the Cambodian military was in the south fighting the insurgency and were caught completely off guard. As the Vietnamese pushed further towards the capital of Cambodia they faced stiffer resistance, by the time they reached the Mekong river the Cambodian army had torched several bridges and several hundred Vietnamese died crossing the river. By the time the exhausted Vietnamese crossed the river the king had already fled to Singapore and the newly installed military government have come to the negotiating table.

In Vietnam Mihn's approval ratings dropped like a stone down a well. The ""imperialist invasion"" of Cambodia was denounced by politician Nguyễn Văn Thiệu and general Võ Nguyên Giáp for being overly aggressive. Ngô Đình Diệm's Can Lao Party meanwhile took a diffrent stance; the stated it was foolish to invade Cambodia with an insurgency in their own backyard and so soon after the fear of invasion by the PRC. Human rights activist Thích Quảng Đức has denounced this invasion as well calling for solidarity between Buddhists and an end to violence in Indochina. This has all been set to the backdrop of an escalating insurgency, with numbers rising from an estimated 7,000 to what is now believed to be around 12,000 although these are rough estimates at best. The insurgency has been increasingly publicized with Maoist attacks escalating in audacity, including a well publicized bombing outside the US embassy in Vietnam city that killed 2."
4ixzaw,4,2016-05-11,Trouble Finding Research,sicp123,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/4ixzaw/trouble_finding_research/,"Hey, everyone! I've had numerous pitfalls as this year comes to a close and finals week is in the process of crippling me, so I apologize profusely in advance for my lack of coherence and/or rambling.

As of today, May 11th, I believe I've emailed or spoke in person to about 30 different professors, doctors, and principal investigators and I have been denied a research opportunity with them either over the summer or as the school year begins. It's just extremely depressing on top of being rejected was that my family took large sum of money out to help me stay at my school for the summer rather than go back home and I had the attention of working, volunteering, and getting research experience. I had an engineering internship whose schedule was very constricting and I had to drop it with the idea that my work and research would accomodate them and everything seems to be falling apart and I don't really know what I should be doing anymore.

For context, I'm a rising sophomore, so I understand not getting research early on, however I'm very interested in pursuing an MD/PhD and I truly wanted a chance to expose myself to research early so that I could find out if it was for me and work on a team with a good mentor and eventually get credited in the form of a publication for all my help on the research project.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, where do you turn to now when both the professors you know and strangers you contact tell you either curtly through email or to your face that there's no room in their lab for a volunteer or they don't have the funding (even when you'd be working for free...)?

Any help would be appreciated, please save me from my perpetual sadness as this is truly depressing me on top of everything else I have going on."

I really didn't think Id need it. Now I'm almost 1 year past my graduation date and haven't landed a first programming job. Languages I learned were Java, PHP, Visual C#, and Python. I also delved into database with a couple courses. Most places wont hire someone without experience and I don't even have an internship. 

I looked for internships recently but they all required you to be in school. 

Has anyone found internships after graduating or do I have some other option to be more hirable to employers? I don't have recent work experience outside of cs either but thats because I had a small online business and lived with parents to avoid much of the cost of living, Im wondering if Im getting second guesses because of that. I listed it on my resume anyway. Im afraid my age is coming into play too. 31/M"

* Pros: Better CS education for sure, good career fair (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, IBM...). Extra year to build personal projects and more internships.

* Cons: Set my life back a year. Retake CS course all over again (this could be good).

*Option 3: University of Michigan, cost $7k/year

* Pros: Good CS program, legit career fair. Best option to improve my networking.

* Cons: Set my life back a year and half. Bad weather.

*Option 4: PennState, cost $5k/year 

* Least favorite option. Still set my life back a year but I don't think it's worth an upgrade to my current school.

Which of these options would help me in a long term career? I have to reply to schools by May 15th so any help would be appreciated."

I've been browsing here for the past couple years or so, and it's really helped me over the course of my college career, from starting out as an unpaid intern at a tiny startup during freshman summer (maybe you shouldn't be doing this...)  to now, finally, working back to back internships at two of my dream SF/Bay Area tech companies with a pretty good chance at a return offer if I don't colossally eff up. 

I'm not a CS major per se (shoutout to the UC/UW/UT/other schools whose internal CS admissions have gotten ridiculous), so I didn't really have a ton of close people who I knew from classes (one of the big downsides of not being a cs major in my opinion) to ask questions about what decision to make with an offer or courses to take in the beginning. 

And while I admit there are some things to be desired on this sub, a good deal of the resources and threads that were posted here helped me immensely with practice at both the interview and resume stage, and just solid nuggets of advice in general, from sourcing interview questions to places to apply to (truthfully speaking, I think I practiced more questions I found through here than from CTCI). Although I sacrificed the better part of Oct-Feb taking said advice, the end results (and all the offers! awesome feeling) were, I think, worth it. I used to be a pretty nervous wreck in interviews (topped with a healthy dose of ""I'm not even a major!"") and even choked on some easy questions (which sucks immensely when interviews alone are so tough to come by), but the commenters here gave me great advice on where to go to improve and other helpful stuff. 

And as of a couple days ago, I'm all set to start. :) 

Thanks a ton, r/cscareerquestions! ~~I could've done it without you, but it would've been almost unbearably hard and a lot longer~~ I couldn't have done it without you!"

4izlxx,1,2016-05-12,[Support]Thinking of going NC with my Ndad [TW:All of the Above],Sokkenfee,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4izlxx/supportthinking_of_going_nc_with_my_ndad_twall_of/,"When I [26,F] grew up it was obvious my Ndad was an alcoholic. He only gave me shit when something went wrong (low grades, or not up to his standards), never encouraged me, and never congratulated me on good grades. There is one instance I remember where he was drunk and my sister [then 15] got kicked so hard she actually flew through the room a bit. Otherwise it was more verbal than physical abuse. She was the one to take most of the heat, until she went off to college. Then it was my turn. 


He would make fun of me when I made a mistake, even as small as forgetting to bring one item back from the grocery store. “Well, looks like Sokkenfee is at it again!” “That’s so typically Sokkenfee.” Stuff like that. It might not seem that harmful, but the way he said it always made me feel bad about myself and what I’d done. Even if I forgot to bring a book home from school he’d make me feel like I was the dumbest person he’d ever met. I wasn’t diagnosed officially, but since then I’ve realized that I was depressed as hell. Since high school began I thought about committing suicide. After I got help for that it got better for a few years. Three years later I almost got anorexic. I weighed 45 kg, which was the very, very last point before being considered severely underweight for my length. I’d always been a bit plump before that, and I was getting obsessed with food. The stereotypical image of skin-to-bone anorexic patients was enough to get me back to reality, thank god. But the self-harming continued. If I couldn’t punish myself though food, a razor blade would do just fine. Through the internet I found others who had the same kind of struggles and decided that I really had to quit while I still could. This was not healthy behavior, or a normal type of reaction to my situation. I struggled and had some moments I found it really difficult to keep myself from doing harm. The last year of high school was hell for me. I got molested in one instance and got raped on a second. I didn’t know how to handle this, so I just went on. When I told my mom about the molestation she was speechless. She told my dad, with me standing next to her, and he just walked away. I never mentioned the rape to either of them. Only now, almost ten years later, I realize how much my dad’s behavior had to do with everything.


Not surprisingly, I got out of there as fast as I could. As soon as I started at the university, I went to find a place for myself. It took me four months to finally force a move, in which my mom was very helpful. Everything seemed to settle down, at least for a while. Then my grades started to drop dramatically. I wasn’t used to living on my own, couldn’t keep a budget and was enjoying my newfound freedom way too much. I quit my major and decided on a new one to start in September. That is where shit hit the fan. I told my parents and my dad went berserk. “See? It was a bad idea to let you out of the house! Didn’t I tell you this was a mistake? You’re coming back home!” I resisted that until the point came where I broke off contact. My dad was furious. He took all of the money in my savings account, which was all I had at the moment. Three days until rent was due, and another full month of having to get by without any money for food, I was desperate. I called my mom, who was constantly interrupted by my dad in the background. He wanted to set up a meeting to talk about my money and everything that had happened. I would get the money back as soon as we had talked everything out. 


During the meeting, my dad kept saying how much he wanted to help me and that he was worried. He’d give the money back as soon as I’d completed my first year of studying. Red flags went up instantly and I didn’t want anything to do with him anymore. I broke off contact until three years later. He could keep the money if that meant my peace and quiet. I worked on myself and made friends. I realized that my relationship to my dad was way off from what is considered normal. I couldn’t relate to people who went home every weekend and were happy to see their parents. I noticed how I was similar to my dad and started hating the parts of me that were. Not everything I inherited from his is bad, like my intelligence, but other things are really despicable. I find it really easy to lie convincingly and I have little to no remorse when I hurt someone’s feelings when making a snide remark. It took a long time to be able to deal with that, and I’m still working on it every time I have a conversation. 


When I saw him again I was struck by how happy he was. It wasn’t the teary-eyed ‘omg how have you been’ but more of a smirky ‘I always get what I want, nothing has happened at all’. He was way too jolly for the situation. As soon as we went to a restaurant, he started talking about the money. He was willing to give it back, and pay for my student loans. I just needed to promise him I’d keep in touch more often. He made some payments, but always made sure there was some more I was promised that I hadn’t gotten yet. He basically held a bag of money in front of me, just out of reach. Every time I jumped through his hoop, he would say I needed to jump another one.


Despite promises he would give me the money, he hasn’t paid anything in the last two years. He would occasionally give me some money so I was able to pay for clothes, and he bought me a car when I really needed it for my internship abroad. Now he claims that he’s paid me back everything, and more than I was to receive in the first place. He brings up the money for clothes and the car, even though I told him this would not reduce his debt to me, and he confirmed. Of course the total of those gifts isn’t what I’m owed. My mom now has it written down in the financial divorce part: he owes me xK money and will pay it back. He hasn’t signed it yet (no surprise there), and the theft of my money is about to expire according to the law. (7 years past, next month)


That last part is what happened last night. I now have a letter in front of me generally saying “I’m better off without you in my life, I consider you to be dead, if you attempt to contact me I will call the police.” Any form of explanation on my part would be useless, so why bother? He doesn’t respond to emotional pleas. I will send the letter if he doesn’t have any good response to my questions on his decision to keep my money away from me. It’s a hefty price, to lose the money, but it will be worth it when I finally get some peace and quiet in my mind. I just have to stay strong for a while and then enjoy a peaceful, Ndad-free life.


Other fun facts about what my father has done / caused:

* Cheated on my mom, kept denying it until my mom filed for divorce and he could take his girlfriend with him to family parties
* Forged documents in the divorce of my aunt, causing the outcome to shift in his favor
* He is a pathological liar
* He is an alcoholic
* In order to make it more difficult for my mom during the divorce, he officially moved to another country even though he still lives in the house I grew up in
* He thinks he is a wonderful father
* He always tries to lecture me on ethics and despises things like tax evasion, racism and general ‘right-wing ideology’, even though he evades tax, is a racist and behaves like a right-wing rich guy
* He literally told me he doesn’t give a fuck about my friends or my life, other than my achievements
*He denied knowing about the molestation and obviously ‘pretended’ to be shocked by it when I brought it up again
* I went to therapy when my parents divorced, learned how to see things he did to others as not relating to our personal relationship.

4izt4z,1,2016-05-12,Build with used parts... (dum dum dum),ozziey,pcmasterrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4izt4z/build_with_used_parts_dum_dum_dum/,"Hellooo everyone of PCMR,

This is my first post on PCMR, and i thought it would be cool to come with a cool idea off building a pc with only used parts. It is probably done before me here I am not sure. But anyway I want to know if anyone here would be interested to know how this little project so going to happen and follow the progress.

A bit about me...

I live in the Netherlands I am 20 years old and I'm currently studying IT and working as an intern at a company specialized in distributing vegetables and fruits (I of course work at the IT department). I play games since I was little on the Supernintendo, PS1 to PS4 and of course the PC. I didn't know much about building one and about components, but thanks by my friends and classmates I pretty much learned everything. 

Now about the Project.
So getting parts wouldn't be very hard in Holland there are plenty of places and people to get them from and because it isn't a very big country it's easy to get everywhere with car within 2 to 3 hours. 
For example I saw some great deals for high end GPU's because of the up and coming gtx 1070 and 80.
Like the gtx 970 for 250 euro's.

So I think I could come up with a pretty good and powerful PC with a Low-mid-end budget.

I'll gladly want to hear any more ideas and suggestions.



Edit: I think we should set a budget like 400-600 euro's ? It is after all, all about building a second hand build powerful but yet cheap. I search for some parts tomorrow and post them here. STAY TOONED

Edit: http://tweakers.net/aanbod/993727/asus-strix-gtx970-dc2oc-4gd5.html maybe still a bit to much for a cheap second hand build. But it is of course an amazing deal."

So, here's my situation-

I graduated college four years ago and since then, in an effort to gain experience which is key to working in the non-profit sector, I have been working mostly in either unpaid internships or federal public service programs. Immediately after graduating, I had an unpaid internship with a refugee center and also another with a grassroots citizen diplomacy organization which worked with the US State Department. After those, I worked a little over a year as an AmeriCorps VISTA volunteer and now, I'm finishing up Peace Corps service abroad.

I recently find a job posting near home in the US that I really like and think I would be an excellent candidate for but, in addition to a cover letter and resume', the posting also requires that I include a salary history as well.

This concerns me for two reasons-

First- I do not actually have a salary history due to the fact that my internships were unpaid and the federal public service programs I participated in only provided living-allowances as ""payment"". So, I'm not really sure what to even disclose to them for that. The last actual wage-based job I had was during college when I worked at a coffee shop. I've thought about just giving yearly totals for the living allowances I received as my salary history but I'm not quite sure that's what they're looking for.

Second- If I *do* in fact include my living-allowances as my salary history, I fear that the recruiters for this position will see how little money I've made over the past four years and if I did actually get hired, I'd be offered less money than somebody who disclosed a legitimate salary history when applying. 

I mean, in the non-profit field, there's not much money to be made in general but I definitely have an idea of how much money I think is reasonable for me to make given the experience and skills I have and also what this position entails.

Any and all advice in regards to what I should do would be greatly appreciated."

4j0kva,10,2016-05-12,"Hey /r/EMS, I made a free Android app that helps you estimate air ambulance response times.",Presupposed,ems,https://www.reddit.com/r/ems/comments/4j0kva/hey_rems_i_made_a_free_android_app_that_helps_you/,"[Google Play link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=medirace.net.medirace), or search for 'MediRace'

I had an idea in medic school to create a program that would automatically map the borderline around a hospital where it started to become faster to call in a helicopter. Problem was I didn’t know how to program in medic school. Fortunately (?), it has taken me a long time to get a field internship preceptor. So, I was able to learn some Java in my free time and I just finished MediRace.

All you need to do is type in the destination hospital and wherever your helicopter is stationed, and MediRace will use your device’s GPS coordinates to automatically get the Google Maps driving time estimation to the hospital and compare that to the helicopter taking off, flying to you, loading, and flying to the hospital at 130 knots.

If you’re en-route to the patient, there’s an optional field for patient location. The extra drive and on-scene time will be added into the calculation.

The location searches are powered by Google and are biased towards your local area. The hospital and helicopter input fields will save your last entry, or provide autocomplete suggestions of previous searches. The results calculations are all displayed for you, in case you need to adjust the numbers in your head. I wanted to make this as convenient and fast as possible to use.

The best feature I think is, after you’re done looking at the calculation, you can tap the marker for your destination on the map, then click the blue arrow to open up Google Maps with your driving directions already done. Makes using the app seamless. You could use it before every call if you just wanted to see the total drive from you to the patient and then to the hospital.

[Some research to consider](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4251659/#R32): Google Maps has been shown to be the most accurate model out there for predicting ambulance travel time. But it’s not perfect. You can expect about a 20% error on your drive time estimations. There seems to be a phenomenon for longer transport times where time estimations become more accurate percentage-wise. This is probably because we start driving on freeways and act more like a normal part of traffic, which is what Google is really calculating. This is good because long transport times are when calling in the helicopter comes into question. Unfortunately there isn’t much out there in terms of improving the model for ambulance use. The model in this paper only improved accuracy by a couple percent, and they didn’t study the effect of lights and sirens. I’ll be looking for ways to increase accuracy of the app’s estimations as more research comes out.

Big thanks to /u/throwmeawaymedic and /u/_Ducky__ for responding to my last post about helicopter response times. I will probably adjust the numbers and calculations as I get more feedback. It’s surprisingly difficult to find exact response times online.  If you have feedback or local protocol to share just message me.

I hope this helps you all. If you get more use out of this app than your Leatherman Raptor's window punch or seat belt cutter I will consider it a success. The only request I have is, if you like the app share it around.


Thanks!

4j0nid,12,2016-05-12,Few questions about getting a second degree in CS,KISS_THE_GIRLS,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4j0nid/few_questions_about_getting_a_second_degree_in_cs/,"I just got my acceptance to my previous college to get a second degree in computer science.  Does it matter if it's a B.A. or B.S.?

Also I'm still working full time right now, but saved a chunk of money (enough to last me through 2-3 years of schooling with all expenses paid assuming I don't work at all) to get ready, so I will be demoting myself to part-time at my company.  

Should I be looking for paid internships for my first semester? or wait until the first semester is over? (I will quit my current job for the paid internship).  I'm in NYC if that matters.

I'm trying to prepare in advance so any help is appreciated."
4j1feu,5,2016-05-12,Getting over almost being killed and kidnapped...and the stress of it all,ohdamngiiina,getting_over_it,https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/4j1feu/getting_over_almost_being_killed_and_kidnappedand/,"Let me introduce myself, my friends call me Gina. I don't really follow zodiac signs but if you do, i'm an Aries. I'm energetic, dynamic and rarely slow down. I work, go to school and do a medical internship. I get one day off a week and I do better when kept busy. I suffer from anxiety and depression and yes, I was almost kidnapped, blessed enough with protection to avoid being raped and heard my boyfriend and his younger brother getting the sh*t beat out of them during a home invasion and I swear, I thought I was going to have to listen to my boyfriend get murdered.

If any of you are familiar with the Carr brothers, the men that robbed and assaulted us made several references to them and they also attempted to make this invasion a similar style. We had to strip down, one of the men punched me and started feeling on my private areas. Maybe it's just who I am or maybe my mind just detached but being naked never really bothered me...the man touching on me, I hated it, but it didn't scar me or make me feel like any less of a person. 
The attack itself was one thing but honestly, it's these last few weeks after the attack that have made me so lost and angry.

 I also occupy my time with singing and music and several of my bandmates had decided to go out that evening as usual. I messaged a bandmate after spending the entire day at the hospital and let them know the details of what happened. The response I received from the band manager was, ""You should get dolled up and come out to this bar because we just met a guy in charge of the casino entertainment. This is grown folks business!""
I chose to ignore the message and honestly was just to exhausted to even get pissed. The attack happened early sunday morning...and I work on Mondays. I was allowed to miss work (obviously) and was able to sleep in and to just..heal. Tuesdays are school. I'm very close to completing my hours at school and am only weeks away from graduating. I wasn't about to let this attack stop me from graduating. Then I found out the school has been screwing me on my hours and had been since day 1 of my education. I'm still in the process of trying to get everything figured but at this point i'm having to take it to our state board because the school is giving me general answers that really don't make any sense and are getting angry at me for asking questions. 
The men that broke in also happened to take all of our cellphones. Since i'm an aspiring esthetician, one of the finals to graduate is a 6 week study. We find a model and they come in weekly for 6 weeks and we do different skin treatments (etc.) and document the change. I had one treatment left and the men took my phone with all the pictures of my model on it. This was my instructors response, ""I can really only give you a maximum of 85 but it will be less if you don't have pictures or anything.""
Outside of school, I am sharing my studio apartment with my boyfriend since he can't stand to be at his home anymore. He is showing signs of depression and PTSD and i've noted that in the evenings, right before I go to sleep, I find my mind replaying scenes from the attack. They don't scare me...it's just that the police haven't picked these guys up yet (even though we ID them in a line up, and they left several articles of clothing at the scene) and i'm just always afraid they might try and come back for more. Before bed I always make sure that my shotty is within reaching distance besides my bed and that my boyfriends gun is within distance for him, on his side. 
I know this is long and drawn out and maybe this is just my way of dealing with the trauma but I woke up today and just felt like I couldn't continue bearing the weight of the expectations of everyone anymore.

 There isn't much in this life that I haven't been able to deal and i'm generally a very stoic person..so, dealing with all these situations at the same time is getting to be to much and I just feel...stuck. Stuck because my main priority is school and it's all messed up right now and I'm so close to getting my license and now I may not be able to graduate, stuck because I go home and watch my boyfriend suffer being trapped in his mind (he cried for 20 minutes the other day because he threw out a shirt that had blood on it and it triggered a flashback) and I sure I am not sleeping as good as I should.

If you're still reading, you're quite amazing. As I said, I know this is long and it probably is my way of dealing...but I just don't know if anyone else out there has felt so much emotion and yet...nothing at the same time? "

We both graduated in the past year and moved in together. He had one more semester after I did so I stayed and got a job at our university. I told him I wanted to move and he agreed, so I started looking for jobs in cities that would work well for both of our career paths. I finally got a paid internship for this summer and we agreed to do long distance until our lease was up at the end of July, just a couple months. I though things were great, I was excited about our new chapter. 

On Monday morning, I woke up like any other day. I got ready for work, kissed him on the forehead and headed out for the day. We had a big romantic date Friday night since I was leaving soon and I was feeling good about everything. 

When I came home Monday, I saw him on the couch and knew immediately that something was wrong. And then he broke up with me. Told me he had been planning it for over a month, and thought this would be the most convenient day to do it. He had a bag packed, he was moving to New Mexico with his parents for a while. He had everything plotted and figured out. 

Now I am devastated. I feel like I have lost a part of myself. I leave to find a place in my new city after work today and he has been sleeping on our couch until he leaves for New Mexico toward the end of the month. I don't know what to do with myself. I just want to rewind the past few days and forget all of this ever happened. I just want us to be together again. All of my friends keep saying things will get better and this is a positive and I should look at it as an adventure but I feel like my whole life is falling apart and I have no idea what to do. He has been my everything for so long and just like that everything was over between us. All of my last memories with him feel like lies because he was planning on leaving me. I have never been this miserable in my entire life and I am honestly so scared. I know people go through break ups all the time but I just don't know what to do. I don't want to go to this new city alone. I want him to be with me again. I don't know how to live without my best friend and everything hurts. I don't want to lose him I just want things to be back the way they were... Please help me. "

Got offered a second internship. I accepted it as I only had a couple weeks after the first one ended to respond.

Now, I'm having a bit of a crisis and realizing I'm not actually interested in the work (and maybe not even interested in software engineering), and am thinking about spending the summer working on a personal project and doing some soul searching.

I'm aware that I'm likely burning a bridge and could face consequences from my school, but is settling with a job I'm not truly satisfied with really the better option?"
4j25j9,3,2016-05-12,"I've realized I'm in the wrong field. Should I try to find a job with my jack-of-all-trades-and-master-of-none current experience and learn a new skillset in my spare time, or should I try to switch careers now? Either way, I need a new job ASAP.",The_Judas_Goat,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/4j25j9/ive_realized_im_in_the_wrong_field_should_i_try/,"I can't be too specific about my current job without revealing my identity. I'm using my throwaway account for this reason. I'm literally the only person on the North American continent who does what I do with the specific leagues/series that I work with. Let's just say I really love a certain sport and thought I wanted to work in the field. So I got a communication degree and got into sports PR.

I had an internship with my home town NBA team, then another with a big name team in another league/series, and now I'm a full-time employee working in PR, media relations and marketing at a premier sports venue that hosts my favorite sport. Mission accomplished.

And I feel like a fish out of water. This field does not fit me.

I took the StrengthsFinder 2.0 assessment a while back, and my top 5 strengths are Analytical, Consistency, Individualization, Strategic and Intellection. Analytical is me in a nutshell.

Ever since I was a kid, I loved taking things apart to see how they work. I still do. I love digging through information and finding that 'Aha!' moment where you come up with something useful in a pile of otherwise meaningless numbers. It would be great to get into an analytical field, but I have absolutely zero professional experience. I've never used any data analysis tool other than typing numbers into a spreadsheet and coming up with formulas and ways to analyze them.

Nobody at my current employer does this sort of work. We used to have a two-person business intelligence department. But we brought in a new CEO who doesn't give a crap about data, and that department disappeared. So getting experience at my current job isn't a possibility.

How can I get into that field without a data-oriented degree and no professional experience? I do have some technology experience as a former Apple Family Room Specialist (basically a Genius who only works on mobile devices, no computers), but that was 6 years ago.

I have too many financial obligations to do unpaid work, and I want out of my current job yesterday. Even if I liked my current field, I would want out of this company. I'll only ever get more responsibilities, never a raise or promotion, but that's a different issue.

So I'm trying to find a new job in a similar field that will pay the bills while I try to learn data analysis and other IT skills on my own.

The problem there is, I'm a jack of some marketing trades and a master of none. Basically I do what needs doing for the Marketing team, regardless of discipline. I do:

* Event planning - I plan the media operations for our events. A lot of media come to our events, and we need to feed them, give them facilities to work in, distribute information, etc. This is the heaviest lifting I do. There are a lot of vendors to work with, volunteers, temporary staff, personnel from the leagues/series, media attending the event. There used to be a 3-4 person department to run all this. Now there's just me.
* Business administration - I administer the paid advertising budget for our events. Keep track of spending, make sure we follow all the accounting procedures, get all the I's dotted and T's crossed, etc.
* Public relations - I send out press releases, but don't write them. I field PR inquiries, but I'm not empowered to do interviews and make statements on the company's behalf. I don't do social media or any other public-facing activities.
* Media Relations - I go through media credential applications and approve/deny them to attend our events, as well as act as their primary point of contact during events.

I'm looking for jobs, and there are a lot of jobs for which I meet some of the requirements, but very few where I meet all of them.

Does anyone have any advice? Are there any certifications I can get in my spare time that can translate to a real job in the analytical field? In the time I've spent trying to find a job that suits my current experience, I probably could've gotten some sort of certification already.

**TL;DR: I'm not well qualified to do many jobs except the one I have, and I hate the one I have. I want to get into analytics, but need a new job ASAP, analytics or not. What should I do?**"

4j2b6p,17,2016-05-12,Back to the Beginning- Leather 5,augdog78,badpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/badpeoplestories/comments/4j2b6p/back_to_the_beginning_leather_5/,"Man, I really want to tell another Ram story. There was some truly wicked shit that went down over the next few months with him.  I’ll get to that, since the Ram and Mark stories get interwoven for a few months. I really have to be careful how I write about him, though, because there are definitely unresolved feelings there, in spite of the time that has passed. In fact, my wonderful husband just brought him up a couple weeks ago during a fight. 

But, let’s go all the way back to the beginning. We all got our start at various times at “Acme Large Business” which was globally diverse. At a step or two above intern, we were packaged up and transferred to another branch to be promoted, trained up in a different area of customer concern and then again split and sent to smaller branches to do good things. 

I arrived at Acme West Coast a sad, lonely girl. Mark took a liking to me and came by my place on the regular unannounced. Each time it was to show off a new thing. Truck. Motorcycle. Purchases from shopping sprees. Electronics. You get it? We had a group of folks in common and when he would ask me to go out for something, I always called some of the others. After some time, I got used to the attention. Then one day I was at work and had to go into his division for something. One of the guys asked if I was there for him. “No, why?” “Oh, sorry, I just thought you were together since you had lunch a lot and he talked about you like you were his girlfriend.”

He and I found ourselves alone together at his apartment one day after work. I thought we were all going out to see a movie so I drove over to his place to meet the group. He told me when I got there that Fred had called to cancel and that a couple others had never confirmed, so we should just watch a movie there. I did find him attractive and he was into me, so one thing led to another that day. I saw Fred on Monday and mentioned to him that we missed him on Friday, maybe we would just see the movie another time. He had no idea what I was talking about.  He never had plans to see a movie with us, he was really confused. The warning signs and flags came early and often with Mark and I ignored every one.

It just became natural for us to be together after that and people just assumed that we were a couple. Dino loved the idea. Some others not so much. One day, we went to the beach. We were out on the pier and he grabbed my hand as we were walking. Yes, we’d slept together the night before, but he hadn’t yet started to express the fetish tendencies and always, when we were done, I got up went home. 

I was kind of happy that we were phasing into something more than FWB, but all of a sudden I had to put into perspective the horrible things he said about his ex, his family, and life in general.  His hatred of his ex was abnormal. He would talk about how she deserved to be raped until she was sterile. I kind of blew it off, like he was just venting and I did tell him that as a brother and a son, he would not ever want that to happen to a woman he loved. He at that point called his sister a “fuckin mattress backed whore” who would get what she deserved someday. I changed the subject thinking he was just a bit off that day. 

On one of the early days in our relationship, he started talking about how seeing women in dangerous situations really turned him on. We had driven by a woman who had a breakdown on the side of the rode. I said how that was why I was so fortunate to have a car still under warranty, with roadside assistance, etc. He said that you never know how a woman will repay a guy for changing a tire or putting plug wires back on. 

Me: How do they just come off? Dude, especially more than one. I mean, yes, on an older car, I can see one coming loose, but in a newer car, I might not even look. 

Mark: Well, in some cases, you have to take them off and wait. 

Me: Huh? 

Mark: Yeah, it’s a great way to meet chicks. 

Picture us sitting in his truck eating ice cream in the parking lot of a big shopping plaza. There is a department store, like Kohls, but not Kohls in the plaza. He tells me this story….

He says that there is a girl who works there who was “giving him the look” – insert 6th grade sex hand signal and weird clicking sound now--one night when he was shopping. It was close to closing time, so when the store closed, he hung out to see what she drove.  A couple days later, he goes back and her car is there. He goes home, shaves everything, puts on EXPENSIVE DESIGNER OUTFIT, and goes back. He said he parked in front of her car, lifted the hood and disconnected the plug wires. He pulled a few rows back and parked facing her car. He then waited for the store to close. People came out and drove away, but her car won’t start. He then tells me with a straight face that he got so hot watching her frustration that he came before he even got the lotion out. Think about that. He was going to jerk off watching her try to start her car. He said before he could approach her, a presumed boyfriend arrived, so he drove home and jerked off picturing her. 

I’m white as a ghost at this point. But what he says next is what got me…

Mark: People do it all the time. Nobody got hurt. It’s not like I would have just left her there alone. You really need to watch more porn. 

Me: Sorry, to me porn is like screwing the pizza guy and stuff

Mark: You said you wanted to get to know me better. This is a secret about me know body else knows. Not even lyingcheatingswampcrotchcumdumpsterwhore. And she and I were together for 5 years. I will always love her and I never told her that one thing that turns me on. You are special.

Now, all of you without psychology degrees out there are listing the sociopathic behaviors displayed in that one conversation. Those of you WITH psych degrees are doing it using bigger words. 

10+ years later, I’m back to the city that happened in. Promotion again!! Yay me!! I take my kid to get ice cream in that shop because kid and ice cream. The department store is out of business, but I will NOT cut across the big open part of that lot. Every once in a while, kid will say, just drive across, it’s faster. Chills.

I only have about 4 classes left, but I'm going part time, so I have about a year left.  My school doesn't offer any summer courses, so I'm trying to find some kind of extra credential that I can get that might make me more employable in the future.

I am interested in counseling, either Substance Abuse Counseling or for Eating Disorders.  I'm also interested in WIC, either someday working with WIC or maybe in a hospital setting.

Honestly, I have no idea what I'm doing, and the advisement center at my school doesn't have any appointments for a while.

I don't think I want to be an RD, simply because I'm not very competitive and it is so competitive to get an internship.  I also really just want to work already and I don't think I have the time to do an RD internship.

Since I'm getting a B.S., it's my understanding that I can take the DTR exam as soon as I graduate (no need for an internship).

Every other credential option I've found seems to be for specializations for RDs.  So I guess my question is, does anyone know of something I can do to add to my DTR (as opposed to an RD)?

I am really eager to start working.  I looked into Health Coaching and this school called the Institute of Integrative Nutrition, but after Googling around a bit, this ""Institute"" just seems like a scam.

I think I would be a really good Nutrition Counselor for someone who needs help, like someone with an eating disorder or someone who's had gastric bypass surgery.  Do you think I should try to get a second bachelor's degree or a minor in counseling?

As you can see, I am a bit overwhelmed and confused.

ANY advice is appreciated, even if it's just a search term.  I feel like crying, I'm so confused.  I'm almost 40 years old and I feel like a teenager.  If it's relevant, I live in the New York City area.  

Sorry this is so long.  Thank you in advance.

4j2lsj,0,2016-05-12,So I got fucked.,dropsolidbluepill,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/4j2lsj/so_i_got_fucked/,"**SUMMARY**: I got fucked. Badly. This post will contain the word fuck, a lot. Deal with it.
&amp;nbsp;

One year ago, after a dry spell of some months, I start hooking up with a girl from my dorm. Out of convenience, probably both of us.  This girl had red flags all over her. She showed me the meaning of a red flag. Now I can see the shit testing, the gas lighting, the exact moment where I stepped into her frame. 

Two months in our little shagging arrangement, she gets pregnant because of sloppy precautions. Even though she said everything was fine, **I should have fucking checked her on it**, but I never did. I 'trusted' her. Anyhow, she never got around to telling me (red flag) and I find out when setting our alarm on her phone. Luckily, she agrees to the abortion.

I vividly remember the doubt I had during that time. I was enraged at her for being so sloppy with my life, hers, and the fucking thing grewing inside her. I knew deep inside I had to bail on her, maybe she'd learn, **what kinda fucking obligation do I even have to 'be around' for her sorry *laissez-faire* ass?**

Anyhow, the bitch is living next door to me, together with all our friends, so my stupid sorry ass had no other option. I 'was around'. I was 'the guy doing the right thing'. I got so much shit flung my way from my friends **I even started fucking admitting I 'loved' her in front of everybody**, because here's the catch: every single relation in that circle started out like I did with that girl, and every single bitch in the circle was giving me non-intermittent shit about 'my intentions'. They can't accept their own ""love"" is fake, they don't realize their fucking boyfriends are just in it till college is out, they don't even realize THEY are fucking in it till college is out. Classic fucked up social dynamics at play.

She wants me to come to the abortion. I walk her to the building but don’t enter. Fuck that vibe, baby slaughterhouse for fucked up women who can't even take precautions. I sit there for over an hour, get fed up and go home to roll a joint. Finally relax a little, when she tells me to come get her. I go get her. We meet. Not a fucking word. Nothing. Bitch doesn't even look at my face. I walk with her for like, what, two minutes and then fucking bail the bitch because fuck her. **What the fuck does she even need me around for if she's not even gonna acknowledge my mere existence?**

So yeah, social dynamics and me being blue pill inclined gets you: we turned into ""a couple"". I cheated on her. Got caught one time with one of her best friends at a party I thought nobody was at. Guess what: massive shitstorm from all our friends AGAIN. Even though all these bitches know most of the boyfriends in the circle 'cheat', I was getting so much shit pouring over me, it was like somebody diverted the fucking Ganges over my head. 

I sure as fuck couldn't stand up for myself and face the social stigma, so I ""professed"" my love. ""It was a one time thing, it's just 'cause we've been friends a long time, I got a little confused, you know I love you, *remember what we went through*, etc."" From then on, I actually convinced myself I fucking loved this girl and there will not be a day in my existence, my fellow men, that I do not regret and deeply fear my actions. **I swallow the blue pill.**

By the fucking way: my dad hang himself when I was six. No brothers. Just me, my manic mother and my two younger sisters. No wonder it came to this. I never really went to college, I just enrolled to get people of my back. I am an autodidact with pretty solid skills in 3D visualisation, so I got out there and was able to provide for myself up until my business collapsed, due to a lot of reasons, the main one being: **I was depressed as fuck.**

So as we all move out the house where I swallowed my blue pill and we almost had a freaking child, I lose my business. It's getting fucking painful even typing this shit out but here goes nothing. I am forced to move in with this bitch, her parents pay the whole deal. I do nothing all day, every day. I just sit on my fucking ass and smoke weed. This kills the relationship. This kills the man.  All the while, she is preparing for an internship abroad, and I am frantically looking for a way out of the mess my life has become. In November I get a lucky break: I get a job at one of the leading visualization firms of my region. What do I do to celebrate this immense feeling of being in control? **What do I get for finally feeling good about myself?** Just a couple of days of being happy and I get pussy. I cheat on her again, I get caught again.

This time, we get ""banished"" from the group because people can't handle reality, just like me. I focus on my job. Commute is killing me, **I get 2 hours of free time which I have to spend with this major pain in my ass**. Her departure nears, I feel a huge relief coming off my shoulders, I get my own place, we say 'we're gonna see how it all turns out', she leaves, big party blabla. 

Not two fucking days after she's there, I step in her frame. **I don't know how she did it**, if I was too blind or scared to fucking see shit for how it really was, but I felt this massive obligation to 'be there for her', to 'be her guy', to 'help her', 'wait for her'. Through a fucking 6"" screen, she gets me to devote my life to her, 7000km away. 

You guys all know where this ends. She gets fucked big time, multiple times, boys and girls, everybody gets a go! She keeps lying to me for three months. Luckily, I started to see the light. I started taking mental notes. I started exposing her fucking lies and manipulation. I contacted people she's there with and turns out she even lied to them so she could have her own little cake and eat it too. A little attention goes a long way apparently but you don't eve get **anything** in return.

So I broke this bitch down, told her a little story about the reality we all live in, how our 'relation' really went down and how even she never loved me. Just like I never loved her. 

Her response? Total breakdown. She almost got on a plane back home. Once she found out her parents weren't gonna pay for it, she threatened to hurt herself. 

My response? Nothing. I dropped 'the circle'. I dropped 'her'. I have a fucking dream job and a whole new life waiting for me here. And **I will never again turn a blind eye towards reality**. 

If there is one mission in life, it is to **never stop looking at things how they really are**. 

If you don't like the look of reality, change it, don't adapt to it. 

Never bow down to society, I don't care if it's a Disney movie or your own fucking 'friends'.


I'm out.

**TLDR**: Social stigma can force your life, always go with your gut."

4j2nog,113,2016-05-12,To my fellow cold/misunderstood/lonely INTJs: An INTJ success story,underwhelmedcactus,intj,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/4j2nog/to_my_fellow_coldmisunderstoodlonely_intjs_an/,"It's great to have a place where similar people can share similar problems. But I want to point blank say that being an INTJ does not mean you're doomed to be lonely or misunderstood. 

I also want to put it out there that as an INTJ, you are fully equipped to tackle any problem, including being lonely or misunderstood. 

You just have to lose the self-loathing misunderstood act. 

I see it all the time here. And I've experienced it first hand in my own life. Ni to Se means that INTJs feel the most fulfilled when we are seeing our abstract ideas realized in the real world. Isn't that an amazing experience? When you're appreciated for your brilliance? When you can bend the world in some small way to your more logical system. 

But this is the real world, and getting that to happen is tough. Enter the self-loathing I'm so misunderstood act. 

""if only people would listen to me"" ""no one understands me"" 

I see it all the time here. (Not that it's the only thing here -- there's plenty of good stuff too, just addressing a certain type of post.) So many stories of INTJs who've received feedback from people that they're too cold and unemotional. And how they actually do have feelings but CLEARLY everyone else it just not INTJ enough to understand. 

But here's the truth: Almost every other type outnumber us. And if you're going to get anywhere, you're going to have to learn to talk to them and meet them half way on things. Understanding us is hard. You have to give them clues. 

I work at a firm where one of the Chief Officers is a INTJ. He had a corner office in a downtown skyscraper that's the size of my apartment.

But he started as an intern. Literally. He came in, and like most INTJs, he put on his headphones, didn't talk to anyone, aaaaaand then outperformed everyone. 

But outperforming everyone isn't how he got that office. Occasionally, he'd take off his headphones and let people know how he was getting the results he was getting. And when people asked him for help, he gave them help.

Then he got promoted. 

But it didn't stop there. Being a boss, and getting the authority to put your ideas into practice comes at a cost. He had to learn to talk to people even more. He had to learn to temper his Te Fi. 

So at this point he's a middle manager. Probably wasn't easy. 

They brought in a consultant who ran data on what people thought of themselves, and what people thought of their bosses. And he got a report back that said basically all the things we complain about here: too cold, too demanding, too logical. 

And you know what? He took that advice -- which let me tell you it's never fun to find out you're not as liked as you want to be -- he took the weekend to process the information and then he used the information and got better. 

That's how he got that office. That's how he gets to control a firm of almost a hundred people on the cutting edge of his industry. 

So while I understand, it's nice to get to vent to people. I'd say you need to, after your Fi has simmered down, think about how you can turn that advice into something good. 

If you're getting negative feedback from people, it's worth using your Ni Te to examine if your behavior is negatively affecting your life and your ability to achieve your goals. 

Yes, I have been called out like this. Yes, I know it really sucks to be asked to go against what you think your values are. But are your values really to not communicate to people? Or is accomplishing your dreams more important. Hack into your Ni and see what you really think the outcome of isolation will be. 

As for me, I made it a point to begin to smile and be nice to coworkers. I don't have to shoot the shit with them for an hour, but a little bit of warmth goes a long way. I asked my ENFP partner for ideas, and praise her warmly when they were good. 

Once I did that, BOOM promotion. Now in my not so big office -- which is really a desk in an open office layout -- I get my say on several things in my world. I get to make my own N ideas into an S reality. I'm happier, I'm better, I'm living a more fulfilling life. And people jokingly say I'm really direct now, instead of getting pulled into an office and scolded. 

If people are perceiving you as a cold psychopath / person with resting bitch face/ robot / weirdo -- then you need work to come across as the person you are, not this false image. 

You are responsible for how the world perceives you -- not the other way around. If you're waiting for the world to figure you out without giving them any clues, you'll be waiting alone in a dead-end job forever. 

tl;dr: Being an INTJ isn't an excuse for being unhappy. You can use your INTJ strengths to make you happy. Others have. "

I am currently Interested in working as a Intern at Companyname in IT, this is  because I have a strong passion to work as a IT technician, and also because like the individuals who work at your company I share their passion to work and grow as a team whilst maintaining professionalism.


I believe that the opportunity to work along side professionals in the IT industry, whilst learning and getting  paid for it is something that should be valued and appreciated by job seekers attempting to get into IT but also students seeking IT Jobs in the future, as it allows them to gain valuable work experience and skills needed to progress further in their career and through life.   

The reason I believe that I would make a good candidate for the IT internship is because I have voluntarily helped my friends and family with IT for the last 10 years, this has included, networking both wireless and wired and setting up of PC's and printers, I have also installed and troubleshooted software including operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office and also  antivirus software. 

Along with my voluntarily work experience in IT, I am eager to learn new skills and put them into use in a professional working  environment, in which I can progress further up the career ladder and hopefully end up working as a 2nd line IT technician as I would like to work closely with computer hardware in my career.  
 
Finally, I would like to say thank you for taking the time to read this, and I look forward to hearing back from you in the future.

I finished my sophomore year at a well-known Canadian university, and I just got rejected from the on-site interview from a growing startup in Bay area. As much as it is devastating to be rejected for 17th time for an intern position (especially this late in the game), I'm wondering if I should keep looking or not. 

I'm Japanese and so I applied to Japanese startups in Tokyo as a backup. I got two offers as a software dev intern, so at this point  I could go back and spend my summer there. The thing is, I would rather spend my summer in US since I fit much better culturally here than in Japan (also since working environment in Japan as a software dev is pretty shitty). It might be interesting to work in a foreign country, but the pay will be significantly lower than what I would make in US or in Canada.

Is it too late to keep looking for summer internships in US / Canada? Since this is my first summer with an internship and I'm mainly looking to gain some experience for next summer, should I stop being obsessed with working in US and just start working in Japan?

I have heard that in the software industry ""You can get a job if you can code well, period"". I've heard of many many people who have successful software engineering jobs without finishing any sort of formal higher education, as programming is rather easy to self-teach and practice at home compared to many other subjects (like, say, chemistry). 
My question is how do I know when I'm worth employing? I know how to use the features of c, c++, and python but I've never worked a ""real"" project. The biggest thing I've made is a (bad) one-level platformer in c++ on a team of 4. What steps should I be taking? Should I just make a github and fill it with random projects I create as I continue to learn? Should I just apply for jobs over and over as I continue to learn programming until someone hires me? Can I apply for the same job more than once or will they start ignoring me even if I improve? Should I try to master one ""type"" of software (like games or backend server stuff etc.) or try to have a wide variety of weaker skills to appeal to more places? I assume the first actual job I get will stem from an internship at a small company, so that's probably what I'll be looking for.

My wife has recently graduated with early and middle grades, and she's just spent the last semester as an intern teacher working several weeks at a few different schools. Naturally she's  looking for a full time position for this coming school year, and she's been putting in applications all around our area.

I want to make this clear, because I think it's an an important fact, the area that we are in is a very saturated job market for teachers and one of the worst areas in the country for teachers find work. 

My wife was born to teach, she's very bright and creative, and kids flock to her like Santa. She also won student teacher of the year at her college, and has received very high praise from the principals at the schools that she's worked at this year. 

Her scenario is strange mostly because teachers around this area don't usually have multiple options, especially first years.

She has been unofficially offered 3 jobs week. One in a higher paying County (Money), one in the lowest paying County (Poor) and one kind of inbetween (Mid). She has worked at Money and Poor, but knows nothing about Mid. However, Mid has scheduled her an interview this coming week and she's been told that she is possibly the only candidate they plan to interview. 

She really likes Money and Poor, and they both work with kids in bad neighborhoods, which she enjoys most. Neither of these schools even interview until mid June, and she isn't certain if the positions will even be renewed. It is a possibility that one or both positions will not be rehired.

If she taken the Mid job, how poorly will it be received if she is officially offered Money or Poor and chooses to take one of those jobs instead? The issue is mostly that we can't afford for her to turn down the Mid school and neither of the other two pan out.

Is this something that teachers do? And if so, what is the best way for her to go about it? Also, is it normal to negotiate pay or benefits?

The three following courses are the last I have to take for my CS minor (Cloud Computing, Web Programming, and Essential Computing for the Sciences). Although the school on requires these and 2 semesters of intro programing in Java I have also taken Object Oriented Programming and Design as I flirted with a double major for a bit. 

I should have all but the programming for the sciences courses under my belt before any internship interviews. My GPA is not stellar (about 3.0) and honestly my biggest concern is I don;t find myself to be a particularly good programmer. I can't recall much about how to go about using a BST or linked lists really. Is there some sort of online videos I could be watching or free classes I could watch to get a much better feel for those?

* Senior year (hopefully): AP Statistics, AP Biology, AP Chemistry, AP Physics 2, ASB, English 12, AP Economics/AP Spanish (see questions).

**Extracurriculars:**

* Did FIRST Robotics all 4 years of high school, will be the Team Captain this summer and senior year. Learned a lot about engineering and Computer Aided Design (Am design lead, and designed almost the entire robot this year in Solidworks). I also won the Dean's List Semi-Finalist award.

* Joined a Jewish youth group my sophomore year, where we volunteer in the community and generally help out the public. I have been in it since, and it has been absolutely fantastic. I have never documented the service hours with my school though. Also running for the president of the chapter next month.

* I ""productively"" procrastinate by playing piano, ever since I was 7, which is why I took Music Theory this year.

* Been a member of Junior State of America for 3 years; I went to the JSA Summer Camp at Stanford University before my Junior year and studied AP Government.

* Been in ASB (Student Council) for 4 years (2 in middle school 2 in high school).

* Likely getting a research internship this summer at a local college to research neuroscience and possibly Autism Spectrum Disorder.

**Essays:** I'm honestly swimming with ideas, but whenever I try to start on one it ends up going terribly. For my personal statement I'm planning on writing about family, and everything I have learned from them and how they've helped and developed me as a person. Every time I write though I feel it just sounds... wrong.

**Letters of Rec:** Great (I think), I'm going to get letters from my science and English teachers at my school. For the optional I'm (hopefully) going to get the lead mentor on my robotics team to write one. 

**Schools:** Stanford for REA (Dream since 7th grade), MIT, Yale, Caltech, really all the top science schools for general.

**Questions:** 

1) For my senior year, I have to take Economics (It's required by the school), however my Spanish teacher recommended that I also take AP Spanish my senior year. I don't have room in my planned schedule already, but since AP Econ at my school is a one semester course I was thinking of just taking it online over the summer and taking AP Spanish in the school year. What should I do?

2) Is there anything I could do to strengthen my application? Constructive criticism/suggestions welcome.

3) I feel the essays are the chance to really show what I've learned in my life, however I'm not that powerful of a writer ~~(24 Writing ACT)~~ . Any tips for the personal statement / supplement writing?

4) Does the lack of an official sport hinder me in anyway? I do swimming and mountain biking with friends occasionally but not anything competitive. Should I mention this on my app?

5) How was your day today? :)

Thanks for the help."

My gf of two years left me for another guy and lied and cheated in the process in December. I was sad, but more for the way she treated me than the actual leaving. Things did not improve from there. This all happened during finals week and my grades suffered and cost me my degree program as I was a few point short on one final. Part of me wanted to blame her, but I was more upset at myself than anything. I recovered pretty quickly with friends, but I spiraled down into a dark hole. My grandmother that is very close to me has rapidly been declining in health. Her ability to talk has been deteriorating from normal to unable to get a word out in a few short months and she has lost almost all mobility and requires constant attention. It was something that I knew was happening, but when I returned from college the reality of it set in and made my broken heart crumble because I no longer had that friend in my ex that I could confide in with the pain from seeing a loved one suffer. I almost killed myself, but I managed to pull out of it. I did the sterotypical moves. I hit the gym, reconnected with old friends and new, changed my degree program that actaully fits me better and landed a great internship. I moved on from my ex and have looked at dating. I have come to some terms of my grandma passing soon and I should be fine, but I don't feel right. I look back at the person I was and I see I am not the same anymore. I don't enjoy life like I used to. Im not the more fun goofy person I used to be. There's something always nagging at me and I cant figure out what it is. I should be happy and grateful for what I have but im not. My mind drifts back to ending myself and I dont know why. I think mainly of the guilt of my students loans on my parents whe it crosses my mind. I think I am depressed, but I dont shed tears, I just feel this emptiness and knowledge that something is wrong."

When Kaya went away to school in Texas, she liked to tell all her new friends about how the Oakdale was originally settled by vikings, and that's why most of it's inhabitants were tall and broad and blond. Obviously, Kaya wasn't descended from the same vikings, as she was a tiny redhead. However, that didn't stop her from feeling an immense amount of pride for her hometown.

Speaking of immense amounts of pride, though, Kaya had a rough time adjusting to Texas. Most of the students at her school were locals, and they liked to remind her that ""Everything is bigger in Texas."" In fact, the Sigma Nu fraternity loved to remind girls of the saying, and almost every party they threw used that as their theme. Typical frat boys, right?

Kaya tried to stay away from the greek scene and focus on her studies. She was hoping to land a summer internship as a research assistant for Mrs. Woods, her biology professor. Kaya went to every office hour, asked insightful questions during class, and aced every assignment. So she wasn't too surprised when Mrs. Woods approached her at the beginning of Winter Quarter and offered her the position. She was, however, shocked when she heard Mrs. Woods' stipulation: Kaya would only get the internship if she would agree to date the professor's son for the rest of the school year.

[Chris Woods](http://i.imgur.com/gkWHHI2.jpg) was, in his mother's eyes, a disappointment. He was a senior at the university and he would have failed out at least three times by now if his mother hadn't called in some favors from Chris' professors. But now, with graduation six months away, Chris was threatening to throw it all away again. He was president of Sigma Nu, and the fraternity had been getting progressively worse over the last few years. There had been incidents with hazing, serving alcohol to underage girls, and several unsubstantiated claims of sexual assault. Mrs. Woods decided that the only way to keep Chris from getting kicked out of school once and for all was to set him up with a sweet, quiet, small-town girl who might be able to exert a good influence on him.

What she didn't know about Chris, though, was that the fraternity wasn't a bad influence on him -- he was a bad influence on it. Chris had been the star quarterback in high school and somehow retained all of that ""jock swagger"" despite not playing any sports at university. That arrogance was multiplied 10x by his good looks and dazzling smile, and multiplied 100x by the blessing he had hanging between his legs. Chris, as his fraternity brothers liked to phrase it, could swing dick. His cock, 8.5 inches long, was at least an inch longer than anybody else in the school. Unsurprisingly, he was obsessed with sex, and had no problem finding willing participants since most girls had heard the rumors and the rest were able to catch an eyeful of his bulging shorts whenever Sigma Nu threw a party. 

And even though Mrs. Woods was mostly right about Kaya being a sweet, innocent, small-town girl, she had missed one key piece of information. Kaya had only slept with two boys in high school. The first was Eric, her boyfriend sophomore and junior year, who had gone off to Hollywood after graduation to pursue an acting career. The second was Ryan, her rebound after breaking up with Eric. Ryan also went off to Hollywood after graduation. Oh, and she almost forgot about Michael, but that doesn't count because it was on prom night. Actually, Kaya thought she'd seen something on facebook about Michael moving to Hollywood too. 

You see, nobody knew Oakdale's secret. Not Mrs. Woods, not Kaya, not even most of Oakdale's residents. But it turns out that about 60% of male performers in the porn industry came from a small county in Minnesota that was centered around, you guessed it, Oakdale. In addition to making the people of Oakdale rather large, it seems the viking genes had also made the men of Oakdale ... well ... rather large. Average penis size in Oakdale was nearly 9 inches, and in Kaya's limited experience, was closer to 10. So when she agreed to Mrs. Woods' offer, she had no idea what a disappointment she was in for. And more importantly, neither did Chris.

-------------------------------

The age-old tale of comeuppance, an overconfident jerk getting taken down a notch. I feel like whenever I post about size, I get requests from guys who want me to humiliate them and their small penis. But that doesn't sound like fun. I'd rather humiliate a guy who has a big penis and treats girls like dirt because of it. If he thinks that he's valuable just by virtue of having a big dick, I'd be happy to prove him wrong. I also think it would be more fun if Kaya's humiliation wasn't malicious, just naive. Of course, I'm also open to suggestions from you guys based on what you're into! "

4j50ns,2,2016-05-13,"[WP] You figure out how to travel through the 4th dimension and discover great pillars of fire coming from all of the stars, and below these great pillars is a terrible, terrible being.",Varafel,varafel,https://www.reddit.com/r/varafel/comments/4j50ns/wp_you_figure_out_how_to_travel_through_the_4th/,"Describing my current situation is proving rather difficult, as I can’t draw parallels between what I am… seeing? Imagining? Visualizing? Experiencing, I think. Because this is a universe of experiences, an infinite number of them. After the accident with the quantum disentangler - a pet project of mine which could, theoretically, translate a very small object into quantum data, transfer it across space-time instantaneously, and re-entangle it back to it’s original form - I’m not exactly sure where I am, whether it be a higher dimension or some inbetween plane of existence.

Life plays itself out before me, an infinite expanse of slices of *moments*, the moments of my life, everything I could have been, would have been, had been, may never be. Despite their infinity, I can process all of them at a moment’s glance. It’s like a movie I can stop, play, rewind, and dissect each infinitesimally small frame into its quantum components, a form of omniscience, you could say, but limited to *my* lifetime.

Regardless, all the strands end at the moment of the accident, regardless if at the time I was a physicist, an air force pilot in Mumbai, the president, or a corpse buried in the ground. I would find that concerning if I wasn’t so infatuated with the light approaching-.

It is everywhere, a vast pillar of pure, radiant *light* burning the tapestry of my life away. It reminds me of the warm sunlight on my back I felt as I kissed Annabelle in the field behind our houses for the first time, the inferno of the furnace as I toiled in the blacksmith of one of my others’ lives, of being lost in the Andean cave for three months, trapped desperate and hinging on death’s door, and seeing that glimmer of day at the end of the course. It consumes everything, it *is* everything. Basking in its glorious radiance.

And then, there was silence. And cold. I opened my eyes to see a being trapped under the pillar, which had sinewed to a thread as it departed my form, a being not of flesh, but of thought, of time. A bundle of experiences, just like my own, but mine were a pebble on a mountainside, a drop in an ocean, compared with the monolithic enormity of timelines contained within the creature. I watched as it brought its gaze to rest on me, the power of stars behind its eyes. If there was a God, this was it.

We did not communicate through language, or even thought, but with a sense of *sharing* of emotions and of timeline images. I queried if it was a deity. It laughed. Far from it, it said, soon enough your kind will be *my* gods.

How?

Already you have learned to enter my world, the true world. Soon enough more will follow, until you breed here like rodents, children in your handling of the past, present and future. All of reality will quake and tremble as the untempered vices of your people destroy this world.

It would never come to that, I relayed firmly. Once they see what it is like here, the underlying meaning behind our reality, understanding will soon follow. No one else knows how to get here. I will not share the secret, when I get back.

You fool, it pitied. You monstrous fool. You don’t even know why you have come.

It was an accident.

An accident! It laughed, the tragic weight of cosmic irony, of a sea of stars too bloated with power to live, either consuming themselves into singularities or erupting into cataclysmic supernovae, projecting from it. No, human, there are no such things as accidents.

I felt the breadth of my being slowly tugging towards the creature.

Even if what you say is true, and your reality follows the implausible course of never journeying into my land, I am still doomed. It may take a thousand years, it may take a million, but eventually the hearts of your kind will grow cold and spiteful towards my light, and clad me in a shell of iron, stealing my light. When that day comes, as that day has come for billions of us, spanning the breadth of the universe, when that day comes, I will truly die, my light and my vision cut off from my brethren. It is inevitable.

The tug grew stronger.

We cannot live without communion through the medium of your reality. Everything in this world is just an extension of that reality, infinitely vast, but tied down just the same to its foundations. Know me that in all my power, I cannot prevent these turn of events.

But I can prevent my own demise. A mortal shell, willing to trade their timeline with my own. Accidents do not exist, but the cosmos is full of bad jokes.

The tinge of power, an ocean of it, began to consume my being, as I felt my memories begin to burn away, replacing themselves with the slow, inexorable crawl of the creature’s.

I am not willing.

You cannot resist.

Dr. Ingstin’s body was cold and white, sprawled with his back against a counter, and several of his interns were trying to slap him back into consciousness. Emergency sirens could be heard in the distance, outside the lab’s walls, approaching closer. And then with a jolt, Ingstin convulsed, looked dazedly into the eyes of his concerned pupils, and smiled.

A terrible, terrible smile.

I graduated last year as an Information Science major from a solid university. I ended up going back to the company I interned with over two summers, doing specialist call center work. It's thankless but pays well, and I was sort of cool doing it at first because I figured it's an easy way up the ladder when most of the IT division knows I'm dependable from my internship work. Right now one of my old bosses is hinting that he wants to poach me for the network analyst group that he moved to... But it's got some bad hours (horrible shift rotation) and I'm already working an evening shift that kills my free time pretty bad.

After I've been asked for assistance with programming assignments a few times in the past month by friends and colleagues it made me realize just how much I enjoyed programming all throughout college and high school, and trying to learn Unity recently has been making me yearn for it. But I don't know what to do; outside of school I've never really had the chance to do programming work and that worries me.

Right now, I'm gunning for the higher-level systems architecture work that I assisted with as an intern; that side of IT interests me, along with human factors work and the psychological side of interfacing. It's a living and a good match for me, but programming is something I can do for **hours**.... I have ADHD but given an explicit end goal I find it easy to chug away at programs for hours with no issue and I enjoy it. (Gives me the same dorky endorphin rush that working on sudoku or picross puzzles do...) 

And yet, whenever I think about how I wasn't in a CS degree I feel awfully insecure about it. I know Java and SQL pretty damn well, and I've worked with Javascript, HTML/CSS and Objective C... But it worries me that my programming background was never really rooted in nitty gritty things like real attempts to optimize my code, and I worry I'd never make the jump because I don't have the advantages that my CS peers got.

So what should I do? I don't know what job would fit me best. I really do enjoy IT (while I'm not working with angry users...), but I feel like I'm missing what I loved most. Coming from an IT and not a CS background, am I missing too much to make coding a career? And if I enjoy programming in general, interfaces and human factors, databases and system architecture stuff, what would be a good fit for me if anything?"

Should I ask her to reconsider/meet with me again or should I try to find another psychologist within Kaiser to evaluate me?

**Full story**: Basically, my teachers have ALWAYS said I have been very gifted and ask the best questions in science classes, etc but ""if only I would apply myself."" Boy I love that one. I almost never did homework in elementary school, barely in middle school, failed english three times because I couldn't get myself to get through the readings, etc. In high school I took easy classes because I knew I was going to a community college and transfer from there and so I never really studied or anything for that. At community college, it really didn't require much studying and the homework (which I tried my very best to complete because I knew my future was riding on it) generally prepared me well for exams. I had a desk internship for 8 months during my time at community college and I couldn't stay at my desk for more than a few minutes at a time. I couldn't work on tasks at a steady pace. I would have to get things done absolutely as quickly as possible and then I'd feel like I needed a break. I would go make coffee, tea, or whatever I could just to get out of my desk and do something else. I could tell it didn't look good to others.

Well now I've spent a summer and two semesters at a top ranked public university and can't function properly with my academics. I always try to start papers, studying, etc early on so that I'm not cramming everything at the last minute but that's ALWAYS what happens. Every single paper I wrote was written the night/morning of with the help of a very unproductive all-nighter. One of them I didn't even get the page requirement. I just end up staring at the screen and googling some random thing that springs into my head or driving somewhere or doing something random that I think is really urgent. The studying is MUCH more intense here and I simply cannot get through the content that I need to study even once before the exam. Even an outline, I can't process the whole thing. It just won't go in my head without me losing focus and it's obviously very humiliating and irritating. 

Anyway, I called to see the psych first in December but got an appointment for March, then another for May and then another for the TOVA test (which with her sitting right behind me watching me did not make me feel like it represented my symptoms well at all). She asked me a ton of very specific questions about my childhood habits in school and at home and habits at work and everything and to my huge surprise, my history was absolutely LITTERED with examples of how my inattentiveness has hindered my progress in life. At work, at school, even with my family sometimes. She, as did I, appeared to grow more convinced that I had it, and she even told me at the end of our last session that she could tell I was very intelligent and that that can mask the signs of childhood ADHD until it surfaces later like in college when intelligence is not what you need to succeed and where being attentive for hours and hours is what you need. 

So she calls me today and says it doesn't seem like I have it. I was utterly speechless and shocked. I asked, well do I have anxiety, depression, anything that could be leading to this crazy inattentiveness? And she basically said nope, everything looks pretty normal. I am utterly stunned and can't understand how despite giving her hundreds of examples and a cohesive and completely true storyline that explains how it could go unnoticed for this long, that she tells me I don't have it. 

I am fully aware of the epidemic of college kids buying adderall from prescribed people to cram for exams and frankly, if I wanted to I know I could do that. But that's not what I'm after. I want to work with a psychiatrist and figure out what's best for **me**, not just for school but for being able to function more efficiently on a daily basis and for being able to feel like a normal person. I have never done drugs or even drank and I'm 20. I would absolutely never abuse the drugs in any way and simply want to be able to live my life in a productive manner. It's crazy to feel like you have to work so hard to prove yourself. I'm just truly stunned by her opinion. 

Would you ask for a more thorough evaluation or a reconsideration or something along those lines? Would you try to seek a second opinion? Has anyone had this experience? "

4j5uri,0,2016-05-13,Why college students and employers pursue internships as a path to future employment,PursueAsia1,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/4j5uri/why_college_students_and_employers_pursue/,"As thousands of college seniors wrap up final exams this month and head out into the working world, the job picture looks relatively bright.
That is especially true for those with internship experience, employers and researchers say.
A spring survey for job search engine CareerBuilder found that 67 percent of employers plan to hire recent graduates this year. That was up from 65 percent a year earlier and marked the highest level since 2007.
Separate research by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce estimates that nearly two-thirds of college students who finish a paid internship will get a job offer upon or even before graduation, while only about one-third of those without an internship to their credit are likely to have similar good fortune.
Brianna Rippin, a 20-year-old junior at Baldwin Wallace University in Ohio, is among the growing number of undergraduates recognizing early in their college careers that internship experience can complement their studies and give them an advantage in an increasingly competitive job market after graduation. Double majoring in economics and finance, Rippin started scouting out opportunities early in the school year before landing a prized gig this summer as a quantitative analyst intern at Progressive Insurance.
""I firmly believe that the completion of an internship is the No. 1 step an undergraduate student can take in order to obtain postgraduate success,"" Rippin said. The message she and other students get from future employers is that they are ""really interested in your ability to apply knowledge in a real-world situation.""
Indeed, employers say they increasingly view internships as prerequisites for many jobs. Many of them also view internships as an important way to make ties to top students they want to cultivate and potentially hire as full-time staffers after graduation.

""Firms like it because they can test out talent before they hire,"" said Kevin Jacques, a Baldwin Wallace professor who doubles as the school's finance chair.
'We want to make conversions'
Emily LeFevre, human resources director at Phillips Edison &amp; Co., supports Jacques’ assertion.
She said Phillips Edison, which provides redevelopment, leasing and management services for grocery-anchored retail centers, largely gears its internship program toward ""converting"" students into postgrad hires. Phillips Edison, which has offices in multiple major markets across the U.S., including Salt Lake City and Cincinnati, regularly works with several universities, including the University of Utah and a host of schools in Ohio.
""We want to make conversions,"" LeFevre said, adding that such hires can hit the ground running and are more likely to shine with the company. ""It's a huge part of our recruiting practice.""
She emphasized that meaningful work experience along with a college degree is “almost an expectation."" If graduates don't have that experience, she said, ""it's a huge question mark because it's just so standard.""
Danielle Brindisi, a 2014 University of Cincinnati grad and a former Phillips Edison intern, said her own experience mirrors LeFevre's assessment.

The 24-year-old political science major said a majority of the degree programs at her college required an internship before graduation and the school provided information and guidance early on. She started laying the foundation for an internship her freshman year. By her junior year, Brindisi was interning at Phillips Edison, with an emphasis on professional experience and the hope of opening the door for a full-time job.
Brindisi started out in the property management group, reviewing lease language for clients, and then later worked in the HR department. She found her niche in HR and eventually won a job there upon graduation. Now she has come full circle: She runs Phillips Edison's internship program.
Her experience sums up what many employers say they want to see develop from internships. ""It's a great way to start reaching out to people at a young age,"" Brindisi said, ""a great way to identify and connect with talent.""
Dylan Schweitzer, Enterprise Holdings' corporate talent acquisition manager, said the car rental giant shares that view. Enterprise runs a national internship program, hiring some 2,000 per year, aiming to make connections with possible future hires.

""It's a very big part of our recruiting program,"" he said.
An upward trend
Among 2015 bachelor's degree graduates, 65 percent took part in an internship or cooperative education assignment, according to a nationwide survey of college students by the National Association of Colleges and Employers.
That marked the highest level since NACE started keeping tabs in 2007.
Separate research from NACE shows that the so-called conversion rate of interns to full-time employees topped 50 percent a year ago, up from about 35 percent a decade earlier.
NACE research associate Kenneth Tsang said conversion is likely to continue to be a primary focus for employers. NACE members increasingly report that they want new hires to have on-the-job experience, and many say they view internships as a way to ensure that experience is meaningful to their companies.
""It's no longer just something nice to have,"" Tsang said of internships. ""It's almost a minimum requirement"" to get hired.

He added that paid internships are not only coveted by students for obvious reasons, but they also are widely viewed by employers as far more valuable credentials for job applicants. The thinking, he said, is that the best students migrate to paid opportunities.
The 2015 NACE survey found that more than 60 percent of interns/co-ops were paid. Nearly 78 percent of private, for-profit companies paid their interns. NACE research shows the average intern earned $17.20 per hour in 2015, Tsang said.
Tsang summed up the message college students increasingly are taking to heart: ""An internship has to be a top priority.""

4j5ywi,4,2016-05-13,Will I Improve?,TaxPayer942521,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4j5ywi/will_i_improve/,"Hello friends,

today I sat an online quiz for an internship, it consisted of two questions and I'm fairly sure I ballsed it up.

I had an hour and a half to answer these two questions, the first was finding a word in a grid that was given to me as a list of strings. The words could be found going up, down, left or right.

I;m fairly sure I got this question, although I may not have done it optimally, still it took me a lot of time.

The second question involved finding the largest sum of 600 consecutive numbers in a list of 10,000 numbers. I am confident I submitted a completely wrong algorithm and I ran out of time at this point anyway.

My question is this, I am a third year software engineering student who has been coding for approximately a year and a half now. I have sat the main computer science paper my university offers and am halfway through its algorithm paper. The rest of the papers in my degree will be coding based, but I do not think any of them will help me answer questions like the ones mentioned above. Will I get any better at these kinds of questions? 

For example next semester I'm taking AI, humans and computers, a software engineering project paper and a network security paper. I don't see how any of these papers will improve my ability to solve problems like the ones mentioned earlier.

Are some people simply more gifted at coding? And have I started to find my 'potential limit' now that I've started to master the basics. Or will more time exposed to code help train my brain to think more optimally?

Thanks.





tl;dr

- sat a coding quiz today
- messed up
- worried i wont improve anymore no matter how much code i write"

4j6f5g,193,2016-05-13,"[Pics] 24/f, 5'10, 55 lbs gone, mental health gains",immaslapu,keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/4j6f5g/pics_24f_510_55_lbs_gone_mental_health_gains/,"Hey guys! I'll try to keep this brief but will probably fail. 

First off, http://imgur.com/a/OJa8T

I have been overweight all my life. I went on my first diet when I was 11 years old (weight watchers) and have yoyo dieted most of my life. About 4 years ago I lost a lot of weight extremely quickly by calorie counting. Unfortunately it became very obsessive for me and I developed a binge eating disorder. I struggled for a long time and stopped binging mainly because I was just eating like shit again in general and I gained back almost all of the weight I had lost. 

About a year ago I started an internship in my field and knew I was going to have a lot of spare time compared to student life so I decided to join a crossfit gym. In the first 3 months I ate ""healthy"" and lost 15lbs. When my loss started to slow my coach recommended I give keto a shot. I was totally against it but agreed to commit to one month of it. 

9 months later I'm still going strong. I absolutely love this diet and it has been incredible for my relationship with food. I did lazy keto until about January and when my progress slowed I calculated macros and started estimating calories. I don't count extremely strictly from fear of becoming obsessive again, but it's working very well for me. I no longer feel like I'm a slave to food and I do 16/8 IF every day to keep my appetite in check. I haven't had an urge to binge... Ever on this diet. I see this as a way of life and plan to continue to eat this way forever. My internship ends in August and then I'll be heading back to school for my final year and will be replacing crossfit with Stronglifts. 

So in short I have gone from 229 lbs to 172lbs in the last year with keto and crossfit. My goal weight is 155 and I'm hoping to hit that by the end of the year. 

Thanks so much to this amazing community for all of your support! Couldn't have done it without you guys. "
4j6m3d,4,2016-05-13,Is it too late to get into CS from IT? (xpost r/advice),throwayayaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4j6m3d/is_it_too_late_to_get_into_cs_from_it_xpost/,"Hey guys- I need some perspective on what my skills are worth. Got a suggestion to post here from r/advice.

I graduated last year as an Information Science major from a solid university. I ended up going back to the company I interned with over two summers, doing specialist call center work. It's thankless but pays pretty well, and I was sort of cool doing it at first because I figured it's an easy way up the ladder when most of the IT division knows I'm dependable from my internship work. Right now one of my old bosses is hinting that he wants to poach me for the network analyst group that he moved to... But it's got some bad hours (horrible shift rotation) and I'm already working an evening shift that kills my free time pretty bad.

After I've been asked for assistance with programming assignments a few times in the past month by friends and colleagues it made me realize just how much I enjoyed programming all throughout college and high school, and trying to learn Unity recently has been making me yearn for it. But I don't know what to do; outside of school I've never really had the chance to do programming work and that worries me.

Right now, I'm gunning for the higher-level systems architecture work that I assisted with as an intern; that side of IT interests me, along with human factors work and the psychological side of interfacing. It's a living and a good match for me, but programming is something I can do for **hours**.... I have ADHD but given an explicit end goal I find it easy to chug away at programs for hours with no issue and I enjoy it. (Gives me the same dorky endorphin rush that working on sudoku or picross puzzles do...) 

And yet, whenever I think about how I wasn't in a CS degree I feel awfully insecure about it. I know Java and SQL pretty damn well, and I've worked with Javascript, HTML/CSS and Objective C... But it worries me that my programming background was never really rooted in nitty gritty things like real attempts to optimize my code, and I worry I'd never make the jump because I don't have the advantages that my CS peers got.

So what should I do? I don't know what job would fit me best. I really do enjoy IT (while I'm not working with angry users...), but I feel like I'm missing what I loved most. Coming from an IT and not a CS background, am I missing too much to make coding a career? And if I enjoy programming in general, interfaces and human factors, databases and system architecture stuff, what would be a good fit for me if anything?"

However, it seems that even the junior roles ask for several years **experience**.

I have been told before that these experience requirements can often be exaggerations, but I am not sure what the minimum experience would be then for these roles.

I have taken a course in my final semester that focused entirely on Hadoop, and my final project from this course is the only **hadoop-related project** on my resume.  

Also, I have 5-6 other projects not related to hadoop or distributed computing/big data on my resume, but I **do not have any internships**. My **gpa is 3.4** from an average state school with a well-funded CS program. 

With all of this in mind, should I be able to secure one of these junior hadoop-related software developer roles? Or do I need more projects relating to hadoop? "
4j6t27,3,2016-05-13,My 24 [F] boyfriend 31 [M] wants me to consider moving far away from home for his potential job.,5796,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4j6t27/my_24_f_boyfriend_31_m_wants_me_to_consider/,"My boyfriend and I just graduated from college and we are looking for jobs. We have been together for 3 years living together for 6 months and we are very happy together. We plan on staying together and eventually getting married. 

We both completed internships with excellent companies during our schooling that we enjoyed. While I have been eagerly applying to as many jobs as possible (including waiting for  a position to open up at the company where I did my internship) he has looked at a couple postings too but applied to none. His internship was in a city that is 6 hours away that has very few job prospects outside of the utility that he worked for. He wants to call them and ask about jobs. He wants me to strongly consider coming with him if he is offered a job.

Here is my concern. I have a very rare disease (eosinophilic esophagitis along with inflammatory bowel disease). Where I live, I am getting the best medical care possible in my province (and possibly country) with experts in these specific diseases. My diseases require lots of colonoscopies and upper endoscopies in order to monitor the disease status. I have a VERY restricted diet (ordered by my doctors) and find it difficult to maintain adequate nutrition at times. 

In the city he wants to move to I would not be getting any where near the same level of medical care seeing as they don't have clinics or specialists knowledgeable in my disease. The food choices are also more limited (fewer grocery stores that sell food that adheres to my diet). I am 90 lbs and I can't afford to lose more weight due to not being able to consistently find the right food.

My second concern is the toll this move would take on me emotionally. Last month one of my closest friends died in an accident and I still feel very fragile emotionally. I am very close to her family and find HUGE comfort in seeing them every week. My very best friend has a serious illness (cystic fibrosis) which leaves her in very fragile and precarious health too. Me and her have a very close (sister like) relationship and we help each other through all our appointments, through our shared grief from the accident and other life events.

 I can't imagine moving away from her and not being there for her when she is ill and not having her hugs and in person support. I also have a very close relationship with my mother who has expressed that she would be sad if I moved. I am already very depressed and the support I have here help me function.

I also recently joined a band with people I have been jamming with since high school (I am passionate about music as a hobby). I am thrilled at the opportunity to re-ignite those friendships and record music with them. I have really only one friend (my best friend mentioned above) and this will be a good opportunity to get out more and cultivate friendships. However, I know if I move I will have to quit my position in the band.

Between all these things mentioned above combined with the lack of jobs for me in this new city I can't see myself being happy there. In fact I would be absolutely devastated/depressed that I have to give up seeing the people I love (who I constantly worry about) and the chance to join a band as a hobby again. I also worry about getting adequate healthcare there. My boyfriend wants me to keep an open mind and try it even if I remain unemployed (or under employed) there due to the lack of jobs. His job would pay very well (60k to start) and he said he could support me if necessary. 

However, I find that city very isolating and unlivable due to poor public transit, need a car to get every where (which I don't have) and the lack of things to do (no music scene, deserted streets, very rural feel). I don't want to sit at home alone all day waiting for job opportunities to pop up. 

He wants me to think about giving the city a chance even though I hated it when I used to visit him during his internship. To top it off, housing and rent prices are very high. We had a fight over it and I cried a lot. The outcome was that if I truly insist it's unlivable he wont take a job there even if it's offered right now but in 6 months if we are still jobless he will want me to consider it again.

 I feel like a terrible manipulative person for wanting him to turn down a good job because of me but he doesn't want us to live apart at any cost. I know this job is best for him and would allow him to expand himself and earn good money. I also know that there are good jobs closer to where we live too. I am torn and feel like a shitty girlfriend for not wanting us to move for this job?



   
tl;dr Am I being unreasonable?"

4j6ylf,3,2016-05-13,[M4F] Vanilla Never Tasted Sweeter!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4j6ylf/m4f_vanilla_never_tasted_sweeter/,"Hey there DPP!

**INTRODUCTION**

My name is Andrew, 28 year old professional from New York. I am 6'5, 220 pounds, blonde hair, blue eyes, with a strong build and broad, muscular shoulders. My hard outer appearance is contrasted sharply and juxtaposed by my sweet tender inside and penchant for kindness.

I share a deep affinity for story-telling and writing in general and my past prompts and posts have usually tried to demand a higher level of grammar, imagination, detail and literacy in the responses as I feel that's the best way to keep a story alive and fresh and prevent it from becoming stale or having either side decide they may as well just watch some porn.

I've been posting on DPP for a long time and today I am in the mood for something a bit more vanilla as I hope to engage a more diverse population of those individuals who frequent this lovely sub-reddit. I've been seeing some especially great prompts recently and want to make sure I'm not alienating anyone by requesting the same prompts/kinks.

**PROMPTS**

I've narrowed down my prompt ideas into separate categories, each with their own plot lines and twists and can incorporate other ideas as well and are all up for discussion!

**(1)NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR**

I've just moved in to town from the high powered life of New York City as an attorney working in Manhattan. I've grown tired of the constant hustle and am looking for a more small-town feel. I've gotten a job at the local law firm, a boutique operation specializing in real estate closings and is more in line with the slower pace I hope to find. You have been living in the small town of Paradise Springs your whole life and are intrigued at the new neighbor that you have. We spark a conversation and begin a slow and gentle courtship.

**(2)THE CO-WORKERS**

Similar premise to the above prompt, only we have been holding on to a work friendship for nearly three years now. Always amiable to one another, we never really felt any kind of emotional spark together, just a simple friendship between two people who understand each other. Perhaps one of us goes through a particularly harrowing time (i.e. a breakup, death in the family, etc.) and relies significantly on the other for support, where a new tenderness seems to blossom.

**(3)THE ANNIVERSARY**

This one would center around a pre-existing romantic relationship and be premised upon a one year anniversary, perhaps even six months or something of the like to mark a very special time in a budding new love affair.
Long-time lurker here and have finally decided to put my ""hat in the ring"" so to speak and try my hand at roleplaying and seeing if I can get any quality responses and to return the favor!



**(4)OFFICE AFFAIR**

The office affair with some kind of added twist. You could be my boss, peer, secretary or intern but we are both married and over time the sexy innuedos and flirting get taken further and further as we both realize we don't get what we want at home. But there's more to you than meets the eye. You decide what it is! 

**(5)THE ELEVATOR**

The woman in the elevator. Weeks have gone by and at least twice a week I ride the elevator up with you. It's the best 60 seconds of my day. My god you're gorgeous and you always give a crooked smile when I get on. And that little hair flip as you tell me to ""Have a nice day!"" when I get off the elevator knowing I've been checking you out. But one day the elevator is overly crowded and we are pushed against each other and I just can't stop myself from getting hard and you feel it against your ass...

**(6)INCEST**

Mom/sister drama queen. You're always the damsel in distress and every time you come to me over something petty and annoying but I know you rely on me quite heavily and I'm always there for you. But this time it's serious. You're going to have to hide out with me in my apartment for who knows how long. And that sexual tension that's been there since I was 12... surfaces and I have to try and deal with you getting a little too close when my mind is else where. 

I've written much longer prompts before that are more specific and if you wanted to check those out by all means please do. I really want to find a long term roleplay partner but I understand we have to be able to connect for that to happen. 

**KINKS**

My favorite kinks are: 

* Vanilla/Romance
* Anal
* Facials
* Blowjobs
* Cuddling
* Kissing

PM me and let me know what you'd like to try and if there is anything you would like to change or add to any of the prompts. I really enjoy having my partner have equal say in the set up and role of characters! 

I can't wait to talk to you soon!

4j753b,4,2016-05-13,[F4A] The Basic Protocol,CrowmeatDPP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4j753b/f4a_the_basic_protocol/,"""War"" may be a bit of an exaggeration, but anyone who claims that Western society is living in racial harmony has their head buried in the sand. Just turn on the news, the US, Europe, it's the same story everywhere. It's not anyone's fault, really- we're genetically designed to associate with those like us. But we're also designed to compete and conquer...

Let's introduce the Black Broadcast Capitalist Enterprises. International underground firm that is part of almost every market imaginable. News broadcasting, commercials, auctioning, farming, construction, law, politics, the film industry, sports... Everything. Though they always have cover-ups, ghost companies used to hide them from true sight. Most of the world has slowly been taken over by BBCE, and now they control enough to start moving.

Nearly every employee for the BBCE and their underling companies is of African descent, and the ones that aren't are very attractive white girls. Well, they weren't very attractive white girls at the start, but the BBCE works in the research industry and the cosmetic industry, and also the plastic surgery industry. They are very attractive now. Though they don't date, they deny any man that talks to them. Apart from a black man. And then if a girl talks to them, well, they'll introduce them to that high-paying secretary job at BBCE, and the cycle continues...

Now, however, they can start their original goal. To make the Black Race supreme. They've always been working towards this goal. Money is funneled into interracial porn productions, sent as child support payments to Black men and the women they breed, used to fund tuition for Black students to attend historically white colleges and universities and support the propaganda spewing Tumblr blogs they write filled with smut. In fact, BC Enterprises is the largest source of funding for the advancement of the Black race the world has ever seen- and it's working. Only, they are ready to launch a new initiative.

the Basic Protocol. Designed to target basic white girls, ones that are cute and the ones that are stunningly hot, the goal is that by the end of the year, nearly every white girl will dream of BBC stretching them out and being filled with the superior sperm. Of course, that takes time... And testing. If people suddenly get suspicious of the copious amounts of interracial porn that they can watch, targeted towards them in particular... No, the BBCE got to where they are now by patience and waiting. They were slaves by these stupid white men, now they'll enslave them. Only, they won't realize they are being enslaved until all their women are breeding black children and every job is taken by the superior black race.

The BBCE control everything, as mentioned above. And when I say everything... I truly mean everything! Every market, every business, everything is managed and monitored. If the BBCE want a famous celebrity to go black, for example Kim Kardashian... They start to influence her. Replace her friends' thoughts and let her friends convert her. Whisper in her ear. And then they put down their hand-made celebrity Kanye West to sweep in and finish the job. Now, millions of teens on instagram look up to Kim, and her sexy black husband...

This is only an example. The first step to the project is to pick a fresh target. I am sure that you boys can find a nice picture of a pretty girl who is ready to be tested and moulded into her ideal image! Then, the influence begins. Start replacing boys in her school with black ones, have her watch her crush get beaten up by a gang of muscular black guys. Surround her with pretty black men and... Her friends. Her friends will be converted in advance, on a more... Enhanced version of the protocol. Sped up. Her friends already love black cock and eagerly work for BBCE. They giggle and point out things like how much bigger and more dominant black men are...

And then they steer it towards sexual conversation. Is it true that black men are bigger? Is it true that once you go black, you can't go back? Stuff like this. Questions that keep our target up at night, pondering about them... At this point, we'll begin to convert her family. Take the men of the house out, her brothers and father, replace them with a new black step-father. This is a long process, but the black agent who will play as the step-father will begin to play subliminal messaging and hypnotic videos that are disguised as films. Ones that get her horny as the sex scenes get steamier, the ones that make her close her eyes at night, but not for sleeping.

Then we amp it up after a few weeks of this. After this amount of time, she's into black guys. But still into whites... And that can't do. We'll make her give a BJ or have sex with a white guy and his tiny penis, and then afterwards, a few days later, have her accidently walk into her step-father, or maybe find a beefed out black guy in the gym showers... Maybe asked on a date from the basketball player in school. And they'll get it on, slowly but surely.

She should have her first black cock within two weeks of amping it up. Then, we give her more black cock, and tiny white cock as well. From there, she'll make her choice. We'll get her addicted to the stunning pleasure of BBC, and then the BBCE will give her an internship at one of their prestigious offices, far away from her family. There, they'll pump her up into an airheaded bimbo secretary and... Rinse and repeat. Until they get the formula for the Basic Protocol down.

Then... They can release it upon the world.

---

The best message to me would be starting off the roleplay by writing about one of the girls. You'll play any man that comes up, and the world and how it reacts to the Basic Protocol, but also about the brainwashing and the effects it has on the four girls! So mentioning how they find themselves thinking about black men... Stuff like that. I'm more likely to ignore you if you don't write a response to the roleplay and get stuck in straight away, just because I can see your writing talent and whether we'll be a good match! "

4j7a39,3,2016-05-13,Network Systems Engineer?,Cernerthrowaway29,cerner,https://www.reddit.com/r/cerner/comments/4j7a39/network_systems_engineer/,"I was told during the on-campus interview that Cerner is in need of good network guys even though the title I was applying for was clearly Systems Engineer. I saw a review for “Network Systems Engineer” on Glassdoor which got me thinking about all of this. From what I’ve gathered, there seems to be 4-5 different parts of the company in which Systems Engineers are placed. Is Network one of them? Based on what my interviewer said, 60-70% typically are placed into the working on the back-end servers (unix/linux) and working with clients to maintain them.


I was also able to confirm that this role had more emphasis on working on the server/systems side by reviewing the job description + responsibilities through the Systems Engineer posting (Brassring), LinkedIn, and various reddit posts on here. Shoutout @hellgiver, you have been very helpful in helping me get an idea of the day-to-day.


I certainly have no problem learning a new side of infrastructure. I’m always looking for a new challenge and enjoy learning different technologies. But if at all possible, I’d like to continue pursuing my long-term goal of becoming a CCIE and continue working with network infrastructure. The opportunity to work on a cloud-service environment sounds very exciting to me. I have experience in a medium-large environment that I gained during an internship as well as my CCNA R&amp;S. I am also an incoming graduate. 


I’ve found a recent job posting on Brassring that seems to be very aligned with my current skills, goals, and interests.
https://sjobs.brassring.com/TGnewUI/Search/home/HomeWithPreLoad?PageType=JobDetails&amp;jobId=297945&amp;partnerid=25754&amp;siteid=5095

So my questions are: 

1. Would it be feasible to get a rotation on a team like this early on in my career at Cerner as a Junior Professional? Even though the title I applied for was Systems Engineer?
2. If so, would I most likely work within CWx or CTS? The interviewer mentioned most network-focused jobs are CTS but I saw a comment on here somewhere talking about CWx Infrastructure. Not sure what the difference between those are.
3. I’ve heard that CWx provides associates with great career advancement opportunities. Is CTS similar in this way? How are they different?


That's all I can think of right now. I hope I have been thorough enough to get my point across. Any feedback is helpful and I appreciate anyone that took the time to hear me out. Thank you."
4j7a3y,20,2016-05-13,How I landed 2 hospital CF offers / Advice!,JW_about_everything,slp,https://www.reddit.com/r/slp/comments/4j7a3y/how_i_landed_2_hospital_cf_offers_advice/,"So it's commonly known in this field that those hospital CFs are so difficult, if not impossible to come by. To that I say NAY - it is not easy, but it is ABSOLUTELY possible to land these positions, as I have received two offers from different hospitals (in acute neuro rehab, specifically). Granted, if you do not have experience in the setting of the job for which you apply, you may not have such luck. For example, I had an acute rehab internship. I applied to some acute care positions, and had no luck even landing interviews. All of my interviews / offers came from similar acute rehab hospitals. 


So, here is my BEST advice for grad students / CF seekers looking to get into the medical world!


* If you know there is a specific setting (acute care/acute rehab) you want to work in, the absolute best thing you can do is to have an internship in that particular setting. The clinic director at my graduate program was AMAZING at setting us all up with internships that aligned closely with out clinical interests/future aspirations, so I was very lucky in that regard. If you cannot get an internship in the specific setting you want, it will certainly be more difficult to land a CF position in that setting, but you can always observe/volunteer/do a number of other things that will benefit you.


* Around February/March-ish, start contacting hospitals to see if they are open to hiring CFs. I spoke with a lot of HR reps and therapy directors. Some will straight up tell you that they don't take CFs, some will. Keep tabs on those hospitals that ARE open to taking CFs, and get back in touch with them regularly to inquire about availability of positions.


* When you're searching for jobs on Beyond, Indeed, Glassdoor, or whichever job search engine you choose, do NOT limit your search to include ""CF,"" ""CFY"" ""Clinical Fellowship,"" etc. For both hospitals that offered me jobs, it was NOT specified in the posting that the position was for a CF - they said things like ""CCC's required but strong CF candidates are encouraged to apply,"" or ""Candidates completing CF will have on-site mentorship"" - so read the fine print, and call to inquire if you're uncertain! 


* Be VIGILANT (but not annoying)! If there is a position you apply for and REALLY want, you need to SHOW them that. Chances are, your application is one among many, and regardless of how qualified you are, it may fall between the cracks if there's no follow up expression of interest. For the job that I have accepted, I was REGULARLY in contact with the therapy director before/after my interview - it was a fairly stretched out process, so it showed that my interest was high throughout. 


* This isn't something that is typically done in this field I believe, but put together a portfolio! I did, and all my interviewers were all very impressed by it. I put together one that I keep, and to all interviews I put together another to let them keep. I used resume paper, page protectors, and tab dividers to section things off. In my portfolio, I included my resume, cover letter/letter of interest, professional references, LORs, undergrad and graduate transcripts, Praxis score sheet, CPR certification, and a few work samples that were relevant to my interests/the position (Papers, PowerPoint presentations, self-made assessments/documentation logs, etc). 


* Regarding your interviews, PREPARE! Know what your clinical strengths and weaknesses are, be prepared to discuss certain patients/experiences that were both successful/challenging and why, explain why you got into/love this field, etc. In EVERY interview, I was asked the dreaded/horribly open-ended ""Tell me about yourself!"" so definitely prepare how you'd answer that as well. Also, do your homework and research the facility and staff members who are going to be interviewing you. This could significantly set you apart from other candidates, and REALLY shows you're interested. 


Best to everyone, I am happy to answer any questions you may have :)"
4j7alf,0,2016-05-13,(Spoilers Everything) What does the Red God Want?,OhThatsRich88,asoiaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/4j7alf/spoilers_everything_what_does_the_red_god_want/,"I'm out of school right now, and I have a couple of weeks until I start my internship. Instead of being productive, I thought I'd come on here and BS with my favorite sub about our favorite books (and TV show?). It is my goal here to be thorough while avoiding the wall of text and constant repetition of my point. If you would like me to elaborate, please let me know. If you have a correction, speak up. I will add it and credit you.

The main assumption that I am making here is that there is a hierarchy in the religion of the Red God. We know that Thoros was ""sent"" to convert Robert, though he failed. The fact that someone in the religion had the authority to send him indicates that actions by Red priests/priestesses coordinated by this hierarchy. Probably not the details of it, but they are setting what they want to happen in motion. Because of this, whether the Red God doesn't necessarily need to exist, just the magic of the R'hellor's order. For the purposes of this post, the will of the Red God and the will of the religion's hierarchy are interchangeable.


There seem to be _____ main players that the Red God is using.

1) Thoros- Thoros was sent to convert Bobby B. Though he failed it is possible that he wasn't meant to succeed. He brought Beric back from the dead, which led to the creation of LSH.

2) Melisandre- Mel made every effort to get Stannis on the throne, but failed. We are told in AGot (Tyrion IX) that Stannis was ""brining a shadowbinder from Asshai."" This doesn't fit in with what we know about Stannis. He wasn't religious at all before Mel brought him on, and even then he seemed to view the Red God as a means to an end, rather than being a full-throated, pious believer. I believe that Mel was sent there, just as Thoros was, without being requested.

Mel's visions in the fire cause Stannis to make a big strategy change, and it completely alters the course of the War of the Five Kings. Right after the Young Wolf sneaks around the Golden Tooth and kicks some Lannister ass, Tywin begins taking his forces West to defend Lannisport and Casterly Rock. Renly is marching toward King's Landing with about 100,000 troops, the Dornish aren't going to fight to defend KL, and the city is starving, riots are taking place, including actual violence against the King and his crew. KL is ripe for Renly to pluck out of the hands of the Lannisters. Then Melisandre steps in:

Davos II, ACoK
&gt;Melisandre told me that if I went to Storm's End, I would win the best part of my brother's power, and she was right.""

&gt;""B-but,"" Davos stammered, ""Lord Renly only came here because you had laid siege to the castle. He was marching toward King's Landing before, against the Lannisters, he would have—""

&gt;Stannis shifted in his seat, frowning. ""Was, would have, what is that? He did what he did. He came here with his banners and his peaches, to his doom . . . and it was well for me he did. Melisandre saw another day in her flames as well. A morrow where Renly rode out of the south in his green armor to smash my host beneath the walls of King's Landing. Had I met my brother there, it might have been me who died in place of him.""

(I think what she actually saw was Stannis being defeated by the Boltons below the walls of Winterfell, but that's just a side note and beside my point.)

Stannis' actions stopped Renly from taking KL. I believe that if things had followed their current course, Renly would not have broken his forces against the walls of KL the way Stannis did. He had shown that he wasn't in a hurry to bruise his ass sitting on the iron throne. He could have camped outside of KL and done battle with Tywin outside the city if the Lannisters decided to face the beseiging force (as they did with Stannis). Or he could have left 20,000 troops to seige the city and taken the other 80,000 to destroy the Lannisters. What would Robb have done? He and the Northmen had no fight with Renly. I have no reason to think that they couldn't find some common ground, and work together somehow. My guess is that with the Lannisters defeated, Robb would bend the knee and probably maintain the title King in the North, but still pay homage to Renly. 

Boom, war is over before Winter comes.

But this isn't what the Red God wants. For some reason (s)he wanted Renly to fail, so Stannis, in a dream and through a shadow, kills Renly the night before the battle. I believe that the Red God isn't siding with Stannis, just giving him what he needs to further the cause of the Red Order. Just like Thoros thought he was supposed to convert Bobby B but ended up serving a different purpose (indirectly bringing around LSH), I think that Mel was sent to create chaos and get the Wildlings behind Jon.

That brings me to my second point.

I believe that the Red God uses people to fulfill her/his purpose, and then when (s)he is done with them, they are left out to dry. Stannis is a great example of this. Out of all of the five kings, Stannis is the only one who showed any interested in preserving the Night's Watch. Stannis' defeat at KL left him desperate to find support, but he also felt that it was his duty as king, despite the chaos, to protect the realm from Wildlings. So, he sails north and saves the NW from a wildling invasion when all appears lost. His intervention may have even saved Jon's life for all we know. Jon was beyond the wall treating with Mance when Stannis and his men storm in against them. This brings Mel to the North. She is now in position to bring Jon back from death, giving the Wildlings a new leader, and giving Jon an army. Now that  Stannis has fulfilled his purpose in their  plan, the Red Order stops giving helpful guidance, and Stannis is defeated at Winterfell.

At this point in the story in the show we have three groups being led by R'hellor, or that were created by the actions of a Red Priest/Priestess, sent by the Red Order.

1) The Brotherhood without Banners, led by LSH (or Beric, in the show).

2) Jon and his Wildling army. I'm going to assume that Mel comes along, since she can't exactly stay in KL. Even if she doesn't, or if she dies, this army only exists because of the actions of Stannis, guided by Mel. It is very likely that without her intervention the NW would have been destroyed in Mance's attack upon the Wall.

3) The Faceless Men. Jaqen H'ghar tells Arya that the three names she must give him are offerings to the Red God. The bathing ceremony that Mel performed on Jon was also very similar to the one that we see in the House of Black and White. I strongly believe that their one God, death, is R'hellor.

I doubt that these groups are meant to fight each other, or oppose one another. They each currently have a Red Priest(ess) among them (assuming the leaders of the House of B&amp;W are priests of R'hellor), which will likely influence the decisions of their leaders.

Final thought:

The three groups that we know use magic are the Red Order, White Walkers, and the Children of the Forest. One represented by fire, another by ice, and the final by trees, or life. Ice and fire both destroy life. I'm guessing that Brann and Jon may end up on opposite sides of the final conflict.

Thanks for reading. I look forward to your comments.

**TLDR**: Three groups are led by R'hellor, or were created through the actions of Red Priests: Jon's Wildling Army, the Brotherhood without Banners, led by LSH, and the Faceless Men. How do you think they will find room to cooperate, and what are their separate roles in the scheme of the Red Order led by Mel's bosses?"

4j7f6b,0,2016-05-13,Need help on bettering myself over the summer,ChangingtheSpectrum,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4j7f6b/need_help_on_bettering_myself_over_the_summer/,"So, I'm an undergrad who switched to a CS major before junior year - a bit late, obviously, but that didn't deter me from attempting to get an internship over the summer. I put in some work on my own time in order to learn some front-end languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, a bit of AngularJS) on top of the Java I was learning in school, but switching majors so late turned out to be too large an obstacle to overcome -- despite getting two interviews, I am without an internship this summer.

HOWEVER

I asked one of the interviewers what I could have done to make myself more attractive as an applicant, and he gave me a couple things I could do. 1. Go deeper into Java by learning parallel processing, Spring/Hibernate frameworks, or JVM (what even are these things). 2. Pick up Python. 3. Pick up MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js) for a more web-oriented skill-set.

My overly wordy question to you guys, then, is: which option would be in my best interest, and what way should I attempt to tackle learning it? If it's at all relevant, I would like to one day be a software developer. Thanks!"
4j7g6z,10,2016-05-13,Junior system admin,trevorludgate,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4j7g6z/junior_system_admin/,"Hello,

A little introduction:
I've worked as a store manager at a computer store for 4 years (fixing computers, customer service, managing employees, etc)
Im 20 years old
No university but did an AEC program (a Quebec thing, in English that means roughly college equivalency - it's an 18 month program) in network/systems administration 
Did a 3 month internship at a hospital as help desk technician 

I have my CCNA R&amp;S and MCTS SCCM and actively studying for the following:
Network + (already have CCNA but I'm studying to brush up on network skills and might as well chalk another cert up on my CV)
CCDA (design) did course on CBT nuggets but need to review routing protocols
MCSA Server 2012 (may wait for 2016 - depends on how long it takes me to study) I already know my stuff and could _probably_ pass the exam but doing the CBT training just in case 
CCNA Wireless - did the CBT nuggets course for the new exam but many from /r/CCNA say the course doesn't prepare you adequately 

In queue (future)
-CCNP R&amp;S
-MCSE server 
-CCDP 

I'm leaning more towards systems administration, but I want to be qualified for network administration as well

----- end of intro -----

So I've been unemployed since February (I got a job offer and have my 2 weeks- then the company disappeared (really complicated but it was a government subsidiary that was dissolved and the current IT staff became govt employees and I got lost in the process)

I went to an interview for a Jr System Admin at a private company which went pretty well. They said they're willing to invest in me (certifications)
It's a really nice and modern office and they're updating EVERYTHING so I'll get to play with nice and shiny toys.

They asked me to send them a list of references so I contacted my colleagues at the hospital. Apparently, the job (at the hospital) has come back up and will be posted soon. I'm told that I'm their primary candidate for the position and that the IT director has given his OK for my hiring.
The position would be help desk technician (as opposed to Jr sys admin) but it's a great environment, unionized, close to home, and very relaxed. IIRC, the pay is around $45,000 per year + crazy benefits

The Jr sys admin would be $40,000 + benefits


So here's the dilemma:

The Jr sys admin job would be amazing for my CV (I eventually want to be a Sr sys admin) + pay for certs

The hospital would be help desk with higher pay, but to get promoted, I would need a bachelors degree (considering taking it part time). But I've already worked there so I like the environment and it's pretty low-stress. 

So here's my question:

If I were to receive an offer from both, which would be the best for me (especially long term)?

Thank you so so much for reading my ramblings and for responses :) :)"

I got accepted as a scholar recently to attend a huge developers conference in NYC. I am interning at Amazon this summer and asked for time off of work to attend. 

He seemed a bit apprehensive and worried but said I could go as long as I could keep up with my work (since a 12 week internship is relatively short) and said I could present my findings to the team afterwards.

I asked the person in charge of the conference if I could just attend 2 days (since the 3rd day is not the actual conference itself) and she said that I could, but I would no longer be a scholar and just a regular attendee and miss out on all the scholar perks (which I wanna do).

What should I do? I don't want to disappoint my manager at Amazon (although he seems supportive as long as I do my work) but I also don't want to lose my scholarship perks. What should I do?"
4j7nkn,5,2016-05-13,"I [20F] can't bring myself to cut one of my closest friends [20F] out of my life, but something needs to change.",plscanunot,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4j7nkn/i_20f_cant_bring_myself_to_cut_one_of_my_closest/,"tl;dr: Close friend of 6 years just isn't giving me the support I give her in our friendship, and I find myself really frustrated with her behaviour. What should I do?

My friend Hannah and I met in 9th grade. We made fast friends and stuck by each other’s sides through all of high school. Once high school ended, she was the one person I kept in really good contact with and saw twice a year despite being in different states. That’s pretty much how it’s been, up until 2016.

Something to know about her is she’s a very independent girl. She has a hard time making and keeping friends, and has never had a boyfriend. On the flip side, she’s really successful. Great grades, and just started her third internship, this time in Washington DC working in the exact field she’s studying. She has never been particularly sensitive or soft; she tells it how it is, even if nobody asked for her opinion. That type.

Recently, though, that side of her has gotten worse.

I have had some struggles with school, which were negatively affecting the way I viewed myself. Probably a year after I should have, I finally decided to go to counselling. Obviously with her being one of my closest friends, I confided in her that I had sought the courage to seek help and see a counsellor, and that I was going to get tested for ADD. She essentially scoffed, asked why I wanted to go, and told me I probably have nothing wrong with me. She said I just needed tips to manage my time better and prioritize properly, which I found incredibly frustrating and insensitive. I confronted her about it, and she explained that this was her attempt to provide support because she “wouldn’t want anything to be wrong with her if she was in my situation”. Not helpful, especially when a few days later I got a positive ADD diagnosis - aka, ""something wrong"". When I sent her a few more messages trying to explain why what she had said frustrated me, she ended up ignoring my messages for 4 straight days, and was completely unreachable. On the 4th day I said, “If you don’t want to be friends, that’s something I can deal with. What I can’t deal with is you leaving me in the dark.” She responded later with a pseudo-apology – “Sorry you don’t understand that I am a perfectly sweet friend and have never been anything but supportive.”

That ordeal was a defining moment. I have not taken her as seriously or communicated as frequently since then. The thing is, I can’t seem to let go of the friendship. At this point, it’s very apparent to me that she doesn’t care what’s happening in my life. My boyfriend left a week ago to Europe for 8 months, and we’re doing long distance. I messaged her the morning he was leaving saying “Man… can't believe Brady [my boyfriend] is leaving for the airport in a few hours.” Her actual response was “Chill, u going with” and when I responded she ignored it.

At this point I know she uses me to blow off steam and get advice, but doesn't want to give any. As far as I can tell, she cares about keeping me around because she has a hard time keeping friends, and doesn't want to lose a friend she's had for 6 years. But I can’t seem to let go, because a decent portion of the messages we exchange feel comfortable and are benign. There's a reason we've been friends for so long, and as long as we stay away from emotional topics, nobody gets hurt. It's just when I want to talk about something personal, she's not there and changes the subject, often to ask for advice on a petty problem of her own.

At one point in my life I wanted this girl to be a bridesmaid of mine. I thought of her as a sister. I don’t know why I don’t have a clear answer in my mind as of what to do… which is why the past few months I’ve just been clinging to the leftover bits of friendship in a lackluster way. How should I handle this? Can I confront her again? I can't let things continue the way they are. I don't think I could just ghost her because I know it'd bother me, so if I was to discontinue contact I'd have to tell her why... not sure how I feel about that option though. I'm not sure what to do."

4j7zot,1,2016-05-13,[F4A] Basic Protocol,CrowmeatDPP,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/4j7zot/f4a_basic_protocol/,"""War"" may be a bit of an exaggeration, but anyone who claims that Western society is living in racial harmony has their head buried in the sand. Just turn on the news, the US, Europe, it's the same story everywhere. It's not anyone's fault, really- we're genetically designed to associate with those like us. But we're also designed to compete and conquer...

Let's introduce the Black Broadcast Capitalist Enterprises. International underground firm that is part of almost every market imaginable. News broadcasting, commercials, auctioning, farming, construction, law, politics, the film industry, sports... Everything. Though they always have cover-ups, ghost companies used to hide them from true sight. Most of the world has slowly been taken over by BBCE, and now they control enough to start moving.

Nearly every employee for the BBCE and their underling companies is of African descent, and the ones that aren't are very attractive white girls. Well, they weren't very attractive white girls at the start, but the BBCE works in the research industry and the cosmetic industry, and also the plastic surgery industry. They are very attractive now. Though they don't date, they deny any man that talks to them. Apart from a black man. And then if a girl talks to them, well, they'll introduce them to that high-paying secretary job at BBCE, and the cycle continues...

Now, however, they can start their original goal. To make the Black Race supreme. They've always been working towards this goal. Money is funneled into interracial porn productions, sent as child support payments to Black men and the women they breed, used to fund tuition for Black students to attend historically white colleges and universities and support the propaganda spewing Tumblr blogs they write filled with smut. In fact, BC Enterprises is the largest source of funding for the advancement of the Black race the world has ever seen- and it's working. Only, they are ready to launch a new initiative.

the Basic Protocol. Designed to target basic white girls, ones that are cute and the ones that are stunningly hot, the goal is that by the end of the year, nearly every white girl will dream of BBC stretching them out and being filled with the superior sperm. Of course, that takes time... And testing. If people suddenly get suspicious of the copious amounts of interracial porn that they can watch, targeted towards them in particular... No, the BBCE got to where they are now by patience and waiting. They were slaves by these stupid white men, now they'll enslave them. Only, they won't realize they are being enslaved until all their women are breeding black children and every job is taken by the superior black race.

The BBCE control everything, as mentioned above. And when I say everything... I truly mean everything! Every market, every business, everything is managed and monitored. If the BBCE want a famous celebrity to go black, for example Kim Kardashian... They start to influence her. Replace her friends' thoughts and let her friends convert her. Whisper in her ear. And then they put down their hand-made celebrity Kanye West to sweep in and finish the job. Now, millions of teens on instagram look up to Kim, and her sexy black husband...

This is only an example. The first step to the project is to pick a fresh target. I am sure that you boys can find a nice picture of a pretty girl who is ready to be tested and moulded into her ideal image! Then, the influence begins. Start replacing boys in her school with black ones, have her watch her crush get beaten up by a gang of muscular black guys. Surround her with pretty black men and... Her friends. Her friends will be converted in advance, on a more... Enhanced version of the protocol. Sped up. Her friends already love black cock and eagerly work for BBCE. They giggle and point out things like how much bigger and more dominant black men are...

And then they steer it towards sexual conversation. Is it true that black men are bigger? Is it true that once you go black, you can't go back? Stuff like this. Questions that keep our target up at night, pondering about them... At this point, we'll begin to convert her family. Take the men of the house out, her brothers and father, replace them with a new black step-father. This is a long process, but the black agent who will play as the step-father will begin to play subliminal messaging and hypnotic videos that are disguised as films. Ones that get her horny as the sex scenes get steamier, the ones that make her close her eyes at night, but not for sleeping.

Then we amp it up after a few weeks of this. After this amount of time, she's into black guys. But still into whites... And that can't do. We'll make her give a BJ or have sex with a white guy and his tiny penis, and then afterwards, a few days later, have her accidently walk into her step-father, or maybe find a beefed out black guy in the gym showers... Maybe asked on a date from the basketball player in school. And they'll get it on, slowly but surely.

She should have her first black cock within two weeks of amping it up. Then, we give her more black cock, and tiny white cock as well. From there, she'll make her choice. We'll get her addicted to the stunning pleasure of BBC, and then the BBCE will give her an internship at one of their prestigious offices, far away from her family. There, they'll pump her up into an airheaded bimbo secretary and... Rinse and repeat. Until they get the formula for the Basic Protocol down.

Then... They can release it upon the world.

---

The best message to me would be starting off the roleplay by writing about one of the girls. You'll play any man that comes up, and the world and how it reacts to the Basic Protocol, but also about the brainwashing and the effects it has on the four girls! So mentioning how they find themselves thinking about black men... Stuff like that. I'm more likely to ignore you if you don't write a response to the roleplay and get stuck in straight away, just because I can see your writing talent and whether we'll be a good match! "
4j84tw,2,2016-05-13,When should I start applying for jobs (info inside),kevkev667,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4j84tw/when_should_i_start_applying_for_jobs_info_inside/,"I'm graduating with a Bachelors of Science in Comp Sci from Rutgers University in December 2016.

GPA:

I started off my college career with a very low GPA and have been inching my way back up. As of the end of this spring semester my GPA is a 2.98, and by the time of my graduation I'm confident it will be above a 3 and as high as a 3.2 (for the purposes of this question, assume it will be 3.1)

Internships:

I have 2 summers (6 months) of software engineering internship experience at the same company (relatively small ad tech firm) and this summer I'll be interning an additional 3 months for a SaaS HR company with pretty decent name recognition. total of 3 summers(9 months) of internship experience.

Initially I was planning on starting the application process in the summer so I could honestly list my third internship on my resume, and hopefully continue with interviews and sign somewhere during the fall. Now I'm wondering whether it would be in my best interest to wait until after Fall semester when my GPA will cross the magic 3.0 number before I start looking for jobs.

tl;dr, would it be worth it to wait until after my GPA crosses the border from 2.98 to ~3.1 to start applying for jobs even if it means I wont be set with a job when I graduate (also feel free to give any other advice you think would be useful to someone in my situation)

edit: I guess some personal info that you would need to answer this is how much it matters to me to have a job right out of college. I would definitely prefer to have a job right away but I certainly dont *need* to (I have support from my parents for how ever long I need it). The real crux of the question is how much it would benefit me in applications to apply with a 3.1 rather than a 2.98 (I dont plan on rounding my GPA on my resume because it feels dishonest)"

I got email with two software positions with two relatively tech giants. I responded with the first company(about 3 days ago), to schedule a phone interview at 3pm today but got no confirmation email and it is (1:10 pm). I got another email from another company(yesterday) that they think I would be a great fit for them and asked a couple questions about my preferences, I responded with answers and such. However, I got no confirmation or response email with these two companies. 

My Questions: 1.) Is it normal for companies to not respond after they email you they are interested in you.
2.)Should I still expect a phone interview even though I got no confirmation email for the phone interview after I gave my timings that are preferable. "
4j8cfm,30,2016-05-13,[anecdotal] How to leverage your intern status to meet new people and learn new ideas,[deleted],consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/4j8cfm/anecdotal_how_to_leverage_your_intern_status_to/,"To any prospective or incoming interns, I'd like to share what worked well with me during my last internship regarding meeting new people and learning new ideas. This sub is full of resources on networking, but in this post I turn my attention to day-to-day practices of leveraging being an intern to meet new people and learn new ideas. My present goal is not to recommend ""networking techniques"" but to instead help people who may unfamiliar or uncomfortable with the process of meeting more senior people. 

**Timing**

Get some project experience before you reach out to new people, enough to have something to talk about. Having a coffee chat day one in which you find yourself struggling to come up with an answer to *How do you like your current project?* or *What are you working on?* or *What have you found most interesting so far?* will not lend itself to meaningful conversation. Even if your internship is only eight weeks, take some time to settle in and orient yourself.

**Be calculated in who you want to speak to**

I found it most helpful to have a colleague ""endorse"" a connection, so to speak. When I reached out to people with whom I had no mutual ties, I found the conversations fell flat and were more formal and procedural. In other words, it seemed like these conversations were more of a check mark, with the other person feeling a sense of *Check, met with the intern today* rather than having a feeling of a rewarding conversation. In reaching out to other people, I found this most useful in initial emails by mentioning something along the lines of *""I'm currently working on a project with Sarah and she recommended I speak to you based on mutual interests."" In addition to a higher success rate of meeting with people, I found that having more in common helps the conversation along with both how much you get out of it, and how easy it is to progress.

**The WIFM principle: what's in it for me?**

The WIFM principle is one of the most important pieces of advice I ever received. Always ask yourself before meeting with someone what you can offer them, as people tend to always be thinking what's in it for me. Be prepared to offer yourself to help on a project (if appropriate) or to otherwise make yourself useful. This is difficult because interns don't usually have useful levels professional/social capital, but if you can demonstrate that you're not just taking their time, folks tend to be more receptive to meeting and chatting.

**Do your homework**

Before meeting with someone, learn about what they do, what projects they've worked on, and what interests them to the best of your abilities. I'm not referring to the creepy LinkedIn scouring for hobbies that you see some folks do before interviews. Instead, sincerely get a feel for what makes them tick, and ask them about that. If you're talking to a manager who specializes in energy, don't waste their time asking about what it's like to be at the manager level. Instead, try to get their unique insights on their industry, or whatever their interests/specialization may be.

**Ask advice and WRITE IT DOWN**

Perhaps the most important thing I've learned. You are an intern, and people realize that you have little experience and the greatest potential for growth simply by nature of your inexperience. Ask for advice at the conclusion of every meeting, but don't ask for general advice. Ask for specific advice. In other words, don't ask *Can you give me advice on being an intern?* Instead, ask questions that more specifically probe the idiosyncrasies of each relationship. The wording is up to you, but your question should be more along the lines of *What advice can* **you specifically** *give to* **me specifically**? The specifics will likely come from either commonalities you share or because the person you're speaking with has knowledge about a particular industry/area/whatever that you'd like to improve upon in your own professional experience.

After you ask for advice, write it down. It will give you the opportunity to follow up with the person in a few weeks to show that you've listened to advice. I often liked to remark to people *You gave me advice and said improve [x]. I did these three specific things and that helped me improve [x].* Don't bullshit this, be sincere and treat these as learning opportunities.

**Bottom line**

People are willing to chat with interns, I've found. It's useful to connect with people across functional and industry specializations. You learn a lot, and you can grow a lot from what you learn and the advice you receive. Make it personal whenever you can to deepen the level of mutual understanding and appreciation for the conversation. It's hard to make yourself particularly useful sometimes, but always try. Make sure to follow up with an email to thank the person with a conversation.

**Practical Remarks**

It's easiest to email people to set up a time to chat. Ask them for fifteen minutes of their time to grab coffee. They are more busy than you, and what they're doing is more important. If they want to talk longer, they'll keep chatting past the fifteen minute mark. Be sure to propose at least three times that work in your email, and always be polite. If you schedule a phone call, always ask if they'd prefer to call you or if instead they'd prefer you to call them. Usually they will call you, but it is a nice gesture regardless.

Thank you for reading!
TL;DR: **be a human and act like one**.

4j8idb,0,2016-05-13,[MO] Will a police department background check be able to find my out of state public intoxication charge?,bag_of_dix,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4j8idb/mo_will_a_police_department_background_check_be/,"I recently applied for an internship position at my town's police department and disseminated information about two prior legal issues I had. Both of these issues took place in Missouri (where I live) and I was able to explain them during my interview. Both of these issues were expunged due to my compliance with the consequences I received from the judges.  I did not, however, disclose information about a public intoxication ticket I received while visiting friends at a college town in Mississippi. I do not believe Mississippi and Missouri traded records about this incident (which I spend a few hours in jail for, even though it was just a ticket) because it would have affected the terms of my probation for my previous legal issue. I did not receive any notification that my probation had been violated due to this public intoxication ticket.

My question is: will the background check I will go through to become an intern at this police department uncover my public intoxication ticket from Mississippi?"

Until she meets a man she only knows as Sir.
Shamelessly deviant, Hayato knows exactly what Max thinks of Dominants like him. So ready to dismiss his lifestyle, she’s the type to assume she knows everything about it and him after one cursory glance from the outside in. But, looking at Max—at her intelligence and passion—he can see more in her than the misconceptions she’s deliberately blinding herself with.
And, determined, he plans to show her more.
Max finds herself fascinated by this man who insists on challenging her every belief as he leads her into his world of dark desires. Matching his clash of wit, will, and seduction, Max begins to question all she knows about what it means to be empowered. 
Used to being unquestionably on top, Hayato is intrigued by Max's formidable delight in playing games and striking deals that shifts his usual power dynamics as they negotiate roles and rewrite rules.
But, just as their game heats up, it gets used against them. Seeking to punish them with their play, someone threatens to drag their private lives out into the public spotlight. 
With high stakes and bitter scandal looming over their heads, Max and her Sir will have to work together to show that what the world thinks they are does not define who they are.*

**Novel Excerpt**

“I want my goddamned file!”

He looked up from his monitor as Max stormed through his office’s main door, Elin trailing behind her.

“I’m sorry, sir,” Elin apologized, still trying to get ahead of Max’s long, determined strides. “I told her that you were very busy today and that she’d need to make an appointment, but—”

“It’s all right,” he told her. “Call Werther and push our meeting until three and reschedule the office meeting for tomorrow. Thank you, Elin.”

“Yes, sir,” she said, leaving quickly.

After the doors shut, he turned to face Max’s sneering face. “It must be an enormous ego-stroke for you to have an assistant who calls you *sir*,” she snarled.

“It’s just a word,” he said with a dismissive shrug, knowing that to a woman like Max it was much more. “I don’t require or demand it from Elin. It’s her choice to address me that way.”

“At least you gave her a choice, Mr. Hayato,” she spat back. “Now, I want my file—the original copy and any other copies you might have made. I want all history of me wiped from your records. And,” she added with a spitfire swish of her head, “if you can manage it, *Mr. Hayato*, I’d love it if you and your little club disappeared completely, if not from the face of the Earth than at least from my life. Think you can manage that?”

He smiled, admiring the glitter in her eyes and the glow of her skin that all that violent anger lent her. It was an unforgivable cliché, but she was stunning when she was angry. “Maxine,” he chided, knowing he was tempting more of her ire, “you needn’t to be so formal.” He smiled as he saw—heard—her grind her teeth. “After what we’ve done together” —and all the things we’ll do, he added to himself— “you don’t have to call me *Mister*.”

“Well,” she shot back, planting balled, meticulously manicured fists against full, sensual hips encased in a stiff, molded skirt, “I don’t know what to call you, since you won’t tell me your first name.”

His grin widened as he let his gaze travel down the tailored length of her skirt, down shapely legs, and all the way up again to her gloriously furious face. “I told you what you could call me.”

She gave a derisive, unladylike snort. She stepped back, altering her defensive stance into something more aggressive as she crossed her arms under her buttoned-down breasts, held down and held captive by a pretty, professional jacket. “If I understand BDSM guidelines,” she said, her voice taking on the icy chill of logic and tempered tone of debate, “the title *Sir* is reserved for tops or Doms used by their bottoms.” It was wrong that her tight, tense, cold voice, that strove to conceal all her fire, made him so hot. “It’s not a label tossed out lightly. You have to earn that title.” Her cold eyes flashed fierce and hard. “I have to agree to it.”

His lips twitched as he fought the urge to grin. Instead, he sat back in his chair, leaning against the soft, cushioned back. “I hesitate to point out,” he drawled, “that you did indeed say that you belonged to me. That you were mine.”

“*Do you belong to me*?” he’d asked her that night in the club. “*Speak*.”

“*Yes*.” So soft. A weak whisper of sound.

“*Yes what*?” he’d pushed, the feel of her skin—the delicate length of her neck held tight in his grasp—making him hot and hard.

“*Yes*,” she’d said, the sound reluctant, but resigned, “*I’m yours. Sir.*”

He’d wanted so much to fuck her right then and there at those words.

He wanted to again just at their memory.

“I didn’t mean it,” Max hissed testily as she glared at him from across his desk, much of her cool reserve melting, “and you know it. It was a completely irrelevant statement, made under duress. It was either you or a night with Rand.” She sniffed. “If I’d known how difficult you were going to be, I would have made a different decision.” She made a small, almost inaudible sound of female impatience. “I swear a single night with that caveman—no matter how tawdry or how fucked-up it would undoubtedly have been—would have been easier than dealing with you.”

He gave a short, thoroughly amused laugh. “I’m sure a night with Rand would have been many things,” he said, as he eyed—studied and imagined—her body and all the secret possibilities it held, “but—or so I’ve been told—*easy* would not have been one of them.”

She huffed, her nostrils flaring as she glared dark and stormy eyes at him. “I want to know your name,” she demanded.

He smiled, still remembering their first encounter. “I like the way *Sir* sounds from your lips.” Loved the way the word tumbled from her mouth like instinct, unwilling but ingrained.

He saw her fists flex as she fought the urge to growl. He wished she wouldn’t fight so hard, wished that she would unleash herself. “There must be something else I can call you other than *Sir*.”

“*Master*?”

It was slight and he almost didn’t see it, but he glimpsed the briefest blink of amusement flicker across her face. She tilted her head at a mocking angle. “How about *milord* or *your excellency*?” she said with jibbing rigidity as she dropped into a scathing curtsy.

He laughed. “If you prefer,” he replied with a matching bow of his head before he shrugged off her disdain. “It’s just a title, Max. Just a name. A relatively harmless one at that. We use it every day in polite parlance. Is it really worth all this trouble? All this fight?”

———

Fine! Max thought, ready to tear out her hair.

What did it matter to her anyway? she thought as she calmly ran her hands over her carefully coiffed hair. It wasn’t as if she was going to see him ever again.

And he was right. She called strangers *sir* and *ma’am* all the time. And, narrowing her gaze at the live-action anime man, she knew this guy was certainly stranger than most.

Besides, she thought, maybe it would put a nice distance between them. Maybe if she started treating him like the stranger—the anonymous no one—he was, being with him would feel less intimate.

So, fine. If he wanted to act the arrogant ape-man, that was just *ducky* with her. “I want my file now,” she repeated through gritted teeth, “*sir*.”

He smiled, tapping a thoughtful finger over his thin, smirking lips, as an unease rolled over her. She did not like that look. Didn’t like the tickled, rumbling laughter that accompanied it. She didn’t know what it meant, but she knew it couldn’t be good.

“I’ll tell you what,” he finally said, “for that, I’ll give you a page of the file.”

A page? “A page?” she balked. “No, I want my file—the whole thing—and I want it now.”

He tsked. “We’ve been through this,” he said. “The file is about you,” he repeated with a shake of his head, “but it’s not yours.”

Oh, he wanted to play, did he? Well then, she thought, let’s play. “If you don’t give it to me right now, lawyer-boy,” she scolded, using her most imperious tone—the one that made her interns quake, “I’m going to bring in my own attorney and—”

“And what, Max?” he asked, interrupting her. “Make a case out of this? Making your file not just my property but evidence as well? Is that really what you want?” He settled back, steepling his finger thoughtfully. “I’m fairly well-established as an unscrupulous member of the seedy underbelly, a dirty-pool defender of the less than sterling sect of society. My reputation won’t be affected should this become public.” His hard, almost gleeful gaze bore into hers. “Can you say the same?”

She growled, the sound strangled and choked in her tight throat.

They both knew the answer to that.

No.

If that file—if the fact that she belonged to a club like Donovan’s, however momentarily and unwillingly—became public knowledge, she’d not only be deeply embarrassed, she’d be ruined. How could she expect anyone to take her seriously as an advocate and editor of feminist erotica if she had ties to a club that used and degraded women as mere sex objects so unabashedly? She wouldn’t just be fired, she’d be laughed out of the industry.

No, legal recourse was an empty threat and they both knew it. Her hands were judicially tied. She couldn’t force him to give her anything without attracting unwanted attention she couldn’t afford. Max pressed a finger to her throbbing temple. Well, shit. She shut her eyes, squeezing them shut.

“This is blackmail,” she accused.

She jumped when she felt his hands touch her from behind, wrapping gently—almost comfortingly—around her shoulders. “No, this is a compromise,” he said in a soothing tone.

Still trying to swallow her surprise—she hadn’t even heard him move—she forced herself to breathe and think. “What kind of compromise?” she asked, suspicion making her tense.

He sighed and dropped his hands, his disappointment in her dousing her doubts. “A fairly simple one,” he stated in a brisk, business-like tone that she knew he adopted for her sake. She softened a bit, appreciating his effort. “There are twenty-six pages in your original file, plus a digital copy kept in the system. I’m offering an even trade, a favor for a page.” 

“And the digital copy?” Max asked, wanting to fully understand his deal before countering.

“The same?”

“Not a chance,” she said. “I don’t want to do one favor for you, you think I’m going to agree to fifty-two?”

“I like a woman with quick math wits; too many people need calculators for simple addition,” he said with a smirk. “What if the digital file counts as half?” he asked. “Thirteen favors. Plus the original twenty-six makes thirty-nine.”

“No deal,” she argued. “The digital file takes a right click of the mouse to delete. It shouldn’t count as a favor at all.”

“And the whole file is a shredder-feed away from non-existence,” he stated.

“Exactly,” she stated, with a decisive wave of her hand. “It’s such an easy fix for you; why make this difficult—why prolong it—when it’d be easy for you to just end it?” Then he’d be out of her way, she’d be out of his, and the world could go back to the way it was before.

“Because this isn’t about effort,” he told her sagely, “it’s about worth. And you’ve made it very clear that you value this file very much.” Folding his own arms across his chest, he asked with a cocky tilt of his head, “So, Max, how much do you want it?”

Deliberately ignoring the innuendo liberally laced in his words, she sniffed and focused on making the deal. “The digital file is worth one favor,” she said. “One click, one favor. Fair?”

He shifted in his chair, excitement—and something hotter—sparking in his eyes as he watched her. “Strictly speaking, it takes three clicks—a right, a left, and an *okay*—to delete the file. Three clicks, three favors. Fair?” he tossed back.

She sighed. “Done.” She could accept that.

“Good,” he said. “The digital file will count as three additional requests on top of the original twenty-six.”

“Wait,” she stopped. “If we’re counting the digital file by how many clicks it takes to delete it, shouldn’t we do the same for the paper copies? How many button-pushes would it take to delete the file?”

“Several,” he said as his ice-blue gaze narrowed, telling her more effectively than words that he was rapidly reaching the end of his patience and leniency, “if I fed it through the shredder in huge chunks so it purposefully jammed. Are you sure that’s how you want to measure this?”

“Have it your way,” she acquiesced casually—as if it didn’t matter at all—sensing that more argument might cost her valuable ground she’d just gained. “So, that’s twenty-nine requests.” Not an easy task, but not nearly the worst undertaking she’d taken on. A good deal, she thought. “But nothing illegal,” she added quickly. “And nothing that could jeopardize my career.”

“Of course,” he said with a swift nod. “But in return, I want a time limit on these requests. If you refuse a request or take longer than three minutes to begin complying, you forfeit that page.” Tossing her a challenging glance, he added, “Agreed?”

Max bit her lip. She didn’t like the idea that there was even the possibility—the very real likelihood—that he could keep any of those pages in his possession.

“I promise not to compromise you physically, professionally, or personally,” he told her softly. “I have no desire to harm you in that way or any other. You are safe with me.”

She scoffed. Safe with a blackmailer in an all but blind deal?

But what choice did she have? She couldn’t leave here empty-handed. Besides, she thought as she studied him, I can handle anything—even him. She took a deep breath. “Agreed.”

“Excellent,” he said almost cheerfully. “I don’t suppose you’d be willing to seal our deal with a kiss, would you?” he asked mockingly.

“Sure,” she said with a shrug. “Why don’t you kiss my ass and we’ll call it a deal?”

He laughed. “Bend over;” he said with an obvious leer to her behind, “it’d be my pleasure.”

Her face wrinkled. She was sure it would be his pleasure—all his. Perv. “How about a handshake?”

“How about our first trade?” he countered.

Fine. He wanted another drink with her? Wanted to watch some more live sex shows starring her nearest and dearest? That was just fine. She could deal with twenty-nine nights of that, if it would get her goddamned file for her. She shrugged and then nodded.

“My first request,” he told her as he moved to lean against his desk, “give me your panties.”

Max stuttered. “Excuse me?”

“Your panties,” he repeated, sounding impatient, “give them to me…”

4j8kfw,4,2016-05-13,"My mother [57F] and brother [21M] are supposed to visit me across the country, but my mom keeps finding excuses for not coming.",throwdatnameaway3,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4j8kfw/my_mother_57f_and_brother_21m_are_supposed_to/,"Edit: I'm 26F.

I am very close with my mother and brother, but they live across the country.  Every year, they visit me twice.  My brother is still in college so usually this takes place around the time of his summer or spring break.  Then, I visit them for the holidays once a year.

My mom doesn't work, but my brother is a full time student with an internship and I am an adult with a full time job.  My mom is well off financially, and basically gets to do whatever she wants.  She travels whenever she wants, etc. You would think that my brother and I would be the hardest to plan around since we have school/real jobs, but my mom's social life and hobbies are the main obstacle here and it's driving me nuts.

Since my brother's school just ended, it's a good time for them to visit.  However, every time we decide on a weekend, my mom has some other priority that she puts first.  For example, this weekend looked good for all of us, and then my mom said she has art classes on Friday and can't miss even one (even though she's definitely missed a few in the past for social reasons).  So I suggest the weekend after that, and she says she can't do that because she just got invited to a wedding that weekend (yes, someone invited to her a wedding on extremely short notice because just last week, she said that weekend was fine).  The person who invited her is not a close friend, but she feels it's more important to go to this wedding than to see me because she thinks the bride/groom will be furious if she misses ""just so she can visit family."" (I recently got married and I wouldn't have cared if someone missed it for this reason unless they were in the wedding party!)

When I told her she was clearly a last-minute invite to this wedding, and that it was silly to miss seeing me to go to an acquaintance's wedding, she got mad at me and accused me of ""Not allowing her to have a life.""

My brother is willing to take days off his internship.  I'm willing to take PTO off my job.  Everyone is willing to move things around except my mom.  Every small social obligation she gets suddenly becomes more important than visiting me.  When I told her she was placing more importance on her hobbies and social circle than on seeing me, she said I was being hypocritical because I'm traveling to Europe next month and that time would have been good for her to visit (My husband and I planned the trip six months ago, and we already paid for it, which is obviously different than attending some acquaintance's wedding on short notice.)

She also does this every single time she's scheduled to come out and visit.  She claims to want to see me and that my brother and I are the most important things in her life, but she continually puts the priorities of her friends/acquaintances first and acts like ""I can't do this, I'm visiting my daughter that weekend"" is an absurd excuse not to attend something.  She feels obligated to please every single acquaintance she meets, but she doesn't care if she hurts my feelings by putting me last.

I've gotten really sick of the constant texts/emails to determine when she can come out.  It's gotten tiring and a part of me feels like she does this on purpose to stir up drama and attention.  She even told me that my brother's job wouldn't let him take any days off and we couldn't do a certain weekend, and when I asked my brother about it, he told me our mother literally made that up.  His job allows him to take days off, and he never said anything to her about not being allowed to.

I'm at the point where I'm resigned to the idea that they may not visit at all because of my mom's various social obligations, but it still makes me sad, because I miss them a lot, and I wonder why I come last to my mom, when she's one of my first priorities.  I keep trying to connect the three of us on Facebook chat so they can arrange this themselves, but my mom resorts to messaging me separately and rejecting almost any weekend I give her as an option, then making up objections on my brother's part, which aren't real or true.

Because someone will probably suggest ""Just visit them!"" it's actually harder for me, because I don't have the same disposable income as my mom does (The Europe trip is something we've saved for, for a while now), and because I have a real job, taking time off that includes a 6 hour flight both ways, just isn't practical.

What do I do now?

**TLDR: My mom is putting small social obligations and hobbies first and is making it impossible to find a time to visit me.  I'm starting to wonder if she doesn't even want to come out, or is doing this on purpose for attention.**"
4j8ktn,9,2016-05-13,Addicted to Rocket League,i_takes,RocketLeague,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/4j8ktn/addicted_to_rocket_league/,"This is an admittance to this here community that I, i_takes (known in game as danonthemoon), am addicted to Rocket League. This is the tale of how it came to be.

**Stage 1: Experimentation**

It all started back in July when Rocket League was one of two free games of the month for the PS4. I saw a couple of my friends had downloaded the game and started to play it as well as others playing the other free game (I can't even remember what the other one was.) So, after receiving a couple invites from my close friends, I thought, why not, I'll download it. After the twenty hours it took to download it on the world's bumhole's internet connection, I finally got to start it up and play. I thought to myself, let's knock out some tutorials and training before I join my friends, who I assumed would be leagues ahead of me by now. After an hour or so I figured I was ready to hit online casual with my buddies, so we did just that. Having not learned any tactical approaches to the game we spent days upon weeks ball chasing and ramming into each other. It was all in great fun as we experimented with this new feeling of adrenaline, but late into August or early September things began to change. My friends got new games, new downloads, new experiments, I, however, moved on to Stage 2.

**Stage 2: Regular Use**

At this point in my life, I was in between an internship and my part time job, giving me two to three weeks of relaxation as I prepared myself for my final year of college. I had minimal responsibilities, as well as, way too much free time. I had recently paid my college tuition, so I was short on cash and not going out on the town with my friends. Instead you would find danonthemoon on the couch, ps4 controller in hand, and Rocket League on the tele. I was playing each day in and out, constantly trying to improve my skills. I mastered (or so I thought) the art of aerials in this hiatus and began to learn basic positioning as well. I discovered this subreddit, and with that I started to learn more and more strategies and techniques that it began to become all I could think about. My friends occasionally would want to play with me, but I couldn't be held down by their lack of skill. They persisted, so I joined them anyways and proved that I was the Rocket League big shot of the group. Needless to say they were not happy. Friends and family no longer wondered what I was doing at any time, they knew where I was and what I was doing to myself. I thought nothing of it, until it got worse.

**Stage 3: Risky Use**

Here is where many people will say you need to start changing things. You need to take a break, or move to better habits. Here is what some people like to call, ""the point of no return"". This is where Rocket League began to really take a toll on my life as we know it. It's the beginning of December and final exams are around the corner. People are studying, the house I live in with 5 roommates in dead silent. I have exams coming up, but you can still here from my room the faint sound of the ion boost trail creeping under the doorway. My friends try knocking on my door, no answer. They call me, no answer. They beg me to come out, no answer. I only emerge from the soccar themed cave for drinks and bathroom breaks, occasionally also to get food from the delivery driver. Finals go by and somehow I pass, even though I drew a rocket league car as one of my answers on the operating systems test. For some reason it was all I could think about. Spring semester rolls around and I buy Rocket League for the PC. I begin bringing my PC to class and playing then. I bring my PC to work and play on my breaks. I bring my PC to the bar and play against the CPUs as the bar did not have WiFi. Rocket League had become one with me.. Stage 4.

**Stage 4: Dependence**

From February to this month of May, there is nothing else I can think about except Rocket League. I wake up every day, play a little to wake myself up. Shower, eat, poop, smoke, play a little more Rocket League, school, Rocket League, work, Rocket League, more work, Rocket League to finish off the night. If I miss one of my Rocket League times, I become light headed. I get nauseous when I do not have the controller in my hand attempting to do freestyle aerials in the middle of a game while the ball isn't in front of the net. Rocket League has become a part of me and there is nothing I can do about it. I have tried uninstalling the game, but steam knows me better than that and auto reinstalls it. I threw away my ps4, but the trash guy set in back on the porch, thinking it was a mistake. I moved to a different state, no help. I have become dependent on Rocket League. Is it a problem, some my say no. Is there a solution, not that I have found. Is there a reason to change?

**Stage 5: Addiction**

This brings us to two days ago. I was without internet, and with out power at my new apartment. I quickly burned the battery on my laptop playing a a game against the AI in an exhilarating 13-1 finish in a 1v4. I think this it, I think I am through. I cannot play, it was finally over. I was going to have to be cured whether I liked it or not. That brings us to today. I am in a weird state of bliss. I no longer really no who I am anymore. Am I still danonthemoon, am I still a Rocket League player, am I still alive? *knock knock knock* could it be? I answer the door. It's the AT&amp;T guy. He sets up my internet. Duke Power calls, power has been turned on. Charging my laptop as I write this. About to start up the game. This part of me, this addiction, *it lives on*."

Wondering if I should look for an internship this summer or a full time position. I go to a target school so I know that an internship will boost my chances of obtaining a FT offer at a reputable company, but I'd need to take another semester of classes (probably part-time) so that I'm eligible for internships. 

Alternatively I know that a FT position is doable for me next year but it's unlikely to be anything special, plus I'm not sure if I'll get as many interviews/offers due to my current lack of experience. 

Thoughts?

My experience by next fall includes performing bioinformatics research using Python and R and a pair of personal projects both written in Java. I have the CTCI book and intend to study the heck out of it. Finally I'm thinking of another project to make. "
4j8tby,2,2016-05-13,[25/F] dating my [29/m] co-worker and having some issues.,throwaway_party12345,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4j8tby/25f_dating_my_29m_coworker_and_having_some_issues/,"Hi guys. I'm going to apologize in advance for the long post. I feel like I need some outside,unbiased advice on how I should handle a certain situation.



Here's the background. I work in a 6 person IT team for a huge company in my country. Currently I'm an intern. I've been an ""intern"" for the past 2 years only because the CEO of the company is utilizing a government hand out scheme where the govt pays the whole intern's salary. I do as much work, if not more than the permanent workers in my department. I'm heading up huge projects and when I'm presenting them to clients I have to lie about my position because the CEO doesn't want people to know he's using the government program.



After about 6 months of working, I quietly started dating another member of the IT team. My boyfriend is currently the CEO's favorite employee so much so that other coworker's refer to him as the next CEO of the company. A couple months into the relationship, a marketing officer at work sees us together at a party. Bright and early Monday morning she runs to the CEO and tells him about our relationship.



This is where it gets tricky. After the CEO found out about us there has been an inexplicable hatred towards me. I have been overlooked for promotions because of this. The CEO even went as far as to tell my boyfriend that he suspects that I'm cheating on him with another co worker. It has reached the point where I'm not sure how to progress in work. All my accomplishments and hard work are ignored. What is starting to irk me is exactly how close my boyfriend is to the CEO. I'm not sure if the CEO sees him as some sort of son figure but the relationship they share is almost father-son like. The CEO always makes comments about how I'm ""just an intern"" implying that somehow I'm lower than my boyfriend?



How am I supposed to feel about all this? I feel hurt that I'm being treated like this at work for no reason (other than the fact that I'm dating the CEOs favorite). Should I be angry at my boyfriend for not standing up for me? I'm not even sure how he's supposed to go out doing that. Another opportunity is coming up where I could be promoted from an intern into an actual permanent worker and I've indicated to my boyfriend that if I'm overlooked for it again I'm going to give my notice. Should I expect my boyfriend to have my back in this situation?



TL/DR - dating a co worker. The CEO hates me but loves the boyfriend. Trouble ensues"

4j9jbu,72,2016-05-13,Kelly meets an Alumni Member,ACharest,StoriesAboutKevin,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesAboutKevin/comments/4j9jbu/kelly_meets_an_alumni_member/,"I've met my fair share of individuals that weren't so bright, but none of them were so dim that I doubted their survival skills. Then there's Kelly, whose mere existence makes me question my college's accredibility.
When I was a freshman, she sat next to me in our screenwriting class. She was often late, fell asleep, interrupted the teacher, and went off on tangents about movies she liked. One time when our professor told her to wake up or go home, her response was ""well sor-eee"" (yes, she put emphasis on the ""y"" like a fifth grader, as a college sophomore). While this was annoying, I didn't hold this against her, since this was an 8 am class and no one's at 100% first thing in the morning.
Then came sophomore year. I received an email from my career advisor that an alumni member, who now has his own film company, would be at the school to talk to students in the creative media division and answer questions on how to get into the industry.
I showered, put on my most professional outfit, packed my bag with a pen, notebook, and copies of my resume and showed up early to meet the alumni member.
He seemed impressed by me and my classmates professionalism, and we had a pleasant conversation about changes that had occurred at college since his graduation in 2007. Suddenly a loud, nasally, Jersey accented voice yelled ""SORRY I'M LATE"" (even though she was on time, but wanted to draw attention to herself while interrupting the alumni member).
Immediately a wave of disgust and annoyance washed through me as the now junior year Kelly in her kitten t-shirt, ripped leggings, faded and oversized purse, and copious amounts of makeup sat down (For the record I wear makeup too, but she wears so much that she could easily make a cosplayer blush).
I thought that maybe she thought she was late, and would leave a good impression on the alumni member and not embarrass us or herself.
I was wrong.
Dead. Fucking. Wrong
Throughout the meeting, Kelly spun in her office chair, played on her phone, played with her nails, played with her hair, and barely made eye contact with the alumni member.
When she asked questions, many began with ""huh""? Or ""what""? 
She interrupted the alumni member while he was explaining his company.... To ask questions about his company.
She also asked a lot of questions that even a child would think were ridiculous. I.E. When the alumni member was telling us about a documentary he made on the Market Basket Strike (a popular grocery store franchise in Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts) Kelly asked ""does Market Basket own City Market?"" 
Alumni Member:..... No. No it doesn't.
(City Market is a grocery store chain in Vermont, I can only assume that she thought they were sister companies since they both have ""market"" in their names).
Then came the cherry on the sundae.
Kelly raised her hand and asked in the most demanding, prying tone possible...
""Do you have any internships?""
We all sat there in stunned silence, the alumni member as well with the most uncomfortable expression I've ever seen.
He finally answers, ""No... No I don't"".
She then pours salt on the wound by asking ""Are you going to have any soon?""
I wanted to vomit, and felt the need to restore faith in our class by asking about qualities he'd like to see in an intern and advice on how to get an internship.
He seemed relieved that not all of us were on Kelly's level, and relaxed.
Sometime later, another girl intrudes on the meeting room, causing Kelly to jump up and yell ""Gotta go!"" With a childish grin on her face.
She almost forgot to shake hands with the alumni member, and stepped over everyone's legs to leave.
Turns out the reason why Kelly left early was because she and her friend didn't want to miss happy hour...
I've told this story to my friends, classmates, and family, and none of us can come to any explaination of how she got to junior year of college."

Okay so here's my story: Have always worked hard at my Calculus classes and have managed a C+ in both Cal 1 and 2 in college. I got a C+ in discrete math due to one bad test grade that brought me from a B down to a C+, unfortunately for me. I never realized how much I truly enjoyed math until I started learning about financial mathematics/ quant finance. I also quite enjoyed discrete math, the proofs were fun to work through, I just got lazy/depressed about half-way through the year and that really made me go into a nose dive. However, I have always wanted to learn linear algebra and am fascinated by figuring out how to prove statements and such. 

Currently, I am in a situation where I can change my major from Computer Science to anything else. I thought business was where I wanted to be (even got an internship in San Jose, and I speak three languages), but now I'm doubting that business is what I want to do. Even with my low GPA in low-level Calculus, should I major in math? I want to use math to eventually go into financial engineering or data science, so I would concentrate in statistics (it's not its own major at my uni). What do you think?"

My parents' concern is that my lack of work and internship experience during undergrad seemed to have a huge effect on my ability to get a job after graduation...and it's true. I only just got my job and it took a year and 200ish applications to do so.  
  
I live in an incredibly small town (population = 2,000) and the opportunities just aren't there, especially for my desired  field. I want to attend UCLA, UW, or UMich so I can be closer to the video game industry or have access to video game archives and professionals (only recently found out studios employ librarians and it has since become ""the dream"" and I'm gonna do everything I can for it).  
  
I don't believe online programs are lesser than or any nonsense like that. It's not an elitist thing. I just don't think it fits my goals. Staying at home and doing an online program would mean that a) I am thousands of miles away in a hick town with few opportunities in the industry I want and b) I won't have the time to work 40-50 hours a week year-round, do school, AND relevant internships (oh, and nothing close to a video game company near me).  
  
I think I already know the answer and, hey, I *am* an adult, but I do care about my parents' input. I also need some independence...I'm a bit of a failure to launch and I think that moving across the country is something I need. I work very hard and have few loans as well as saving everything I can for a Masters program over the next two years.

The thing is I can't drink yet (legally) so I can't really ask anyone out for drinks after work which seems to be the surefire way to make friends. It's also a bit odd because I'm in IT so we don't really interact as much with everyone unless they need something.

So withdrawn. So shy, kind, and sweet. So beautiful. So....innocent. 
I suppose I...coveted her, /because/ of that- her innocence. 
Years went by and I spent more time with her, slowly pulling her out of her snug little shell that she struggled so hard and long to surround herself with. 
I made her trust me, that little innocent little thing, she never suspected a thing. 
She opened up to me, she acted like herself, she told me things she wouldn't tell anybody else, and that.../pleased/ me. 
I wanted to see her trust me, I wanted to be able to hurt her when she trusted and cared for me most. 
We began to see each other, and she seemed to grow more attached, more dependent on me every day, and that..it pleasured me. 
Deep thoughts brewing in the back of my mind, I couldn't help myself. 
I remember leading her to my room, her eyes sparkling with anticipation and wonder. 
I couldn't help but to smirk, and I grabbed her by her hair. 
Startled her. 
Good. 
I threw her into the room and slammed the door shut; there was no escape at that point. 
She gazed up at me through her long eyelashes,  whimpering, tears in her eyes. 
I could almost hear her silent pleas to leave, her silent wishing to have never met me, and i shuddered, licking my lips. 
Delicious. 
I glanced over to my wall of...tools, then grabbed a whip, eager to begin my little game. I lifted my arm above my head, and let it come down on her with a sharp crack. 
She cried out in pain. 
Excellent. 
I licked my lips once again, evil grin growing, and I let it come down on her, that sweet and innocent body. I regarded her with a sneer. 
Over and over again, i let that whip come down, until she was a quivering pile of blood.  Torn skin and bones.  
I smirk. 
Poor little thing. 
I gazed down at my work, at what i had done, and i dropped to my knees. 
She trusted me...why did she trust me? She...she shouldn't have trusted me....
The whip rolled out of my hand and I could feel tears rolling down my cheeks. 
She...
SHE TRUSTED ME WHAT HAVE I DONE...?!
The one person who trusted me, who gave me the benefit of the doubt, who saw the...good in me?
I chuckled dryly. 
Obviously there is no good, none in a man like me. A man like chaos. 
Why had her trust pleasured me? And why had I wanted to punish her for it? Why did I feel the way I did when she had been around? 
I didn't know. 
I didn't care. 
Angry again, I stood up, grasping the whip as if it was there to save my life. 
Hearing her quiet whimpers and pleas fueled my...anger...? No....
My...my need...my obsession, and I smirked. 
Here we go again. 
Again and again I brought that whip down, until that lovely little woman was no more. 
And that's how it should have been. 
She shouldn't have trusted me, and I showed her why. 
Very slowly, almost ceremoniously, I placed the whip on my wall and walked out of the room, done with that woman that used to be such a lovely little play toy. 
The next day, as composed as ever, I strolled into work, to be surprised by something pleasant. 
A new, shy and quiet intern.
Delicious. 
Perfect. 
Delectable. 
I must have her. 
I can't stay away.

I've already posted this query in https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/4hgbsy/biweekly_careers_megathread_may_02_2016/d34vyhd but I figured I should post this here as well.

--
A little backstory about myself, I completed my bachelor's degree in civil engineering a few months ago and it was a total burnout. The last 5 months of university was particularly draining for me and I could tell that my enthusiasm for the industry was seeping away. To collect my bearings, I decided to take a gap year after graduation and do some soul searching for myself. I know a short break can do wonders to the human psyche so why not. A few months into my ~~beach-hopping across the country and getting wasted every other day~~ self-imposed contemplation of life, I got a call from my dad who worked in the UAE asking if I wanted to visit for a couple of weeks. I thought it was a good idea, and the next thing I know, I was on the earliest possible flight to the Emirates after they granted my visa. 
 
When my dad fetched me from the airport, he told me that Dubai and the UAE as a whole was rapidly industrializing and that job opportunities are abundant especially in the engineering fields.  My parents mentioned and suggested it numerous times before, but securing a job here was still not at the top of my to-do list that time. My priority was one thing only and that was to have a profile picture with Burj Khalifa in the background in Facebook. I must say though that the idea of working in the UAE lingered for quite a while at the back of my head, and it took a few more weeks for “engineer me” to convince “vacation me” that it wasn’t a bad idea after all.

In the short time I’ve been here, I have come to realize and appreciate how wonderful Dubai is. Weather is nice ~~too hot~~, diverse good (and cheap) food, great transportation system, shopping malls are huge and complete with everything, and the parks and entertainment scene is incredible. The diversity of the community is also great and I have met wonderful people from various backgrounds. I mean, I have quite a number of international classmates and friends back in my country, but the multicultural experience here is on another level. There are little bits of cons here and there but nothing too serious. Most importantly, I appreciate Dubai because it refreshed my passion for civil engineering. Whenever I use the metro rail network, I always feel amazing because I can see the cityscape and I appreciate all the efforts of the urban planners, structural designers, and engineers who made it all possible. It takes an engineer to recognize the talent of another engineer, and during those times when I look through the train windows and see all the infrastructure and building networks around the city, I imagine myself giving nods of approval to the engineers and architects. Truth to be told, I was slowly entertaining the idea of staying and working here, and in those times when I walked through the parks, gazed at the buildings, and watched the city lights lighten up during night, I knew that the fire in me has reignited once again. I remembered why I chose the civil engineering profession, ~~totally not for the money~~. And when I ate my first kunafa, I had the epiphany and said ""Alright, let's do this"".

So, a fortnight after I arrived, I started to pimp my LinkedIn profile and created résumés in jobsites like Bayt and GulfTalent.
The thing is, life always finds a way to screw people, and there is nothing better to screw people with than one of life’s greatest ironies ─ and this particular irony is a nightmare to new graduates like me. *To get a job, you need experience. To get experience, you need a job.* This particular destructive circle is a part of life. I like to think life as a circle, and that circle is made out of more little circles such as this one, and that is what makes the world go ~~circle~~ round. 

Most of the job postings have these key requirements. And I always check if I meet the criteria:

•	Appropriate degree? Check.

•	Familiar with relevant programs? I loved to draw on important documents of my father’s company as a child, so AutoCAD, 3ds Max, and SketchUp came as second nature. Mastered Microsoft Office at school and Excel in particular whenever I made my monthly allowance budget allocation table during college (food, school activities, savings, ~~booze~~, etc). Had to learn Primavera P6 because the professor wouldn’t accept my arrangement made with Microsoft Project even though it was basically the same, and had to learn ETABS because not everyone understood my analysis report in STAAD.Pro during design classes.

•	Gulf Coast Country experience? My only experience in a Gulf Coast country is that I sunbathed in Jumeirah beach twice.

•	Work experience? 3 internships in two companies. One in the national department for public roads and highways and the other two in one of the major construction companies in my country’s capital region, two months each.  Still &lt;1 year experience when combined together. National department for public roads and highways, and a major construction company in my country’s capital region? Am I trying to sell myself? ~~Yes!~~ Of course not, I just want people in r/dubai ~~and in turn possible recruiters to see that I have the necessary qualifications for a possible job~~ to see the point I will try to make in the next paragraph.

Now, I’ve been quite busy scouting companies these past few days and I’ve compiled a list of 60 companies I’d like to work for and noticed in their websites that most of them offer training/apprenticeship programs for new graduates. My understanding of these training programs is that they are like paid (not sure) internships. Certainly these apprenticeships are considered experience in the industry? The point I’m trying to make is, applying for trainee programs/apprenticeships is another valid, if not better, option for new graduates like me. I understand that securing an actual job with the company you did the apprenticeship with after it ends is not guaranteed whatsoever but it is still considered a legit industry experience, which can be put in one's résumé.

My dilemma is, which option should I go for? I've had people tell me that they know others who got into the industry with fewer technical know-how and knowledge than me, and that I should just search for an entry-level job because I have good qualifications even without the experience. But I wonder if it's better to increase my experience first by getting an apprenticeship? Sure, there is also competition for positions but it is not as tight as for actual jobs. People would flock more if their position is civil engineer rather than trainee civil engineer, right? I've been researching about job searching in UAE and job searching in general and I grind about 5 different browser windows of 20+ tabs regarding those each day, including past r/dubai posts.

Sorry if I'm not making any sense. ~~I just watched Donnie Darko and I can't get it out of my head. I've been listening to Let the Bodies Hit the Floor by Drowning Pool on repeat for 4 hours now to get it out.~~ So why did I post this? ~~(Not for networking purposes)~~ I just want ~~other job seekers to apply for apprenticeships/trainee positions so there is fewer competition on posted jobs~~ to hear what other people have to say ~~(also r/dubai wasta)~~. 

So I guess my real questions are, civil engineers in Dubai, and UAE:

1. Good beer, where to buy them?

2. Should I apply for actual entry-level jobs or secure a trainee program/apprenticeship position in companies?

**TLDR**, went to UAE for vacation, fell in love with the country and currently torn between getting an entry-level job or securing an apprenticeship/trainee position in my industry.

EDIT: Formatting + added TLDR

PS: ~~PM me for my LinkedIn profile~~ Your replies are very much appreciated.

4jabfm,23,2016-05-14,Now this is how you start a career.,ass_munch_reborn,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4jabfm/now_this_is_how_you_start_a_career/,"We were hiring for an intern.  We are a startup that is ""ramen profitable"", so we only pay $11/hour.  This is peanuts, we know it, so we basically wanted someone with no experience.  We needed to have someone come in and help with blog writing, marketing, slides, branding, social media presence, etc.  And we felt enthusiasm and desire trumps experience.

So, this kid comes in, a guy finishing his Sophomore year in Economics at a good, but relatively unknown University outside our area.  Did some minor stuff for a car dealership, a few minor ""marketing"" things (which meant handing out flyers, manning a booth).  Nothing that screamed hire me.

But when this guy came in, he talked about how he researched and dissected our product with his CS major friend, how he talked with a Business professor about a possible marketing strategy.  We gave him a 20 minute assignment to write a couple of paragraphs about a publicly known product, and he did tons of research, found out people who used that product, and got their personal feelings about.

He took time to understood the space we were in, asked questions that showed he wanted to learn more, ""e.g. what is our market segment"", etc.

He explained how he would use this experience to propel his career.  He explained that he was excited, and showed it by saying how learning ABC would improve his career by XYZ.  He said to us, point blank, that we were his first choice.

We got a few more resumes tricking in, and my initial thought was to keep looking and make a decision in a couple of weeks.  But this guy was perfect.  We immediately stopped the interview process and called him to say he's in.

As a junior, he can go out and say, ""hey, this product - I helped with the marketing strategy"", with concrete proof, when he looks for another internship in a year.  He's going to have a leg up over a whole bunch of people.  He will have exposure to a startup, will probably talk to VCs (as we are in the final stages of seed funding), work in a growing space, and make connections and possibly help with sales. 

Essentially, this guy's career is going to grow like gangbusters.  And why?  He took initiative.  He looked for places to improve his personal growth.  He showed excitement.  He cared about career growth - and mapped it to how it can help our company.  

This is how you get hired.  This is how you start a career.

EDIT: Well, apparently, I guess I'm evil for giving a Sophomore in college with virtually no experience an opportunity to help prove himself in something he wants to move into.  Giving him a sense of ownership instead of ordering him around makes me exploitative.  Giving him flexibility means I'm making him give develop our ""entire marketing strategy for peanuts.""  Apparently, paying $11/hour to an employee with virtually no experience who would help and train is wrong, and sophomores in college deserve twice that much.  I thought I was helping someone out since every entry level job wants experience.  But I guess I'm wrong.

I kept seeing posts of how ""entry level posts always require experience"" and ""I just graduated and I can't find a job"" and I wanted to give an example of what to do to beat this cycle.  But apparently, that is evil around here.  I wanted to show what it was like to get that ""first job"", how you can break into an industry with virtually no experience - how to get your foot in the door.  I had that experience (at $8/hour as Sophomore BTW), which led me to a very successful career (~$120K/year), I wanted to give someone else that experience ,that push, that foot in the door.

Now it sounds like /r/jobs is the new /r/relationships.  For those that think business are evil and rant about corporations, you beat me.  I'm out of here for good.  Spread your gospel.  I can see why some one like /r/van_the_recruiter left.  This forum just wants to circle jerk about how they can never get a job - not talk about the sacrifices you have to make to get the job.  I wanted to instill the fact that, no, you have to work your way up.  But alas, I can't.  To those that disagree with me - you won.  Congratulations.  I'm out of here for good."

4jadgf,5,2016-05-14,One of my [22F] closest friends [26F] randomly cut off all contact with me and our other friend [26F],vvml,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4jadgf/one_of_my_22f_closest_friends_26f_randomly_cut/,"I've worked at a company for 3+ years now both as an intern and part time through college and am now there full time post grad. 

During my time there I've met two wonderful girls.  Initially me and ""Diane"" worked on the same team and quickly became very close.  A year later, ""Leslie""  joined our team and we all three hit it off instantly.  About a year after that I moved to a different division in the company, but wasn't too far away (I'm just in the next building over). 

We all ate lunch together everyday and Diane asked both of us to be her bridesmaids in her wedding when she got engaged.   Of course we both accepted and then when I recently got engaged, I also asked them both to be in my bridal party to give you all an idea of how close we all were.  We all shared very personal info with each other as friends and had an amazing relationship.   We had a group text app and texted daily when we weren't at work, Leslie constantly invited us over to take her puppy out to get one, we literally were super close friends and beyond co-workers. 

About a month ago, Leslie came in and put in her two weeks notice and told Diane and I that it was because she got this amazing job offer elsewhere.  We were really sad that we wouldn't be working with one of our closest friends anymore, but we were super excited that she was gonna have such an amazing job.  I got her a nice going away gift and we talked about how we'd hangout more outside of work since we wouldn't be able to see her at work anymore. 

The end of her first week of her new job was also the weekend that we had planned to have Diane's Bachelorette Weekend.  We had all put in to have that Friday off since we'd be driving a few hrs to a different state for the weekend getaway.  Leslie told us that now instead she would meet us there Saturday morning since she didn't want to take the Friday off on her first week.  Totally understandable. 

As things would have it, something unfortunate came up for me and I couldn't drive down with the girls on Friday and I couldn't take my car since my fiance's had taken it on a business trip that weekend.  No problem, I'll just go down with Leslie, right?   That way she won't have to drive alone either.  Perfect! 

So I told Diane this and she wss fine with it and then I texted Leslie on Friday morning asking her if I could go down with her on Saturday.  I didn't get a reply right away but it didn't bother me too much since she had been really slow at replying to texts all week (a reply once every day compared to constant texting before).  I even called her earlier that week to confirm what things we needed to get for the Bachelorette weekend and she didn't pick up.  She told us it was because she wasn't allowed to have her phone at her new job. 

Friday afternoon, Leslie sends an email to Diane and I.  Which is a red flag for me because we've never emailed... It felt really.. Distant? 

The was short. It said:

Diane/OP,

I'm really sorry I haven't been communicating a lot the past week. I made the decision to move back to [her hometown, 3 hrs away].  I'm going through a lot right now.. things I would rather not explain but I know it's for the best.  I'm sorry, I know this is all so sudden.  Diane I'm sorry I'm not there.. I just have to do this.


Les 

Strange but... Okay... 

Immediately we were worried and thought maybe she and her bf (who is the reason why she moved to this area a few yrs ago to begin with) who she lives with broke up and she was moving home. 

For the next few weeks she didn't reply to any texts even tho we only texted a few times and mostly said that we support her and we're here if she needs us.  

After this I saw that she posted picture out at the bar with some of her college friends from back home and thought Ahh she loved back home but was a little annoyed she had time to go out but not reply to us, but I didn't say anything.  Nor did Diane.  Right after this she blocked us on all social media out of nowhere.  Without a word. 

Recently another coworker who wasn't close to any of us and has no idea this happened randomly mentioned that she saw Leslie at Target near work... So she didn't move back home? 

I have no idea what happened here and neither does Diane.  We honestly do not believe we've ever wronged Leslie in anyway.  Like truly.  We really loved and cared for her.  It hurts almost more than a break up that she would disappear out of nowhere and block us.  When she wasn't reply to texts and such we assumed she was busy but blocking us is something she intentionally did and I can't think of an excuse or explanation for it. 

I'm really just open to hearing any theories on what may have caused this. 

I apologize if I did this wrong.  It's my first post on this sub and also I'll add flair in the morning since I'm on mobile. 

Names have been changed, just in case (:

TL;DR A co-worker/super close friend/bridesmaid randomly disappeared and blocked me and our other friend.  We have no idea what happened to her.

I graduated college majoring in a liberal arts degree, and like a ton of people choosing that degree I have had trouble finding a ""real job"" aka one that pays enough where I can move out and be financially independent.  I was applying for jobs without success, and in the mean time I just worked at a fast casual restaurant.  I finally, after spending waaay too much time without success, started looking for jobs that weren't necessarily in my major.  I had an internship in college that was basically a marketing/general office kind (but the subject matter was dealing with my major), so I started applying for entry level jobs in both marketing but mainly like general office jobs.  This led to me being contacted by two different staffing agencies.

I was obviously aware of recruiters, but for some reason I never really thought about using them at all until I happened to apply for jobs listed at each recruiters website, which led to them contacting me.  I met with both, and both said they would contact me with any potential leads.  

I landed a temp-to-hire job with one recruiter, which I currently work now. It doesn't pay enough to live off of, but my plan was to work this job until I was offered permanent work and either a)accept the job if it paid well enough or b) decline the offer if it didn't but then use both recruiters again to try to land a better job, which should be possible with the added experience (the other recruiter was totally ok when I told her about this job and wished me luck and to contact her if things changed)- while also still applying for jobs within my major on the weekend in case I somehow actually got a job in my major.  I also planned, after like 3 months (or whatever people could suggest), of updating my resume with my current job so I could also apply for full time office jobs and maybe the added experience would help.  I know it's considered ""bad"" if you quit a temp job, but obviously if I got a permanent ""real job"" it would be understandable.

So now that the background is given, here's why I'm posting: the other day my manager was just shooting the shit with our team (~15 members) and was talking about how much more lax with dress code, breaks, etc is at our place compared to most jobs, and he remarked that it's because we're temps.  He then elaborated to say he's ok if members end up quitting the job without 2 weeks notices etc, because he basically admitted that this job is a resume builder and will not lead to advancement.  I did not ask explicitly, but from what he said compared to finding out how long other members have been employed etc, that this job apparently is one of those ""indefinitely temp"" jobs where they can get away saying it's to hire but they don't give an actual timeline because they really don't plan on hiring people to a permanent basis. 

So with these new facts, should I contact the other recruiter pretty much now?  At the time she was right about to try to market me to a startup that actually had a timeline and exact salary for when you were hired permanently (I wish that I could have got a definite answer in regards to maybe an interview through her, but I didn't really feel like I could take the chance of not accepting my current job when offered), so I know she has jobs available if I told her I didn't want another indefinite temp job like my current one.  Or should I wait and in the meantime try to get a definite answer in regards to when/if/how temps are hired to permanent at my job, or at least spend more time there to soften the blow of me going back to the other recruiter and quitting the temp job before it's done?  Although I obviously would like to support myself fully ASAP I'm not going to starve, my family is still ok supporting me as I get my career situation straightened out.

Thanks!

4jaqdr,658,2016-05-14,My Surgical Abortion Story,itllbe0kay,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/4jaqdr/my_surgical_abortion_story/,"Background: I'm 21, a junior in college (out-of-state public). My parents pay tuition, and I have a on-campus job, scholarships, and loans to pay for everything else (rent, textbooks, food, travel etc). I have a craniofacial disorder that has around a 3% chance of being passed down to any offspring. Also have severe depression and anxiety.

Took a pregnancy test on April 21 after being six days late, and it came up positive immediately. Went to my university's health center to confirm on April 22. After talking about it with the nurses at the health center, I decided to abort. Keeping the child was never an option: I am in no way shape or form ready to be a mom. Adoption was. My decision was based off of the fact that I was unwilling to carry a baby until mid-December, and I'm not physically or emotionally ready to do so. I have a prestigious summer internship and a whole semester of college I would have to go through pregnant. My depression is getting better, but I was afraid that going through the pregnancy would trigger it and even make it worse. Basically, I wasn't ready to put my life on hold to carry the child. Plus finances (pre-natal care, ultrasounds, eventual delivery) is too expensive for me. I'm already going to graduate with student loans, and already have been in medical debt from having mono in September 2014. So I made an appointment for a surgical abortion at Planned Parenthood on May 13. I decided on the surgical rather than the medical (pills) because of cost, rate of effectiveness, and recovery. I would have to wait until I was nine weeks along -- I was only six weeks at the time.

I told the dad on April 25 (he was away for the weekend). The dad and I had a drunk one night stand, we both have many mutual friends, and he said ""oh I can pull out"" andddddddd that worked out.......not well. The dad took it really well. He offered to drive me and pay for the whole procedure (425 dollars). I was really really grateful. 

The three weeks between finding out I was pregnant and having the abortion was awful. I had mood swings, cried for no reason, awful morning sickness (threw up at least three times a day), was always exhausted, and basically just a ball of stress and anxiety. I told one other person at my college (my little in my sorority) and my core group of 5 friends at home. One friend called me a ""baby murderer"" and actively tried to talk me out of it, while the other said ""I will always look at you differently now."" I get that they have their own opinions, but I was really hurt. 

Fast forward to the day of, the dad drives me 20 minutes to Planned Parenthood early in the morning (I was the first appointment of the day) and the appointment was basically broken up into six parts.

1) Ultrasound: They determined I was 8 and a half weeks pregnant with only one fetus. I did not see the ultrasound.

2) Medical tests: They took my blood pressure and checked to see my blood type &amp; if I was anemic. I'm O+ and I didn't need an extra shot since I wasn't negative. I also wasn't anemic.

3) Counseling: Basically asked me if I've considered all my options, if I'm being forced to do this, if I have support etc.

4) Pills: They gave me Xanax for anxiety, some pain medication, and an antibiotic.

4.5) Morning sickness: I ended up throwing up right outside the bathroom door (thanks morning sickness) because I couldn't get the lock code to open. Whoops.

5) The actual procedure. The pain was worse than my worst period cramps, but bareable. Was very lightheaded and nauseous after.

6) Recovery. Stayed in recovery for about 15-20 minutes. They gave me ginger ale and crackers, as well as a heating pad for my cramps. When I felt better, I left.

The nurses/doctors at Planned Parenthood were all so supportive and I couldn't have made it through this without their support, the support of the dad, and the support of my friends. Although crampy, I feel like I made the right decision for me &amp; I'll become a mom when I'm ready :)"
4jasrn,7,2016-05-14,I need to find a software job in Europe within the next few months from my current location in Taiwan.,AdamLazaruso,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4jasrn/i_need_to_find_a_software_job_in_europe_within/,"Here's the situation!

I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering in June 2014. As part of that degree I completed a year long internship as a software developer, although to be honest I didn't get a lot out of it as the company didn't have a ton of work for me to do. I decided to take a break from software and I've been an English teacher here in Taiwan ever since.

In September I'm getting married and we plan to move to Europe, because she's Filipina and it'll be much easier for her to get a visa there than in my native UK. Since I don't really have any other skills (except English teaching, which pays very little in Europe) I'd like to go back to software.

The only problem is that I'm not finding it easy to find a job! I haven't given up on software completely in the two years since I graduated and I've completed a few personal projects (including an Android app) in that time but a lot of 'Junior' roles that I've looked at seem to want two years professional experience or something crazy like that. I've applied for plenty of advertised jobs I've seen and most haven't even bothered to reply. I had an interview with a company last week but they rejected me because they felt that I didn't have enough experience for their Junior role.

Does anyone have any advice on how I might be able to make myself more attractive to employers given my situation? One of the problems as well is that since I'm currently in Taiwan I can't attend an in-person interview or anything. I'm continuing to work on projects in my spare time but as I'm also working full-time at the moment I don't have a lot of time to make anything really great.

Any help or advice on this would be much appreciated."

I have been with Mike for over two and a half years and I love him to bits, he's been my rock through tough family times and never fails to make me fall about laughing. He's the funniest, oddest, most caring man ever.


However, I've always suffered with severe jealousy and insecurity issues regarding Mike. He has done nothing to trigger them apart from being an attractive and friendly guy, it just sets my mind wild. We talk about this often and we have been progressively been working through it but I've suddenly been offered the opportunity to work for a particular dream internship in an amazing country (all expenses paid)


 I know for certain my mind will be running wild and I will miss him horribly. Sure I will have Skype etc but I tend to let crazy thoughts creep in and have a horrible habit of stalking his social media profiles to see his activity and who he's talking to. I know well this is just going to drive me up the wall and possibly spoil this amazing opportunity.


I'd like to add that I've grown up in an abusive home and I've been diagnosed with anxiety disorder. 


I don't want to reveal much more info than that but basically I'm wondering how I am meant to handle not seeing him and worrying about him possibly being approached and tempted by other women (I feel so stupid and silly typing that out)? Everything was getting better and now I'm suddenly so anxious about this trip and how I'll just drive myself crazy.


I'm thinking of just disabling my Facebook, Tumblr and Instagram accounts, but is there something I can do or say to myself when I'm feeling anxious that'll help? 



TL;DR: I have serious insecurity and (unnecessary) jealousy problems and am leaving my boyfriend for 8 weeks. What can I do to stop driving myself crazy and spoiling this amazing work opportunity? "
4jazvb,0,2016-05-14,[F4A] The Basic Protocol [BBC],CrowmeatDPP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4jazvb/f4a_the_basic_protocol_bbc/,"""War"" may be a bit of an exaggeration, but anyone who claims that Western society is living in racial harmony has their head buried in the sand. Just turn on the news, the US, Europe, it's the same story everywhere. It's not anyone's fault, really- we're genetically designed to associate with those like us. But we're also designed to compete and conquer...

Let's introduce the Black Broadcast Capitalist Enterprises. International underground firm that is part of almost every market imaginable. News broadcasting, commercials, auctioning, farming, construction, law, politics, the film industry, sports... Everything. Though they always have cover-ups, ghost companies used to hide them from true sight. Most of the world has slowly been taken over by BBCE, and now they control enough to start moving.

Nearly every employee for the BBCE and their underling companies is of African descent, and the ones that aren't are very attractive white girls. Well, they weren't very attractive white girls at the start, but the BBCE works in the research industry and the cosmetic industry, and also the plastic surgery industry. They are very attractive now. Though they don't date, they deny any man that talks to them. Apart from a black man. And then if a girl talks to them, well, they'll introduce them to that high-paying secretary job at BBCE, and the cycle continues...

Now, however, they can start their original goal. To make the Black Race supreme. They've always been working towards this goal. Money is funneled into interracial porn productions, sent as child support payments to Black men and the women they breed, used to fund tuition for Black students to attend historically white colleges and universities and support the propaganda spewing Tumblr blogs they write filled with smut. In fact, BC Enterprises is the largest source of funding for the advancement of the Black race the world has ever seen- and it's working. Only, they are ready to launch a new initiative.

the Basic Protocol. Designed to target basic white girls, ones that are cute and the ones that are stunningly hot, the goal is that by the end of the year, nearly every white girl will dream of BBC stretching them out and being filled with the superior sperm. Of course, that takes time... And testing. If people suddenly get suspicious of the copious amounts of interracial porn that they can watch, targeted towards them in particular... No, the BBCE got to where they are now by patience and waiting. They were slaves by these stupid white men, now they'll enslave them. Only, they won't realize they are being enslaved until all their women are breeding black children and every job is taken by the superior black race.

The BBCE control everything, as mentioned above. And when I say everything... I truly mean everything! Every market, every business, everything is managed and monitored. If the BBCE want a famous celebrity to go black, for example Kim Kardashian... They start to influence her. Replace her friends' thoughts and let her friends convert her. Whisper in her ear. And then they put down their hand-made celebrity Kanye West to sweep in and finish the job. Now, millions of teens on instagram look up to Kim, and her sexy black husband...

This is only an example. The first step to the project is to pick a fresh target. I am sure that you boys can find a nice picture of a pretty girl who is ready to be tested and moulded into her ideal image! Then, the influence begins. Start replacing boys in her school with black ones, have her watch her crush get beaten up by a gang of muscular black guys. Surround her with pretty black men and... Her friends. Her friends will be converted in advance, on a more... Enhanced version of the protocol. Sped up. Her friends already love black cock and eagerly work for BBCE. They giggle and point out things like how much bigger and more dominant black men are...

And then they steer it towards sexual conversation. Is it true that black men are bigger? Is it true that once you go black, you can't go back? Stuff like this. Questions that keep our target up at night, pondering about them... At this point, we'll begin to convert her family. Take the men of the house out, her brothers and father, replace them with a new black step-father. This is a long process, but the black agent who will play as the step-father will begin to play subliminal messaging and hypnotic videos that are disguised as films. Ones that get her horny as the sex scenes get steamier, the ones that make her close her eyes at night, but not for sleeping.

Then we amp it up after a few weeks of this. After this amount of time, she's into black guys. But still into whites... And that can't do. We'll make her give a BJ or have sex with a white guy and his tiny penis, and then afterwards, a few days later, have her accidently walk into her step-father, or maybe find a beefed out black guy in the gym showers... Maybe asked on a date from the basketball player in school. And they'll get it on, slowly but surely.

She should have her first black cock within two weeks of amping it up. Then, we give her more black cock, and tiny white cock as well. From there, she'll make her choice. We'll get her addicted to the stunning pleasure of BBC, and then the BBCE will give her an internship at one of their prestigious offices, far away from her family. There, they'll pump her up into an airheaded bimbo secretary and... Rinse and repeat. Until they get the formula for the Basic Protocol down.

Then... They can release it upon the world.

---

The best message to me would be starting off the roleplay by writing about one of the girls. You'll play any man that comes up, and the world and how it reacts to the Basic Protocol, but also about the brainwashing and the effects it has on the four girls! So mentioning how they find themselves thinking about black men... Stuff like that. I'm more likely to ignore you if you don't write a response to the roleplay and get stuck in straight away, just because I can see your writing talent and whether we'll be a good match! "

Then I don't know what happened, I guess I got burnt out, and got a bad start with a math class (precalc) that made me feel like I was dumb. I didn't even understand the basic materials that everyone else did. Ended up dropping that class 2 weeks in but I couldn't get over the feeling of being dumb. 

So then I didn't read the 15 books we had to in literature class and failed that class. I fell behind in my programming class and got an F in that too. Then my one class I had a C+ in, accounting, I bombed the final with a 50% and then it brought my grade down to a 69.30% I thought he would make that a 70% because I showed up for class and went to his office hours but he didn't and I got a D+

I know it's not over and I'm not giving up but I feel like shit knowing this semester was basically a waste and now I'm even more behind than I already am. I just kind of feel like shit even though I like to think I'm on the right path (scored an internship again this summer). "

I got into a few but I've cut it down to these two schools. Below is a pros and cons list of each. Does anyone have a suggestion for which I enroll in?

Bucknell:

Pros
-More fun (parties)
-Liberal Arts which means smaller classrooms with more discussion based learning. I have ADD so I would benefit from this over classes that are just lectures.
-Nicer weather
-Smaller school
-Hotter girls
-Harder to get into
-Graduates of Bucknell get higher paying jobs on average than Binghamtion graduates. 

Cons
-I would graduate with 40k in debt which I would have to pay off myself
-Greek life is super big there (like 2/3 of students join). I would probably still rush.
-The public transportation isn't great

Binghamton:

Pros
-Better options for undergrad research and internships
-I wouldn't have to pay anything and would have leftover money for grad school
-Better housing
-Free buses from the college to the city of Binghamton that run often

Cons
-not as fun as Bucknell
-A lot of kids from my high school are going
-Big
-According to a lot of people it's very easy. I'd prefer a more challenging school.

So which school should I choose?"

I've got another week to cram some Linux knowledge and also some knowledge of proprietary software they use into my head, then I have one or two weeks with their Intern IT who can probably teach me a bit. After that I'm on my own. All of my previous IT contacts have zero knowledge of Linux as well, so I'm essentially going to be just diving into this completely alone. 


I'm going to be the sole IT/Administrator managing several servers and probably over 50 workstations. Along with various mobile devices and peripherals. Oh and it's not just Linux. They have mac, Linux, and Windows servers/devices. I also don't know shit about mac, but they said it's not a big deal. The good news is that it's a game developing company, so most of the users are pretty tech savvy..which should cut down on the time I have to fix silly problems (queue memories of chiefs/officers demanding I fix ""my shitty broken computer"" immediately. Sir, the internet cable is unplugged)


Any advice on what to do besides the Linux institute? I'm fairly confident I can ""fake it 'til I make it"" as long as nothing breaks. I plan on working long hours learning the systems, and hope I can get a bit of training from the Technical Director (he took over the duties of the administrator when they lost theirs), but he's incredibly busy and I don't want to be tugging on his arm all the time asking for help. He's aware that I don't know shit about Linux, but somehow I convinced him and the CEO that I can learn it. Thanks ahead of time for any advice.

I have no where left to talk. Please please please don't remove this. I have no where else to go.

Post: I am NOT suicidal, let's get that out of the way here and now. But if I were hit by lightning right now I think I would be the happiest motherfucker on the planet. I am giving up. The one thing that I want, love is beyond my reach. In spite of every single last effort I've gone to.

I am a 24 year old gay guy who has been ""out"" since I was 16. I was on apps since 18 like POF and ok cupid and manhunt and I have been trying since then to find someone to love who also loved me. Nothing has worked. I am now on growlr and scruff and a great many more. Nothing has worked.

Further.  I have been in university for over 7 years now. I just 2 weeks ago began my internship as a software engineer making medical and surgical equipment. So I just began that page of my life.  For those interested my degrees were: neuroscience -&gt; medicine -&gt; dropped out of medicine because I was too much of a bleeding heart and went into COMPSCI. 

But being serious this entire time I've been trying I haven't been successful at all. 

I have gone to FABAlberta events and even joined as a member during their summer events last year. Know what happened? I was sat in a back corner and then was told I wasn't welcome. In the BEAR COMMUNITY that preaches about love and acceptance.  Which for the record I love bears.

I'm going to be serious.  I am a white guy with pretty damn bad acne scars. Still sometimes break out. Ivery worked out 6 days a week for over 3 years now. Yet because of the scars and other facial imperfections I am treated as a second class citizen.

I have gone to my universitysurprise gay group and was sat alone there too. I've been to a bunch of other gay mixers and it's all been the same. I am not welcome and I am not even tolerated. Because I am not hot I am discarded as a whole and as a human being.

I am told on apps like growlr in response to messages as simple as ""Hey how are you doing?"" To go and die and other horrifically cruel shit. Anything else dies off 2 or so messages after.  Even in the middle of a concord.  Drops dead at the snap of one's fingers. 

So I give up. I don't want to do anything  anymore.

Why should I go to the gym? Today I did lrg day and my legs already are feeling busted. It is a waste of time. No guy wants me so why should I spend so much money on my diet, so much time at the gym, so much effort and exhaust myself at the gym.... for nothing? I don't even get joy out of it anymore because I see gay couples there and I get jealous and depressed and just want to quit.

I also don't know why I have my position. I feel like I enjoy the job... I really truly do love it. But why am I doing that? So I can pay taxes like a good little tax payer ? Without love why bother making m9ney? I don't give a rats ass if I live in a cardboard box eating frigging beans every day. 

And I am thinking of quitting all the other shit I do. I don't see a point.

Me? I just want to quit it all and go on welfare and spend all my money on beer and be permanently drunk.  There is nothing I want other than love. No video game, no sport, no ANYTHING can fill that void inside of me.

Literally all I want is someone to love me. Without that I seriously do not grasp the concept nor the point of why I should bother with anything. I want love. 

Hell I've even offered to pay a guy a 50k salary if he dated me on kijiji. Know what happened there? Only response I got was from a 60 year old guy who didn't even give way fuck. 

Oh and there is more.  A year ago in December I fell in love with a guy who ended up raping me. Drugging me to keep me there only to rape me a second time. 

Wooo that is my greatest relationship achievement.  Getting fucking raped and drugged. I regret being upset with him and breaking up because honestly? He was the best I ever had and all I ever could have had.

So should I just quit and go on welfare? I seriously don't know why I should keep trying. 
Insanity is constantly doing the same goddamned Bullshit and expecting different results. I am under no delusions that anyone could fucking love me."

I'm not sure why I'm posting. I started watching this sub about two months ago and I've been pleasantly surprised by the comments on here (In a good way, I guess). I guess I'll start somewhere...

I figured out that I had a bigger problem with depression and anxiety around a year ago by my old roommate, who's girlfriend had hinted to him that I had been showing signs of depression whenever they hung out at our place. I had a rough last couple of semesters (To the point where I had actually accumulated a medical condition via stress), which led to me being more angry and abrasive toward my roommate, which I still apologize for, he was a good friend and I should've been nicer to him and asked for help, I guess.

During school I had worked at a theater that was pretty great, except for a couple of things: being made fun of for mistakes that I had made or things that I had said. I'm not good at jokes and most of the time I get the punchlines wrong and anytime I messed up (Which felt like all the time) they would joke about it, which made me feel like utter shit and like I couldn't do anything right. But I tried to work as hard as I could and tried to do the right things at the right time. Some of them had told me that the jokes were just to help me realize my mistakes and to correct them, which I get and I knew I take jokes personally, which I've tried to realize more and more, but when you get made fun of for hours on end, my mental strength just couldn't take it and I would start taking everything personally again. So nights were pretty rough for me mentally. Even my boss made fun of me for things that I had done...

Side Note: I got an internship at a festival and accidentally got too drunk and blacked out (Was 20yo at the time and was stupid) and got a nickname from it, which lasted till the end of my college career. Which made me feel like shit as well because I regretted it so hard even though I try not to regret anything that I do and have tried to be a better person and learn as much as possible. I never got asked back to that festival even though I had enjoyed working there very much and still talk to a lot of my coworkers that have gone to do other things or have gotten asked back. It's really bugged me and paranoided? me that I haven't been asked back even though people told me I was a joy to work with. 

... Anyway, I moved back in with my parents after graduation and got a part time job at a church, which is nice, I guess. Most of my friends that graduated had jobs lined up and have gone on to do some pretty cool things, but I just feel stuck and am afraid that I can't get anywhere from here. 

For the first two months, january and february, my day was getting up at 10am-12pm, playing video games and doing a couple of chores around the house till my parents came home, then I get scolded for not doing more and being more motivated...

Side Note 2: By now I had realized I have depression and anxiety and had been going to a college therapist for about 6 months and had been looking for another one around my parent's. Most of my depression and anxiety is based in inadequacy as a man, employee, son, which has come from my father, who has all the signs of paranoia anxiety and when I was young and made a mistake, he would tell me what I did wrong about 15 times, differently every time. But I digress...

... I hated being told to do things by my parents because I had absolutely no motivation. I tried to tell them that I'm not going to be motivated if they keep bugging me about doing this and that and they eventually stopped, probably due to trying too hard. I got really into educating myself on my depression and thought about it a lot and discovered that I had panic attacks whenever a girl that I didn't know started to flirt with me when my parents or someone was around. I felt/feel like less of a man and have a fear that I'll never find a girl that will put up with me. 

So, my dad currently treats me like an employee because I've been helping him out with yardwork and such and he gives me advice about how to get a job (I have long hair) and trying to give me advice he's told me 3000 times before in different ways and it's exhausting. On the other hand, my mom is extremely controlling and cynical. She doesn't have depression and doesn't understand it and thinks that there's gotta be a pill or a therapist with the right ""Treatment"" or ""Trick"" that will ""fix"" me. Which I have repeatedly told her that that doesn't exist since we don't even know enough about the human brain than we do about space. She's also one of those people that if you go up to her with a personal problem, she'll say to your face, ""Get over it"" which I grew up with and hurt me to no end. I enjoy video games a lot and I enjoy playing with my friends online a lot. It makes me feel good and it's helped with my anger management (Which I got from my dad as well. Yay parents handing down personallity triats), but they don't see video games in the same light. They think it's horrible and, granted, I've tried not to play a whole lot during the day, but it's my passion and it's what I want to do as a job someday (Sound for Games). I feel like my whole family thinks that about video games because whenever I'm really passionate about one, they're not that interested or look like their really listening. Which is why I usually try not to seem too interested in video games around them anymore, which makes me demotivated to start learning how to get into the video game business.

I've realized that my parent's house isn't a good environment for me and have tried to figure out ways to get a place for my own, but haven't really been fruitful. I've created a place for myself in my room where I like to go whenever I'm emotionally exhausted from my parents and their not too happy when I stay there longer than they think I should. 

Sorry for the long post. I'll leave you alone forever now."

I've never been so far down before. I transferred to a damn tough school, doing computer science, worked my ass off on a side project and portfolio website, and even landed an internship for this summer.

But after all that I let my guard down. Three years of hard work and I let it all turn to shit this one quarter. It wasn't because my mom was sick. I wasn't depressed. I just got distracted by Dark Souls 3. I haven't extensively played video games in years. And the one time I do, everything is a mess.

I got a 50% of my hardware midterm. My easier elective classes I've neglected as well. I am clueless in my operating systems class. I could drop a class and hope to get by with the other two, and work double time either summer or fall.

I fucked up and I feel like shit. I know it's my fault. I honestly wish a car would hit me or I end up comatose or something so I'd have a better excuse. I'm not as smart or disciplined as the other students and I probably don't deserve to be here. Maybe that's just impostor syndrome talking, but maybe it's true. I've never had an A in a course where it mattered.

****tl;dr: Don't be like me. I didn't think it would happen to me, but it did. Focus on your classes and don't try to take on the challenge of having kryptonite around your neck. It's probably better to toss it away in some cases, whatever it may be (drugs, gambling, whatever).****"

4jeh0p,7,2016-05-14,Please help me understand this guy,Amelia_94,AskIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/4jeh0p/please_help_me_understand_this_guy/,"Okay, so I know that I can’t necessarily find the answers to my problems on Reddit. Perhaps there is no real answer but I want some completely, honest, opinions from strangers. First of all, to understand my boyfriend and secondly to understand better the culture so I can make a more informed decision about what I should do. I am adding a lot of details in this topic because I want the whole story to be known by those giving their opinions. Please, I hope nobody is offended by how long this topic is. 

I am 21 years old girl from a Western, English-speaking country. I have an Indian boyfriend, my age, who I met online and I travelled to India to meet him, on his request. Ever since we met, we have talked for hours every day, and we have a very strong connection. That’s why I travelled to India to meet him. We had a very nice time, and laugh so much together. After that I developed trust in him because he took care of me. I went back to my country because we are both still in college. I wanted to see him more, not just once in a while when I can go overseas so I really hoped we could live near each other. He said the future is hard because of family things but he can’t hurt me. At that time he was staying in South India for an internship although he is from Rajasthan.

When he went back to Rajasthan, his younger brother found out, from looking through his phone, and my boyfriend started acting badly and said we don’t have a future. I was crying a lot. I have Indian friends in my country but they are westernised and they believe in love. I didn’t know that parents over there go crazy and didn’t know marriage is forced over there. When I cry and tell him I’m breaking up, he tells me he will he will do something and everything will be okay. 

I don’t expect his parents to ever accept, since they are from villages and don’t really speak English. They have never met a foreigner so I can hardly expect them to swallow this. But still, I can’t agree in racism and I can’t think that it is wrong for people who come from different countries to love each other so I keep in the relationship. I don’t have a problem with them, even though they won’t accept me, I already understand a lot of Hindi and would easily learn more just to talk to them, I want to help him and his family have a good life. My family is also from a rural area here, and they are very accepting of other cultures. I don’t see why there should be a double standard for Indians. 

What’s more, many of the people in his family seem to have bad marriages and even I know other Indians who have had their lives ruined because of marriage. His cousin’s wife takes all his money and does nothing to help him or his family and my boyfriend’s own mother had an extra-marital affair, something that has traumatised him and he still can't speak about. I really can’t see how it could be worse for him to be with me, who loves him selflessly, I am hard-working, educated, vegetarian (they are vegetarian), and have the same spiritual beliefs as him. I lived with Indian friends since I started college here, and I picked up their habits, learned cooking and beliefs.  

He says we have no chance in India and he just has to go to my country and his parents might understand that way because now he has only been in India, they will think he is crazy and it will be too much shock. I somewhat agree with this. I am worried about the prospects of anyone living in India, since there’s bad pollution, and people seem to be struggling to find work and quality education. His own father lost his job recently and just stays at home depressed since there's little chance of him finding another one. 

But then he says things like he doesn’t like speaking English or doing something weird (because there are not many foreigners in India, everyone was staring at me) and he thinks that he won’t like my country because he will be lonely and it will be too clean and boring. He also mentioned a few things about my appearance sometimes and then he says he doesn’t care but his family will care about it. He seems to just be trying to lower my confidence. I don’t know what the hell he is thinking saying things like this but it just makes me think he is a complete idiot. 

Another of his arguments is (since he worships Bhagavad Gita) is that everything in this world is just a prison and nothing in this world is real happiness so fighting for love is just senseless when the only love that should matter is love of God. I also have similar spiritual beliefs to him so I somewhat agree with this but I say that You still can’t justify marrying another girl on that principle and I don’t think people are meant to be alone and he is not doing anything else enough to live by God besides being veg so I don’t think he can justify hurting me as some spiritual act. 

He sometimes says he wants to stay together but not as a permanent thing and that i should just accept when he gets married but I tell him I can’t imagine what kind of nightmare that will be and don’t think I will recover from that trauma and to me that is not love and just a waste of time. But still, he won’t let me go, every time I break up, he keeps trying to convince me, and sometimes he really cries when he thinks he’s losing me. I just don’t understand him. Now I have already booked a ticket to come meet him again in India, and he just talks about how hard the future is which makes me feel sad because I am spending all my holidays and a lot of money (since I am still a student) to meet him and now I am seriously thinking of cancelling my ticket and not talking to him again.

Everyday I’m just thinking of the nightmare of when his parents want him to get married, wondering how I will possibly handle that. I am a very loving person, I can’t just move on easily and can’t imagine ever trusting someone again after this. Please tell me: does this guy sound like an idiot or is he good? Does he sound like he will hurt me? How do I handle this?

According to the APFT calculator, I am currently at a 255, so not maxing, but decent (from what I've seen.) I'm looking to improve to a 270 in the coming months, but I'm not sure at what point in the OCS process the APFT is taken.

I plan on chatting with an Army recruiter within the week about putting together an OCS packet, but I'm unsure as to what I should expect right off the bat.

My main concerns as of right now, are the following:

- I have no leadership experience outside of the classroom

- I still have a semester left in college before my 4 year (technically 4 1/2 thanks to shitty transfer credits not actually transferring) 

- My APFT calculated is only a 255, but as I mentioned, I have no idea if this even matters right now as I'm not sure when I will need to take an official APFT. 

That being said, I do hold myself up well both socially and physically, I'm a good interviewee (at least I believe I am,) I've landed two internships at a very large company in two different IT fields, one database focused and the coming internship cybersecurity focused, and my GPA is a 3.3 (not fantastic, but respectable.) 

So while I'm hoping to get some insight from some officers that have gone through the process (or better yet, recruiters that have brought canidates through the process,) any advice or personal insight to my situation with the information I've given is totally welcome.

So just in case you need a general question to answer:

- What are my chances of getting into OCS? Is there anything I can do in the coming months to improve my chances? What should I know going in, above all else, that I may not already know?

Thanks for your time guys."

I graduated from university a couple years ago and after working full time in an industry I'm not too fond of, I have finally decided to quit my job come September and attend law school in BC. I'm looking for some advice on the best way to manage my finances and maximize my eligible amount for government student loans. By the end of August I will have roughly:

- $5k in ETFs in my TFSA
- $7k of my current company's stock through a Registered ESPP
- $7k in my chequing account.

My parents have told me that if necessary they are willing to lend me up to $20,000 interest free on an as-needed basis, which I am hoping would either not be necessary or I would only use at the end of my education to help reduce interest payments on student debt.

Total estimated cost per year: 10,500 tuition + 2000 misc school expense (textbooks etc) + 12,000 (9 months living expenses) = $24,500 x 3 years

I will most likely be working in the summers but I do not want to rely too much on this income in my budget in case I can't find an internship or want to take time off to volunteer/travel etc.

I am fully aware that with my current level of savings I will be graduating with significant debt. I considered working an extra year to save more, but after weighing the costs and benefits it seems like a better idea to take the risk since there is a good chance I will find a higher paying job after I graduate and I will not accumulate interest on government debt until I do.

I guess my main questions are:

- What are the chances I will be able to get government student loans that fully cover my expenses for all 3 years? I'm hoping to stay away from line of credits since there is no grace period on the accumulation of interest. Is there any kind of resource that can give me an estimate of how much I can expect to be eligible to borrow?

- Without committing fraud obviously, is there anything I can do to maximize my chances of receiving a higher government loan for the next three years? For example, will it make a difference for my application next year if I sell all my investments and put them toward my tuition for the year as opposed to holding onto them?

- under the Lifelong Learning Plan, it seems I can  borrow up to $10,000 from an RRSP to pay for full time education. My current plan is to sell my shares in my RESPP and transfer the funds to a newly set up RRSP account through my bank, and then borrow the full amount of the RRSP through the lifelong learning plan. I don't expect there will be tax on any of this. Are there any faults with this plan?

I still would like to study but I (most likely) can't anymore (at university). I don't mind working, but as for now I am pretty lost on what to do. I would like continue on with what I'm currently studying (Graphic Design), but maybe looking for a different way to go about it?

-Finding an internship (but doubtful I would get one without having finished my studies)

-Online university (not sure if you're able to find courses like graphic design here)

I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering in June 2014. As part of that degree I completed a year long internship in Germany as a software developer, although to be honest I didn't get a lot out of it as the company didn't have a ton of work for me to do. I decided to take a break from software and I've been an English teacher here in Taiwan ever since.
In September I'm getting married and we plan to move to Germany, because she's Filipina and it'll be much easier for her to get a visa there than in my native UK. Since I don't really have any other skills (except English teaching, which pays very little in Europe) I'd like to go back to software.

The only problem is that I'm not finding it easy to find a job! I haven't given up on software completely in the two years since I graduated and I've completed a few personal projects (including an Android app) in that time but a lot of 'Junior' roles that I've looked at seem to want two years professional experience or something crazy like that. I've applied for plenty of advertised jobs I've seen and most haven't even bothered to reply. I had an interview with a company last week but they rejected me because they felt that I didn't have enough experience for their Junior role.

Is there a reasonable chance that I could get a software developer job in Germany with little professional experience as an English speaker, from my current location in Taiwan (via Skype interview, ideally)? What would be the best way for me to go about finding a job in Germany?

Any help or advice with this would be much appreciated."

So following some feedback I decided to spread the uploads horizontally rather than vertically ( more columns ). I hope it ends up looking nice.    
Added the stream secion and I hope it looks ok. I don't know how popular it will be but it's something.  
Should I upload streams like the 31 mins one?   
I'm not really a twitter/instagram person so it's kinda hard to not stay up to date with everything James/Aleks post, I just notice what's on the subreddit. What would you consider ""newsworthy"" ?  
Everything that is related to cowchop is getting posted on the subreddit by others.
I feel weird referring to Joe as Intern Joe but it wouldn't be the same without the intern part.  
  
Also moved the updates from 2AM to around 8-10AM CST time.

MIT:
1) Is the undergrad as rigorous as said by many other forums (i.e. Yconic, StudentAwards, etc.)? I know it's a lot of essay writing but is it really that hard, or does it just so happen that a majority of students do not manage their time well?
2) I am aware that there is a curve, however how hard would it be to maintain an 80%/+ in the program? 
3) How was your overall experience in the program? What did you enjoy and what type of content were you exposed to?
4) How hard was it to land an internship first year, second year, etc. (It can be within MIT's internship opportunities or outside)

AEO/HBA:
1) Is a dual degree worth it at Ivey? I know Ivey HBA is ideal for those who want to go into financing/consulting, but otherwise is it worth the tuition? (I have received offers for Schulich, Queens and Rotman + do not have a large amount of uni funds but don't mind making the sacrifice).
2) How tough was it to maintain the 80% admission average and be involved with clubs (Also how many clubs would I have to lead/join just to be safe)?

I'm a sophomore in high school. I applied to a (fairly competitive) summer program, and on April 20th, I was notified of my rejection from the program. I've crafted an email requesting feedback on my application, to be sent to the program directors. Does my email seem polite, or pushy? Is it too lengthy? Is it too late to send this email now? How can I express my gratitude more clearly? What can I change about this email to increase my changes of getting a reply? Thank you all for your help.

&amp;nbsp;

Subject Title: A Request for Feedback on [Program] Application

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Dear [Program Director],
  
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Hello! I'm [APCS Trash], a sophomore from [APCS Trash High School]. I submitted an application to [Program] this year, and was notified that I was not selected as a candidate for the 2016 program.  

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Firstly, thank you again for reviewing and considering my 2016 application to [Program]. Choosing applicants each year is an undoubtedly difficult job, and your time and efforts on behalf of the [Program] applicants are greatly appreciated.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

I was initially disheartened by my denial from [Program], but self-betterment is the motto! There is a chance to learn and to grow from every mistake, and I would like to turn this rejection into an opportunity to reach out again and ask if you had any additional feedback on my application — anything you noticed that could be changed or improved on. I would truly be beyond grateful for any small piece of criticism or personal insight you have to offer, whether it's a weakness in my academic performance or a flaw in my essay writing style.  

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Hindsight is definitely 20/20, and looking over my application again, some potential flaws become apparent: I stated that my ""summer availability is subject to change""  because I applied to other summer programs, which demonstrates a lack of commitment and interest (not a smart decision!); I did not write an essay about my interest in Biomolecular Engineering, which again suggests indecisiveness and irresponsibility; I only very briefly touched on my experience at [Other Affiliated Program] last year, and barely connected it to what I wanted to gain from [Program]. Is this analysis well-founded? If you have the time to answer, what are other areas of weakness in my application? I hope to improve myself, both as a student and as an applicant, and a different perspective on my application would help immensely with identifying errors to avoid in the future. Again, I want to express my enormous gratitude for a few minutes of your time and a quick skim of my application.  

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

I'm not sure whether my 2016 application is still accessible, so I have attached my application essays (verbatim) in a PDF document below just in case.
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;


I completely understand if you have other priorities; I hope that my request is not a burden to you, but rather a small task to tackle in your spare time. Thank you again for making this year's [Program] program possible, and a final thank-you for providing this incredible internship opportunity to high schoolers from all over the nation!

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;


Sincerely,  
APCS Trash"

Now on to why I'm here today; recently I heard from some interns at the hospital that osrs is back and I thought heck why not give it a shot again.

Unfortunately, my excitement was crushed when I tried to log in and it said 'your account has been disabled'. I thought maybe it was a security measure because I hadn't played in a while, but when I went to the message centre it said ""ICU Major (Bug abuse) June 06 2006"". However, this could not have been me because remember I quit to go to medical school. After doing a quick Google search it seems that I was hacked and the hacker committed the falador massacre and got my account banned. 

If you look at the account you will clearly see that I must have been compromised by a different IP sometime late May. After all, why would I risk all my hard work and green partyhat? Please let me know how I can get this reviewed by a jmod. Thanks.

4jgyrj,57,2016-05-15,Scored my first programming internship!,purethoughtndeeds,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4jgyrj/scored_my_first_programming_internship/,"TL;DR: Decided to double major in CS, worked really hard in a Biology course, professor noticed me, I got a spontaneous job interview and got an internship.

I've been perusing /r/cscareerquestions for about a year now, and I am extremely grateful for the excellent advice and insight given on here. I'd like to share my mini success story with you all today.

I currently attend a top public university and entered three years ago as a film major hoping to specialize in virtual effects. I felt that the degree was not opening the doors I wanted and I had a very high unfulfilled interest in science and computing, so my third semester I enrolled in a Computer Science minor. Since then, I excelled in four programming classes and built up a neat little portfolio, but when I started looking at careers I found that a CS major would open more doors for me.

So after browsing this subreddit obsessively and rethinking my life, I decided to add a second Computer Science major to my degree, though it would add three semesters to my track.

My university has one of the most competitive CS programs in the nation, so the internal transfer process is ridiculously tedious. I had to take two non-CS science courses and a Calculus course, along with two essays to be considered for admission for this Fall. I had already taken two introductory biology courses for non-majors, but I had to take it AGAIN at major's level to be considered for admission.

I thought it would be a piece of cake since I had already had plenty of exposure to the subject, but boy was I wrong.

Bio ended up being an extremely difficult course, and the professor really worked us hard. But, my professor had great teaching methods I had not quite seen before, and in class he heavily utilized a classroom participation application that he created.

The professor took note of me because of my perfect attendance and my class participation, and after a class in which he recommend a book on cognitive psychology that interested me, I came up to speak to him about it. I told him about my double major and all that jazz, and he said he could try to get me programming work experience.

So at the end of the semester, as I was taking my challenging Biology final, the professor placed a card on my desk with his company's name and told me to meet him in a specific location on campus immediately afterwards. I was going to take my Calculus final in 6 hours, so my mind was mainly on that and I didn't know what to expect.

So I get to this place, and it turns out to be the office for his start-up. I am introduced to the team of software engineers by the CEO (who is the son of my professor) and I'm asked to talk about my background. Then the CEO asks me to show him my work, which I was not expecting. So I show him my chatroom and web applications I built from scratch, and in my code I had some cuss words and unprofessional comments because I had never expected anyone to see my code (but thankfully, he was chill and thought it was quite funny).

Then I'm given a marker and asked to solve a programming problem on the whiteboard. I was extremely nervous and took about 30 minutes to solve it, since I was not expecting a spontaneous interview, and was in between my two hardest finals of the semester. I finished the problem correctly, though it wasn't the most efficient algorithm, but he seemed satisfied with it and bode me farewell.

Two days later I receive word that I've received a summer internship for this software start-up, and they will consider me for paid employment for the Fall.

Only because I had taken the advice from this subreddit, worked hard to build up my personal projects and double major in CS and had an understanding of what a programming interview would be like, did I obtain this internship. 

So this is the perfect foot in the door for my first software-building experience, and I wanted to thank you all for your advice and support!

4jh94j,23,2016-05-15,Would anyone here be willing to review my code?,pill5b3rry,iOSProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/4jh94j/would_anyone_here_be_willing_to_review_my_code/,"Hi all,

I have a small project that I need to submit for an internship I applied to. It's relatively simple: gets user's current location, makes request to JSON (Meetup.com API) url using the user's zip code, pulls and parses that data and then displays it onto a tableview. There's also a detail view.

The app works great but I want to make sure that the code is polished and that I'm doing things correctly before I submit.

Project is here: https://github.com/jeffmoran/NearbyTechMeetups

If anyone has any suggestions or feedback, that'd be greatly appreciated. I do plan on adding some comments throughout for documentation/organization purposes.

One of the things I'm struggling with is the AutoLayout on the detail view. Any help with that would also be appreciated.

Also, I know my API key is visible in the project. It's a free API so it isn't a big deal. I can always revoke the key if I need to.

Many thanks!"
4jha5q,21,2016-05-15,My story (long),br00kstone,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/4jha5q/my_story_long/,"I've been a lurker of this subreddit for a long time, but this is my first post. I can relate to many of the personal anecdotes I've read here, and I'm hoping likewise that at least some part of my story will resonate with any of you willing to listen. Warning: things are going to start off sounding very normie-ish, so please bear with me. I promise the ending is anything but a happy one for all of you cynics out there.

Let me begin by telling you a little about myself. I have many qualities that should be working for me in the dating world. I'm a Caucasian living in a densely populated area of the US. I don't possess any of the ""big 3"" characteristics that many women consider to be deal breakers - short, fat, and bald. I'm also very well educated (master of science in computer engineering) with a great career and not particularly socially awkward. None of this information is included as a humblebrag; I just want to paint a picture here.

I never really received any positive attention from girls while I was growing up. Like many people, I didn't date at all in high school and assumed that portion of my life would begin in college. I should also note that I was never given any significant reason to believe I was unattractive. Entering college, I actually felt that I was slightly above average looking.

The truth is, while I do have an attractive face, there are many other physical qualities that make me undateable to the vast majority of women. To name a few, I have a very ugly profile, an awful sounding voice, bad posture as the result of scoliosis that wasn't diagnosed until adulthood, skinny wrists that give the impression of toothpick arms, etc. It took the better part of a decade for me to discover some of the traits that women see wrong with me, and the truth is that I'm still looking for all of the rest.

When I turned 19, I started to realize that my KV status was becoming a little abnormal. Most of my friends were in relationships and would talk about the women who they were sleeping with at the time, and I could never relate. As an engineering major, it was difficult to meet women in school and so I decided to try my hand at online dating. I haven't been happy with my life since making this decision.

Remember, my face itself is not inherently unattractive, and the rest of my qualities look pretty good on paper. Couple that with the total ignorance of my FA'ness, and I was embarking on a long journey of heartbreak and disappointment.

I still remember my first date very vividly. I met her on YAHOO! Personals (which was popular at the time), and we spent several weeks chatting online and texting before finally agreeing to meet. By the time of our date, we had built a pretty strong connection. We would literally stay up until 4 or 5AM talking and had so much in common; I assumed at the time that this was the woman I would marry. Unfortunately, this couldn't have been farther from the truth.

When I eventually picked her up, I could visually see the disappointment on her face. We went to dinner, and she was extremely quiet and uncomfortable looking. Originally, we had made plans to go window shopping at the mall after grabbing something to eat, but she told me after dinner that she wasn't feeling well and wanted to go home. At this point, I started to realize she was not interested in me at all. By the time we got closer to her house, she actually made the comment that she felt like she was going to be sick. Of course, this was really just her way of ending the date early and making sure that I wouldn't try to kiss her. The next day, I texted her to say that I hoped she was feeling better, and I never received a response (or heard from her ever again, for that matter). This was my first broken heart and my first experience with being ghosted.

Over the next 5 years, I continued with the trend of online dating. I also began a rigorous self-improvement campaign that included going to the gym regularly, investing in fashionable clothes and learning how to dress well, taking up interesting hobbies such as snowboarding and skydiving, and expanding my social circle. I landed a great internship in my second year of college and was even making considerable money and paying off my student loans early. 

Using sites like POF, OkCupid, and Match.com, I had no problem at all getting dates. I posted real pictures of myself and made them as minimally deceiving as possible. Texting and even talking to women on the phone came easy to me. In some cases, the conversation would end as soon as they heard my voice, but I stayed optimistic and kept trying. Over time, I learned that it was best to arrange a date as soon as possible after talking to someone new because it would keep the overall time investment low if things didn't work out.

I am not exaggerating at all when I say that during this 5 year timespan (19-24), I probably went on over 250 dates. At times, I was easily averaging 1-2 dates a week. I became VERY good at keeping conversations interesting no matter how apathetic my company, and I nearly always drove to the other person's neck of the woods and picked up the check for dinner or whatever activity we were doing. At first, my standards were pretty high but became a little lower with each rejection. I had so many ""face turns"" while trying to give a kiss at the end of each date that I eventually stopped attempting that altogether. I should also note that NONE of these women ever gave me a second date although I did become close friends with a couple of them.

My friends teased me for being a serial dater, but all I really wanted was a serious, monogamous relationship. Out of embarrassment, I would sometimes tell friends and family that I didn't like any of the girls I went out with or even make myself sound like a player because I couldn't admit the truth - none of these women were the slightest bit interested in me. A few of my friends even asked me for dating advice, wanted to know my secrets and called me a pick-up artist because I was talking to a new woman each week. Little did they know I was still a KV at 24, despite devoting an absolutely ridiculous amount of time and money to dating. In some cases, I did actually attempt to meet women in-person at school or the bars, but of course I was always rejected. At least when I was taking the online route, I could reliably get a conversation started and a date.

Each rejection added to my depression and broken-heartedness. I felt so alone. At times, I contemplated suicide, but this was not an option because my father committed suicide when I was 20 and I saw the devastating impact that it had on my family. Eventually, my self-esteem became so low and I was so depressed that I got rid of my dating standards altogether. I was willing to be with anyone who would take me. I just wanted to know what it felt like to get a YES and a second date from someone, no matter who it was. I also wanted to finally get that first kiss and lose my virginity.

I started talking to a woman on POF who I had absolutely nothing in common with. She was a morbidly-obese, recovering drug addict with $100k+ in student loans and no degree or career goals in sight. She didn't even have a car or driver's license when we started talking. She did, however, listen to me vent about my own problems and seemed to genuinely care about me. Most importantly, we went on one date and she wasn't completely repulsed, even agreeing to go out again.

Over the next 3 years, I let myself fall into a relationship with this person. I had been given an affirmation by society that I could not do any better. No matter how much I tried, she was the first and only person who wanted to be with me romantically. Finally, I was no longer a KV. This was far from a happy love story, however. I gave her a place to live, made payments on her student loans, and drove her everywhere. She reciprocated these favors by cheating on me regularly. My family and friends were so disgusted with the person I was dating that they distanced themselves from me, which only intensified my relationship because she became the only person in my life. After 3 years, she too finally left me and my heart was broken once again.

For those of you out there thinking about settling, my advice is DON'T. Yes, I was finally in a relationship with someone, but this relationship was toxic and far worse than being single. I desperately wanted to become a dad and start a family; thankfully she was never the least bit interested in having children. Although I felt like I had been stabbed through the heart when she finally ended things, it was the best possible outcome for me. It took me some time to realize this, but we did not have a bright future together. Nevertheless, at the end of 3 years, I was even more alone and depressed than I started.

As a newly single person, I became desperate to fill that void in my life. I felt (and still feel) like I have so much to offer someone, so of course I went back to online dating hoping to have more luck after a 3 year hiatus. This time I was primarily using Tinder, and I had the same successes (and failures) as before. I had no real problems getting dates, but the outcome was always the same. Nobody was interested.

After another 2 years of trying without any luck, I have decided to officially give up on dating and relationships in general. I am closing in on 30, and my older brother who has never had any significant academic or career success is happily married and starting a family with a beautiful woman. Despite all of my personal achievements in my career, a plethora of interests, hobbies, and passions, and work towards self-improvement, I would trade all of it for a single healthy, loving relationship.

To everyone out there who says you don't need a relationship to be happy, you're wrong. At the end of the day, no matter how much you have going for you in this world, you will still feel unsatisfied without that person to come home to and share your life with. It breaks my heart to realize that I will almost certainly never have a family and someday die alone. At 29 years old, I have been with only one woman who seems to have existed only to take advantage of me and better herself. I have never known real love, one of the most basic of human needs and desires. I have also had to endure seeing all of my childhood and college friends alike easily find the relationships that I so desperately wanted even despite them having accomplished so much less in life.

Yes, maybe I do have psychological problems; I'm bitter, jaded, negative and probably way too guarded to let anyone into my life at this point. I didn't come into the world this way, though. I was happy and optimistic about life until the universe continually reinforced time and time again the notion that I am not good enough for anyone. When you hear something enough times, you will inevitably believe it. I have certainly had enough women find something wrong with me to know that the numbers cannot lie and there really must be some truth to it at this point. I can fake being confident and happy as much as I want, but it changes nothing.

So what's next? I find a little peace and solace knowing that I did not give up without a fight. I spent a decade looking for love, and I was greeted with nothing but heartbreak. Now I'm resigned to the fact that I am forever alone, and I'm preparing for a life of solitude. I plan to continue pursuing my interests and hopefully do a lot more traveling. I will never be happy, as this isn't the life I wanted, but I'm making the most of my situation until this awful, disappointing journey comes to an end. Then maybe I will finally be at peace.

4jhckg,1,2016-05-15,I feel stuck in a loop in my programming career and need help breaking out of it,cs_stuckinaloop,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4jhckg/i_feel_stuck_in_a_loop_in_my_programming_career/,"So here's the situation: I'm currently looking for a software engineer job and I don't want it to be like any of the other jobs I've had previously. I didn't graduate with a CS degree. I have a 4 year degree, but it's in some different major that just happens to be related to computing technology. We took programming classes, but nothing extensive. I didn't take internships or co-ops. Then close to graduation time, comes the start of the dreaded loop that I want to get out of. Here's how it panned out.

Basically, it's a cycle of working for a company that is hurting for cash most of the time, and then being let go, usually because of those financial circumstances. And following that up, a long period of job hunting. This has been going on for about six years now and the cycle has repeated itself three times. 

I think the ratio of working to job hunting is something like two to one. So for every two years of work I've done since graduation, I've job searched for one year.

I don't get these jobs from knowing anyone, and I don't start looking for a new job until I stop working at my old one. But what I want now is financial stability. To get out of this cycle, I am applying for software engineer jobs at bigger companies now, and sometimes I get interviews with them so my resume shouldn't be that bad. Still I haven't gotten any offers. Same applies when I try using headhunters/recruiters to help find me a job.

What other options do I have to get out of this loop? I prefer to get a good job now and not a few years from now, so returning to school is out of the question. "

Unfortunately due to her visa, she had to go back to her motherland last week.

Before she went back we talked about how our long distance will work and it will not work if we do not have a broad view of our future.  I basically told her I cannot do LDR if she does not plan to move to US somewhere in the future. She said she will move to US after about 2 years for me and shes willing to just close her business there and get her prepared for the move.

Ever since she left i became so emotionally depended on her and if i dont talk to her for lil bit like (when shes sleeping) i get extremely said and i always tell her to tell me to show more love to me these days and im afraid its smothering her. I just feel so anxious all the time and I told if its ok to change her plan of 2 years to 1 1/2 year. She basically told me no shes not ready because she has yet to find a job and wants to finish paying off her loan in Korea and when everything is done she wants to make clear cut plan when everything comes in place one be one.

I just want to get an outside prospective on how people feel about my relationship and any advice to reduce my anxiety being away can be great and if she is being fair she does not want to make any clear cut plans yet.

I realize some of these questions can be answered through the school, but I wanted to see what others went through.

1.As an undergrad is it possible to carry on an internship and part-time job?
2.Did you get financial aid over the summer while at your internship?
3.How did you know when you found the right major?
4. CS and Math/CS are impacted. If I don't get into CS (or Math/CS), what would be a good fall back major - physics? Don't get me wrong, I am on top of it, but it's always good to plan for failure...

I've taken up to calc3, mechanics (calc based), C++, and Java. All were interesting/challenging. The main reason why I thinking physics is because it's difficult. The same reason why I joined the US Marines initially. Neither came easy, but I like how hard work changes a person.

Anyways, I keep coming across negative reviews about the physics major - even from some professors. They say go engineering or CS, that's where the $ is at. Those majors can also be pretty challenging from what I've researched, so I am not ruling them out.

I am conflicted because I could care less about what field I go into. Any path will be an adventure and I will enjoy it even if it sucks (thank you Marine Corps :D) I am just getting to that point where I have to choose and there's no clear indication on which path I should take.

However, it wasn't too bad until this weekend...

I went on a massive binge and am unable to stop. I am panicking and I feel a feverish sensation in my brain that I have learnt to recognise as a telltale sign that I am slipping back into depression. I skipped a workout for the first time in three months. I don't want to go back in the dark room. I am exhausted though, I have had a though week and I know this is contributing to my state of mind, but I can't get to sleep. Waking up late is also not going to help - I need to keep my rhythm. I can't afford to slip back into old habits. 

At this point, it is clear that I have to speak to someone, but I don't know how to address it. I need to bring this up to my parents, but I don't know how. 

On the short term, I need to keep on doing what I have been doing up to now - swim, walk and do bodyweight strength, eat healthily and regularly. These have really become the railings that I can hold on to in dark times. I need some practical advice though on not letting go, as well as some tips on how to tell my parents.

EDIT:
I calmed down a bit. Thank you for all those who took time to answer, just hearing ""I am right there with you"" and the fact that some people actually stayed to answer was great help. In these situations, I am terrified of being a burden to people, because I know I have benign the past, so the no-judgemental answers were of great help.

Because a ramble from me is not going to be helpful to anyone, here is some more information:

Details: I am female, 24, turning 25 at the end of the month. Next year will be my last year of college and then I will need to find a job. I am, until next year, still under my parents' insurance plan as long as I am in school. I will need to switch turning 26. 

My parents don't know about my attacks or my depression. Which leads me to...

See a doctor: I can't. Not immediately, at least. I am moving to another country to start a 3-month internship in less than a week. Although I am lucky enough to have an insurance plan that will cover me there, I know from experience that there are other administrative hurdles that will make it perfectly pointless to see a doctor until I get there. I am planning to see one ASAP though, I will need you guys to trust me on this one. :/

Also, my invoices still go straight to my parents. Meaning that I can hardly see a doctor and get a prescription for an anti-depressant without talking to them. That is why I asked for advice on telling my parents, because I have to tell them but I don't know how.

That is all. "

After hearing this I downloaded Oracle vmbox and installed ubuntu, set up LAMP and got myself into some open-source to understand how things work and just to get used to.

Advice?,jobless_scrub,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4ji1vf/just_graduated_college_a_few_days_ago_feeling/,"Just 2 days ago, I graduated from my top private university, majoring in econ and minoring in math. My GPA is shit -- 2.88. Luckily, I was very involved on campus; I was on an athletic team and a fraternity, and participated in many campus performing events, so it's not like I just dicked around all of college. I worked all summers, and interned at a top hedge fund last summer. I already got in contact with the people I know at my internship last summer, and they currently don't have any positions available for me. 

One of my biggest mistakes of college was majoring in econ. I found it really boring, and liked computer science a lot better when I took a few classes during my second semester junior year. Thing is, it was far too late to change to CS, so I just decided to finish my econ degree. I'm not really sure about what I want to do careerwise, and would actually prefer to do a short term kind of job like an internship or fellowship as opposed to a full time thing. 

Sorry if this is all a huge jumble of information -- I'm feeling lost after all. What do you think would be the best course of action for me to take right now? Reach out to friends/family and ask if they know of any opportunities? Keep applying to online job listings?"

**tl;dr**: Professor always gives generic, minimal instructions and then gets pissed off when I don't do things to his unstated, non-existent instructions. Not sure if I should stick it out or just quit now.

Okay, this is just the straw that's broken the camel's back. I work as a student assistant for a professor in my department. I've had multiple internships before this, and at every one of them I've received very positive feedback; one is a Fortune 500 company who have asked me to return for another internship this summer, and stay through the entirety of the next school year, not just the summer. So I'm pretty sure that the root of this problem is not that I'm a bad worker.

D, the professor I work for, is in his mid-60s, he's very crabby to everyone, and has an extremely dry sense of humor. A dry sense of life, in general. I've also been working with another professor as a student assistant and we have had literally no problems. But D will consistently give me instructions, such as ""give this student extra credit points"" and then get mad at me because ""those points aren't supposed to be visible in the gradebook from the student side"". But he didn't tell me when that when he told be to enter them in. At the same time, he's having me enter in extra credit grades regularly and those are ALL supposed to be visible to the class.

Many iterations of this have happened in different forms. I was actually told by the Doctoral student who helps with the other professor that D actually should have a Doctoral TA of his own, but there's a reason that he doesn't have one, and that he does this to everyone. When I've told people in my major who I'm working for, I've had several of them tell me about a friend or person that they knew that quit or only worked a single semester because he was so bad. 

The most recent incident was that I released the final letter grades for the class, and I posted a generic ""Final grades have been released... not subject to change, etc. etc."" message. Not that exactly, but very general, very generic that I have seen with almost every single class I've taken. Well, he got mad that I posted a message attached to the email. If I hadn't, it would have been a blank email sent out with a ""From the desk of D"" as the subject line. I guessed I stepped out of line by attaching a message, but I was afraid that he'd get mad if I didn't post one. I'm so angry right now because D has consistently treated me badly, talking down to me, made sexist remarks, and said things that were juuuust this side sexual harassment. I want to do a good job, but I can't if he doesn't ever give me clear instructions and only ever gives negative feedback and nothing I can be constructive with.

I don't know what to do. The May semester starts tomorrow and after this last incident I'm so tempted to just quit outright but since he's a major player in my department I feel like I'm trapped in this until the end of the May-mester. The lady who works for the department has apologized to me for D's behavior on his behalf before, so I'm almost sure that they wouldn't be surprised, but I just don't want to leave the department in the position of finding a new assistant with no notice if I leave. Not to mention the fallback, because I am a senior taking only upper level classes.

I have no clue what to say to him, he gets very agitated easily and I don't feel comfortable voicing my concerns to him. I don't know if I should just not say anything to him and only let the woman who works for the department know why I am quitting. She seemed so relieved when I said I would stay for the May-mester, and now I'm just not sure at all what to do.

Edit: After reading a few comments and calming down when I woke up this morning, I decided it was best to slog out these last three weeks and let the department know when I was leaving. I did speak to the woman who is in charge of all the assistants and she seemed disappointed, but not surprised. Apparently I had been doing much better than most of the assistants D had been assigned before: He fired one last semester halfway through the semester for reasons that weren't even the poor girls fault, and had tried to fire multiple ones like that before as well. She said they'd look into giving him a doctoral TA next fall. If they do, at least the doctoral student will have a much stronger voice that people in the department will be willing to listen to vs an undergraduate."

So, that brings us to my main question: is there anyone on here that knows of any internship positions open for software development, programming, web development, etc. in the Jacksonville area? To be specific, anyone know of any company willing to take an 18 year old HS graduate under their wing? Again, I understand this might be a bit of a long shot but I'd like to give it a shot. "

.......................................................................................................

I met John in school, he had already studied something completely unrelated before so that explains the age difference and why we ended up in the same year even though he's older. We graduated last june and are now both working freelance because that's how it works most of the time in our fields. 

The thing is, even tough our fields are similar, it's easier to find freelancing jobs in mine. What happened after school :

* We both did an internship for 3 months, him until october at company A, me until december at company X
* I worked again at company X for a few jobs (2 days minimum, 1 week maximum) from january to april 
* He worked again at company A (2 weeks each time, but fewer times than me) from january to april
* He worked 2 weeks at company B, 2 weeks ago, they plan to call him back when they need to
* I recently worked 2,5 weeks at company Y, great opportunities, they called me back immediately

So we worked roughly the same amount of time, but my companies have more projects so they tend to call me back more, while his projects might be longer but less numerous. Company Y plan on teaching me how to work on some projects so that I can be their back-up. In the mean time company X has called me back. So recently I've worked 2,5 weeks, waited 2 days, and have been called back by these too companies and have my next 2 weeks (possibly more) planned.
John has worked 2 weeks recently and they plan to call him back when they need to but it hasn't happened yet and I know he's starting to be scared about finding other jobs.

.......................................................................................................

The fact that he's 26 scares him. He just wants to earn money and work so he can be independent (he is, except that he lives rent free in his mother very very small spare apartment and she'll need to rent it next year so he'll need to move out).

When he's stressed he tends to shut down. I talked to him tonight and he was clearly stressed, he wanted to send resumes tomorrow but had an issue on his computer so he will probably do it tuesday instead. I can't hep but feel bad because I'm in a perfect place right now with my freelancing work. We were together friday when both companies called me and I had just recently told him how excited I was about one opportunity, and even though he was happy for me on friday, I know it's also hard for him.

When we see each other it's great, he sometimes talks about his insecurities. It's wonderful to be able to help him and motivate him. When we are just talking on Facebook or texting, if he's stressed the conversation won't really go anywhere, he won't want to talk about it, and sometimes even about anything else non work related. I know him really well now, and I can tell if he doesn't want to talk because he's stressed or because he needs time alone. I respect that. But when he's just stressed it's hard to know what to say. I just keep encouraging him, not pushing, telling him I will ask at my future job if they now companies that could hire him for a job, but I feel like it's not going anywhere since he shuts down half the time.

.......................................................................................................

I know it will be better with time and networking but I would love advices on how to deal with this situation. What can I do to ease his stress ? I don't want to pester him with ""you can do it, I have faith in you, it will be ok"" or empty stuff like that, it feels meaningless to him. And I feel guilty when I talk about my job (when I have one) because I know it will make him think about him not working. I know he want's to hear about my job, he asks, but I feel uncomfortable talking about it knowing he might get more stressed.

Sorry for the wall of text !

**tl;dr**: BF and I, just out of school, work freelance in similar fields but it's somewhat easier to find jobs in mine. I have had some great opportunities recently and he's stressed because he hasn't. How do I/we deal with that ?"
4jiskd,4,2016-05-15,"Need advice on current relation path, [M] Dominant, wall of text incoming",Onic_Tavor,BDSMcommunity,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMcommunity/comments/4jiskd/need_advice_on_current_relation_path_m_dominant/,"Hello all.  I want to apologize for the upcoming novel and if I posted in the wrong place.  I don't really know where to go for good advice on my present circumstances and could really use some support and honest words.

My interest in BDSM has been growing slowly since I discovered porn as a teenager.  In college, I met a woman who was willing to explore with me and we had a lot of fun learning about each others bodies.  I proposed before our last year in college, she agreed, and we wed shortly after graduation.  That was 6 years ago, this June.

Our honeymoon was not that enjoyable.  I packed all our toys in anticipation, struggling to close the bag with them and even bought a few new ones to try out.  The bag was never opened during the full week.  I can honestly say that we did more BDSM in the three years leading to the marriage than the 6 years since.

I discovered second life while we were engaged and the bdsm scene there.  I wanted to bring her into it but she never enjoyed it, always complaining about the interface and how she would be seen by others.  She stopped eventually while I kept going, mostly as a submissive to a dominant woman.  That lasted a little bit into our marriage until she saw me emotionally hurt by said domme and told me that she wanted me to stop and promise never to go back.

That lasted for a little while then I discovered collarme, the old version from years ago, and chatted with a few folks on there, both as a dominant and submissive.  Things going as they are, I knew she wouldn't like it and told her about it then deleted my accounts.

A little more backstory.  She had a job offer in the Northern Virginia area straight out of college.  Due to my grades and somewhat lackadaisical attitude, I did not.  I was actively looking but there was zero interest in my area of knowledge in the same area that she had an offer.  We decided that we would move down and I would find something soon.

Then being 2010 and a fresh college graduate with poor grades and no internship isn't exactly a recipe for success.  I looked for jobs I was interested in, sent out quite a few applications and never heard back.  Well, I wasted almost a full 4 months waiting on some recruiter from Raytheon to find the money for a position and then he would do an interview but that materialized into a public job posting I had to apply to and a whole lot of silence.

I eventually interviewed with the local best buy because money was getting tight, to join their geek squad but because we had plans for Black Friday that year already, they wouldn't even consider hiring me after that weekend.  I interviewed with Barnes and Noble and got the job.  I didn't do a full time position as I didn't want to eat up all my time that I could be using to find a job.

A year and a bit later, feeling very stuck and hopeless, I get a call from some temp agency and they tell me they found my resume on a job board and would like to interview me for a database analyst position, was more a data entry job, but I snapped up the chance.  Didn't matter it was in the middle of DC, 90 minutes from our apartment.  It was a technical position that I could use to help my poor resume.  About 30 minutes after the interview, that I was sure I was not going to get, I get a call with an offer for a ridiculously high sounding number, keep in mind, I was making $8 an hour, so going to $15+ was a miracle I could not turn down.

Another thing that was happening a lot, was my driving my wife to work.  Not a problem you might say.  No, it was a 40 minute commute in DC traffic, one way.  And she wanted me to drive her a couple times a week when I didn't have any job.  She was always too tired in the mornings, not feeling good, or something.  So, I drove her and then either burned 8 hours in Maryland, feeling very awkward when I sat in Panera for a few hours or I drove home, chilled for 6 hours then drove back to get her, often spending 2+ hours in a car because she needed me to drive her.  So, the barnes and noble job mostly stopped that, but the job in DC truly did.  I could not drive her as it would make me late or unable to get to work.

Once I started working though, I was the one that offered to stay home when we needed maintenance done on something or the car serviced.  So my vacation hours burned up fast while she kept piling them up.  Last year, she was at 200+ hours accrued.  Needless to say, due to my lack of vacation hours we never went anywhere distant.

She got a trip to England for work with a co-worker, very excited to travel for work.  Meanwhile, I was itching to get back on second life and this was my perfect chance.  So, she went and I found very little to keep me in second life.  A day or two before she comes back home, she calls and is being very evasive with me.  Turns out that she and her co-worker did a little kissing and she felt terrible about it.  She comes home, almost in tears when I greet her at the airport and can't believe I'm not that mad at her.

I thought it was a one off occurrence but with my job being so far away (90 minutes commute) and her job fairly recently moved closer (ten minutes commute), she got together fairly often with her co-worker, also our neighbor.    She always came clean shortly after they did any kissing and it was only that.  But they did keep flirting, unbeknownst to me.  Finally, they engaged in a mutual masturbation session where they both climaxed.  It was at this point that I had enough and they knew they couldn't keep going.

What pissed me off the most about that was the fact that a) she had an orgasm with him when she would barely let me masturbate her and b) that she found him irresistible sexually and I was as much as white bread.  Now, given that he was married as well, his wife was way more pissed than I was, like probably ready to cut his balls off, I think.  We all reconciled, the co-worker and his wife eventually got a divorce after a full year of marriage.  So it was a bit awkward for a few months as she was sorry about what happened and struggled a bit to allow me to touch her and I had issues arousing her in bed.  It wasn't until he moved away that the flirting stopped and their fling was over.

Then we got a dog.

I love our dog dearly.  And it is painful to imagine not seeing her anymore as much as I get annoyed on occasion by her wet nose.  But with her being tired in the morning, tired at night/not wanting to walk in the dark, I was taking our dog for her morning walk and night walk, just about every day.  The only time I wouldn't is when I would stay up to 2 am on Friday/Saturday and more tired than she was.  We were still recovering from the affair at this point so sex wasn't exactly frequent.  As soon as pup came home, we had even less.  And I believe that our last bondage session was before we got the dog.  This has been 2 years now with that lanky and adorable furball.

A year ago we bought a home after saving up for a bit, managing to find something in our budget for a mortgage.  The burden of walking the dog was still firmly on me, always a sleepy, ""Can you walk her?  Thank you.""  Even getting a fenced back yard didn't really help, since our dog loves to tear up the yard as she runs around.

*Now, with all that back story in mind, here are the issues I've been having.*

She claims she isn't what I want whenever I start talking about doing more bdsm things, often with a choked up voice.  Which I fully don't understand, as I wanted to do all that with her.  I wasn't wanting to find some random submissive or domme to do bdsm with, I wanted her to enjoy my passion for it.

I am a very handsy guy.  I like to touch, caress, feel, and rub.  I show affection and love with my passion.  And that is one way I feel loved as well.  Whenever I try to show affection this way, I feel like I get pushed away.  I remember my father coming up behind my mother, while she was preparing dinner, giving her a hug and little kisses from behind, seeing her smile.  I try to do the same to my wife and I feel like I'm not letting her get her work done.

In the bedroom, I want to do everything to her.  I want to bury my face between her legs for hours, listening to her moan.  I want to hold her in my arms as my hand brings her to climax after climax.  I want to slowly stroke her body under the covers.  But I get pushed away for a scratchy beard, I get pushed away after my hands make her cum once, she pushes me away when my touch is 'ticklish'.  One or two years ago, I stopped initiating sex as much, and we went from maybe once a week to less than once every three.  Oh and she hates going down on me.  Which makes me going down on her stressful as she feels pressure, that doesn't exist, to return the favor.  I just wanted to make her feel good.  I didn't care if I had it returned, as long as she felt good.  My last blow job, where I actually came in her mouth was before we got the dog, so more than two years.  And whenever I bring it up, I get told, ""I know it's been awhile"" and that is all there was said about it.

I would occasionally talk about doing more BDSM or joking about a third person to spice things up.  And it never developed, never got to more.

About two years ago, a few months after we got the dog, I said 'fuck it' to her oft spoken desire to not be on second life and I made a new account.  I promised myself that I would keep it secret, that this time, I wouldn't tell her.  And I haven't.  She might suspect but she has never accused me of it.  For a while, Second Life was my refuge from the vanilla relationship I had.  In second life, my dominant side unfurled and I learned that while I enjoy being a submissive, I can't sustain that mindset long.  I settle comfortably as a dominant and would identify as such if asked.  The way I can best summarize, for me, being submissive is a shirt or a piece of clothing I put on occasionally then take off.  Being dominant is in my blood, I can't stop that feeling or take it off.  Sometimes I wish I could.

Now, to describe her, I would say classic type A person.  She regularly works 45+ hour weeks, often closer to 50, because she feels the need to get things done in her office.  She stresses over the way the house is kept while I see it as something that could use to be cleaned in a few weeks.  She stresses over how much I drink and how I drive.  Reminding me that the car infront of us is slowing or that the light changed, seconds after it happens, when I'm well aware of it.  She's not as bad as her mother about this, but when I'm told I need to slow down 5 times in a 10 minute trip, its a bit much.

She is very judgmental and very quick to jump to an unfair conclusion about someone in my mind.  Not as bad as her younger sister, but when her mind jumps to the worst conclusion about someone or something, I often speak up.  Then an argument starts as she thinks I think she is stupid and intolerant for something she said, when I either misunderstood her point or didn't let her finish.  And when I try to explain my confusion or try to demonstrate, as gently as I can that a specific point is wrong or misunderstood, she gets frustrated and occasionally goes off to the bedroom to sulk.  And then I need to go talk to her and hold her until she isn't feeling hurt anymore.

So we come to the crux of it all.  A final realization that what I want, isn't a vanilla relationship with occasional BDSM elements when we have sex.  She isn't a submissive, not in the normal understanding.  She is a submissive because she wants me to be happy.  She puts on the submissive hat so I will be happy.  But she doesn't let the hat become part of her, she doesn't want to live as a submissive.

Please don't get me wrong, I don't want a 24/7 relationship with ""Sir"", collars, and leashes all the time.  But I'm starting to seriously thing about finding someone else who is a submissive.

This is where I'm a bit lost.  If I was dating my wife, I would end things.  I would break things off as gently as I could and start over.  But I have a ring on my finger, a joint mortgage, a house full of furniture and things, joint bank account, etc etc etc.  And the other issue that I have been raking myself over coals for is that she supported me when I was and had nothing.  She helped feed me in college when I was too proud to ask my parents for more money.  She paid for our housing for a year and a half until I got a job.  She is making more than I am now, so if I view my contributions to our marriage financially, I feel like a divorce would be taking advantage of her generosity and openness.  I recently got a much better job, very close to my home in August.  So to only now ask for a divorce makes me sound like an asshole to myself, that I only was married so I could live off of her.

After I write all this, I somewhat feel that I've been taken advantage of.  That she knew my enjoyment of BDSM and denied it to me.  That she was only playing bdsm with me because our first sexual partners were each other.  And when we had sex for the first time, I showed her the receipt from the down payment I put on her engagement ring.  It was literally in my pocket.

I'm worried that she won't be okay if I leave.  I'm worried our devout christian parents will demonize me for wanting a divorce for sexual reasons.  I'm worried that what I think I want isn't real.  That I'm overreacting as I often do and the place I need to be is in this marriage.  I'm worried that I will get the divorce and will not find what I'm looking for.  Doomed to grow old, posting messages, looking for a submissive who would like me, and never making my desires a reality.

Am I wrong for wanting a divorce from a vanilla woman, simply because I want something different sexually?

Thank you for reading, this has been weighing heavily on me these past few months and I, someone who rarely tears up, gets a bit teary when I think hard about this, when I think about all that has happened.  I can't do this on my own right now and going to a marriage counselor doesn't seem to be a solution.  I brought up the idea the other night and she literally said, ""I can't deal with this"" and left to cry somewhere, for me to come find and comfort her.

I want everyone to be happy.  But I also want to be happy.  Do I change for her and feel slighted?  Do I demand she change to make me happy?  Am I just looking at this all wrong and need a bucket of cold water?

As a side note, if anyone knows of BDSM friendly therapists in the DC/Metro area, I'd appreciate knowing.

Last thing, I'm not going to go back and edit this wall of text, it is not going to help my current state and any grammar, spelling, formatting, or wrong information, I apologize for here.

4jisso,277,2016-05-15,Complete Psychotic Break,seriouslywiththis,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/4jisso/complete_psychotic_break/,"Hey guys. I have a doozy of a tale for you. I'm sorry if my writing is a bit scattered - I'm still pretty out of it. Here we go:

At 2:52 PM on Friday, May 13th, I take two tabs (100 micrograms per tab) of what I believe to be acid. I had purchased them on the dark web from someone I thought was a reputable seller. I decided to trip alone. I've taken many drugs in my life, so I thought I'd be able to handle myself. 

First, I walk outside and listen to music. I'm nervous and excited, and really feeling the emotion behind the music. As my sensation and perception shift, dramatically more with each passing minute, I figure it would be a good idea to go back to my apartment. My short term memory is going, going, gone. 

Next thing I know, I'm in my room. I feel like a scared little child. I have no idea what is happening. I don't know who I am. I call my best friend on FaceTime. I'm so glad to see him. He reminds me that I'm on a drug. This calms me down for short periods of time, but since my short term memory is shot, I forget frequently. All I know is that I am a panicked entity, detached from any sort of societal paradigm and without a past - I don't know I'm human. I forget my name. All I know is panic. 

Then, another friend of mine comes into the room. I tell him that I'm tripping really hard and ask him if he can help me. He reluctantly agrees - he has no experience trip sitting. He encourages me to lay down and notice how beautiful the peace lily next to my bed is. He tells me to touch the leaves and I remark about how soft they feel - in retrospect, this is funny - there's nothing particular ""soft"" about peace lily leaves. 

After what I've been told was a few hours, my friend has to leave. The friend with whom I had been FaceTiming then calls me back and tries to help me maintain my grasp on reality. Somehow, probably because I didn't know what the fuck anything was, I lose my phone. What I experience next is very abstract. I traipse back and forth in my room. I am a formless being with no knowledge of the fact that I have a body, and no knowledge that I am a person. I pace back and forth like a lost soul, beyond psychotic, for hours. 

Then, I walk outside (it was dark out), aimlessly. I see buildings, bikes, cars, and streets in my town and don't know what they are. I am a ghost - floating around a world I don't understand with no knowledge of my past and no thoughts other than ones of confusion. 
I then find myself in a building in which I like to play music. I wander around it for a while, then see a janitor. This janitor usually annoys me quite a bit - when I'm writing songs, he often barges into the room I'm in without knocking. It's very unnerving. So anyway, I'm in front of this janitor. He says, ""where are you supposed to be?"" which, in retrospect, is a pretty strange question to ask someone. I say, ""I don't know."" He says, ""You go upstairs! Or you go downstairs! Choose!"" Again, very strange behavior from this janitor. So I say, ""I don't know what I am."" After hearing this, he determines that I need help. He leads me down to the music department of the building, steadying me the whole way down the stairs. I say ""what are these?"" and he says ""they are stairs."" Crazy shit.

We then encounter two students. I tell them the following: ""I feel like I was just birthed into this society and I don't know what anything is. What are you guys? I'm pretty sure you guys are called ""people"". Is that what I am? Am I a person too? I don't know how this world works but I guess I can speak your language. I don't know how I know it."" These guys are really kind and understanding. They call an ambulance. The paramedic in the ambulance asks me who I am and what my major is (I'm a grad student) and I can't answer his questions. 

In the hospital, I pace back and forth (with my finger out as if I'm about to say something) for hours, constantly looking at the clock but not understanding what time is. My body feels extremely tense and uncomfortable and my heart is racing. I am perpetually worried that I'll go into tachycardia. 

I don't usually dance, but I decide to dance a bit to make myself feel better. I used to practice Tai-Chi, so my dancing reflects that. I make up some pretty cool dance moves. One involves tipping an imaginary cap. I tell the nurses about my dance moves and they laugh. There is one nurse, Tom, who is very kind to me. He periodically comes to check on me and smiles warmly. He gets me pudding and crayons and paper to color with. I am incredibly appreciative of him, given that he is my only tether to reality. One of the other nurses tries to fuck with me. He tells me he is God. He also asks me if I am ""seeing Jesus"", to which I reply ""I don't think so."" I keep walking around asking the nurses if they need any help because I feel like I'm a burden to them given that I'm not really in need of emergency medical attention. I'm going to be interning at a hospital soon, and I tell the nurses this even though I don't really know what an internship was. Then, a very kind and wise black nurse (this detail is important to the story) comes to talk to me. I proceed to tell her that Martin Luther King Jr. was correct in his belief that all people are the same, regardless of the color of their skin. She seems a bit weirded out, but voices her agreement. I then tell her that being nationalistic/thinking that your country/ethnicity/belief system/religion is better than others is really stupid, again, because we're all the same and all part of the same energy. Then, she tells me to think of the sound of rain or ocean waves to comfort myself. It didn't help at all haha.
At this point it's getting close to morning and I still don't know who I am or where I am or what anything is. Here I am, sitting in a horribly uncomfortable hospital stretcher, thinking that I fucked my life up but not knowing what a life is. It is pure torture. I also miss my girlfriend even though I didn't know what a girlfriend is. Then, a nurse comes up to me and tells me that I can't stay in the ER because I've been there for 8 hours. She asks if I know anyone who can pick me up. I remember that I know two people's phone numbers (my parents). An agonizing amount of time later, my parents are there to pick me up. 

I ask them ""are you my parents?"" They say that they are and take me home. On the way home, I point at things and ask my parents what they are. Some things I recognize. I recognize Trader Joe's and say ""that's a good restaurant that we like to go to!"" haha. My parents say that I'll be able to see my dog when I get home. I don't know what a dog is but was excited to see him nonetheless. 

Oddly enough, I repeatedly say to my parents ""I believe that my procedural memory is intact but my episodic memory is shot."" They laugh each time.

At home, I constantly ask my parents ""is this my home? are you my parents?"" I'm still very disoriented and scared. Then, I watch the show Shark Tank, which absolutely blew my mind. Then I watch the show Chopped on food network, which is anxiety-provoking to me because I didn't know what any foods were. Then, I watch The Office, which is a complete mind-fuck in the best way. I rave madly about how Michael Scott and Dwight Shrute literally just fuck everything up and that's the main premise behind the show. I laugh my ass off at how crazy Michael and Dwight are. I somehow understand that their behavior is nuts.

My dog is especially comforting and attentive to me the entire time. Later that night, I go on a walk through my town with my parents. The dogwood trees are flowering and I think this is very beautiful. My parents take me to my elementary school, a baseball field I used to play at, my friends houses, etc, and I start remembering bits of my past. 
Then, we go home. I'm still very panicked and think that I'll stop breathing if I fall asleep. My mom stays in my room with me all night. Eventually I fall asleep. I'm very appreciative of her - I was appreciative to everyone who I encountered during this trip. I think I said the phrase ""thanks for helping"" close to 200 times, to the paramedic, the nurses, and my parents and sister. all day. In the morning, I feel better. Quite foggy, and still a little dissociated from my body, but better.

From this experience, I learned how important it is for people working in hospitals to be kind to patients, especially if they're confused/have dementia/aphasia from a stroke - any brain issue. It's very scary to feel that confused and helpless, and any act of kindness and care from a health care professional is extremely valuable. I told everyone at the hospital that working at a hospital is a really noble career and that they should never forget how meaningful it is to help others. The nurses really appreciated hearing this.

What I took may not have been LSD, considering that I was tripping hard for around 35 hours. It could have been DOx. The tabs had no taste though. Who knows? Thanks for reading.

Edit: Thanks for the support everyone. people are asking me to test these tabs - unfortunately I can't. I burned them once I came back to reality. I honestly feel reborn. I feel like I'm experiencing everything for the first time. My memories are slowly returning to me. My parents and sister were very supportive, but also very disappointed in me. They lost a lot of trust in me. I can understand their frustration, I really worried them. I can't do substances anymore. I can't risk triggering another one of these episodes. "
4jiun4,1,2016-05-15,I [24/M] am not sure how to handle my coworker [24/F],GreyHawk2000,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4jiun4/i_24m_am_not_sure_how_to_handle_my_coworker_24f/,"6 months ago my work got a bunch of new interns and new hires. Some of the current young(er) staff were assigned a new hire/intern as a buddy to help guide them, I got a female intern.


Soon that buddy relationship turned into a friendship. We just clicked on everything and honestly that has never happened for me (or her) so soon, she would always say how it felt like we had been friends for years. We were talking all the time at work, going to lunch together 1 on 1 several times a week, and talking after work through text/snapchat/call almost daily. She even opened up to me several times (including a drunk bar trip with some coworkers where I ended up babysitting her crying until a friend could get her for an hour while everyone else called it a night), I know her dreams, her insecurities, her fears, her family problems, etc... everything. Things normally people question telling anyone else let alone someone you've known for a few months. 



Then I started to think she might like me. But I knew she had a BF of 5 years. In fact she made it very clear to me right away, the first time we went to lunch together 1 on 1 (like her 2nd day at the company) as soon as she sat down she goes ""I gotta text my BF im out with a coworker in case someone sees us, I don't want him to get the wrong impression."" Which I thought was weird but shrugged off at the time. But then those texts never happened again and when I asked she said ""I don't do that anymore""...... Coupled with the fact she would say things like ""Sorry I'm not pretty enough for you"" or if I commented about her clothing, she would take it very serious. I once said that outfit needs a belt, and like 2 weeks later she came over and showed me the outfit with a belt. Several times I mentioned I hadn't had x food, and it would either appear on my desk the next day or we would be going to lunch to try x food. She came up with a list of places I had to eat at (with her). She'd ask what color nails to get I'd say X, they would be X. Same with hairstyles. She'd ask what my favorite movies/songs were and then watch/listen to them and report back. Was always eager to tell me news, for example on Monday's she couldn't wait to tell me how her weekend was or what she did.


All of this went on for a couple of months and I didn't know what to really think. Then one day our company had a happy hour at a far away bar (1 hour+ away). I wasn't going to go, but she kept saying she wouldn't go if I didn't and that she would drive. So I agreed. We went had a good time, left our coworkers at the bar, went to a winery for food and more drinks before meeting up with a coworker and his wife at another bar. Her BF was texting her all night (her being short with him from what I could tell) about how she needed to be home by 1. Well that didn't happen and that was the beginning of a change in our ""friendship"".


A couple days after that there were no more texts/snapchats/calls. No more talking all the time at work. In fact the only talking at work now was strictly her asking questions. I asked whats up? and got nothing. Knowing full well what was going on, I ignored it for another week or so until I called her out on it, and she said ""I was putting her in a difficult spot between choosing a friendship and her relationship, and I was being selfish for not putting myself in her shoes."" I didn't know what to say and eventually she said that she wanted him to meet me.


Well that never happened as she determined weeks later it ""wasn't fair to him to meet me"". And during that time she was nothing but a B to me. She would still call me over for help all the time, but everything I did was wrong. If I touched her mouse suddenly I was yelled at to ""STOP TOUCHING MY STUFF"" loud enough the other people around us could hear. Or if I just stood there while she was doing something and started looking around she would yell ""STOP BEING NOSY AND LOOKING AT MY STUFF!"". I tried once or twice to have a normal conversation again like hey what are you doing this weekend and I would get ""why? why are you being nosy?"". I quickly stopped that.  But it didn't stop there. When I'd eat lunch at work (its just 1 really long table), I'd get dirty looks from her. If I brought up a topic among the group, she would quickly change the group topic. Her responses were always cold to me and cheerful to everyone else, so much so that other people picked up on it too.


So I spent the last month just helping her several times a day and getting yelled at. If this was anywhere outside of work I would have told them to fuck off. I hated work every single day. No other coworker would treat me like that, but since we were such good friends she apparently was comfortable enough snapping at me. 


Deep down I was happy she wasn't going to get an offer for full time employment. Despite me originally helping her so hard to get it. Then came our companies summer party which is just 7+ hours of drinking and eating and playing cornhole. She was 100% back to normal with me and even invited me to go to the major city bars that night with the female coworkers. I said no, she gave me a big hug goodbye and I thought that was the last I'd see of her. 


Then I found out from a manager who she is BFFs with that she got an offer to come back in a month. My face must have looked like I had seen a ghost because the manager goes ""why arent you happy? you guys are great friends?"" I go ""no I'm happy"" and walked away like I had just been shot. 


Since then I have seen 2 times at our companies professional sport suites. Both times she made no point to talk to me outside of hi when I walked it and bye when I left. And now tomorrow she starts again full time and I don't know what to do. This past month has been so peaceful and I've been dreding tomorrow. Its gotten to the point where I've thought about updating my resume. I can't deal with being talked down to and being treated like an outsider at my company. I know if I call her out on anything her and that BFF manager could make my life hell. And I can't go to management about this because I went to bat for her hard. I stuck my neck out for her so many times and sang her praise so much that me and that manager are the reason she got hired. I've even thought about spilling the beans about the BFF manager and her doing some sexual stuff at work (I walked in on it and stuck around to watch at their request), resulting in all 3 of us probably getting fired. 



I honestly have 0 idea what to do. Never ever would I think I'd be in this situation.

Other fandoms welcome!",bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4jixpr/m4f_house_of_lies_the_office_or_buffy_fan_come_on/,"---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

Things normally people question telling anyone else let alone someone you've known for a few months. 



Then I started to think she might like me. But I knew she had a BF of 5 years. In fact she made it very clear to me right away, the first time we went to lunch together 1 on 1 (like her 2nd day at the company) as soon as she sat down she goes ""I gotta text my BF im out with a coworker in case someone sees us, I don't want him to get the wrong impression."" Which I thought was weird but shrugged off at the time. But then those texts never happened again and when I asked she said ""I don't do that anymore""...... Coupled with the fact she would say things like ""Sorry I'm not pretty enough for you"" or if I commented about her clothing, she would take it very serious. I once said that outfit needs a belt, and like 2 weeks later she came over and showed me the outfit with a belt. Several times I mentioned I hadn't had x food, and it would either appear on my desk the next day or we would be going to lunch to try x food. She came up with a list of places I had to eat at (with her). She'd ask what color nails to get I'd say X, they would be X. Same with hairstyles. She'd ask what my favorite movies/songs were and then watch/listen to them and report back. Was always eager to tell me news, for example on Monday's she couldn't wait to tell me how her weekend was or what she did.


All of this went on for a couple of months and I didn't know what to really think. Then one day our company had a happy hour at a far away bar (1 hour+ away). I wasn't going to go, but she kept saying she wouldn't go if I didn't and that she would drive. So I agreed. We went had a good time, left our coworkers at the bar, went to a winery for food and more drinks before meeting up with a coworker and his wife at another bar. Her BF was texting her all night (her being short with him from what I could tell) about how she needed to be home by 1. Well that didn't happen and that was the beginning of a change in our ""friendship"".


A couple days after that there were no more texts/snapchats/calls. No more talking all the time at work. In fact the only talking at work now was strictly her asking questions. I asked whats up? and got nothing. Knowing full well what was going on, I ignored it for another week or so until I called her out on it, and she said ""I was putting her in a difficult spot between choosing a friendship and her relationship, and I was being selfish for not putting myself in her shoes."" I didn't know what to say and eventually she said that she wanted him to meet me.


Well that never happened as she determined weeks later it ""wasn't fair to him to meet me"". And during that time she was nothing but a B to me. She would still call me over for help all the time, but everything I did was wrong. If I touched her mouse suddenly I was yelled at to ""STOP TOUCHING MY STUFF"" loud enough the other people around us could hear. Or if I just stood there while she was doing something and started looking around she would yell ""STOP BEING NOSY AND LOOKING AT MY STUFF!"". I tried once or twice to have a normal conversation again like hey what are you doing this weekend and I would get ""why? why are you being nosy?"". I quickly stopped that.  But it didn't stop there. When I'd eat lunch at work (its just 1 really long table), I'd get dirty looks from her. If I brought up a topic among the group, she would quickly change the group topic. Her responses were always cold to me and cheerful to everyone else, so much so that other people picked up on it too.


So I spent the last month just helping her several times a day and getting yelled at. If this was anywhere outside of work I would have told them to fuck off. I hated work every single day. No other coworker would treat me like that, but since we were such good friends she apparently was comfortable enough snapping at me. 


Deep down I was happy she wasn't going to get an offer for full time employment. Despite me originally helping her so hard to get it. Then came our companies summer party which is just 7+ hours of drinking and eating and playing cornhole. She was 100% back to normal with me and even invited me to go to the major city bars that night with the female coworkers. I said no, she gave me a big hug goodbye and I thought that was the last I'd see of her. 


Then I found out from a manager who she is BFFs with that she got an offer to come back in a month. My face must have looked like I had seen a ghost because the manager goes ""why arent you happy? you guys are great friends?"" I go ""no I'm happy"" and walked away like I had just been shot. 


Since then I have seen 2 times at our companies professional sport suites. Both times she made no point to talk to me outside of hi when I walked it and bye when I left. And now tomorrow she starts again full time and I don't know what to do. This past month has been so peaceful and I've been dreding tomorrow. Its gotten to the point where I've thought about updating my resume. I can't deal with being talked down to and being treated like an outsider at my company. I know if I call her out on anything her and that BFF manager could make my life hell. And I can't go to management about this because I went to bat for her hard. I stuck my neck out for her so many times and sang her praise so much that me and that manager are the reason she got hired. I've even thought about spilling the beans about the BFF manager and her doing some sexual stuff at work (I walked in on it and stuck around to watch at their request), resulting in all 3 of us probably getting fired. 



I honestly have 0 idea what to do. Never ever would I think I'd be in this situation.

4jj7ek,0,2016-05-15,"Me [22 M] with my girlfriend[21F] of 2 years and 8 months, living with me",bsthrowaway33,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4jj7ek/me_22_m_with_my_girlfriend21f_of_2_years_and_8/,"Hey /r/relationships, I'm a normal browser of this subreddit and had always hoped I would never have to post here but I guess I'm not that lucky. This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

So essentially I've been with my girlfriend(who we'll call laura) for a little over 2 years and 8 months. We met our freshman year of college and are now going into our senior year. We've had some ups and downs throughout our relationship but things have been mostly happy and we've talked about getting engaged after graduating and living together.

This summer both my girlfriend and I have started applying fore internships, however because my girlfriend doesn't have a car she was only able to apply for internships offered on our college campus. Unfortunately she didn't get any of the ones she applied for and now has nowhere to work for the summer. The area where she lives has almost no job opportunities in her field and was really depressed because of this. On the other hand the area where I live, 10 minutes away from our college has tons of job opportunities in and out of our field. So naturally I offered her to live at my home for the summer so she can find work and my parents loved the idea since they love her and have always liked having her around.

Well, ever since I made this offer she's been applying to tons of summer jobs around the school to see if she can still possibly stay on campus even though it wouldn't count for an internship. The entire time she keeps saying how much she would rather live on campus then she would my house, which to be honest somewhat hurt my feelings. But i brushed it off because I figured she more so meant that she just wanted a job. Well unfortunately by the time she started applying to all of these jobs the summer student worker positions were filled. Because of this we ended up moving all of her stuff to my house.

The next day we ended up going to graduation to see some of our friends off and Laura and I ran into a friend who was getting an apartment with her boyfriend after graduating. We all talked for a bit and then were on our way. I mentioned to Laura as we were walking back to my car that I can't wait until we have our own apartment one day and she got quiet all of a sudden and didn't want to talk about it. Once again I figured she was just worried about getting a job and let it go.

Later that same day we're relaxing at my house and Laura just seems to be in a bad mood because she can't find any food she likes in my house that she likes (she's vegetarian, whereas my family eats lots of meat and not too many vegetables). So I offer to take her to the grocery store so we can pick out what she wants. At this point Laura just glared at me for a few minutes and then lied back down on my bed and didn't want to talk to me. I ask her what's wrong, no response. I ask again and she just blows up at me all of a sudden with how she doesn't want to be living here with her boyfriend, how she's mad she didn't get the internship and how she doesn't want to talk about living together or getting engaged anymore and how she's just stressed.

At this point I let her be alone so she could cool off and run to the store myself and get her a bunch of foods I know she likes and make her dinner. For the rest of the night she seems much happier and stayed that way throughout all of today. Then all of a sudden an hour or so ago she was lying down in my room and she suddenly says how she hates that she has to live her with her boyfriend and she wants to live on her own and be independent. So I ask her or if she means just for this summer or if she doesn't even want to live together after graduating and she simply says I don't know. At this point I went to go workout and left Laura on her phone in my room.

I just don't get what's going on here. On one side I can understand that she's upset that she didn't get the internships she wanted and that she can't live on campus. But on the other side I've been trying my best to make things comfortable here and I'm hurt that she feels the way she does. And lastly I worry if she's starting to get second thoughts about us since she suddenly doesn't want to talk about moving in together or getting engaged when she was previously excited about it. I just want some basic opinions on our situation reddit.


tl;dr; Girlfriend wanted to live with me and have our own place for a long time and now she's living with me and miserable."
4jj8vm,4,2016-05-15,[Seeking][Share] 24/M Intern looking for ~$1000/month temporary housing in or near Mountain View,SqueeglePoof,SFBayHousing,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFBayHousing/comments/4jj8vm/seekingshare_24m_intern_looking_for_1000month/,"My original, cheaper, and closer-to-work option fell through, so I'm looking for housing in the area. I'll be around from June 19th to late August or early September (tbd) for research. Looking for something around $1000 (preferably less, as I'm earning less than $10,000 for the entire summer). I have been to Mountain View before, so I'm familiar with the location.

I've been considering staying at a hacker hostel, but I don't think I'd be able to handle sharing a room with 2+ people for that long; a private room would be ideal, but I'd consider sharing a room with 1 other person. I've been on several internships before, and each time I've either stayed at a private home or shared a room with another intern (want references?).

**About Me**

I'm 24/M, non-smoker, non-partier, 420-friendly, pet-friendly, trustworthy, quiet, and I clean up after myself. As is common in the area, I'm very interested in technology. I love listening to electronic music and even making my own. I enjoy making jokes in the company of a small handful of people, but avoid large groups. Other hobbies I like are hiking, camping, and playing video games.

Feel free to PM for more details."

I recently lost my job, which is a suck situation, but not really the end of the world. I've of course been combing the job sites and subreddits, but that can only get me so far. 

What I'm asking of you is **not** monetary assistance (although if you need cheap graphics work done, do check out my post in /r/slavelabour to give me some petty cash for bills and groceries) but if you've heard of any jobs in your company or your friend's company, etc etc that are hiring. There's usually something about jobs that actually come recommended from a human being that end up working better long-term. 

A little about me: I'm based in the Boston area, I have a bachelor's of science in Digital Arts &amp; Sciences (a combination of graphic design, programming, communication and math), as well as minors in business and mathematics. I graduated just over a year ago and held a professional career-type job in the marketing and events management industry until about a week and a half ago. I've had numerous internships in the marketing field as well. I have experience and training in customer service, copywriting, graphic design, HTML, CSS, sales, video production, direction and editing, project management and top-to-bottom events management tasks such as booth sales, contract negotiations, logistics and vendor coordination and light IT work. All of this does sound very inflated-resume, but I promise I either took a college class in it, or had it assigned to me as a task at work. 

So Reddit. Do you know of any positions I can apply to in the Boston area that would be in the marketing/events management field? Feel free to PM me if you want more info. "

Not an intern was stirring, not even a dildo; 
The dank memes were posted in Discord with care, 
In hopes that Kevin Panera would soon would be there; 
The VIP’s were yawning in front of their computers;
While visions of Yaniv banging more cougars; 
And Eddie in his ‘dress, and something about a cat, 
Had just held on to our butts for a long summer's nap,
When out in the hallways there arose such a splatter, 
I walked slowly from my tiny office to see what was the matter. 
Away through the foam door I walked in a reasonable pace, 
Tore open the shutters with a pale look on my face. 
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen show, 
There’s boobs in this rhyme? Cool. I forgot where I’m at just keep reading below, 
When what to my DripWet eyes did appear, 
But a miniature Action Alex and eight tiny cans of cheap beer, 
A man so youthful and sexy with a big fancy camera; 
I knew in a moment he must be Kevin Panera. 
More rapid than MikeBoys thrust his employees they came, 
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them generic names: 
""Now, Corrado! now, Los! now Evanne and Joey! 
On, Blythe! on, Liz! on, Beardo and Whitey! 
To the top of the fridge! to the top of the new set wall! 
Now fap away! fap away! fap away all!” 
As interns being burned by hot coffee fly, 
When they meet with a stunt, mount to the thigh; 
So up to the studio the employees they flew 
With the Power Wheels full of dildos, and Kevin Panera too— 
And then, in a peeping, I heard on the roof 
The gyrations and dancing of each little goof. 
As I threw up in my head, and was turning around, 
Down the anal cavity Kevin Panera came with a bound. 
He was dressed in apple bottom jeans and boots with da fur;
Looked like a common slut, Alexis-, a cheap whore.
A bundle of dildos he had stuck on his back, 
And he looked like a peddie just opening his sack. 
His eyes—how they wrinkled! his dimples, how deep! 
His cheeks were like marshmallows, his nose like a peep! 
His small little mouth was drawn up like a hoe, 
And the beard on his chin was as visible as California snow; 
The stump of a dildo he held tight in his teeth, 
And the Attack Brand Condoms necklace, it encircled his head like a wreath; 
He had a narrow face and a rubbed raw belly 
That shook when he laughed, like a spoonful of grape jelly. 
He was skinny and pale, like Slenderman you see, 
And I laughed when I saw him, and squirted when I peed; 
A wink of his eye and a twist of his knob 
Soon gave me the confidence to give a good hand job; 
He spoke not a word, but I went straight to jerk, 
And filled all the empty milk jugs; then turned with moar work, 
And laying his index finger aside of his nose, 
And giving a nod, up the crystal meth it rose; 
He sprang to his Power Wheels, and sped off doing a wheelie, 
And away they all flew like the downs of a theory. 
But I heard him exclaim, as he drove out of sight— 
“Happy Attackmas to all, and to all a good night!”"

I was dismissed from my college sometime ago for my grades, and ended up getting reinstated soon after because it was due to personal issues.

I took some time off from school to go to a psychologist and get a part time job for a while. Eventually after having a job and taking some classes on the side, I decided that I was ready to return to my school.

So here I am now, in my first term back, fucking everything up once again.

I was never over my issues. I just convinced myself that I was. I've been telling my parents and friends that everything's alright and that I'm doing fine, but the truth is that I can barely force myself to leave the house or go to class most days; and because of this I ended up sabotaging myself once again.

Last day to withdraw from my classes was last week, but I couldn't even do that. I couldn't bare to tell my advisor, who has been helping me along this whole time, that I need to withdraw from all of my classes again (and honestly, since I'm on reinstatement contract I don't think I would be able to...)

So now I'm very likely going to fail 2 out of the 3 classes I took this term, thereby failing the reinstatement contract requirements, and failing out of my school.

I'm a computer science major with a decent amount of experience (had a 6 month internship and helped develop a website for the past 4 months), but I don't think that will matter much without the degree.

I don't even know what to do with my life right now. I want to just go in a hole and die. I'm not sure what I should even do after this. Should I go to a community college and see if I'll do better there(if I can even go with getting kicked out of this school? I don't really know how they work to be honest..)? Should I try to get a minimum wage job? Should I try to apply for a computer science related job? It also really doesn't help that the school I currently attend is very expensive and the loans I've already taken out are going to kill me without a decent paying job.

I really need any help I can get. I'm just sitting here unsure of what to do with my life anymore.

I was 3 years into this school and doing fine, then this whole disaster happened.....and now I really don't know what I should even do...help please..."

I feel like a complete failure.,BertMacklinMD,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4jk6dl/graduated_college_this_weekend_i_feel_like_a/,"I got my mechanical engineering degree (Bachelor's) from a top 25 school this past weekend.  I'm supposed to be happy.  Instead, I've just been plagued by regrets and suffocating depression.  I have no experience in my field whatsoever, no serious job prospects, and I made no friends in the process.  

My time in school always felt like a struggle.  I was a transfer student who elected to commute 30-45 (each way) minutes all three years to save money.  I never really excelled at the material despite studying my ass off.  I also had bad anxiety at the start of last year and had to go see a psychologist (who I'm still currently seeing).  Despite these hardships, I still feel like I should've done a lot more with my time.  I made the effort to join some clubs but I never really stuck with them consistently due to weird meeting times/assignments.  I even tried to join an engineering frat but they declined to give me a bid.  I tried to do research, but the professor said I'd need to give a bigger time commitment in order to get a spot.  I applied to over 60 different internship positions last summer and could not get a single offer.  My social skills are also complete piss and I was alone almost all the time on campus.  At this point, I'm just giving a litany of excuses and it's not really helping.

On graduation day, I looked at my peers and they were able to succeed in all the areas where I've failed and it's absolutely killing me inside.  They've gotten good grades, been active in student organizations, landed internships/jobs at top companies, and made friends.  I really have no idea how to go forward knowing that I wasted three really important years.  Can anyone relate and/or share advice?"

I'm here once again in the hopes of finding some awesome people to play games with and talk to. A little bit about me:

* I love video games. I play a little bit of everything, however when I'm playing solo I mainly play RPG or MMO games. 

* I talk a lot when playing games and am more then happy to voice chat when playing together. I have every system except for xbox 360 available to play.

* I don't play MOBAs of any kind. They bore me to death.

* I binge watch random anime with my girlfriend. We have to watch it quickly, or we have a habit of never watching the ending.

* I'm a jack of all trades. I love to learn new skills and won't turn down the chance. I know a bit about many things ranging from programming to roller derby.

* My gaming habit make me sound like a shut-in, but I do have other hobbies. I am a voulnteer EMT, I enjoy music and going to outdoor concerts (although I usually play hacksack 90% of the time) 

* I live in the eastern time zone and I have a job that keeps me in a lab most of the day. I'm an R&amp;D chemist intern, and am currently working on my bachelor degreee in science. 

I think that about sums up a decent portion of me. If you're interested in playing games I would like that:

* You're willing to play games every so often. Doesn't have to be every day, but please don't just add me and never play games with me.

* Voice chat is a plus as it makes playing some games easier, however I do talk a lot and can be very profane at times. 

* You are willing to play many different games. Its nice to have a bit of variety to what games you play.

* Most importantly is to have fun! Games are about having fun and enjoying the people you're playing with. It's no fun when people get uptight or upset when things aren't going perfectly.

If you're still interested in taking a shot at it, feel free to send me a message with a bit about yourself and your chosen gaming platform. If you don't play games but you want to chat, feel free to send me a message also. This post turned out to be longer then I originally intended, so I commend you if you actually read all this."

**INTRODUCTION**

My name is Andrew, 28 year old professional from New York. I am 6'5, 220 pounds, blonde hair, blue eyes, with a strong build and broad, muscular shoulders. My hard outer appearance is contrasted sharply and juxtaposed by my sweet tender inside and penchant for kindness.

I share a deep affinity for story-telling and writing in general and my past prompts and posts have usually tried to demand a higher level of grammar, imagination, detail and literacy in the responses as I feel that's the best way to keep a story alive and fresh and prevent it from becoming stale or having either side decide they may as well just watch some porn.

I've been posting on DPP for a long time and today I am in the mood for something a bit more vanilla as I hope to engage a more diverse population of those individuals who frequent this lovely sub-reddit. I've been seeing some especially great prompts recently and want to make sure I'm not alienating anyone by requesting the same prompts/kinks.

**PROMPTS**

I've narrowed down my prompt ideas into separate categories, each with their own plot lines and twists and can incorporate other ideas as well and are all up for discussion!

**(1)NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR**

I've just moved in to town from the high powered life of New York City as an attorney working in Manhattan. I've grown tired of the constant hustle and am looking for a more small-town feel. I've gotten a job at the local law firm, a boutique operation specializing in real estate closings and is more in line with the slower pace I hope to find. You have been living in the small town of Paradise Springs your whole life and are intrigued at the new neighbor that you have. We spark a conversation and begin a slow and gentle courtship.

**(2)THE CO-WORKERS**

Similar premise to the above prompt, only we have been holding on to a work friendship for nearly three years now. Always amiable to one another, we never really felt any kind of emotional spark together, just a simple friendship between two people who understand each other. Perhaps one of us goes through a particularly harrowing time (i.e. a breakup, death in the family, etc.) and relies significantly on the other for support, where a new tenderness seems to blossom.

**(3)THE ANNIVERSARY**

This one would center around a pre-existing romantic relationship and be premised upon a one year anniversary, perhaps even six months or something of the like to mark a very special time in a budding new love affair.
Long-time lurker here and have finally decided to put my ""hat in the ring"" so to speak and try my hand at roleplaying and seeing if I can get any quality responses and to return the favor!



**(4)OFFICE AFFAIR**

The office affair with some kind of added twist. You could be my boss, peer, secretary or intern but we are both married and over time the sexy innuedos and flirting get taken further and further as we both realize we don't get what we want at home. But there's more to you than meets the eye. You decide what it is! 

**(5)THE ELEVATOR**

The woman in the elevator. Weeks have gone by and at least twice a week I ride the elevator up with you. It's the best 60 seconds of my day. My god you're gorgeous and you always give a crooked smile when I get on. And that little hair flip as you tell me to ""Have a nice day!"" when I get off the elevator knowing I've been checking you out. But one day the elevator is overly crowded and we are pushed against each other and I just can't stop myself from getting hard and you feel it against your ass...

**(6)INCEST**

Mom/sister drama queen. You're always the damsel in distress and every time you come to me over something petty and annoying but I know you rely on me quite heavily and I'm always there for you. But this time it's serious. You're going to have to hide out with me in my apartment for who knows how long. And that sexual tension that's been there since I was 12... surfaces and I have to try and deal with you getting a little too close when my mind is else where. 

I've written much longer prompts before that are more specific and if you wanted to check those out by all means please do. I really want to find a long term roleplay partner but I understand we have to be able to connect for that to happen. 

**KINKS**

My favorite kinks are: 

* Vanilla/Romance
* Anal
* Facials
* Blowjobs
* Cuddling
* Kissing

PM me and let me know what you'd like to try and if there is anything you would like to change or add to any of the prompts. I really enjoy having my partner have equal say in the set up and role of characters! 

I can't wait to talk to you soon!

4jl7gy,1,2016-05-16,Interning for the Reaper,AlinaKG,AlinaKG,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlinaKG/comments/4jl7gy/interning_for_the_reaper/,"Prompt: You are an intern for the grim reaper. A massive battle has just occurred, leaving many dead. Describe the logistics (and difficulties) involved in herding thousands of people into their respective afterlives.

*****

I don’t know who told me to apply for this job, but he was clearly a blithering idiot. 

The Grim Reaper seemed together when I did my training—made a big fuss about the black cloak, and to always keep it clean and tidy because no one wanted to be reaped by a slob—but as soon as we took the training wheels off and I presided over my first death, he lost it. 

He cried because I learned too quickly and thereby made him useless, because my mother would be so proud if she knew, but she didn’t since I died young and now she has to live an empty life on earth without me—this one got me crying right along with him—and now that we had just come to reap the people of the massacre, the Grim Reaper sat cross-legged, on the patch of grass where we landed, and sobbed for the *babies*, while I did all the work. 

“It’s time now, Mrs. Rodgers,” I said, and held out a hand, doing and saying exactly what he trained me to. They had to touch me, you see, or it didn’t work. Sometimes it took a lot of convincing, but I haven’t had a problem yet.

The woman, mid-thirties, looked up at me, and hesitated, biting her lip in a slight panic. “Do I have to?” Her lip quivered, and shoulder rose in question.

“You see all these people?” I asked, and made her turn her head to look. “They’re in a lot of pain, and the quicker I get to them, the quicker that stops. I’m not going to be the last face you see, okay? So, don’t you worry about that.”

She nodded, and I smiled then quickly closed my mouth, remembering the black stains around the edges of my teeth.

I tried to cover most of my face with the hood of the cloak, but that made some things worse. My skin was a lighter shade than that of a corpse and dark rings ran around my eyes, within which the pupil dilated to replace the iris entirely.

The woman reached out, touching my arm, and absolutely nothing happened. My head twitched to the side in question. 

“What now?” she asked.

“Ah . . . hold on. Let me go call an actual reaper.” This had never happened before. “I’m sorry, I’m just a trainee.”

The Grim Reaper still sat on the same patch of grass. He looked up at the sky, and his chest shook as another wave of sobbing overcame him.

“Hey, Jerry,” I said, approaching. He’d asked me to call him that on the first day, Mr. Grim Reaper, Sir, didn’t quite work for him. “That woman back there isn’t working.”

“What?” His forehead wrinkled. He took a second to think, and then shot up, eyes wide. “Did you touch someone not bound for death?”

I opened my mouth to answer, but no words came out. *Crap, I forgot to smell her.* He never told me what happened when we made contact with those that would survive, but by the look on his face, it wasn’t good.

“Damn it!” He bared his dark teeth at me, and stormed off toward the woman. “Five reaper rules, Lily! Five. What are they? Name them!” His cheeks glinted with streaks of tears, but none formed in his eyes anymore. Anger replaced the sadness.

“Don’t feel sorry for them,” I named that one first, since well, he’d been breaking the rule since I became his intern. “Don’t go near family members or friends. Inspect the wounds. Smell for death. Make them touch you.”

“And smell for death again! That’s the sixth. How many times have we gone over the rules?”

“A lot.” I walked next to him sheepishly. The battle had been my fault, and the guilt was rather easy to hide. Jerry, in the midst of his own breakdown, didn't pay any attention to me.

“Now, we’ve got another damn psychic on our hands. Do you know how much I hate psychics?” He closed his eyes and paused in his step. “She’ll see it all now, and probably write a damn book about it. Honestly, Lily, we don’t need that kind of exposure again.”

“What do we care about some book?”

He stopped. “What do we care about some book?” He glared at me, and came closer. I felt his chilled breath on my face, and leaned my head back. “That’ll be the third written about me. Do you know how embarrassing that is? The sheer incompetence of it is divine. All the reapers will be talking about this. Not to mention, you’ve give this woman the sight.”
 
“I’ll fix it,” I said, and nodded. 

“Oh, not you won’t. Where the book of the dead? You’ll follow me around just like on your first day, and scribble the names in.”

I sighed. “But the book writes them in by itself,” I moaned. 

“Well, that’s a damn shame, isn’t it? Back to the start of the training for you!” 

He walked past the woman, and onto a hilltop, below which the dying had truly gathered. With a sigh, and a shake of the head, he said, “The other reapers have already arrived. Oh, you’ve done it now.”

The whole field smelled like death. The strength of the coppery reek made my head spin, and I was glad that Jerry banned me from reaper service for today. I wouldn’t be able to tell who gave off the smell, too many of bodies piled up on each other.

“Alright, Lily, I’m trusting you again. I won’t let those bastards claim more death than us. Do what you must, but get those names in my book. Or I’ll never be able to quit this damn job.”

4jlal4,1,2016-05-16,"How do I [22F] survive the next three months with an entitled, selfish roommate [23F] who insists that we be friends? Am I in the wrong here?",wmpr3991,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4jlal4/how_do_i_22f_survive_the_next_three_months_with/,"After graduating from undergrad, my roommate Lucy and I were really pumped to move to New York City to go to the same graduate school. When I submitted my deposit, a friend of a friend, Angela, reached out to me. She was also going to be moving to NYC for a different graduate school, and she wanted to know if we could live together. She didn't know anyone else in the city and didn't want to be stranded looking for housing alone. I didn't know Angela well at all - I'd only met her for probably 15 minutes before. But our mutual friend, who I really trust and love and who had lived with Angela in college, said we'd be perfect together as roommates. After Lucy agreed to it we decided we'd take her in with us. We all discussed budgets and what we were looking for in apartments (Angela stressed that she was interested in location over size), and we were ready to rumble.

When it came time to look for three bedroom apartments in July, Angela was unable to make it as she was across the country and her foot was broken. No problem at all. Lucy and I headed up to the city to start our search and our parents came with us to help. The only issue was that Angela's program was located a significant distance away from ours. I really, REALLY wanted to make sure that Angela didn't get cheated because she wasn't able to be there with us. Because Lucy had never met her and had no personal ties to her, she wasn't as interested in what would be best for Angela, so she and our parents kept pushing me to look at the (cheaper, larger) apartments that were closer to where Lucy and I would be going to school. We were looking at places significantly below our budget cutoff that were right across the street from where I would attend classes, but I stayed firm in defending Angela's best interests, even though it was making me really unpopular with the group. I also took it upon myself to text Angela pictures of every room in every apartment we saw, including information about price points and distance to her program so that she could still have a say in what we were doing from afar. I thought this was just a decent thing to do as a human being. 

The process was a complete disaster. I won't go into details for brevity's sake, but there were tears and lost apartments and general stress. Four days later, Lucy and I still hadn't found a place. By total and complete chance, we landed a place located dead in the center between Angela's program and ours. It was just a little over our budget, but it was cheap for the area and it was where we needed it to be. I was still a little unsure about it because the rooms were not the same size throughout - there was one very large master bedroom, one medium sized room, and one quite small room. I worried that this would cause roommate issues in the apartment, but Lucy and our parents were really pressuring me after four days of total anxiety and wasting money, so I agreed to it. I texted Angela pictures of the place as well as the cost and we FaceTimed her to make sure she felt it was right, and after her approval we signed the lease. 

The day to move in arrived. Lucy moved in before I did and she took the medium sized room. That left either the master bedroom or the smaller bedroom for me, because Angela wouldn't move in until the next day. I texted Angela asking if she had any preference in rooms, and I assumed she knew what she was agreeing to since I had sent her pictures. She said she didn't care. I was still a little torn because it felt weird to just leave her with the smaller room, but everyone encouraged me to take the bigger one, as we were the ones who had spent the time and the money booking train tickets and hotel rooms to come up to the city and look for apartments. So I moved my stuff into the larger room and waited for Angela to arrive. 

I helped her move her stuff into our 5th floor walkup and I could tell she was very disappointed. Apparently she hadn't really looked at the pictures because she did not realize her room was so small. Even so, she still bought a queen sized bed that took up a lot of the space. Lucy and I told her she was welcome to use the closets in the hallway as an additional place to store things if she needed it, and she could use some of my closet as well. It was at this point that shit hit the fan.

We all sat down a week or so after moving in and Angela dropped the bomb: she wanted Lucy and I to pay more of the rent. We were a little shocked, as we had originally all decided together that we would pay equal amounts. She said she felt her room was a ridiculously small size (granted, it is small, but I had SHARED a room of that size a few years before in college and never complained) and it was unfair of her to pay the same as us. This is a reasonable request, but when I saw what her mother had calculated out, she basically wanted me to pay over $800 more a month. What?! Completely objectively, my room is 100% not worth that amount. Meanwhile she'd be paying less than half of what we had agreed to. Bear in mind that she comes from a very rich background - her mother still sends her a package of new, expensive clothes every week, so I knew it wasn't about the money. I told her I'd already gone over my maximum budget allowance in getting this place, and unfortunately I wouldn't be able to pay any more. I offered to switch rooms, but she declined. Lucy and I told her that she could have her own bathroom (our place has two and Lucy and I didn't mind sharing) but she insisted on sharing with me. As a final offering I told her she could come in and use my room whenever she wanted (I have a desk in there for studying and she complained she couldn't fit a desk in her room). After this, we all tried to move on.

But we couldn't. I really really tried to just put it past me, but I was really irked by the whole ordeal. I felt that I'd done my very best to look out for Angela, but she was kind of accusing me of treating her unfairly. She continued to complain about the living situation to Lucy, who in turn told me about it. It probably doesn't help that we all approach roommate situations as an opportunity for new friends, so I think we all came in with the expectation that we HAD to be besties. We tried doing roommate activities together, exploring NYC together, etc etc. I even invited Angela out just the two of us for coffee or meals to see if we could dissolve the tension by spending more time together, but it never worked. 

It didn't help that overall she was just a bad roommate. She doesn't clean up after herself and she doesn't pitch in to buy communal apartment supplies like paper towels or dishwasher detergent. She is always borrowing my stuff, and she occasionally breaks them (she used to always borrow this one blazer of mine that I had never used, and she mistreated it so badly that it was ruined by the time I got it back and I had to throw it away). One time after a serious roommate talk she tried to clean the shower in our bathroom, but she didn't even know which cleaning supplies to use and she had to ask. We'd been living together for at least 8 months at that point. 

Bear in mind that these are all things I have been able to look past in prior roommates because I care for them and love them, and I'm typically able to find their shining qualities through the bad stuff. For some reason in this situation I haven't been able to do that, and every time she does something I don't like I can't wipe it off like I normally can. I go through phases where I really try and be her friend, because everyone else who knows her seems to think she is a great person and she very well may be, but for some reason I can't do it. I've tried listening to her vent about her issues and even venting about mine, but I stopped feeling like I could trust her because every time I start to talk about what's going on in my life she compares it to what's going on in hers, inevitably turning the conversation back to herself. I think she's just oblivious that she does this and she's probably just trying to relate to me in the only way she knows how, but it still turns me off. On top of all of this I am engaged in a really emotionally demanding internship and I don't have a lot of emotional energy to give at the end of the day, so it's hard for me to talk with her much, which probably makes her feel rejected because she thinks we need to be friends. She kind of overdoes it in her attempt to be nice to me, and it is really exhausting because it comes off as really fake. For example, I'll come home at the end of the day and she'll be like, ""Oh my gosh HIIIIII!!! How was your dayyyy?!"" in a really high pitched and fake voice. I'll say one minor thing that happened, like ""I had a muffin for breakfast"" and she'll be like ""OH my gosh NO WAY. That's AMAZING."" It just seems so fake to me, but I know she's just trying to be friends. She and Lucy have been able to get pretty close, and although Lucy has her tiffs with Angela as well, she considers her a good friend at this point. 

By now I've reverted to just avoiding Angela. She continues to try and reach out to me, but I can't handle it. I find her emotionally draining to talk to and I'm sick of being in the same space as her. I feel like she's fake and entitled, and I just don't want to live with her anymore. When we're both in the apartment just the two of us, I find any excuse to either leave or lock myself away in my room so I don't have to talk to her. I'm still genial to her, and I try not to be rude, but I can't do it anymore. When it came time for us to talk about what would happen next year, I sat down with her and told her I thought it would be best if we went our separate ways. To my surprise, she REALLY tried to convince me that we should make it work somehow, but I just can't do it. I think she thinks we've failed somehow because we weren't able to be friends, and part of me feels that way too, but I don't know. I can't see myself happy next year if I have to live in the same space as her. Now I don't know how to survive these next few months.

Reddit, what do I do? How do I survive another few months with a girl who insists that we be friends? I don't want to be mean to her, but I can't stand being around her. I really want to be able to just let go of all these negative feelings about her and just spend time with her, but I don't know how to do that - any advice?

TLDR: My roommate and I got off to a bad start and now there's so much tension. She really wants to be friends and seeks out every opportunity to make this happen, but I can't stand her anymore. How do I survive the next few months? "

Instead, I held it underhand and heard the scratching on the paper as I reaped the victims of the massacre. 

Jerry dotted around the bodies too, jumping from one to the other and holding his hand out toward them. The tragedy turned into a scavenger hunt. All the reapers seemed in an awful hurry. I was the only one actually speaking to the victims. 

Bones poked through skin, swords lay scattered, and blood colored the grass. A clot of bile rose in my throat. It dipped and rose midway. I felt an urge to just stick my fingers into my mouth and get it out, but there was no time.

Jerry didn’t explain why this massacre turned into chaos among the reapers, nor did he explain the point of the book. I just knew that both were important.

I scooted over to a man, inspecting his injuries. A deep cut split his stomach, and a bulge of his intestine poked out just a tad. White as a ghost, his face brightened with a weak smile when he saw me. “Don’t worry,” he said in a voice, low as a sigh. “Mother’s still got Peter.”

The hot sting of tears ran through the top of my nose and up to my eyes. I put my hand on his armor, and looked up to make sure Jerry wasn’t near. “Why are you here, Rob? What the hell were you thinking? It’s bad enough what I did, but this is treason!”

“He wasn’t supposed to have you, Lily.” He lurched up, coughing, and droplets of blood landed on my arm and cloak. “Father messed . . . up. He should have let you chose, like he let us chose.”

“No,” my lip quivered at the sight of him, “it was my fault. I shouldn’t have run away from the King. It was a good marriage. And now look what I’ve done to you.”

“I should have stood up for you before it came to this.” He heaved a deep sigh, and his eyes rolled up in pain. “Lily, end the pain.” Without thinking, I took his hand, to soothe him through it. 

Rob looked up at me suddenly, and furrowed his brows. 

I gasped, and saw as the cut in his stomach sealing, and all signs of pain disappeared from his face. “Thank you, Lily! Thank you.”

“What in the bloody hell did you do?” I heard Jerry’s voice bellow from across the field. Some reapers halted their actions and watched as he marched toward me.

“I’m sorry!” I said, wide eyed. “I . . . didn’t mean to—it’s my—” I cut myself off before saying brother. Family was off limits. 

Jerry grabbed the book from my hand, opened it and pursed his lips in anger. He swung the book at me, and I held out my hands to block the blow that did not land. I heard a thump as the book fell by my feet.

“You’re the worst intern that I’ve ever had! THE WORST! This just cost me a thousand deaths! Now I can’t move on again. I had three left, Lily! THREE!” He was fuming, blue face turning a shade of bright purple. His foot tapped against the grass. He sucked in a calming breath, and spoke, “What are the five rules, Lily? Name them for me.”

The reason for me wanting to move out is because I want to develop myself as a person and because I for some reasons have this idea that I identify more with the societies within these countries.

I'm currently trying to graduate from uni (I will mostly not be looking for a job that's related to what I'm graduating in, because that would require that I take a non-paid internship at either the EU or the UN and I don't accept to work for free), I work as a security guard and have no kids nor a man. 

I'm open to most things, such as learning a new language (I already speak and write Swedish, English and French) or move to a small apartment (I'm not a person that has to live in the biggest city of a specific country). And since I've been working as a guard for at least a year now, I would not have any problem with looking for jobs within the surveillance/security industry.

So what I would like to know is if someone could help me with choosing one of these countries to move to? Any tips on where to start to look out for information? "

Let me give you some background information.  I am currently home from college for the summer, well, a couple weeks more like, seeing as I am leaving in about 10 days for a vacation with my boyfriend's family, and then moving to D.C. for the summer for an internship.  My father killed himself when I was about 2 years old, and my mother is truly one of the strongest people I know, anyone who meets her is overwhelmed by her gentle-heartedness and care towards others.  The last year has been pretty hard, as we lost my grandmother ( my mom's mom), and as soon as I came home for Thanksgiving break this past year, our beloved yellow kitty Berlioz got hit by a truck while playing outside. Needless to say, my mom has been through her fair share of shitty things, and is still an incredible person regardless.  You see, my mom treats our cats basically as well as children, especially when I am away at school.  Berlioz's death absolutely broke mine and my mom's heart, as he was only 3.  We couldn't bear the blanket of sadness over our household that came with his absence, and so, within the week I was home for Thanksgiving, we ended up adopting another baby cat, whose name was ironically Jill (my name as well).  My mom and I coddled the crap out of Jill, whose name we changed to Brandi.  My mom was constantly sending me photos and videos of her and everybody who came over fell in love with Brandi.  Last night, my friend and I were hanging out at my kitchen table, and my mom was in the laundry room.  All of the sudden I heard her scream, so my friend and I ran over.  She was holding Brandi, absolutely hysterical, sobbing, trying to wake her up.  Brandi is still pretty tiny, and had snuck into the dryer while my mom was loading it.  I cannot get the image of my mom holding her out of my head, and I hate it.  My mom exclaimed things like, ""What kind of person am I to have done this?"" and "" Oh, what a terrible way for a little innocent kitten to die.""  We both just couldn't stop screaming for about 10 minutes, not believing it had happened.  Even today, I keep thinking it was a bad dream and am looking for her to jump up on my bed.  The worst part is that I heard the loud clanging from the dryer too and just ignored it because it makes noises like that a lot of the time.  I know I'm going to have some serious PTSD from this, as animal deaths in movies and stuff have always upset me more than human deaths (kinda messed up, I know).  I think it's something to do with their love and innocence and these big machines fucking that up.  I am mostly concerned about my mom though.  Not only will she be upset by the absence of Brandi while I am gone, but she will be absolutely ridden with grief.  We are both sort of spacey people, and I think she is putting the blame on her lack of attention, and worries that people will say things like, ""how did you manage to let that happen?"" She has no clue how she managed to turn it on without realizing Brandi was inside, and I (and everyone else) keeps telling her how often freak accidents like this happen and that nobody can blame themselves, especially her, because it could've happened to anyone.  So, a few main questions here:

1.) What are the best things I can do for my mom while I am still here, and how can I help her get through this?  I know I need to be strong like she was for me, but what else?

2.) How do I deal with the PTSD and the guilt of leaving my mom like this for the summer? I already called my therapist to schedule an appointment, but does anyone know about hypnosis and PTSD?  I'm having terrible visions and dreams at night, which I know will hopefully heal with time, but as of right now it's awful.  

Side note:  Last night my mom was using talk-to-text to reply to a text my cousin had sent her.  Regarding Brandi, she said, ""I just feel so bad"", but the iPhone heard it as, ""you stupid bitch.""  I'm not sure how spiritual any of you are, but my mom is convinced that this was Brandi calling her a stupid bitch for what she did.  I know it's silly, but I am very spiritual, and have been scared shitless at night thinking her spirit is here and angry at us.

4jm4x2,1,2016-05-16,BP Friends want to hang,[deleted],asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/4jm4x2/bp_friends_want_to_hang/,"So my friends are somewhat blue pill.

They've both got their host of family problems. Friend 1's overweight and tall. He's got a gf who tries to control his life in minute ways. He says he's trying to hang out with me and my other buddy more often, but it just seems like he doesn't know the value of time and is trying to hang out with us only when he's bored (which is a lot lately since his girlfriend moved back to her parents' house and he's trying to make it big on Youtube playing CSGO). We also have little power struggles and it's obvious (both in the virtual world - leaders of our video game parties - and in real life).

Friend 2 is a super sensitive guy who I've written about in concern previously. He's beta with women but looks like a nice guy Yakuza gangster. He's very active and always wants to go bike riding or hang out. 

I'm currently in Monk Mode and trying to instil some strong habits that will propel me towards success. My sister is telling me that the way I'm feeling is silly because I'm taking my friends for granted because I'm denying requests to hang out, that I'll regret it in the future. I played call of duty non-stop for weeks with them. I packed up my Playstation and discussed how guilty I felt about playing with a different friend of mine. He understood what I meant when I said me and Friend 1&amp;2 don't think alike. I think video games are a complete waste of time. They're okay in moderation but come the fuck on, you could do better than kill kids repeatedly on Call of Duty for a few ""moderated"" hours.

I don't know about these guys man. Am I being fucking selfish for not wanting to waste my time? What do we do? We played badminton once which was fun. Other times, we go out and eat junk food (bubble tea is amazing). Friend 1's been saying he wants to work out with me. I don't want a gym partner. I want self-discipline. Are my friends needy? Give me permission to drop these guys. Inside I feel so cold and distant from these dudes. I haven't ever had a conversation with them where we thought critically about the state of our lives. We're going into our last year and haven't gotten any internships or have any jobs lined up. I feel like I shouldn't give up on them as they may be useful later or be good friends. What the fuck is a friend anyways?

They have families that can back them with cash. I'm poor. These kids are pretty well off and I quote Friend 2, ""I know too many people who have focused on themselves...they usually lose themselves in the process"". Man fuck you. I'm just trying to get mine.

I think they're great people and they have shown me respect and we've had lots of good times. But dude, it's not the first year of university anymore. We've been friends for a while, that's great, but are you going to give me a job? Or pay my parents' mortgage? Or buy me that 65 Mustang I've wanted for fucking ever? Yeah I didn't think so.

My question is: how should I proceed?

I have a math BS with a 3.86 GPA from a ""meh"" school where I was a big fish in a small department. I won some awards in my school, merit scholarships, spoke at my graduation, etc. I did not take any classes relating to actuary science at all, save for the required stats and probability courses for my major. In fact, my focus was more on pure math (abstract algebra etc)...

I went to school late, at 21. And graduated in 2013 at 25.

I worked 4 jobs since graduating. Two startups, one big corporation, and one smaller company. I quit them all - never got fired. I know this doesn't look good but I have some good professional references. I worked as a coder (JAVA and Python) for one of the startups, risk analyst for the corporation, and as a head of operations for the other 2 companies. My resume is all over the place.

I want to settle down and have a stable job, with normal hours, and less stress that the company will soon fold. This is why I am seriously thinking of becoming an actuary. 

I haven't signed up for any of the exams but reviewed the material and believe I can pass on my first try.

Questions:

(1) How many and which exams should I take before I start applying for jobs?

(2) Should I apply to internships and do an internship while still studying for exams?

(3) Are internships paid? If so, how much?

(4) Based on my stats, would kind of salary should I expect in Boston or NYC?

edit:

(5) Am I at a huge disadvantage because of my age and unfocused experience?"

4jmea4,1,2016-05-16,Ongoing mental fatigue problem,aww_shee,AskDocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/4jmea4/ongoing_mental_fatigue_problem/,"First-time poster here, I'm finally doing so because I don't know where else to turn. I apologize in advance for the lengthy post, but I've spent so much time trying to figure this out, and tried so many things, that I want to be sure I don't leave out any details that may prove crucial.

I'm a 21-year-old male, about to graduate from college in Central Texas. I've been experiencing on-and-off mental fatigue for almost a year and a half now. It started around January 2015, I was starting another semester of college and my girlfriend and I decided to try becoming a vegetarian. Soon, I noticed that I wasn't feeling like myself -- I couldn't really focus on anything when I was in class and I had a hard time talking to and enjoying time spent with my friends. After a couple of months of this, I decided to drop being stricly vegetarian and instead avoid eating red meat only, in the hopes that my condition would improve, but it didn't. I visited my university's health services and saw a doctor, who after a lengthy conversation with me said that we could run some blood tests to see if I had a vitamin deficiency, and that if nothing strange came up, it was probably just stress that was giving me problems. The blood tests came back and everything was normal.

I spent the next six months trying various things on my own, to no avail. I started taking iron supplements around April, and they seemed to help at first but after a week or so, stopped making any difference. Despite how I felt, my academic performance didn't decline at all, and I spent the summer doing a techincal internship with a large company, and performed very well. At the end of my internship in August, I started eating red meat again. When I came back for another semester in September, I went back to the same doctor, who advised doing a few more blood tests to test for certain infections. The results came back and showed that I had had CMV infection and EBV infection recently. Both his advice and research I did independently online suggested that there wasn't any cure for these diseases, but that they remain latent in the human body. I'm not sure how I contracted these diseases, but the most obvious cause might have been the advancement of my relationship with my girlfriend -- we started having sex about a month or two before I started feeling tired all the time. The rest of the semester went by, and my condition only got worse. I felt exhausted all the time. I really did believe that stress was causing my problems, since I had a difficult workload that semester and was applying for full-time jobs, travelling a lot to do rounds of interviews. I thought that once the semester was over, I would feel better.

The semester came to an end, and things didn't improve. The doctor I had seen at my university had also recommended doing a sleep study, to see if I had sleep apnea. I did one when I returned home in December 2015, and went in to see a doctor about the results. The results indicated that I woke up many, many times while I was sleeping there -- on average, once every five minutes -- but that my problem wasn't severe enough to qualify for sleep apnea. I have always been a light sleeper, so I wonder how much of my disturbed sleep was caused by the sensors and cables that were attached to me while I was there. The doctor I met with at the sleep center asked me some questions about my living habits, and concluded that the only cause must be stress. He gave me some recommendations for how to ensure I get better sleep, and said I should take melatonin before I go to bed every night. I've been doing that for the past few months, and while it has certainly helped me fall asleep quicker and sleep deeper, I still don't feel like myself most of the time. I did some research recently online, and I found some Wikipedia pages that I feel describe my symptoms best: mental fatigue, directed attention fatigue. I would also say that a lot of the time, it feels like my eyes won't focus on anything -- I am nearsighted and wear contact lenses every day, but this feeling goes beyond just nearsightedness. I've planned a third visit with the same doctor, but this will be the last time I'll be able to meet with him, since I'm graduating in a week. The past several months, I've gotten very depressed over the situation, because it seems like there's no end in sight and that the supposed best time of my life is being squandered. Nowadays, I take naps in the middle of the day (the sleep doctor instructed me not to, but sometimes, it feels like it's beyond my ability to avoid...), and hardly plan anything fun in advance, because I don't have any guarantee that I'll feel like myself.

I've tried thinking a lot about what might be (consciously or sub-consciously) making me stressed out. Graduating from classes might be one reason, but I have a job lined up after I graduate, so it's not like I have no plans for the future. I'm also generally a somewhat paranoid person, but I've stopped seeing people as often as my condition has deteriorated, so I don't think that's the central issue. Any insight into other tests or treatments I could investigate would be much appreciated."
4jmga7,1,2016-05-16,Are people as stupid and irrational as I think they are or am I just mentally ill and need to be put on psych drugs to suppress my disgust with those around me?,brainfogboy,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4jmga7/are_people_as_stupid_and_irrational_as_i_think/,"Where does one draw the line between intelligence and mental illness?  In which walks of life is the ""herd"" always right, and should be listened to?  If everyone tells you you're crazy, and you are crazy and unable to see it in yourself (because you're crazy), then they are right.  If you are not crazy, and everyone tells you you're crazy, that would make them wrong.  In either case, you would believe yourself to not be mentally ill.  So how do you tell if you really are, or if it's just everyone being a fucking idiot around you?

Parents want to diagnose me with depression at 28 years old.  I am currently battling chronic illness.  Parents have never read DSM 5 or even know what the DSM is.  They rely on others to tell them what to think.

Doctors tell me about the ""mind body"" connection, and suggest SSRIs and that I am in ""deep need of psychiatric help"" despite the fact that I have gone down that road before, taken the drugs, and nothing has worked.

Diagnosed with ""Autonomic Dysfunction with Vagal Neuropathy"" which is a nervous system disorder, but everyone wants to tell me that my ""depression"" that I don't believe I have is causing my health problem.  Could it be that because I'm sick and sometimes cannot get out of bed it may look like depression when in fact it's just chronic illness?

The problem with being surrounded by these people is that I have no objective evidence to support my state of mind.  I am being driven insane by these people (family, friends, doctors) who, without evidence, tell me I'm depressed, and are not open to discussion on the topic.  I hate authority.

When you live with these people you start to question your own sanity.  I have always done very well in life (school, internships, jobs, military experience, etc.) and have excelled at every job/position I have ever held.  I believe myself to be more competent than my fellow workers, as evident by my success in life.  Why all of a sudden am I doubting myself and questioning my own sanity, just because the herd wants me to question myself and take their pills, when I've had a tremendous success in my past?

I deep down do not want to take any more psych drugs.  I want my nervous system fixed.  All everyone wants to tell me is that ""when the depression goes away so will your health problems"", as if someone with AIDS or cancer can just take effexor to make the problem go away?

I'm going mad.  I can't stand these people.  Is it me and do I need to be on effexor to shut them the fuck up, or is everyone else, those god-worshipping ignorant cocksuckers really as stupid, closeminded, and irrational as I think they are?  The same people that cannot plan for the future, are incompetent at work, and unable to hold a basic conversation with me without warping the truth?

The biggest problem I have is that I now find myself ignoring evidence in front of me because ""Dad doesn't believe it"", sort of like how I was indoctrinated as a child to not think for myself and just follow orders.  I could do a Calculus problem and know it's right, but still not believe it, because Father or Mother wouldn't understand it and say I'm wrong.  I could be staring the answer in the face and not believe it, even though my logical brain knows it's right, because my ""is this really true?"" part of me is willing to deny logic and reason to satisfy the demands and irrationality of others."

The problem is that I want to move to Boston after graduating and whenever this comes up during the recruitment process, the firms seem reluctant to work with me on this. In the past when I select the Boston office as my first preference location on applications, they have called and told me I need to put my current city to get the interview, then during the interview, the interviewer seems totally shocked if I mention Boson. It seems like, at least at my school, they aren't interested in talking to anyone who woldn't be working at their office.

I was just wondering if anyone has any advice as to how to actually get a job in a different city than you went to school in, or if I'm better off working here for a few years and then trying to switch firms?


* Just want to add that I have actual reasons for wanting to move there (used to live there and have family there) so I'm not just telling recruiters that I think it would be a cool place to live

Thank you for any help!"

When the Chitauri invaded they told me “Go learn from Professor Pym, we’re busy!” Now with Hydra it’s like, “Kam, play some pool or play some games.” I was so excited to study here and save the world, but it’s like they don’t even want me here."
4jn0b5,1,2016-05-16,I need help,cardigan1,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4jn0b5/i_need_help/,"This is going to be pretty long, so bear with me. 

I was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder about a year ago, when I experienced the worst summer of my life. I isolated myself from everyone, lost friends, and did not really leave the house aside from exercising. After consistently meeting with a counselor, coupled with taking vitamins recommended by a different therapist, my anxiety waned. I felt (somewhat) like myself again, and slowly, but surely, was feeling well. Was I 100% anxiety free? No, but that's impossible-- I've always been incredibly anxious, yet no one would really guess because I put on a mask of being outgoing/fun/funny. Anyway, after feeling somewhat like myself again, and slowly feeling better, I thought I didn't need counseling anymore.

Now, I'm reverting back to my old-anxiety ridden self, except my anxiety has amplified. The root of my anxiety worsening was my course-load, spreading myself too thin, finding an internship (which, I failed to do), and my living situation. Slowly, but surely, I found myself feeling anxious pretty much all the time. About 3-4 weeks ago, I experienced my first, though minor, panic attack-- I broke down crying, continued to do so for an hour, felt nauseous, and was consciously controlling my breathing. I'm now home for the summer, and feel uncomfortable and nervous, as well as unmotivated and apathetic.

On top of that, I think my anxiety is playing mind tricks on me. I am straight. I have had crushes on guys when I was as young as nine, I get butterflies when someone I find attractive talks to me, and I've had deep feelings for someone recently. I vividly remember buying a 'Joe Jonas' shirt after watching Camp Rock because I was in love with him, and writing hearts around boys in my middle school yearbook. I also remember my high school crush said ""Hi"" to me, and I was completely starstruck, turning bright red. In college, I make out  with guys (when I'm drunk because I'm otherwise way too nervous sober), and feel a connection-- I get turned on (I know this because the morning after my most recent hook up, I noticed I 
""creamed my pants."" I'm not sexually experienced at all-- I'm still a virgin and haven't given head, and this is entirely due to my lack of confidence. I've only recently been more 'boy crazy,' since I graduated High School, and want experience. Anyway, you get the gist.

But recently, as my anxiety continues to spiral, I've been questioning everything -- including my sexuality. I've always admired women's assets (this has led to body image/eating disorder problem, but that's another topic for another day). When I first saw Brittany Spears' 'Toxic' music video, I thought she looked so beautiful, hot, and thin; I was a chubby kid, and longed to look like that, but never thought about her in a sexual way. When I see a beautiful woman on social media or anywhere, I analyze her appearance and feel a bit insecure, but then my mind questions: am I attracted to her?
I've never had this questioning before. I never had an 'Aha' revelation as child/adolescent about being attracted to the same sex. I've always been sure of myself, but now, I feel unsure and afraid. I'm wondering if this is my anxiety/depression playing games, for a lack of a better term, or if this has some larger meaning.

I haven't told my dad about this, but my mom has been supportive. She said she went through something similar, and understands what I'm going through. However, she is definitely worried about my mental health, and my self-isolation, as am I. Today, I actually turned down a date with an attractive guy because I feel so sick due to nerves. 

All in all, I know I need help, but don't know where to begin. Has anyone felt like this (with their sexuality) before? What does it even mean? And for my anxiety, do you have any advice/insight?

If you read through all of this, thank you so much. It really does mean a lot. :) I am really, really desperate for answers.

I've heard that is it easy for the students at the University of Waterloo to obtain a job in the Silicon Valley after graduation compared to other universities. Unfortunately, I got rejected from Waterloo for SE and CE with a 94.5% average (still salty). So, I was wondering if there is still a good chance of getting a job at Silicon Valley from a ECE degree at UofT and doing a PEY internship. Should I just try to transfer to Waterloo?"

My plan is to attend a community/junior college for the first two years and then transfer to a university. Until now I have only been interested in schools out of state. However, I started looking at FSU kind of by accident and I like it. Strategically, it seems like a good idea. Since I am a Florida resident I would save a ton of money. I am also interested in majoring in economics or English and FSU seems to be strong in those majors. I also want to be involved in politics and being in Tallahasse, it would probably be more ideal for getting an internship and making connections. 

My concerns are 


1.) Is FSU know/respected outside of Florida?


2.) FSU has a reputation for a being a ""party school"" and to me that is something that turns me off. I fear that if I do go to FSU, I would not find people with common interests or mindset. Would there be more poeple like me?

I'm currently a junior looking to go into engineering. I would appreciate ANY advice you have to offer. Thank you! :)

Demographics: Female, half white, half Asian, high income family

Intended major(s): Engineering

Academics:

ACT: 35

SAT II: Math 2: 800, Bio: 800, Chem: 760 

Class rank: Top 2-3%

UW/W GPA: 3.9/4.9 (on 4.0/5.0 scale) (personally, I've really worked hard to bring this up...because I sort of screwed around while in eighth grade taking high school classes...ah, eighth grade me...)

Coursework:

APs:

- APUSH

- Gov

- World History

- Bio

- Chem

- Physics 

- ES

- Lang

- Calc AB

- Calc BC

- Stats

Also took multivariable calculus outside of class at a local college.

Awards: lol, this is my worst section...

- NHS

- maybe National Merit?

- Honor Roll

- insignificant school awards

- Yup, pretty bad section!

Extracurriculars: Fairly strong section

- founder/pres of community service club - tons of hours from that

- local library work - 2 years of volunteering, 2 years of formal work

- Science Olympiad - multi-time state champion, lots of awards 

- research at a fairly well-known research university as an assistant/volunteer

- Engineering internship with a very well-known agency (no more info for privacy purposes)

- Engineering internship with a well-known national organization

- Orchestra: High school orchestra's librarian and treasurer, member of an out-of-school regional youth orchestra

Schools: Regarding schools, don't worry, I have plenty of safety/match schools lined up. 

- Ga Tech

- Cornell

- Carnegie Mellon

- Northwestern 

- Purdue

All of these are RD, except for Purdue, which is going to be EA. 

So I think I have pretty good academics, ECs, but I'm terrible with awards. As for essays, I'll manage to write a pretty good one. 

And for Recs:

- Counselor: She likes me. I'll give it a 8-9/10. I'm pretty sure I visited her the most in my class (or close to that, second most?) to talk to her, so she knows me well.

- Science teacher: I was in her AP Bio and ES classes, and she was a coach for Science Olympiad. Probably a 6-7/10. 

- English teacher: Really, really likes my writing. He'll review my essay for me, too. We have a good relationship, I like to share lots of ideas in that class and he always has good comments about me. Probably...7.5-8/10. 

Thank you for reading, and again, I'd appreciate any advice given to me!

However, another company (B) that is much more well known than A was holding talks at my school and I applied just for the fun of it. I really did not expect to get an offer, but that's exactly what happened. Company B is much more well known, paying more, and in my opinion has the best career building opportunities. 

The offer that I signed with company A says that I'll start in June, however, I would like to reject their offer and go with company B.

In the offer letter from company A, there's a line that states:


 ""I understand that my employment with company A is at will and may be terminated by me 
or by company A at any time for any reason."" 

Because of this, I'm fairly certain that I can legally terminate the offer, however, I would love feedback on etiquette and how to best handle this situation by leaving on a good term. Thanks!"

As a soon to be graduating Network Engineer doing my internship, I felt the need to get more hands-on experience into my field of work. Also, you know what lurking on /r/homelab does to a person ;). 

So I had a bit of savings since I've been doing studentwork in the summer for the past 6 years(since when i was allowed kinda). And so went to set myself up a bit of an overkill FreeNAS system and some components for my home network. 

FreeNAS box: 

    **Build** FreeNAS-9.10-STABLE-201605021851 (35c85f7)
    **Platform** Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1220 v3 @ 3.10GHz on AsRock e3c226d2i mini-itx
    **Memory** 16G ECC ram
    **HDD** 4x3TB WD RED
    **Boot** 16gb Toshiba USB
    **Case** Node 304
    **PSU** Corsair CX430M

Components:

    **Router** TP-Link ARCHER C7 v2
    **Switch** TP-Link TL-SG1024DE Layer2 Switch
    **UPS** APC BX700UI 390W

This stuff I bought brand new for the usual plex,couchpotato,transmission,... awesomeness that freenas provides. Sadly due to how busy I am I haven't gotten it all setup yet as I'd want it to be. The only problem next to the POST problem I had, is the fact that when I increase the fan spead on the node304, the box will sometimes drop power. Decreasing has no issues but increasing does. But there was just one more thing I had my eyes on and a few weeks ago, after eyeing an auction for 10 straight days I got my hands on my R710, clean as can be out of production. Very good shape inside &amp; out for a whopping €220 in western EU. I think I really made a steal on this one.

VM Host:

    **Dell R710**
    **2X Xeon E5520**   
    **16GB registered ECC ram**
    **2x 146GB SAS, 2x 300GB SAS**
    **2X PSU 870W**

[Pictures of build &amp; setup!](http://imgur.com/a/Gh0cg)

So yeah, now I can finally join the fun. Upgrade the ram on that R710 and maybe CPU's down the line. 

Any suggestions to what I should do with it are always appreciated. I'm in it to learn and will consider myself a complete ""novice"" at this point. I like to live my life absorbing everything that people want to share with me and being thankful for people teaching me something(while stille making up my own mind ofcourse :) ).

The list currently contains:

* Virtualisation 
* Containers
* Self-webhosting 
* Gameserver(s)
* VPN
* Mailserver
* ..

As for the FreeNAS box:

* Plex
* Transmission
* Shares for everyone!(family)
* CouchPotato
* SickRage       
* Crashplan
* ..

And also testing with Asterisk Servers as I'm doing my graduation project on VoIP solutions and developing an Asterisk product with front-end for endusers to easely manage their telephony. 

TL;DR: FreeNAS box &amp; R710. OpenWRT router &amp; L2Switch. Gotta start somewhere and i'm hyped! :) 

Price all-inclusive: €1600.

It is designed for students that have obtained technical credits in community college.  I was originally doing a 2-year IT program at a community college.  So the courses I took that transferred were what you would generally take for an Information Technology degree.  

&gt; Fundamentals of Networking Technologies, Personal Computer Hardware, Network Troubleshooting and Support, Database Programming, Linux Installation and Configuration, Implementing and Supporting Servers, Intermediate Web Programming, and Windows Server Management

So I have a bit of exposure to those things.  I mostly enjoyed the Linux coursework and the database management coursework, in which I used a Pi as a LAMP server, and used that for all of my PHP/MySQL projects.  I also worked for a company for about a year where I did testing and repairs on laptops, desktops, and tablets.

Now, the thing I'm unsure of is how to proceed... what exactly should I focus on to make me a more appealing candidate to employers?  I live in the Dallas area and am not sure if I should start looking for internships or aim for the network+, linux+, etc.  And what would kind of positions should I look for?  Everyone seems to recommend starting with Help Desk and expanding from there."

I have a really good deal on a 1 bedroom in Back Bay, but I'm not sure how bad the commute would be since I'd be relying completely on public transit (won't have a car). 

Google maps says it'd be approximately 1 hr 20 min each way, which I don't mind, but I'd be taking a bus to the Red line, and then another bus from Alewife to the office, so it seems like I could easily get screwed over by delays. 

If I didn't take the Back Bay apartment, I'd try to find a place in Cambridge near the Red line, so my commute would still be around 1 hr according to Google Maps (just without the initial bus to the Red line). I wouldn't mind a 1 hr 20 min commute if it was reasonably consistent, but I'm worried about having to rely on 2 buses every day.

Can anyone who's dealt with a similar commute, or really just anyone who know's the public transit system well, help me out with some advice?

To expand, I am curious on how you, another programmer who enjoys programming in their free time, how you go from ending a project to picking a new big project to focus the next few weeks on.

I love and thrive on problem solving once I lock my focus in somewhere. And I am not complaining there are not enough resources for ""try these 10 COOL projects"" those always seem cool, but I never know how to settle, so, its not a lack of resources but instead a lack of mentality to focus on things and figure out what I would enjoy to do next, while at school and work the assignments are handed to you.

So, in short, If you all could explain your thought process on how you go from one personal project to the next and why you chose that next project.

That would be awesome! The best way I can describe this feeling I have is like finishing a netflix show and not knowing how to invest in another one, but once you do you binge watch all of it. kinda

anyway, thank you for taking the time to read and respond! Have a great day!"

Thanks to anyone who listened. I'll just start from the beginning and lead to where I am now.

I graduated high school when I was 17, went to college to be an aircraft mechanic, got school paid for by an internship, got a degree and a license. I worked at that same repair station for a little more than 4 years. I learned a hell of a lot. Still am a great mechanic. Rented a house with a friend. Bought a brand new car and motorcycle. Life was pretty good. Work was stressful, as I was more experienced, and tasked with more important jobs and deadlines. 

I had 3 best friends and we would party a good bit on the weekends. They for the most part followed in my footsteps before branching off in different areas but still lived within 10 minutes of each other. One weekend I threw a huge crawfish boil. I bought 160 pounds of crawfish. (If you don't know, that's a metric fuckton of crawfish). Invited everyone I knew. Told them to invite everyone they knew. Family. Everyone. I would say around 50 people showed up through out the day. I cooked and slammed beers all day. Anyways. My best friends girlfriend, brought her friend, we will call her Jill. I saw Jill and I knew I was in love. Eventually we ended up dating for 2 years. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. 

We had a great relationship in the beginning. But eventually it went south, with the stress of my job, and the differences in our beliefs and with jealousy. We began to fight a hell of a lot. Just verbal arguments. A lot of the time I'd just leave. A lot of the time she'd just leave. We drank a ton. I spent all my money on going out and drinking. Which caused us to fight more. She drank a lot more than I did. And she was unemployed and wasn't in school at the time. So it wasn't the best mix for me, but I made it work. I went into work without sleeping more times than I can count. She had an ex she wanted to stay friends with, and I wasn't ok with it. And it eventually tore us apart. And we broke it off. I quit drinking. And the lease on my house was almost up for the second year. And in hopes of getting an excellent job in the near future I moved back in with my parents. 

I didn't talk to her. I was very depressed though. I just was a zombie. I just worked. And bought computer parts or car parts. I stayed to myself on the weekends and played with them and sort of annexed my friends. They aren't the type to understand what the depression was like. And I didn't want to be a loser and explain it to them just to have them not understand. Anyways. So I end up not getting the job. Sucked. But life moved on. I didn't make enough money to lease another house on my own. So I continued living with my parents. I started living there February of 15

A lot of days I'd just want to lay in bed and not go to work. And I did that often. It became kind of habitual. The more I stayed home. The harder it was to go back. I worked my ass off so that was really the only thing that kept me from getting fired. Sometimes I'd miss 3 days in a row. Just sitting in my room. Feeling bad for myself.

Well, last August some things happened and Jill ended up texting me. We made plans to hang out on my birthday at the end of August 15. Well. A month later I find out Jill is pregnant. She has always been extremely worried about not being able to have kids. And we had unprotected sex for the entire length of our relationship. So it became the norm. What are the chances of her getting pregnant in the first couple days of seeing her again for the first time. 

As soon as she took the test she started crying, talking about she can't have this baby. She's fucked up too much and she's trying to recover and she can't have this baby. (She's adopted also, this is semi important). My initial reaction was great. I thought that I could have her. And our baby. And we could be together. I just saw it all working. She did not. She wanted an abortion. We fought constantly about it. I took another job where I worked less hours for about the same pay so she could go to school at night and I could watch the baby. Our combined incomes were more than substantial. I offered to buy her a new car. I wanted a family. 

I eventually brought her to my parents and told them. They took it better than I would have ever expected. They told Jill, if she was going to have an abortion, that they will adopt it instead. She flipped out. We all started getting heated. I told her I wanted to move in together. I told her I loved her. And I told her I wanted to have this baby together. Right in front of my whole family. Her response was something I'll never forget. ""Just because I'm having this baby doesn't mean we are going to live together"".

That statement haunts me every day. My parents and her get into an argument about how it is not just her choice. Everyone cries. I take her home. I was like a stone. I had no emotions. I didn't even argue. I was destroyed and through at that moment. Maybe she was right. But that wasn't what I wanted. I didn't want to live in a broken home. I didn't want that for my baby. 

We tried working it out. She wouldn't let me go to the doctors appointments in the beginning or see the ultra sounds. She lived about an hour away so it was difficult for us to see each other. It was hard. And I felt betrayed. She worked late so the only time we could see each other was when I rented a hotel and this was getting way too expensive. Her parents didn't like me and mine didn't like her. And I started declining to see her. I wouldn't answer her phone calls a lot. I wouldn't see her on the weekends. I hated my new job. And I began getting depressed worse and worse until I finally decided I needed to see a doctor. I was missing work all the time. Pay checks sucked. I just laid around on weekends. I just quit. I felt so diminished. I stopped eating. 

I saw a therapist once a week, and there they prescribed me a lot of medications. I didn't like most of them. But they prescribed me klonopin. A small dose. .5 MG twice a day. But this made the pain stop. I could cope. I could be normal. What I thought was normal. But all it really did was make me not give a shit. I stopped giving a shit about her. About putting forth an effort for her. She wanted to do it seperately. I was going to make it seperate. 

I took a very high paying job for delta in Atlanta. Quit my job. Spent tons of money on new tools and a box that would fit into my car. Moved to atlanta on my own. And started at delta. I, along with 15 other people, got laid off the first day. They came in and asked us to leave immideiately. I was in shock. I just quietly got in my car and drove home. It wasn't until 10 minutes later that it actually hit me. 

This hurt me. I had never failed before, and even though it wasn't my fault I felt like a failure. I was failing Jill. And myself. And our child. I knew I couldn't support Jill and the baby on my wage where we lived. And I didn't want to make my parents watch the baby. So I was going to go somewhere, where I made enough money Jill didn't have to work. Sure I wouldn't see the baby as often. But I was at peace with that at the time. 

I got another high paying job soon after in Louisiana. All this time my debt slowly accumulating. Now working for a few weeks in between each job really hurt. I kept on. In Louisiana, some days they would let me work, some days they would send me home. I really didn't make anything. And I added another 800 a month payment to my debt already. I started taking more of the klonopin than I was prescribed. Then, naturally I ran out. About 2 weeks early. I didn't really think anything of it. Then I began experiencing withdrawal. This was far worse than any depression or anxiety I've ever felt. Sweating. Cramping. Constantly running to the bathroom. Randomly crying about little things. Feeling like you don't even exist. Excruciating headaches. It was terrible. I couldn't function. And I was pissed off I wasn't getting any hours there. And I quit. I stayed about another week and went home. 

I was home for about 2 weeks. I had gotten my perception refilled. I didn't see Jill one time. She asked to see me a lot. But I was cold and bitter. I didn't want to see her. Now my debt was consuming. I'm broke. Totally broke. And relying on my parents more or less now. I borrowed about 1500 from them. And took a job this time in florida. I left. I didn't tell Jill where I was going. I didn't care. 

When I got here it was ok. I was well liked. Plenty of hours. Pay wasn't as good but the hours made up for it. And I began to get depressed again. To feel like a failure again. And again I upped my dosage and ran out. Same cycle. Started missing work. Can't pay my bills. Miserable. I am literally miserable. One night I break down and ask Jill to call. She tells me that my absence shows I want no contact. And she asked me to never contact her or the child. That all I would do was show up and leave again. Originally I had started this for them. I was here for them. But I couldn't do it. I was too weak. I am too weak. This killed me. I don't know who is right or wrong. And I don't care. I'm dead inside.

I quit my job today. I'm afraid I'm going to take my own life. My parents won't understand. They will say I need to man up. But I have to get back home. I feel worthless. I feel like a dead beat father. I'm going to lose all the things I worked so hard to own. My family is going to think I'm a failure when I arrive tomorrow. And I need medication to function properly in normal society. I cannot feel any more worse about myself than I do right now. And I have no idea what to do, other than go home. 

Thanks to anyone that listened. I'm very afraid. And I needed my story to be out there. I hope it makes sense. I didn't proof read much. Thanks again.

So recently, I was offered a chance at an overseas internship and I got placed in Silicon Valley. It will be a 1 year program, where I'd work under a startup.

While I had thought that it would have been the best choice for me, I'm not too sure now - the jobs here don't interest me, mainly because they're centered around web/app dev work while my interest is in Comp.Security.

A second option has been offered to me - a 6 month stint in Israel, where I can work under a CompSec startup. I know there's a lot of prestige at stake here, and people would give up a lot to go to Silicon Valley - am I making the right choice to switch to the Israel program?

Other fandoms welcome!",bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4jorku/m4f_house_of_lies_the_office_or_buffy_fan_come_on/,"---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

I'm a new graduate (December) BSN who took a job in a telemetry unit with med/surg spill over.  While I like the job, my heart is in Mother/Baby-couplet care.  I took my current job because there were no internships open for Mother/Baby until this summer.
I'm regretting this decision...

I'm prepared to stay where I am for 6 months to a year, but I want to move to Mother/Baby asap.

I'm looking for guidance on what to do in the interim.  What can I do to make myself marketable to a Mother/Baby unit?  Should I stick it out where I am now for a year and then start looking, or should I start at 6 months in?

Just to note; I work an hour and a half from home, so I live close to work when I'm working, and go home when I'm not.  This isn't really great for family life, but thankfully I have a very supportive husband and children...but honestly, I don't think I can live this way for a year.  Not happily anyway.  I have applied for a couple of internships closer to home, but I don't think that I'll be asked to interview seeing as I've begun the internship I'm in now.  

I'm really regretting jumping the gun with this job, but I was afraid I'd end up with nothing and I have bills to pay, etc.

I guess I'm looking for advice on what to do to make myself marketable as a mother/baby nurse and on how to make the best of the position I have now.

Thanks to all in advance for your sage advice!"

Does Cerner value high GPA? What are they specifically looking for in a candidate (specifically for system engineers?) I've applied recently and have been rejected. I do have some previous experience as a tech support intern, but I'm going to assume that it isn't adequate. The job description didn't seem that demanding, and in fact demanded less than the end-user administrator position they were looking to fill. I was wondering how long should I wait to re-apply. Since I am actually going to attain my degree by the end of this May, should I try again?"

So recently, I was offered a chance at an overseas internship and I got placed in Silicon Valley. It will be a 1 year program, where I'd work under a startup.


While I had thought that it would have been the best choice for me, I'm not too sure now - the jobs here don't interest me, mainly because they're centered around web/app dev work while my interest is in Comp.Security.


A second option has been offered to me - a 6 month stint in Israel, where I can work under a CompSec startup.

 I know there's a lot of prestige at stake here, and people would give up a lot to go to Silicon Valley - am I making the right choice to switch to the Israel program?"
4jp7gi,6,2016-05-17,Fatass,33Sammi32,badroommates,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/4jp7gi/fatass/,"I already posted a few stories to /fatpeoplestories but I think it belongs here as well. It was split into a few posts but I will try to get it into one here. Beware, wall of text coming.

 I have a current roommate that I will refer to as Fatass.....because he's about 5""2' and pretty much round. 

Our story starts over 10 years ago, we were in the same college, taking same major (although he had a second major going for a double degree) same campus clubs, etc. etc. We (a group of us friends with the same majors/interests---language related) were all living in dorms, and after I spent my 3rd year abroad we decided to all rent a place off-campus and split it. It was 4 of us. Fatass, his boyfriend who he met on the internet and he flew over to live with him, me, and one more chill guy who stayed in the living room so I, the only female, could have my own room.

Fatass had never been actually independent until that point in his life. He lived in a dorm when he could get a space, otherwise he commuted from his parents' house. So when he finally moved out ""on his own"" his first move was to get a credit card and buy tons of all new furniture, cooking sets and gadgets, shelves for all his books, video games, DVDs, toys, etc. He also didn't have enough cash for the deposit and his boyfriend would pay once he was here, so me and the other guy ended up paying 2/3 of the deposit instead of half. 

Fatass and other guy got a job at massive overpriced burnt coffee chain. Fatass loved it there and started buying multiple bags of coffee and other materials so he could study to get a special black apron that came with no pay raise. The boyfriend ended up not having a job for the whole year we lived there, and I worked a few different part-time jobs. I had 3 more semesters to go doing full-time course loads until I would graduate, and Fatass had two more classes to go until he could get at least one degree out of his double degree. 

Other guy and I tried to give Fatass some very simple advice, mainly, don't run up your credit cards because you have to pay them, and focus on the two classes you need to pass to get a degree so you aren't working a minimum wage job the rest of your life. Try and be a little more thrifty, like buying only things you need, and getting them used or cheap instead of brand new from the furniture store with white glove delivery. He refused to listen, and kept spending more money than he had, and he almost never showed up to his classes, instead watching cooking shows (he also has a love of gourmet chefery and thinks he is a great cook) doing his ""coffee studies"", etc. He (well it might be the boyfriend as well) was short on the rent every month. Other guy had the exact same job and knew his schedule so knew exactly how much he made per month. He tried to tell him again several times to try and budget his own money so he could at least come up with $450 for rent per  month. In the end Other Guy just picked up the slack, I refused to put in any more money than I needed to cover for someone's lack of common sense. 

Fatass also never cleaned. He would use all of his new pots and pans in one afternoon slaving away for hours at some kind of gourmet chefery he saw on Food Network, after of course going to all the different shops in the area and buying bags of every spice/ingredient he needed to make just one meal (and then he would never touch the ingredients again, because he had to try a different recipe that uses all different ingredients) Of course he would offer some to everyone, but he usually made enough for about 10 people, and he would eat most of it in one sitting because no idea of portion control. And the dishes and pots and everything would stay dirty in the sink for days, weeks. I and Other Guy usually just subsisted on whatever leftovers from our food jobs, I would freeze the freezables, cook raw stuff, and generally stretch everything. I shared everything as well because I couldn't eat it all anyway before I got a new batch at the next closing shift. The occasions I used my one plastic bowl I got at the thrift shop, I would wash it outside in the laundry sink because the kitchen quickly became unusable. 

The living room became a mess too. Fatass also got takeout a lot, because cooking was such a hassle (well yes if you take 5 hours to make a single meal for yourself) and he ate disgustingly, chewing with his mouth open and everything, so the table, chairs, floor, etc became caked with grease and various foodstuffs like chicken bones. We quickly got roaches and mice. Of course, none of this was his fault. He would regularly whine and complain ""no one cleans around here!"" Other Guy and I kept our areas clean. However I still remember having sinus problems that were worse whenever I was in the house. 

So Fatass also failed the 2 classes he needed to graduate. And then he failed them again. At this point, I was also taking the same 2 classes, getting ready to graduate. We were actually in the same exact class one semester....he showed up maybe 2-3 times, sat there with a blank clueless look...I aced the classes. I was also doing internships, firing up my resume, doing all that college senior stuff. I went abroad over the summer and got insanely well paying summer jobs and kept up my pace of working at least 2 jobs at any given time, and was building up my savings. Again, Other Guy and I tried to pound it into Fatasses head that he needs to get his priorities in line or life is really going to suck for him. He just played victim. ""Why is everyone attacking me??"" ""Not everyone can lead the same spartan lifestyle as YOU do..."" 

Our lease was up, we scattered like the cockroaches when you turned on the kitchen light...I moved out to a month by month place just for the last semester,  Other Guy moved out, the boyfriend broke up and went back to where he came from, and from what I heard, Fatass stayed in the apartment over a week after the lease was over, was forcefully evicted, and left so much filth and dirt behind (whining ""no one helped me clean!!"") that not only did not one cent of the deposit come back, he racked up over $1,000 dollars in additional fees and damage. 

The story does not end there. So I graduated, got married, moved abroad, hubby and I worked our asses off 60+ hours/week and got a pretty good savings balance before moving back to the old stomping grounds. We bought a condo and had kids. We rented out the guest room since we were near the college. 

Fatass flunked those 2 classes a 3rd time and dropped out, also went through a few more jobs, then decided to try college again, changing majors to something food-related, then was taking a completely different language, and finally art classes, before his financial aid was completely revoked. He had gone to college for a total 10 years and had no degree to show for it. The only jobs he had were all minimum wage register monkey type jobs. He also went through several living spaces. Of course every time he had to move or his hours were cut it was never his fault, everyone was attacking him. The only time he thought of having more than one job was one situation he got himself into where he had to get rent in 5 days or he would be evicted. So he was turning in applications for a job then. 

He was in a bad spot, and my previous roommates had moved out because they were having a baby....so I extended the offer. He didn't have cash for the deposit but I told him it would be fine to do it in installments. So now Fatass has been living here for over 6 months, and is generally quiet, keeps to himself, travels 2 hours on public transportation for a low-level, low-paying retail job at a chain DIY store, he could easily get the same job 15 minutes from here instead  and get a second job, but instead he chooses to complain about how hard he works (40 hours at most per week) and how broke he is (While online shopping and doing his gourmet chefery and art stuff.) He also has several health problems due to his obesity but refuses to do anything about it because he is proud of his obesity. His previous roommates hated him because of his snoring which is probably an indicator of a serious problem but he chooses to ignore it. He also has disgusting B.O...he takes one shower in the morning IF he is going to work that day and loads up on all the Old Spice and Axe body sprays that make him smell like the men's toiletries section for a couple hours before he starts smelling like old cheese and ass. It's so bad that you can still smell it if you are outside the closed door to his bedroom. He claims to be hypoglycemic, because he gets hangry and it ""ruins his whole week"" if he doesn't eat lunch....which he didn't eat lunch because he overslept and he needs at least 2 hours to make his lunch box following his Youtube and Food Network recipes, and then Instagram and hashtag it. God forbid he go to discount big box store right next to his workplace and eat a hot dog or a slice of pizza. I and another FB friend gave him advice, such as carrying high protein, high fiber snacks, making sandwiches, making freezable meals, etc. There are lots of budget friendly ways to keep yourself healthy and nourished if you try. Nope, same thing happens over and over again.

Financially, same story. He pays rent every month, but was late because ""the payment for his freelance work didn't come"" and ""the couple hundred dollars for emergency dental work"" set him back. Why would an adult in his 30's have 0 savings that a couple hundred dollars sets him back? His job has him at work 4-5 days per week, sometimes less. He whines about how he has no money, then will spend 3 solid days shut in his room watching food videos and drawing art featuring fat people while moaning about how tired he is. Oh, and he buys his gourmet chefery tools (that he'll use once or twice to ""try something"") and art tools and keep up his  Gold Coffee Chain membership, Bulk Good store membership (he has no car and the closest store is across town) Netflix, and of course his smartphone and data plan. 

Also he has learned to wash dishes and stuff after he uses them, thankfully....however his side of the bathroom counter has not been wiped once since he moved in, there is a line between our clean side and his sticky, grimy side. He has not used any of the cleaning utensils I pointed out to him when he moved in in the 6 months he has been here. He constantly sneezes whenever he is in his room, already had a cold and infected eye, and then a sinus infection (which each time he has been taking several days off of work to ""rest"" aka drink highly caffienated coffee and complain that he can't sleep because this illness is so hard on him....just to contrast, my husband and I, the owners of the home he pays us to live in, only take off work if it's BIG...like when my husband had pneumonia....or how I'm on maternity right now. All the things that he has taken off work for, I have had an worked through)

And then the latest incident was a couple days ago, he told me he had this little plastic shelf he wanted to put out on the balcony, so he could put some plants on it. I thought why not, said OK. The next day my husband points at the balcony and goes ""What's that??"" and pointed to a little two tiered plastic shelf that was about half the length of our balcony! Big enough for at least 10 small potted plants! I told him that I thought he said a small shelf, like a 12x12 for a couple plants, but that was way too big and could he remove it when he gets a chance, and if he wants more space for plants he can use the community space in the courtyard of our condo.  So he  stays in his room all day, and waits until we are in the living room eating dinner to come out. ""huffpuff huffpuff (he can't walk two steps without getting out of breath. He literally is out of breath as soon as he opens the door) siiiiiiiiigh......siiiiigh.....Excuse me, can I get through and take the shelf out? I'm going to go and put it in the trash. ....sigh....sigh...huffpuff....huffpuff"" So we literally have to move everyone out of the way, including the table, to accomodate his girth going past, as he moves the table. 

And then today he got a huge-ass package from amazon. After he went to the movies and ate out last week too. Cue the complaining next week when he's out of money again. 

TL/DR  
fatass college roommate, didn't listen to OP+others about common sense budgeting and priorities, 10 years later is flunked out, broke, and renting a room from OP.

I'm currently finishing up my IT program, completed my A+ certificate and currently working on my Network+ and MCSA. 

I'm finishing up my internship at a large company which consists of a small IT department. Being in a tier one position I have been exposed to a lot of different networking devices, platforms, etc.

What interests me the most is the IT infrastructure, Windows Server, Active Directory, Virtualization, networking devices (Cisco Meraki) etc. Being able to maintain and configure the things I have listed is something I'm passionate about. What really stood out during my internship is how inconsistent and disorganized our AD is, I'm the type of person that if I were to configure an infrastructure, everything has to be consistent and organize (i.e. naming scheme, users in the proper distribution lists, etc.) 

My question is, what should I specialize in? I know it's very early on in my career as I am new to the IT industry with 1 year of work experience. I like to plan ahead and open up different opportunities in the future. I was thinking of being an IT consultant or an Infrastructure Manager with years of experience. Should I be working for an MSP or for companies with IT departments? 

Any advice would be great, I don't mind constructive criticism.

I was specifically looking to get a job in music supervision but even finding an internship in that specific field is extremely hard.

I don't know what to do with my life, I have a casual job at a supermarket where I've been with over 5 years (steady and not so steady) and I just don't know what to do with my career. I feel like I'll be there for the rest of my life, I don't know what to do. But I am starting an Instagram/Website with my friend about men's style and writing articles about it.

Would I be considered for any non-music industry jobs? (Entertainment, media)
Will I eventually find a job?

I also have an interest in men's style but without a degree in that field I don't know how I would go about looking for jobs. The thing is I'm open in getting a job in other field (marketing, business - these were components of my music industry course) but I don't know how to sell myself or if I even can.

I'm located in Melbourne, Australia. I know it's very isolated and not the best place to find something in music but at the moment I'm not interested in moving as I believe family comes first, not the job. 

The other thing about me is I'm quite introverted so I don't really go out much, I go to gigs every now and then but I'm not really a huge party guy like you would assume most people in music.

If anyone has advice or tips for me I would very much appreciate it.

This is on short notice too, as I start working the first week of June and finish around July 29th. Someone mentioned really cheap ""hacker hostels"" to me, but I can't find any that aren't around $2000 for 2 months.

I am completely fine living with roommates, and consider myself a pretty good roommate - generally quiet, clean, very laidback - 420/party/alcohol friendly if that is important to you, I don't mind noise or pets (although I am mildly allergic to cats), but I'm not fond of smoking inside. I sleep pretty late, but this is my first full-time job so we'll see how that changes. I have no preference for male or female roommates, although it would be nice to meet someone my age.

I play some video games sometimes, I like to hike/rock climb/camp and try to be generally active, I watch a lot of Netflix, I don't really cook that much.

So now im in a dilemma. Since most internships require that you will be returning for at least one more semester, I only have the fall semester to intern. If I am not able to land an internship for the fall, how screwed am I, and what should I do? I am taking a few courses this summer, so I cant really work on new projects.

I made a portfolio site with several projects that ive done over the years. What are the chances that recruiters will take the time to visit it (I have linked to it from my resume). I'd like to think that I have a good collection of projects, however I am worried that it is mainly C# stuff. I am going through CTCI right now solving the problems with C++ to learn the language (im loving this language so far).

4jpwe8,3,2016-05-17,So...I guess I'm failing most of my classes.,Heliziiii,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/4jpwe8/soi_guess_im_failing_most_of_my_classes/,"I slacked, because I'm transferring out, because I'm lazy, because I'm not a good student. Because I'm... Idk.

Didn't turn into any final  papers. Fiction, classics and America studies. I even asked for extensions but the truth is I procrastinated, I lay in my bed, I played games, I slept, I watched shows, I facebooked I twittered I did everything I can to avoid writing a paper till the last minute and I haven't ever started a word. 

I'm transferring out as a junior, but without counting credits this semester, I only got 44 out 60 for a junior transfer. So I guess I have to transfer as a sophomore now even if I go to summer schools. And obviously I can't think of internships next semester and next summer(bad grades, making up credits). Yes I'm even thinking of internships because I'm ambitious. 

I keep thinking of the stories we read in fiction class. So many fucked up characters we read. I pitied them yet felt it's so distant of my life. But now I'm one of them, and even without an eligible reason like mental illness nor coming-into-age transition. I procrastinate. I'm just too lazy.

I type these down at 3 o'clock in Tuesday morning after the final week, because my favorite professor this semester wrote an email saying if I can't hand the paper in on Monday and I won't get a grade for my final paper. Last weekend, yesterday, today, I set alarms every half an hour and told myself I need to get up and do my work. I fell asleep and every time the alarm rings I told myself I was just going to nap for another half an hour and start my work after. Surprisingly I on't hate myself that much because I'm going to fail the classes. I hate myself so much for letting my professor who was so kind and so patient and gave me extensions after extensions and I'm still letting him down. And I won't get enough credits to transfer as a junior. 

I am fucked up. I am. I am. Now I need to learn to hypnotize myself, learn to lie to myself and lie to my parents and all my friends, and pretend nothing happened."

4jpx6j,26,2016-05-17,Never take music for granted - a recap of my HS band experience,krasny_oktyabr,marchingband,https://www.reddit.com/r/marchingband/comments/4jpx6j/never_take_music_for_granted_a_recap_of_my_hs/,"Last night, I sat in the audience at my high school alma mater as my former director conducted his final concert after a 35+ year career at a private school. His retirement was unannounced and only filtered to alumni over the course of the past week. With short notice, close to 60 band alumni from 1980 to present came to send off their director in the best way possible. I come to find out through these alumni that my director wasn't *really* retiring, but rather the administration had chosen to not renew his contract in an effort to shore up the budget of a private school whose STEM focused curriculum has, for all intents and purposes, failed miserably. A band will continue next year, under the direction of a new combined band and choir director position, being held by a vocal music director with limited instrumental music knowledge, and who has never written or arranged a marching band show. 




My director got his first, and only high school gig back in the late 1970s at this school. The school was expanding and the band director was retiring. This fresh faced recent college graduate was given *carte blanche* to fashion a program of his liking. Using a relaxed corps style drill design, utilizing Moffit style drill and a unique medley-style music program, he achieved unusual success with his band program. Uniform styles bordered on corps style, beginning with the large collared satin windbreaker type jackets corps made famous in the 50s and 60s, then transitioning to a split jacket with ruffled bib similar to the Blue Devils of the 1970s, and finally ending on a modern short waisted coat and uniform design similar to early 2000s Bluecoats. In keeping with the ""football band"" tradition of the area, performances outside of football games were limited to parades and band festivals. A front ensemble was never added. Drill team, dance line, and majorettes were all part of the design. A student drum major position was created in the early 1990s due to overcrowding in the band. 




As with any high school, band enrollment was directly proportional to the total enrollment of the school. As the 80s went on, the school grew by leaps and bounds. By 1990, this private school had a wait list of students and a maximum enrollment of 950. There simply weren't anymore empty classrooms. The band reached about 130 musicians, plus 30+ majorettes, drill team, and flags. A student drum major was added simply because the band ran out of uniforms. The drumline made homemade uniforms out of tuxedo pants and sweatshirts. 




As the 90s went on, the school enrollment began to decline. By the mid 90s, the band had lost about 1/3 of its size, down to 80-90 piece. The principal retired and one of the teachers was promoted to the position. His focus was on STEM before that acronym meant anything. He began modifying the school schedule. Instead of 8 periods per day, the school shifted to a 4 class per day, per semester, block schedule. This immediately had a negative impact on the band as the number of blocks used by a student for band had doubled. Now students had to choose between band and other electives. The director spoke up, suggesting ways to combat the decline in band enrollment, but his ideas were dismissed. A new order had been established, and band wasn't part of it. Band scholarships were cut, the budget was slashed, and travel to non athletic events was discouraged. 




I started at this school in the early 2000s and had no knowledge or interest in band. I would carpool home with a friend who played in band and he would get his instrument every day after school so i just followed him. The director and I eventually started talking and he talked me into trying an instrument. I was immediately hooked. I took a horn home after my first after school lesson. By the end of my freshman year he had invited me to play with the beginning band students who had been playing all school year. My sophomore, junior, and senior years saw me rise to a section leader in our top band. It doesn't mean a whole lot though, when in those three years the marching band fell from 55 to 35 people. There were rumors each year that our program would be cut. But the band played on.




After I graduated in the mid 00s, the STEM focused principal had a new trick up his sleeve to combat dwindling enrollment (the 950 figure from 1990 was down to 450 by 2005). The administration implemented a new internship model for the high school, where students would ""declare a major, ""and take elective courses in that ""major,"" while also working an unpaid internship their last 2 years to offset tuition costs. This model has been tried at magnet schools, charter schools, and vocational schools with varying degrees of success. The problem with my alma mater is that neighborhood kids just want a regular high school that is an alternative to the public schools in academic emergency. They don't want all the extra fluff. 





This new layer of fluff on top of the block schedule system hurt the band even more. The band students began a petition because they were told that maintaining a band with their new STEM focused model would be impossible. The director worked with students and the few administrators willing to listen and created an alternative: the marching band would meet before and after school exclusively, the beginning band would meet one period, and the concert band would meet another period. Under this compromise, the director was forced to go part time, but he was able to continue teaching music. 




As time went on and enrollment dropped further, the beginning band was moved to a before and after school activity, while the concert band stayed as a class. With fewer students learning instruments at the high school level, enrollment dropped further. My high school used to receive about 50-60% of its marching band rookies as sophomores who completed the beginning band program, and the other 40-50% were incoming freshmen who signed up for band. The last time I saw the marching band about two years ago, they had 18 musicians, 10 drill team members, and required the football cheerleaders to perform part of the halftime show. 




Last night's concert featured 30 band members in one combined band of all talent levels, with help from several alumni and friends of the director covering parts. The students were visibly saddened and nervous for what next year brings. Their new director is someone who simply asked to take the position, along with choir, in order to boost their employment to a full time status. My director is being forced to retire early and won't even get his full pension after nearly four decades of service to the school. There has been no word yet on if the new director will even run a beginning band, or if the concert band plus marching band is the only requirement. With no beginning band, and a steadily declining enrollment, the band will eventually fade into history. The school right now has a total enrollment of somewhere around 250-300. Because of this, tuition is over $10,000 a year (for high school). The school itself will shut down soon enough.




In some of his remarks to the band students, the director reminded them - and us - that music isn't a hobby or a job, it's a gift that no one can take away, no matter how hard they try (issuing a stern warning to the administration that he does not want the band to die off as quickly as they'd like). The reaction from the crowd of parents and alumni was overwhelming.





If you've ever seen Mr. Holland's Opus, you might see this story as borrowing from it. I assure you, this is real life. Someone mentioned to the director before the concert that his career at this school has been like the movie. He remarked to all of us on stage that he simply hated the movie, as they could have used his life and this band as a better subject line! 




If this band director wouldn't have taken a chance on me, and just let me ride home with my friend unnoticed, my life would have ended up very different. Hell, my life may have ended already *period.* I had terrible depression in high school because of constant bullying, but band was some place I could play my horn and feel safe. And my director was always willing to listen and help. I wound up going to my top college choice, participated in my dream marching band, and even majored in music. But, like the movie, nothing was fairy tale. I wound up failing out of music school, I never accomplished my goals in college band, but eventually found an outlet in drum corps, which has also been anything but a fairy tale. 




But through it all, I've kept playing. I've been playing my horn now for nearly 15 years. I have never kept up on a hobby or pastime for that long, ever. When I hear people say they don't play anymore and that they sold their horn after high school or college, it hurts me deep down. They are missing such an integral part of their life.




I wanted to share this in a sub that was band related and visited by mostly band members. It hurts me greatly to see a program suffer like my band has for years, and I hope on one hand some of this hits home with those of you in similarly fading or failing programs (through no fault of the director) and I hope this also hits home with those of you from hugely successful programs - be thankful for what you have because there are dozens of programs like mine that have nothing left. Thanks everyone."

I'm a relatively new grad with some strong intern experience, but looking to get my feet wet obviously.  Would this be a good role to take?   Also, from what I gathered in interviews, this particular site was just recently acquired by Cerner, should I be concerned by that?

Due to my recent graduation, it looks as I'll be moving back home because they can't hire me full-time (at the moment).

Although the full-time desktop gig isn't available, my boss offered me a full-time job as a POS Support technician, which works on the store POS systems.  I'm considering it because in about half a years time, it is likely that there will be a full-time spot open on the Desktop Support team.  This is what my boss told me, as he is trying to keep me on.

Only thing is...  I feel that I would be selling myself short if I took this POS job.  Studying Computer Science for the past 4 years and really not apply it post-grad is not ideal for me.  But I could be wrong.  What would you recommend?

Currently a CS student, but I'm looking at taking a PhD after I graduate in synthetic/systems/computational/etc biology, which is something I'd love to do. There's a couple of places I have my eye on (and they have an extra intensive year to get you up to scratch on the biology side if you're an engineer/physicist/maths). I've taken a comp. bio module and I had applied to do some comp bio research stuff via an internship program at the uni, but unfortunately I didn't get a place.

So with a free summer ahead of me, is there anything I can do that really stands out except spending time self-studying? I've got good grades (almost certainly a 1st, which I think is the equivalent of a near-top GPA, dunno) but I was hoping on the internship to have something looking biology-focused on my CV. I don't think 'spent the summer reading a boatload of papers' really works, and I'm not exactly going to be able to do research.

About three years ago, I lived in a different city. I met a girl through a social event. At the time I was going through a rough break-up, but we started casually going out for dinners and such. Nothing ever really came from it, because my situation was too weird and she ended up moving back to her home country. (She was an exchange student.) It was very obvious that we had feelings for each other, but the timing was just wrong.

After she moved back home, we stayed pretty decent friends. I had been hoping that maybe something long-distance would start up, but a few months after she left one of her fellow students asked her out and she accepted. We continued to be good friends, although she knew that I really liked her, and our relationship was a little more close than I was used to with ""just friends."" I even flew down to visit her a few times, which led to her boyfriend disliking me because he felt that she reciprocated my feelings. Probably inappropriate, I know, but it's in the past.

Since then, we've seen each other many times and every single time we were a little more close to each other. I ended up moving to a new city, and she ended up getting an internship in the same city. Since January, we had been getting VERY close. She and her boyfriend were having issues I knew, but they were still together.

And then one night we went to a jazz club together, and that night things seriously escalated. We ended up making out on her couch, which progressed to sex, and then me staying the entire weekend. We continued seeing each other for another two weeks, and then, one day while I was over with her, she whispered, ""Is it okay for me to tell you that I love you?"" I was elated, since I'd obviously been a little in love with her for a while, but at the same time worried about the inappropriateness of the situation. She did end up breaking up with her boyfriend officially the next day. It was amicable, she said, and that they both knew it was coming.

The problem is that I don't know where I stand or how I feel about all of this. It's been a month since this happened, and she tells me often that she loves me, that she sees a future with me, and that she has never been happier. At the same time, she doesn't want to tell ANYONE that we're together. She told her coworkers and mother that ""something happened with [me],"" and that's it. We have a trip planned to go to her hometown, where she says we will have to be ""just friends."" She wants to visit MY hometown, but again as just friends. She says it is because she is worried about what people will think of her, jumping to a new boyfriend, but it's really starting to wear on me.

I also have the usual concerns that would be expected in this situation. Yes, I know that there is a serious risk of being cheated on when your relationship technically starts with cheating. I am actually pretty concerned about that, because with one exception, most of the people I have dated ended up cheating on me. I'm also concerned by the fact that communication is GREAT when we are together, but almost non-existent when we are not. I usually need to initiate any texts or calls, and a lot of time it will take her hours to read or answer them, even though she's obviously on Facebook or WhatsApp chatting.

And then lastly, she says that she ""sees this relationship going somewhere, and she doesn't want to ruin it."" So she sets limits on how often we can see each other or do things together. I'm not used to this at all, and prefer to just plan to see each other when we both want to and both have time. Being told that neither of us are doing anything today, but it's too soon to see each other, is not fun.

So, I guess my multiple questions are this:

- Should I be worried about the fact that she still doesn't want anyone to know we are together?

- Should her rules about how often we see each other bother me?

- Can anyone offer me a reason why someone would be ""in love,"" exclusive, and happy to be with someone, but not want anyone else to know?

It has been three years since I have dated someone, so I'm not sure if this is just normal and I'm the one trying to move to fast, or if I should legitimately have concerns. And like I said, most of my other relationships ended with me being cheated on, so part of me is saying that it's GOOD that this one isn't progressing how I expected.

Or maybe I'm just trying to justify staying with the girl I've been in love with for years.

I would like to mention that when I'm WITH her, everything is perfect. We're happy, she obviously loves me, and life is great. These doubts mostly pop up when we're not together and I start thinking about it.
   
**tl;dr**: The girl I have been in love with for three years ended up leaving her boyfriend for me, but now I am not sure that the relationship is a good one."
4jrdbp,1,2016-05-17,Stageweek 11,pegasus_527,RaaB,https://www.reddit.com/r/RaaB/comments/4jrdbp/stageweek_11/,"# Milestone 2 Evaluation

The intention of this milestone was to create a fully functional, production-ready version of the ""Liveview"" with which I started my internship. According to the goals that were established, this has been fully accomplished. Not only has the Liveview seen a big increase in performance (depending on the specifics, sometimes up to 50%) but it's user interface and usefulness is also quite acceptable.

The biggest improvements are:

* A detailed ""device info"" panel, which shows data such as the device throughput and connectivity in an easy-to-view graph. 
* Nicely integrated sharing functionality
* Performance
* Display on mobile devices

Some of these improvements required a big rewrite (such as the CSS for responsiveness) whereas others were completely new and quite extensive (such as the device info view).

## Not Implemented

Translation of the app was not implemented. Instead we made a choice to use as few words as possible (which forced me to consider the UI very well)

## Points of improvement

Currently, the process of pushing a build to production is more or less manual:

* Tag a commit with Git with a version number (liveview/v*major*.*minor*.*patch*)
* Set the build environment
* Uploading using FTP

Preferably this should happen through an automated build script in order to minimize human error."

Well, she got frustrated and allowed a middle aged woman to take the room, and we had a positive outlook at first, thinking she would maybe be like a house mom. She sold herself as a dependable and private person working and going to school full-time. 


Turns out this woman, S, is a legitimate hoarder. Her stuff has taken over her own room, boxes and garbage bags piled to the ceiling while she sleeps in the middle of it on the floor, spilling out into our living room consuming half our shared space and all of our storage space in shelving and closets. She is dirty, and leaves the sink filled with dirty dishes to the point it is impossible to use the sink at all. She once left a big pot filled with mashed potatoes and dirty water in the sink for a full month. 


She loves to complain and literally sigh about her job and life, and the negativity is pretty exhausting to constantly hear about because she never shuts up. I can't leave my room to get a glass of water without her coming out of her room to talk to me. She also will see you busy watching tv or reading a book or on the phone and will talk to you the whole time. Now when she comes home we scatter to our rooms. She is also jealous of our roommate, D, who has a well-paying engineering internship. She told him she hopes his balls fall off because she is jealous he makes more money than her. She also told me I was a prostitute because my boyfriend pays my rent, and called me a stripper behind my back because I pole dance for exercise.


We fear she has mental issues because once she told me my cat had worms (I took him to the vet and he did not). She said she felt these worms crawling on her arms and in her hair. She also does this zombie thing where she stands with her head tilted, completely zoned out. Once I woke up at 3am and opened my bedroom door and she was standing on the other side of it doing the zombie thing.


Then we found out she used to be homeless and has lived in her car in the past. She once expressed surprise that we didn't have fleas. Because of this and some of the comments she has made, we knew she had no intentions of leaving this place. She was supposed to graduate this spring so we thought she would move out and on with her life after that, but then she failed and has to retake her senior year. We knew she had to go, so we told her yesterday we did not want to renew the lease with her on it. 


Now she is insisting she has 90 days before she needs to leave, but we believe she only has 30 days because her lease is invalid (was never signed by our landlord and has no dates on it, plus we all just signed new leases today). We know she is going to hang on as long as she can. She also keeps asking to take my cats with her when she goes. My question is, how do the three of us get through the next possibly 90 days with this woman? 
   

**tl;dr**: Made a mistake letting an inconsiderate hoarder over twice our age move in with us. How do we deal with this?"

We told her about the Rumples issues over some drinks, and my mom suggested we talk to her about making partial payments of what we could afford. My mom is a queen budgeter and said based on our income and current expenses, we could afford to pay $250-$300 per month towards the car. I felt so much better after talking to her that I thought we could really make it work with Rumples. 

I was wrong as fuck. We had a the shittiest phone call with Rumples the other night. It makes my head hurt just thinking about it, so here's the highlights:

* She started off immediately berating us for not calling her sooner. FH try to explain we've been WORKING. ""That's not an excuse, we're all busy, I'm working too!"" Yes, but you also refused to have this conversation after 8pm, *which is when FH gets off work*.

* Next, says we *have* to take the car payments/insurance starting right now. It's over $600. We try to say we can't afford that right now, hopefully after FH gets hired on as salary. NO. RIGHT NOW.

* Her spaz brain suddenly switches subjects and she wants to know why FH didn't ask his FFIL to keep his phone on. My blood pressure is sky high at this point and I calmly say we didn't want to burden them, if they couldn't afford it, that was fine. ""Well, we *could* have if you needed it!"" WELL, WE DON'T BITCH.

* She then switches subjects back to the car again. Starts whining about how her job is so stressful and hard on her physically and ""all the money is going toward *your* car, we can't save anything"". FH is becoming visibly frustrated and again says that we can help by paying *part* of the insurance/payments since the car has become a financial strain and they can't afford it.

* That's when Rumples spits out this gem: **""We can afford it!!! We have no issues affording it, there's just other things we'd rather spend our money on, you know?""** Apparently, an upper-middle class white woman's weak spot is assuming she doesn't have enough money for something.

* After a couple more minutes of this back and forth and FH looking closer and closer to tears (he NEVER cries), I snapped. ""What do you want from us?! We've told you we can't afford the whole payment, we've offered to pay what we can and you won't have that, so **what do you want**?""

* Rumples immediately snaps that she ""doesn't appreciate my tone"" and I snap back ""Well we've tried talking to you and that's not working."" 

* She switches the subject *again* and hysterically demands to know why I've been mad at her. Apparently the last time FH saw her in person, she had a meltdown IN PUBLIC about why I was avoiding her and the idiot responded ""Idk she's mad at you, I have to go, bye."" I give FH the ""your asshole is next"" look and he attempts to sink into the couch between the cushions.

* So I told her that I was upset with the way she had completely brushed off FH's achievements. She shat on his internship and new job and hadn't expressed any sort of excitement or support whatsoever. She starts crying and does a complete 180, saying *of course* she's so proud, *hooowwww* could he think she wasn't. 

* She insisted he tell her about his internship *RIGHT THEN*. So FH awkwardly tells her about the things he's been doing, how it will look great on a resume, etc. "" Oh, okay... Uh huh.... Yeah.... Well, I don't speak computer but that just sounds *great*, teehee!""

* Then she starts talking about her birthday, which is coming up soon, and how she wants to go out to -*super expensive restaurant*-. ""Oh! Glitterbug! I bought this -*super useless little girl thing*- when I was shopping the other day for your sister! Teehee!"" 

* She babbled on about stupid shit until I told her my phone was on 5%, then happily said she'd talk to us later. After we hung up, FH and I were emotionally drained. We didn't resolve anything.

The day after this convo, she texted me the amount of the insurance+payments again, saying it was ""only $75 per person per week!"" Nothing we said got through to her, she is still insisting we pay the whole thing.

If you want to make an impact on our environment, our democracy and our future, apply to be an Impact intern today: weareimpact.org/internship-apply.html
What do interns with Impact do?  You’ll help us educate and engage more students and citizens on the most critical issues of our time. You’ll help us get our issues into the media, build coalitions, organize events and lobby decision-makers. Ultimately, you’ll help us build the kind of public support it takes to win.
Campaigns
•	We’re working to stop global warming: We took a big step forward last summer when President Obama directed his Environmental Protection Agency to develop standards that would cut carbon pollution from power plants, the nation’s largest contributors to global warming pollution. This historic step won’t be enough to fully solve the problem, but it’ll be an important start. But standing in the way, at every step, is one of the most powerful special interests in the world: the fossil fuel industry. That’s where we come in. We’re working to rally millions of American citizens, along with local elected officials and other powerful voices to back the President’s plan.

•	We’re working to reclaim our democracy: The Citizens United decision changed the landscape of our elections, and in 2012, just 32 mega-donors matched the contributions of 3.7 million small donors to President Obama and Mitt Romney. Our organizers helped put 16 states and more than 550 cities on record in favor of a constitutional amendment to overturn this wrong-headed ruling, and we’ve taken our fight all the way to the U.S. Senate.

•	We’re working to protect our rivers, lakes and streams:  To protect our waterways from pollution and destruction we need to crack down on factory farm pollution, sewage and other threats. And we know it won’t be easy because of big opposition from the Farm Bureau, giant agribusiness and others. Now, we’re working to harness grassroots support for clean water and turn it into the political power we need to have a lasting direct impact on our waterways.
Becoming an Impact intern
If you agree that it’s time to solve these big problems, the best thing you can do to get involved is to apply to intern with Impact today: weareimpact.org/internship-apply.html
We’re looking for students who care deeply about the environment and our democracy, and are ready to make a difference now.
As an intern:
-	You’ll learn how to analyze problems, push for smart solutions, and build the public support it takes to win
-	You’ll work side-by-side with one of our organizers, learning the ropes.
-	And you'll attend briefings and trainings to learn even more about the issues and gain organizing skills

4jsszq,1,2016-05-17,[RANT] GPA Cutoffs,NotSoSiniSter,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4jsszq/rant_gpa_cutoffs/,"I'm approaching my super senior year of Mechanical Engineering, and I'm currently sitting at a 2.7 GPA. Sophomore year fucked me. 

My first semester of my Sophomore year, I scored a 1.7 GPA. *Wonderful*. The whole semester was a shit show. I wasn't sleeping, I was incredibly stressed, and I was drinking over four mugs of coffee a day, and procrastinating on everything. Halfway through the following semester, when my grades were looking as shitty as the previous one, I finally decided to go to student health. Through the multiple sessions I had with a counselor, it finally became clear that my procrastination was being enhanced by my anxiety, and this was creating a vicious feedback cycle. One of the things that helped me was creating to do lists. But since it was so late into the semester, they couldn't do much. After pulling a couple miracles, like walking into my Differential Equations final with an F, and walking out with a C (no curve, mind you), I finished off my semester with a measly 2.3. 

After escaping the most stressful year of my life, I started up my co-op in the fall. Thankfully, my Freshman year GPA was a 2.9, and I got an offer before my grades tanked. The first semester of my co-op was defined by a huge project that was dumped on my desk. It was an incredibly stressful project, having to do with a mechanical failure that caused hundred of products to be returned. No engineer had time to look at it, so my boss gave it to me. I had managers asking me for updates constantly, and I hit several roadblocks along the way. But it was through this project that I learned how to channel that anxiety of not knowing what I didn't know, back into the motivation of solving a problem. After about a month and a half of refusing to fail on this project, I fixed it. The customers got new products, and the change was implemented across the board for the product line. At the end of this semester, my boss took me out to a fancy restaurant, gave me a raise, and offered me a job post-grad.

When I came back for my Junior level classes, I tackled my first semester with ease. I'm damn near proud of the B I earned in Fluid Dynamics after seeing half the class drop out, and most of my friends scraping for a D. I slept well, and I remember being stressed about school exactly twice the whole semester. First time was when I got a C on a Philosophy test, and right before finals. Fast forward through two more co-op terms, and another semester, I had a 3.0 average for my Junior year.

My final co-op term was this Spring, which left my summer free to possibly do something else. But since I had picked up so many responsibilities and projects here, I didn't see any reason to jump over to another local company to do boring intern work, so I was really only considering internships that would really stand out on my resume. I had an internal reference at a...lets say a very big company in California, and was emailing one of my reference's contacts. I had already applied on their website for their summer internship program, and this contact said he would help me out with securing an internship, then he noticed the GPA I had listed...

*""...I encourage you to reapply when you meet the minimum requirements.""*

Unfortunately, I wouldn't be applying for an internship again once I had my degree...I responded explaining the story behind my GPA as I did above, and how it just doesn't reflect my academic abilities. He pointed me to the office that handled intern applicants, which might as well should of been a black hole, since all my emails and phone calls went unanswered. So after giving them more than enough time to respond, I took my bosses offer to extend my final co-op semester through the summer. 

I get it. Employers like to correlate GPA with your aptitude for work for a variety of reasons, and anyone over a 3.0 is going to nod their head in agreement. But does every company have to be so fucking dense? How the fuck does a GPA outweigh multiple points of job experience, a glowing recommendation *from the boss that oversaw my work as a mechanical engineer over three co-op semesters*, and a growing list of projects that I've lead and completed? I've worked with two other co-ops at my company that were both clinging to 3.0s. One was a borderline alcoholic, and the other was literally the worst human being that I ever had to work with - quite possibly worth another rant post. If I had submitted either of their transcripts and GPAs, I know they'd of quite possibly been offered the internship that I wanted so badly, and would have been nowhere near as successful as I would of been.

I'm thankful for the events that prevented me from falling onto academic probation or worse. But it's a shame that my shitty performance in academics almost three years ago prevented me from being offered a game changing opportunity this summer. *sigh*

I'm currently a rising senior in a US university and am myself a US citizen (born here). When I graduate I will have a B.S. in Physics and a B.A. in German. So, native English speaker and fairly fluent in German (around C1/C2).

Job-wise I unfortunately don't have much, since it's been hard to be employed during the school year and due to my housing situation it's been difficult to find jobs over the summer. In high school I worked for the student IT department for a year, so I have miscellaneous computer skills (also from my studies). I can go into more detail if need be. A big minus is that I can't drive, but I definitely should learn anyway, so if it's imperative it's something I'm more than willing to work on. But even if I could drive, I'm not sure I would have the money for a car or license here.

Funnily enough, I have actually been in Germany for a year abroad already, and am in fact still here :) I return to the US in August but while here I've studied at a German university and had an internship at a well-known academic commission. So, thankfully, I do have some references/contacts/roots here already. I'm not sure how much that will help in the long run.

My goal IS Germany, so other countries wouldn't really make sense for my situation. A big piece of this is that my boyfriend is a native German, and we are looking to close the gap in the coming years, if possible. (The relationship is not the only reason I want to move here, but it is of course an influence nonetheless.) I'm not sure if that's a huge help, but I figure it's worth mentioning.

Finally, since my degree is in physics I'd want to try and keep my career in that field, if possible. Maybe that would mean a masters or working as a student researcher. I'm not sure how accessible these things are to an international student; I'd rather delay working on a masters and instead get job experience, but I have no concept of how ""open"" academia/research here is, whether at universities or elsewhere. Honestly though I'm open to anything to just get me on my feet.

I'd appreciate any guidance at all! And sorry for the wall of text."

After high school with my bad grades and just not really knowing what the frickball I was or what I wanted to do I took a year and a half off, worked and then after some shat was sorted went to community college. 

Since I went to community college with plans to transfer and I felt ready to pursue my realized dream of business/marketing/sales I truly flourished I have a 3.5 gpa, 2 years of gen eds paid for and done and now, it's time to decide where to go to school...

I am 22 and have never lived on my own, I always have lived with my family. My dream was to go to school In Chicago (I live in the suburbs of Chicago) but as things became more dangerous I applied to a near home school that was smaller, gave me a large scholarship and I would be able to live at home and save money while completing my last 2 years. 

HOWEVER! 

After looking more into my dream schools in the city it seems as though they have better internships, a larger student body, and stronger alumni connections than the school close to home. Plus I feel as if I would like to move out and finally feel a sense of independence and responsibility for my own future and dreams... 

BASICALLY, is it worth going to the school in the city vs the school nearby even if the city school is more expensive? 

Smaller school close by: graduate with 30,000 debt 
City school: graduate with 50,000 debt

Thanks Reddit I am the first in my family to go to college so, any advice from those who have been through it is helpful. "

I'm still not sure exactly what to begin with, but here goes.

I was never really an outgoing person, never had many friends. A few close ones, throughout my childhood, but they were the type of people that other people flocked to, the exact opposite of me.

I had a few relationships throughout high school, most of which felt extremely codependent, using each other to fill a hole in each other that we both thought needed to be filled. The last of which lasted from my junior year of high school until my junior year of college.

That last relationship was one that I thought would last forever, was the one I thought I was meant to be with for the rest of my life, a perfect fit. It turned out to be too good to be true. This relationship ended as my Junior year ended in college. She cheated on me.

My self esteem and self confidence had never been very high. I had always been described as a decent-looking guy (in my eyes I was below average, even then), but after the relationship my self-esteem and self confidence were at a new found low.

I'm one year out of college now, almost to the day. I haven't been able to establish another relationship since then. I've put on weight, and like I said have never been the handsomest guy, who would want to be in a relationship with me?

I've moved back home with my parents since I got out of college. The few high school friends that I had around here moved on by now, and my best friend lives in an entirely different state and barely ever has time to talk. I feel alone.

I got a job off an internship near my house, it pays way less then my degree would be able to get me and is very unfulfilling. But it gives me money without having to go through the intimidating stress inducing process that is interviewing. Why would anyone want to hire me to do a worthwhile job? My skills and resume are unimpressive, lackluster, to say the least.

And she's having a baby with the guy she cheated on me with...I forgot to mention.

I just feel like I have nothing going for me, I am unimpressive, unlikable, ugly. Everyone is moving forward with theirs lives, and I'm just standing still, getting sucked down into quicksand.

I went to a doctor and she put me on Welbutrin. I felt like it was working for a while, but these last few days, anytime I think I want to cry. I try to distract myself, ignore my pain, my loneliness, with whatever I can. But I don't know how much longer I can do it."
4jt5qf,7,2016-05-17,French Kickstarter game Lynn and the Spirits of Inao accused of having been developed illegally by unpaid interns (x-post from /r/games),ClaudeDante,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/4jt5qf/french_kickstarter_game_lynn_and_the_spirits_of/,"As someone working in the French video game industry, I stumbled upon quite a lot of controvery surrounding a French game currently on Kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bloomylight-studio/lynn-and-the-spirits-of-inao/description

This project, for which I almost worked on during last summer (I ultimately declined because it was an unpaid intern position), is being accused by former interns of not paying their interns at all. Here in France, it is illegal to have unpaid internships when the internship lasts for more than two months. Not only that, but the CEO of the studio behind this project, Bloomylight Studio, also made some interns sign a legal document stating that they had been paid when this was not the case.

This controversy has been blowing up today in France, with many French websites reporting on it. You can find some English translations of some of the posts made by the interns on this article: http://www.journaldugamer.com/2016/05/17/lynn-and-the-spirits-of-inao-stagiaires/

Lately I have seen a lot of controversy surrounding working conditions in the Game's Industry. This is a great thing because it highlights some of the issues our medium is facing. However, I also believe something like this should be exposed since it is completely illegal. I ask of you, do NOT support this game until an official statement has been made. As gamers we should NOT condone the exploitation of students.

Keep in mind my intention is not to smear the game (far from it), but to hold the people accountable for their actions and shed light upon the huge problem this kind of practice is for the Game Industry as a whole.

Please feel free to comment below about your stance on these kind of things and spread the word. Thank you for reading!

I'm on the fence between networking and servers. I've done a little bit of dabbling in both, but I'm not sure what to expect as far as a work environment. With servers I anticipate long hours and more emergency calls, but also more experience and an interesting challenge. I love networking technology and subnetting, and am considering getting my CCENT/CCNA.

I've been turned off to the idea of IT consultation or contract-based work. In my career, I would prefer to be on payroll with mostly consistent hours, pay, and benefits. I'm guessing that environment is going to change the nature of my training needs and expectations.  I've checked out the OOH on a ton of job titles, but there are so many titles that cover similar responsibilities with huge differences in pay and stress levels.

So my question is, what is the environment like generally for these different careers in IT, and what can I reasonably expect? Any recommendations on what I should pursue in my internship?"

4jtbff,33,2016-05-17,How do I (F23) become less of a target for criticism and handle unsolicited advice?,Throwaway7957353,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4jtbff/how_do_i_f23_become_less_of_a_target_for/,"I used to be extremely insecure and blindly believed what other people said about me. Through therapy and a lot of hard work, I’ve learned how to cultivate self-confidence and self-respect. I’m becoming increasingly aware that I’m surrounded by people who dole out unsolicited advice and criticism on a regular basis.  Most of them are adults, many of whom I don’t see on a regular basis, but their comments are still irritating and unhelpful. Nobody is perfect and I’m aware of my weaknesses, but I truly don’t believe I’m any worse than the average person. I have a great job where I’m about to get promoted, live in a nice apartment with my boyfriend of three years, possess a degree from a top university, pursue a wide range of interesting hobbies, and enjoy a loyal circle of friends. That said, I feel like I’m on the receiving end of harsh criticism more than the average person.

I honestly don’t know how to deal with criticism when it comes up in social situations. I find myself wanting to quickly change the subject so it’s not awkward for anyone involved, but sometimes the person continues to be rude after I gently sidestep their comments.

Here are some of MANY examples: 

-After graduating from university, I turned down a job offer from a company because, frankly, it wasn’t the right opportunity for me. (I know I made the right decision because I was subsequently hired at the company where I work today.) At a family party, one of my mom’s friends randomly stormed up to me said, “When I heard that you turned down the offer from {company}, I wanted to strangle you!” I gently explained the reasons why I didn’t accept the offer, and she continued to criticize me. “There’s no reason not to accept that offer! It’s such a great company! I seriously wanted to strangle you, why would anybody turn down that offer?!” I ended up leaving the conversation, but she continued to give me (unsolicited) career advice when she rejoined me later in the afternoon.

-I was visiting a cousin that I don’t see very often. She mentioned, “You’ve never had a job before, have you?” I was extremely offended because, before graduating from school, I had five rigorous internships, in addition to several jobs ranging from retail, nannying, and office work. She also talked about how Aspergers runs in my family and to see if I can’t “get myself checked out.” There’s absolutely wrong with being on the spectrum, but I have zero qualities of the disorder and, even if I did, that’s an extremely presumptuous thing to say to someone.

-My mom and I were on a weeklong trip in a different time zone. On the last day of the trip, I was kinda tired and quiet for about an hour or so. My mom panicked and said, “I feel extremely detached from you right now. Are you angry at me?” She then berated me, saying, “I did nothing wrong, there’s no reason why you should be angry at me.” I told her that I was not angry at her and that I was just feeling quiet, and double checked that I wasn’t quiet or rude throughout the rest of the trip. She that no, that I was bubbly and animated throughout most of the trip, but it was very jarring to have me fall quiet. She then gave me a long lecture about how it’s disrespectful to the people around you to not be actively engaged in conversation, and that she can see why my boyfriend feels neglected by me, (which he doesn’t), because I’m detached and aloof. She also, sarcastically, said, “My, you’re just an independent young lady, aren’t you?”

-A family friend just sent me several articles about “How not to waste your early twenties.” As someone who is working full time, starting her own business in her spare time, traveling regularly with friends, planning on moving to a new city, and so forth, I hardly think that I’m “wasting” my early twenties.

-We were visiting another family friend and she was asking what my future plans were. I told her that I’m planning on moving abroad in the next six months to teach underprivileged children. She asked me how my boyfriend feels about that, and I said, “He’s being super supportive and is allowing me to go.” She immediately got angry and lectured me about, “ALLOWING you to go? You should never allow a man to tell you to do anything! Don’t let him push you around,” and so forth. I most definitely wear the pants in our relationship and so it was extremely weird, and uncalled for, to hear these comments.

Okay, you get the point. I just feel henpecked by all of the adults in my life. I’m more successful and well-adjusted than a lot of young people that I know, and I really don’t think that I deserve these constant interventions. Again, I’m not perfect, and I’m not above reproach, but it really appears that I receive more criticism than the average person, and I'm starting to get sick of it.

TL;DR: I’m criticized constantly by the adults in my life. How can I become less of a target and graciously handle criticism when it (inevitably) arises?

---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

-twerked for a few moments

-graduated onto one crutch only

-100 degree flexion


I guess my main goal at the moment is to be able to walk with just a brace, as I'd like to be off crutches by my internship in June.  Overall, I think I've been taking this injury pretty well, and I just can't wait to start playing and being active again. 

Question: When did everyone get back into playing sports? I don't think I'll get to play much in the fall season, but I'm hoping to play in the Spring. I know my parents don't want me playing at all after this...
Also, do you guys any support when playing? Like a sleeve or smaller brace or something? "

So this takes place late-2000s, I'd just finished college in a medium-sized US city and offered a job from my internship company ""Orangered"" (a small IT contract company of ~30 people). This was my first break from retail and in IT. 

Details have been altered for readability, names have been changed to protect the innocent and the guilty, and any similarities found to real events are *completely* unintentional. 

Our cast of characters:

* Myself: fresh college grad and PFY

* Susan: HR and classmate from college

* Dave: Owner of Orangered IT

* Jack: Senior support tech

* Arnold: Support tech manager, ex-Army Drill Sergeant (unconfirmed)

* Randy: Developer

* Jim: Security specialist

&gt; * Internal monologue. We occasionally see eye-to-eye

**Part VII**

I've been able to schedule my Networking exam while still waiting for the Security exam reimbursement. At this point, I'm expecting to never be reimbursed, but at least I will have something extra to throw on my resume after all is said and done. 

I've also met some other team members like Randy, our developer. He single-handedly designed a tool our security team uses (proprietary for the company) and is our support for the tool. He seems like he's far more talented for this position, but he's close friends with guys on the security team, including Jim. We both had a lot of overlap in gaming, and often would chat at lunch.

He mentioned that the security team may be taking another contract and would need staffing for it. The security team had a more staunch leader that filtered most of Dave's intervention, and I was eager to have my credentials to par for a lateral move at this point. 

Speaking of Dave, this fine late summer day starts with an all-hands on deck meeting: one of my clients, SalesClient, had shown interest in purchasing a Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS), but the available systems we offered were way out of their price range. Dave had this quickly snowball into a project idea tasked to me: create an IDS using only freeware and pre-owned company assets (for this, nothing) to create a company-owned property we could manufacture and sell. 

I tried to fight for any resources I could: a set of hours from Randy, a budget for potentially purchasing assets we could use for this, anything. This fell by the wayside, but I did have no expected deadline and the time to work on this was STRICTLY 'whenever you have downtime to work on it'. Any contract support was priority number one, this was a project he was looking to have movement on my the end of the year. 

And all I had was the hardware from a 6-year old server that sat on my desk and Google to try to create this. 

Some research later brought me to SNIVEL. At the time, it was commercially-available via GPL, we could modify it as we wanted, and we would be selling the contract with support. This was the closest thing I could find that met our requirements, and the documentation was surprisingly good. I lost track of time trying to find if this was something we could use as a business, as the legality aspects were rather new to me. 

Arnold spoke to me the next day. He didn't seem all that worried about this new project, but after I inquired he said he was fairly sure this was fine and to start creating a prototype, but get formal approval from the accounting team to have this reviewed very carefully before we moved past proof of concept. Fair enough, the legalese seemed over my head but after pouring over pages of articles this seemed like the ideal solution. 

Assuming the documentation to get the initial setup and configuration done was fine, the only real issue we had was the display. I wanted to get a single-screen overview the client could glance at, and had a few tweaks in mind to make the device as self-sustaining as possible. I'd had great luck running a virtual Linux server for our internal ticketing system, so I was sold. 

About a week after announcing this project, Dave came by my desk asking me about movement on this. Arnold was in earshot, but I explained what I had found and my plan was to setup this SNIVEL software, configure and tweak it until it met our needs well, and offer a test run to a client once my team was confident this was what we wanted to present. Dave seemed caught off-guard, nodded and was off. Shortly afterwards, Arnold sends me an IM:

Arnold: ""Hey, don't put too much confidence in this. Dave presents projects all the time, and they fall apart or get ignored after a few weeks. There's a reason he wouldn't budget anything for this.""

Likely sage advice, but my feet are already in the pool of inspiration and I'm ready to dive in. Over the next couple of months I set up this server to be what I imagined it: 

* This device was intended to plug right into the network

* It ran SNIVEL, logging all packets in text files

* Redirected two specific IP addresses we'd had consistent scam emails from

* Required a local login to access (no network credentials SPECIFICALLY as everyone at SalesClient was DA again)

* I'd built a web page showing an overview of traffic, with charts and color-coded traffic based on expected threat value of the source

* A script ran monthly to export all logs to an Orangered file server in a nice encrypted folder to conserve space on the IDS

Confident I'd made something even Dave would appreciate, I presented this to Arnold and Jack. They had some minor inputs for tweaking the dashboard that I completed before offering this as a test run to SalesClient in a 90-day free trial. 

In the meantime, I also obtained my Network Certificate and **WAS** reimbursed for both certificates at the same time. A minor amendment was made to it, though. The cost would be prorated over the year after obtaining it, and if I were to leave early would have to pay a percentage of the cost. I was amazed I got anything, but Susan came through for me.

The day before my prototype's maiden voyage, and Dave sent another all-hands on deck meeting. He announced we would be pairing with another company with an IDS we could resell, and we would be freezing my project.

&gt; BUT I'M NEARLY FINISHED! TOMORROW WE PLUG IT IN, AND THE CLIENT IS EXPECTING THIS FUNCTIONALITY FOR 90 DAYS!

I'm livid. Dave continues that he's been working with a few different companies for the last month and a half to find a situation that 'made sense' for our needs. Arnold and Jack don't seem very surprised. 

My cool is lost now. I put Dave on the spot at his meeting about how the test device I created was scheduled with SalesClient tomorrow, Dave says that 'I can try out that toy for the 90 day trial as we'd negotiated, but after that we will be looking to sell them our partner-product.

**The next day**

While onsite at SalesClient, SalesManager asks me about $competitorProduct Dave had called him trying to sell him on. I have still not found my cool, and say that Dave has been considering the $competitorProduct and our internal product was of my own devising. This trial run is going to be my proof of concept. SalesManager then asks me something I had never had cross my mind:

SalesManager: ""Why didn't you just make this on your own time? This could have just been yours.""

Most_Humble: ""I.. had not even considered that.""

SalesManager: ""You put a lot of effort trying to make Orangered look good, but that fire isn't there today. I can tell, I work with people all the time. Something isn't sitting right with this on you.""

Most_Humble: ""This IDS test should be exactly what you are interested in, I've personally-""

SalesManager: ""That doesn't worry me, you always go above and beyond helping out here. Even when we don't follow your recommendations, you're patient and flexible. If you ever find yourself somewhere else, let me know. I have a lot of business connections.""

Most_Humble: ""I'll keep that in mind. Thank you.""

I spend about 30 minutes going over the login, the dashboard, the redirect (which only device admins me, Randy, and Arnold can change), and I provided him the method of unencrypting archived log files. As I am heading back to the office, SalesManager gives me a business card. I didn't notice at the time, but it did not have *his* name on it.

The way I see it, I will regret not doing something while I'm still somewhat young. 

I have decided to quit my good paying but toxic environment of a job with the Federal Government (Veterans Affairs) and go back to college where I have been accepted to a [Masters in Information Assurance](http://www.stcloudstate.edu/graduate/information-assurance/default.aspx?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=redirect) program where I can really work on specializing in network security which, is something I find fascinating. 

Money: Luckily, being a Veteran I have the G.I. Bill which not only pays for school but for housing as well. I'll have to get a p/t job (hopefully a graduate assistant job) to pay for some bills. Money will be tight but, we will not be eating rice for two years.


Employability:
Here's where I need advise and maybe a little guidance. I have 2.5 years of schooling for this masters program. .5 years for pre-reqs since I have a social science undergrad, and 2 years for the masters level courses. I do not know how I will be gauged by employers after graduation. My goal is to get back into the Federal Government. I have held security clearances with the DoD and as a Civilian Federal Employee and understand experience and professional certifications will only help my chances. I will have an internship as part of the graduate process which, can only help my cause. 

So, am I crazy, stupid, ignorant? Either way, I am doing this, I just need to know what I am getting myself into haha. Thank you for all the comments in advance! 


TL;DR - 28, quitting my job, back to school for Masters program, not sure I will be employable."

I will be graduating with a CS degree and a Math degree next spring and want to make sure to do what I can now to increase my salary expectations.


Currently I work as an intern at a medium sized company and have been there for a year so far.  I have worked on two projects, one was an Android app for the QA team written from scratch and the other was implementing a new component throughout their main product.


The internship has definitely taught me a lot but I still feel like I need to learn some new technologies and I think having some projects that I have done on my own accord would help in the interviewing process.  I don't really know if I want to stick with app development or not.  I want a job with a decent work-life balance, a good salary and room to grow.  What would you guys recommend to learn before looking for a job as a software engineer?  Are there any technologies/languages that would greatly increase my salary expectations? Anything else I should consider?

Thanks and I have listed below some of the things that I have experience with and feel comfortable to work with.

- Java
    - JavaFX
- Android
    - Crosswalk
- C++ (Haven't used in awhile)
- Source Control
- Linux Shell

[edit] I also made a small language in my software engineering course that I plan on extending further for my math seminar class.

I work 40 hours a week during the summer and 20 during the school, right after school, right when all club/organization meetings are.

I've also been struggling with my father's health. He passed away this February, and he's been sick for a while. I'm sure I could've done better GPA wise without this stress, but I don't think that matters much.

Will that internship and possibly a 33 or 34 on the ACT after some preparation and a calculator give me a chance into more competitive schools?

I'd like to apply to UCLA, Berkeley,  and Carnegie-Mellon as my reach schools. Would it be a waste of my time to even apply to these? Am I in too deep of a hole to climb out of?

4jv1n7,6,2016-05-18,Got a job over summer mildly related to CS. Feeling guilty. Should I keep looking for an internship?,deeadpoool,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4jv1n7/got_a_job_over_summer_mildly_related_to_cs/,"Hi all, I'm currently in my second year of college. I spent about 1.5 searching for internships, I interviewed at a few places(not all software related). I got an offer(after being rejected) for a software intern position but they wanted me to work full time even after summer ended. I didn't want to cut into school. 

I ended up taking a job here near my school that sounds fun, is full time, and is a bit related to CS(teaching young kids coding). However I feel a bit guilty that I""m staying at school for a job that won't necessarily help me become a developer or whatever.

I know its late in the game to look for a summer internship but I mean you never know. I would also feel pretty guilty for backing out on this position. Also these past 2 months have been really stressful due to interviewing, car accident/insurance stuff, and looking for housing. 

Should I keep looking for a software or It related internship? If I stay at this job I plan to do something on the side. I've been interested in learning some web dev."
4jv71t,2,2016-05-18,[MF] Hello There,King_DeMille,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/4jv71t/mf_hello_there/,"Hello there, you must be Jack? Or is it Mark? I honestly have no clue and let’s face facts I don’t care. There is over 7 billion of you identical bastards, you can’t expect me to remember every last one of you. 

What’s that?

Who am I? 

No one special really. Just the physical representation of everything in the universe. But that’s a bit of a long name so how about you call me Robert 

… 

You seem to be having trouble getting past the whole ""representation of everything in the universe"" what, were you expecting me to be 1,000 feet tall and talk in a **DEEP AND ALL POWERFUL VOICE?** Or is it the fact that you can’t see yourself in me. Well you are there. The third electron on the 554th atom of my big toe was named after you.
 
Why do you look so confused? I mean on your planet alone there is over 7 billion humans and probably over a trillion sentient lifeforms and I haven’t even mentioned the rest of your galaxy. The fact of the matter is, you are just an insignificant little spec on me and no matter what you do to stand out and be remembered, you will never be remember as anything other than a spec. all the lives you claimed to save, all the people you tried to help, even the fact that you are gay and could be killed for that at any second. All of that is meaningless to me. Although if it makes you feel any better I know how your life will end and I found it quite entertaining. The details are fuzzy but let’s just say that you try in vain to save the one you love. 

O well you have at least a few more years before that happens. Or was it a few decades? Honestly I can’t remember, they both last about the same amount of time to me so I guess it doesn’t matter either way. What’s that? Will anything that you do in life cause a change? Well I guess your death will inspire a few protests which will escalate into riots which intern will escalate into a full blown revolution that would finally make being gay in your country legal among other things. Or in other words, a bunch of specs will stop killing each other because of how their brains are randomly wired a certain way at birth. The world will morn for about an hour to a week. After that you will be forgotten by all but the few people still alive to remember you (which trust me, at that point there isn’t too many and their dropping pretty quickly). Then finally your small little pile of dirt that you call a planet will be consumed by its sun and all life on it will cease. There will barely be any evidence left to prove the existence of humans, never mind you and your worthless struggle.

You seem upset? Why? It’s not like this is anything new to you. You were alive when it was announced that the population reached 7 billion. In fact you live in the “Information Era” where everything you could ever hope to learn is just a click away. So at some point it must have become apparent that in the long run, it doesn’t matter that you got accepted into Harvard or whether you got to go on that trip to see the CN tower.  Soon enough you will all be evaporated into dust and be nothing more than a neat little tale for me to remember every now and then.

Well this is starting to get boring so I will give you one more question before I go. You want to know why I’m telling you this? I guess you could call it a little science experiment. You humans seem to be driven in some way or another by ignorance. You seem to think that the rest of the galaxy will care whether your book gets published when the fact of the matter is simply that you could die tomorrow and nothing catastrophic would happen. So with that being said I wanted to see what would happen if I gave you a whole new enlightened perspective. Will you commit suicide? Or perhaps find a way to beat me and truly make something meaningful out of your life. I guess time will tell."
4jvcee,64,2016-05-18,Am I being a selfish Father?,J3necis,Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/4jvcee/am_i_being_a_selfish_father/,"My GF (28F) and I (27M) had our baby girl a little over 3 months ago.  Due to our current situation with me in an internship program and her on maternity leave.  She is residing with her parents about 2 hours away.  I live with my parents at the moment to save money.  We agreed that this situation would be best for us because she did not want to live at my parents house while I am at work (7am-7pm).  Every weekend we alternate back and forth on me going up to her parents or her coming to stay with mine. We usually video chat every night before bed so I can talk to my daughter a bit.  

  Now we just recently got into a big argument over a family trip that I just went on this past weekend.  My cousin was graduating and my immediate family was flying to Texas for it.  My close cousins were also going to meet there and I haven’t seen them in 5+ years because they live out of country and its hard for the whole family to be together at once.  Since my whole family was going I wanted to go with GF and baby so my family could meet her.  I was setting up trip around the month that my daughter was born.  My GF did not want to take our daughter on the plane at 2 1/2 months old but told me that I should go.  So I booked my free flight with my points.  

  Now while I was over in Texas I got to meet my cousin’s 2 year old son and got to interact with him a little bit.  I tried to get a sense of how taking care of a terrible 2 year old would be.  I sent my GF texts about me playing with him.  I told her I missed her and my daughter everyday.  I wish they were with me.  

	That is when she exploded at me and told me that I decided to go on the trip and I should not be upset that I am missing out on our daughter.   I sent these texts meaning that I wish she had come with me.  I ignored her angry texts and told her goodnight.  The next day I asked to video chat with her so I can see our daughter.  She responded that she was about to go to the gym.  I called her anyways and saw our daughter for a bit.  She then called me and told me that I was selfish for going on the trip and how dare I say that I miss them.  She said that I couldn’t believe my parents didn’t say anything about you not staying to be with your daughter, or about your responsibilities.  “It makes me sad” for our daughter.  That I was selfish for calling because godforbid she took some time to go to the gym.  That I already missed 2 weekends in her life, the first was to be godfather for cousin’s baptism planned months in advance.  

  I just didn’t know how to respond.  I told her that I guess I won’t ever meet your expectations.  My GF told me I should go on the trip and see my family as she knew it was important to me.  I wanted them her to go and meet them.  We just recently drove down 6 hours to her uncles wedding for her family event with our baby.  The wedding had a live band playing that startled baby but she then fell asleep.  I didn’t complain about this trip, or the holidays that I have to spend with her family instead of mine.  I don’t say anything when her family holds her while we are at lunch, I don’t want to be rude and tell them I want to hold her.  

  I also wanted to take our daughter to her first soccer game at 4 months, as I am a big fan.  Again she said that I was being selfish and thinking about me and not what our daughter needs.  I had envisioned a family outing where we went to a soccer game and dressed her up in USA gear and took pictures so we can show her when she is older her first game. I have read that many people take babies to sporting events, my parents took me to soccer games as it was what they were passionate about.  How are we supposed to introduce these things to her?  Or am I supposed to ask her when she talks if she wants to go or not?  Am I just blinded by my own self interests?   


Edit:  Thank you all for your responses.  They have been very helpful to understand a different viewpoint.  Initially we had planned for her to come move in with my parents and I to save money as we were going to be struggling with all her bills and mortgage.  We remted put her condo to save money and she moved to her parents during the week.  She then told me that she could not live with my parents at all.  She had worked to hard and been on her own for so long to move in with my parents and be uncomfortable.  It reqlly wasnt my choice to be so far away.  But I work 7-7pm everyday so I understand her not wanting to be at a house stuck in the room all day with a baby.  However this situation is temporary as I expect to be done with my program and get a salary at the end of august.  We have to pay for daycare 1400/ month starting July in additiom to paying her car and school loans.  Because this is taking such a toll on our relationship I am frantically looking at an apartment to rent in June.  It is not what we planned and we will be very tight but I think its for the best.  I am going to have to borrow the money for the rent to cover until semptember as I get paid very little and wont cover rent + expenses.

4jvuu9,13,2016-05-18,My mother [56f] has developed a drinking problem in the last couple of years and I [23f] am wondering how to help her,Jingobae,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4jvuu9/my_mother_56f_has_developed_a_drinking_problem_in/,"Hi everyone, my family is in a tough situation and I'd appreciate some advice/insight. 

Background

I have three siblings, Alex [25], Kat [22], and Rose [20]. Alex lives in a city on the other side of the country, Kat lives in an apartment in my hometown (where my parents still live) and Rose is staying in my parents' house for the summer. I go to school about 2 hours away from my hometown.

Our childhood was so amazing, and it really is all because of how selfless and dedicated my parents are. They paid all of our tuition, given us so many opportunities to travel, and have supported us in whatever we wanted to pursue. I am so so grateful for my family, and truly love them more than anything, even with all the chaos.

Growing up, my mom hardly drank ever, maybe a glass of wine or two when we went out to dinner. There was never, ever any alcohol in our house. Recently that's changed, and now there are empty wine and beer bottles hidden throughout the cabinets and garage.

The first time I had word of my mom's drinking problem was about three years ago, when Rose was a senior in high school and all my siblings were out of the house. I came home to visit one time and Rose said that our mom would frequently get drunk and ""yell at dad"". I kinda pushed it to the back of my mind. I feel like I (and others in my family) are very avoidant of problems and try to not think about them, especially my dad, who is very quiet and reserved as well.

Over the next couple of years I did notice my mom had began to drink, and was a witness to a couple of these fights but never really intervened, I guess I was kind of in denial.


Big Incident 1.


Christmas 2015. I was home for the holidays, and my family was hosting Christmas dinner. My mom works the night shift, and I woke up around 9am to her being very drunk and yelling at my dad. Basically these ""fights"" consist of my mom repeating herself over and over, yelling at my dad as my dad stays quiet and maybe answers one word. I do not remember exactly what she was yelling about, maybe his family (she doesn't like my dad's mom which is questionably justifiable). But she goes on and on yelling, and what she is very, very, mean. Example: ""Fuck you!!!!!!! Fuck you!!! Be a man!!"" Divorce is mentioned frequently.

But anyway, I wake up and walk downstairs, and try to stop her yelling. I tell her for the first time that her drinking is a problem and she should see a counselor. It escalates, she is now being horrible to me. I leave to go back to the city I live in. My sister, dad, and mom all call me telling me to come back, its Christmas. On the phone my mom is crying and says she will get help and that she is sorry. I come back, my mom goes to sleep, and my sisters and I prepare Christmas dinner until my mom wakes up. She apologizes later soberly too. During Christmas dinner I notice my mom is shaking and she is definitely not her usual bubbly self throughout dinner. I feel horribly sad and guilty.

So I must admit ever since I've really recognized my mom is an alcoholic I've been a little bit standoffish. I hardly call her (for fear she's drunk; even though I'd estimate she drinks 2 nights/days a week at most) and just feel distant. Ever since this incident though I've been back to my hometown about 7-8 times for various reasons, each time staying at my parent's house. My mom never actually go help, but the times I've gone home she has been 100% sober and happy. I was starting to feel like everything was normal again and that was just a phase. Her birthday was in April, and we all organized a nice dinner for her and for Mother's Day we got beautiful flowers, her favorite candy, and a nice card. I think my siblings and I have tried to make my mom feel appreciated more than ever. I've made an effort to always tell her I love her after a phone call and give her hugs goodbye.

Big Incident 2

So then this happened, the reason I'm writing this post. I was visiting my long distance boyfriend, and my parents agreed to pick me up at the airport when I arrive back to my hometown. I could tell my mom had some to drink, but she was being nice and lovey so I didn't want to call her out on it. I talk with my parents for awhile, then go to bed around 11. I hear her car leave the garage, and I guessed correctly, she went to go get more alcohol. My dad was asleep on the couch and 30 min later I hear her yelling at him. I get really upset as I'm trying to ignore it and go to sleep, so finally I pack up and go downstairs to leave for my apartment 2 hours away.

I just say to my mom ""You need to get help, you are pushing us away from you, I'm leaving (more said probably)"" and she's like ""WAIT!!! WAIT!!!! [Dad's name] TELL HER WHY I'M UPSET!""
And my dad says it is because he wakes up every morning early to watch the news (has done this since I can remember) and there is an attractive news anchor that my mom thinks he wakes up early to see. Yeah.....

Everything escalates. My mom is SCREAMING. I'm screaming. Rose wakes up and comes downstairs and joins in. My mom is so so mean to all of us, saying fuck you. Saying things like: ""YOU BETTER NOT TWEET THIS!!! FUCK FACEBOOK!! THATS NOT REAL LIFE!!"" (I don't even have a twitter, hardly post on fb and would never even dream of posting something bad about her.)
My grandfather (Mom's dad) is not doing too well health wise and she starts crying about that. At that point Rose and I try to console and help, but she is SOOO irrational and yells at us for trying to help. She yells at the top of her lungs ""WHO WILL BE THERE FOR ME???"" Rose and I try to respond with ""We are mom"" But she just is yelling 'NO NO!!! NO!""

She tells me that Kat (who is getting married in a month) is so so stressed out and that I haven't done anything to help. That I'm only concerned about myself because I travel frequently to visit my boyfriend (I pay for this) and accepted an internship in a far away city for the summer (soberly she was supportive of this). I'm the maid of honor, I planned her bachelorette and bridal shower, which both were successes and Kat was so grateful for them. I have not helped much with the planning of the wedding but every time I ask Kat what I can do to help she tells me she doesn't need anything. My mom telling me this just made me feel so horrible, and I regret this now, but I poured part of a water bottle on my mom. She was just yelling in my face saying horrible, irrational things, and I just was upset and did not have control of my emotions and actions, and I am aware I should not have done this.

The whole duration of this incident lasted about an hour, and the whole time I was trying to leave but my car was backed in and my dad took the keys from the car behind me, saying that I'm too upset to drive. I finally calmed down enough and my dad let me drive 2 hours to my apartment. I texted him to tell him I made it back alright. I asked him of mom was still up and if she was still acting crazy and he said yes, so this is STILL GOING ON 2 hours later.

I just really feel so guilty and horrible. I know I could have handled everything better, but still my mom's harsh drunken words really cut deep. I feel so sad that my parents really have given us so much and now that we are grown up we just don't get to spend as much time together as we once did, and I just think my mom may be bored. She works full time and is AMAZING at her job, and all of her coworkers love her and invite her out but I think she truly doesn't want friends. She maybe goes out with a group of women about 2 times a year. Her mom is her best best friend, and I know it is just killing her to see my grandpa not doing well. She has taken up gardening recently which I'm glad, since she really didn't have any hobbies before.

I think my dad needs to do something, but he is so passive and seems to not even care when my mom is saying mean things to him, as he has probably gotten used to it. He will comfort her when prompted but offers not a lot of emotional support. She truly is verbally abusive to him when she is at the peak of her nonsense. My sister Rose has been living at home for the past 2 weeks and said that this is the first time my mom had been drunk during the 2 weeks she's been home.

I want to help, and I don't want to stop talking to her, but something has got to change. She is pushing all of her children away, but I know she needs us. Like I mentioned earlier, I will be far away this summer so I'm very worried/limited on how I can help but would appreciate any insight. What should my next move be?

tldr; My mom is an irrational, mean drunk and has a fairly recent drinking problem. What can I/my family do to help?"

During the interview, I was told the company was just starting and I would be building it together with a few other engineers. So far I know about one person with a Master's degree in CS who would be responsible for back-end development and another person just finishing up their bachelor's degree who would be involved alongside me. The owner was vague about what kind of product we're developing because I haven't signed an NDA yet but apparently he wants do develop a new social platform that ""has the potential of becoming as big as Facebook etc."". To generate additional income, he would find us additional contract work. Also, to get to know us and how we work together, he proposed the following: He would take us on for a 4 week internship and then hire us in a permanent position.


Now my concerns are that there are apparently no people directly involved with multiple years of experience. There would, however be an external consultant at our service for any questions we have. Also, of course, the inherent risk that comes with such a start-up. And I'm worried that his idea sounds a little unrealistic, but I don't know the details. On the other hand, it sounds exciting to build a company together and sounds like a good opportunity to learn and grow with the challenge.


Now, I'm just out of college and need some advice if this is a bad idea to take this job. The owner wants me to give him an answer until tomorrow. So I'd be thankful for any advice I could get."

(Selling or keeping),ktrezzi,pcmasterrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4jw7i9/advise_opinions_on_what_to_do_with_my/,"Allright guys I have a kind of problem here and no idea what to do. Two years ago I build my solid battlestation instead of getting a PS4. 
I bought just used parts from something similar to Craigslist here in Germany. 

It was: 
i5 4440 @ 3.1 Ghz with stock cooler
Sapphire R9 290 
8 GB Crucial Ram 
500GB Seagate HDD 

It was all about 400€, so a lot bang for buck I would say.

A couple of months later I did a favor to my former boss and we has so happy that he gifted me a brand new MSI R9 390 - What a nice gesture and some almost high end GPU for my solid battlestation. 

I´m loving it! I love PC gaming! As I had just a PS3 and was only playing FIFA and Battlefield 3.
The last years it was so nice to get back to PC gaming and play all those ""old"" blockbuster games I missed during the time, Witcher 1+2, Fallout: NW, Battlefield 4 (with mouse and keyboard), Bioshock Trilology, Mass Effect Triology, Tomb Raider, Hotline Miami, Borderlands and so on...At the moment I´m playing a lot of R6: Siege and Dark Souls I (I hate it :D). 

So far so good. But: By the end of the summer I´m going once again abroad for studying, after that I think I´ll stay another semster abroad for doing an internship. So AT LEAST one year abroad. 

What should I do with my battlestation? 
Taking it with me is not an option, I don´t think that I will play a lot abroad. 
Should I keep it? On the one hand, it is a solid battlestation and could be still fun to play in one year with good grapics on 1080p (Don´t think I´m gonna have the money to spend for a 1440p or 4K monitor)

Or should I sell it? I paid as I mentioned about €400 for all of the stuff, I could sell all of it as single parts maybe for 500€ if I´m lucky and leave it with a €100 surplus. 
And if going to be back from the semestre abroad I start working, so I could save a couple of months and get something really high-end...? 

What do you guys think? What would be the best option? "

I did a 12 week program for IT where I got my A+. I got hired with a company promising 35-40 hours a week at $11.50. Okay whatever. Its better then an unpaid internship right? Wrong.

These people send me on a daily commute to different schools two hours away from my home. Im taking the morning rush hour trained packed so bad that I can feel the person behind and in front of me pressed against me  . You know the NYc stereo types about trains? Yeah theyre real. And its like that on the way back. I have to take two trains and sometimes two buses and walk. I have to be there at 8 am but if I get there at 730 I can clock in. Pff yeah right. I can never make it because the trains always screw me over. I get to the school and work if im lucky for about 4 hrs befoee I have to go... sometimes ill get two schools with 40 mins to 2 hrs in between eAch  school in commute . I spend most of my day in a train or bus. Its freaking depressing. I clocked in 25 hours last week. I live with my mom and she's an at home baby sitter so home is hell so I guess its one upside that I barely have time to do anything..

I want another job so badly. Im tired of the terrible wage. The commute. The low hours. Im sick of it. Ive applied to hundreds of jobs by due to lack of experience I cant get hired. I had a mental break down today during work. This commute is killing em and im making little money.
I have to struggle to make my 7 hours and tey and work slowly but they kick me out of the schopl early. Other workers leave early and clock out on their way home or at home. I dont want to do that....

4jx8m9,6,2016-05-18,Charlotte Comedian Of The Week - Jake Manning,Sad_Clown_Paint,CLTComedy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CLTComedy/comments/4jx8m9/charlotte_comedian_of_the_week_jake_manning/,"**BIO** 
Jake Manning is a pro wrestler, podcaster and a stand up comedian. Much like the title of his podcast Jake feels like a ""Stranger in a Southern Land"" because he moved to Charlotte for a 3 month internship that has now turned into a 10 plus year residency. Jake is able to articulate why he constantly feels like a visitor in a city that he calls home. His feelings of awkwardness are also expressed when he talks about his misadventures in love, his missteps in the world of performance art and his tales of wrestling as a over grown boy scout known as the ""Man Scout"" Jake Manning.

**Why do you love or hate doing comedy in Charlotte?**
I think the Charlotte Comedy Scene is perfect place to start off. Very low pressure, easy access to get on open mics &amp; shows and for the most part it is a very supportive community. If your not a dick. Also on average if you hustle you can go up any where from 3 to 5 times a week which isn't bad. 
But comics in New York or Atlanta can go up just as much in one night. Every veteran comic will tell you the only way you get better is if you go up as much as possible. There is no substitute for experience. So a move maybe in order in the future if I want comedy to be something that I do for living.

**Favorite Charlotte spot to perform?**
The Station on Monday nights is really turning into something really special really fast. Any show that Debbie Millwater puts me on at the Comedy Zone is always a lot of fun. But the Evening Muse really is amazing and really is my favorite. The staff &amp; regulars have always been awesome and super supportive to me as I continue to grow as a baby comic.

4jxeoj,36,2016-05-18,TIAFU by resetting an AP and bringing down the whole building's network,xoxorockoutloud123,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/4jxeoj/tiafu_by_resetting_an_ap_and_bringing_down_the/,"Today, I almost fucked up by resetting a Ubiquity AP and bringing down the entire building's wired network. *Long post coming up*

'Twas the first day as the new intern in IT for the media group on campus. I have a pretty good amount of networking experience working with switches, AP's, and whatnot. I was tasked with finding a Ubiquity AP and resetting it to factory (they forgot the password) while my supervisor went out to grab some food for us. After searching the whole floor of the building with a WiFi scanning app on my phone, I finally found the AP, and stuck a paper clip into the reset port for 10 seconds, hard resetting the AP.

And then, shit hit the fan. I went back to my desk to adopt the AP, and, oh look, it's not there. From around the corner, I hear ""The file server down for anyone else?"" ""Anyone having issues with Reddit? Oh wait, never mind. Issues with the entire internet?"" On Uniquity's control panel, our 4 other AP's started disappearing one by one. Oh shit. Did I bring down our entire wired network by resetting an AP?  There goes my job.

I suddenly get 10 or so people in our production group swarming my lonely desk complaining that they need the file server online and they can't watch cat videos on YouTube. Look around. Supervisor not back. I told everyone that I was going to fix it, and that everyone should remain calm [and exit the building in a single file line]. I grab the keys to the switch room and decide to go cry in there because it is isolated and no one will look for me. Enter the switch room and all the switches have hit the fan. Fault lights on multiple switches. UPS's blaring their alarms. Lights flicker. **Lights flicker?** Supervisor comes back with food. Drops jaw and drinks.

Turns out, the lights flickering starting right as I was resetting the AP due to a power surge or brownout. The UPS's in the switch room haven't had their battery replaced in 10 years so they did absolutely nothing to protect the switches that run the entire building's networking. Supervisor explained everything to his boss, and I did not lose my job. I now understand why ""sysadmin"" gets abbreviated to ""Sadmin."""

During that time I discovered a terrible design flaw on their website. I was toying around with their site and came up with a solution. How should I go about giving them this fix? 

Should I give it to my friend that works for the company and recommended the job to me? Or, should I send it to the internship coordinator?"
4jxi54,34,2016-05-18,"Long post, do I still have a chance at a job with CS?",ineedguidancepls,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4jxi54/long_post_do_i_still_have_a_chance_at_a_job_with/,"Hi /r/cscareerquestions, I've dug myself a huge a hole and I need help. I don't think I can lead my own life anymore.

TL;DR I'm 24, graduated in Fall 2014 with a 2.4 GPA. I have no internships, never held a job (edit: I actually had a job for 3 years in high school but it's way too long ago), and no side projects. I've only realized a few months ago that I've drove my life down into the ground.

I'll try to keep it short but basically I was way too cocky. I had this belief that I could just land a job after graduating because I got a Computer Science degree. Didn't realize how unemployable I was. 1 year after graduating, parents were incredibly disappointed, just became depressed. I didn't want to do anything anymore. I managed to get a job last month at a restaurant as a cashier. I was pretty stoked because it's my first job. It felt great. It got me out of my depression at least and now I feel like I should get back into what I started with. The job just isn't for me.

I know I totally deserve to be working there but I don't think I can last. The commute is 2 hours, 1 hour there, 1 hour back, and it's 10-11 hours a day not including commute. Everyday has been wake up, get ready, get picked up to go to work, work for 10-11 hours, get home, shower, sleep. I don't have time to do anything except on my day off which is today. I want to quit but I simply cannot. This is the only income I have to sustain myself. It took me so long to even land a job, it will take just as long or longer to get another job that's better.

I want to get back into CS or programming at least. I enjoy programming but I don't think I'm experienced enough for the job market. I've only done console applications in school. I know enough Java and C/C++ to do them. My strongest courses were Data structures and algorithms. I really want to get back into it but I don't know what I should be doing because I need to use my time to its fullest.

I don't know what questions I should be asking unfortunately. What should I do? Do I even have a chance anymore? I just feel so lost. I can provide more details if necessary.

If I can't be helped, thanks for reading, even if nothing comes out of this, I just wanted to get it out because I made this account a week ago hoping to find some answers but felt it was better for me to just post instead.

edit: Hi thanks for all the responses! Unfortunately I just came home and will have to read them all during downtime at work. Is there anything I can do with a phone? I'm usually on my phone when there's no customers and it's kind of a bummer that I can't really do anything on it. I will respond to you guys on my free time."
4jxkwr,2,2016-05-18,B.S. in Mechanical Engineering + A.S. in Software Development? Is that enough to get a job?,MEtoCS,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4jxkwr/bs_in_mechanical_engineering_as_in_software/,"Hi Reddit, I graduated last May (2015) with a degree in mechanical engineering. I have been working with my current employer as a mechanical engineer since June 2015. After several internships and a year working full-time in the industry, I have come to the realization that ME is not for me. A few months ago, I started learning web development and Java in my spare time, and I have been having a lot of fun with it. I am now planning to potentially go back to school, and I have a few options in mind:

1. Community college to get an associate degree in Software Development. The program I am looking at includes Java (at least 3 classes of it), Networking, Visual Basic, Systems Analysis and Design, and Database Systems.

2. Community college to get an associate degree in Computer Science. These programs seem to be more focused on students who would move on to get a B.S. in Computer Science. This is the
least expensive option though (assuming I do not go on to get the B.S.).

3. Getting a B.S. or M.S. in Computer Science.

So I guess my questions would be:

1. Would an associate degree be enough, in addition to my B.S. in ME, to get hired in this field? Or do you really need that B.S. in CS?

2. If an associate degree isn’t enough, should I go for a bachelors or a masters? Would I be behind in a masters degree because of my lack of formal programming background?

I am looking for an inexpensive option that will allow me to get a job as quick as possible. I do not think I can afford to go back to school for another 4 years.

Do I even need to go back to school? Or are companies just looking for someone with analytical skills and some programming knowledge and are willing to teach the rest on the job?

I know that this field can be very competitive, but I am not looking to (or expecting to) immediately get hired by a huge technology company. I am fine with starting small at a little company in any industry. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!"
4jxyh6,1,2016-05-18,F4M - Celebrity wins hot vacations,[deleted],AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/4jxyh6/f4m_celebrity_wins_hot_vacations/,"""By ""raffle"", I won a trip to special vacation resort. This resort is unique because it’s ONLY for couples and no one seems to know much about it, as people who won tickets have to sign nondisclosure agreements. But the rumor is that it’s really great, and most importantly one of the most exclusive in the world. I really want to do that trip, but have nobody to go with, so I ""catch"" you and drag you into it so I can go.

In that resort, a lot of activities are organised for couples. We quickly discover that some are mild, and some aren't at all. Romantic dinners, massage lessons with other couples or just the two of us, sexy cooking lessons, but also more kinky ones. Moreover, some employees can give dares to couples every time they see them, from kiss and grope each other right here (“here” being anywhere from an empty corridor public places)or skinny dipping to have sex in that place without getting caught (or make sure you do get caught by somebody). Each couple can choose anytime between 3 categories and activities and dare at the beginning of the day, but won’t know any details until they start. You can be an employee or a fan, or some rich friend and you have to act like your bf. At the beginning You'd probably kind of shy/nervous because of all of this, hanging out and pretending to be with THAT celeb's boyfriend. On my side I'm having a blast, enjoying myself and keeping us from all the things you'd love to try.

And from here, the scenario can go differen ways depending on what you want to do, your kinks &amp; limits… So let’s discuss it

Do youstart to enjoy yourselfself and we both start to take part is more and more daring activities? Do you figure out that you can take advantage of the situation, start to get more and more touchy every time you can? Trying to get us into the hottest activities, and if I refuse to play along threaten to expose us as a fake couple? Or maybe you start to even blackmail me after getting some serious leverage, and get me to do everything you want.

LOTS of possibilities, with either a young celeb and an older employee, assistant, agent... Or an older one with the new intern or some fan she randomly picked, I'm open to suggestions !

I'm about to do my last year of undergraduate study at a top 20 U.S. university for computer science. However, I'm currently planning to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics &amp; Applied Science. I've taken a good amount of Computer Science courses - more than enough for a minor. Plus, I've done two software internships, and am doing a third this summer. You've definitely heard of one of the companies, if not two. Plus, I have some cool side projects on my github that I can talk about.

Will the name of my major - ""Mathematics &amp; Applied Science"" - hurt me in my job search? Should I officially declare a minor in Computer Science? Would majoring in just ""Mathematics"" or ""Applied Mathematics"" look better? The majors are negligibly different - I'm just worried that the *name* of the major will look ""bad.""

4jy68z,0,2016-05-18,Looking to get into software dev or programming but looking for advice on where to start. Here is my story,nipsternip,softwaredevelopment,https://www.reddit.com/r/softwaredevelopment/comments/4jy68z/looking_to_get_into_software_dev_or_programming/,"Graduated HS, No college, worked my way up from a laborer and did construction risk management for 10 years. I new very little about the internet or even computers in general (always wanted to but never took initiative). At 29 I woke up and decided to do something different with my life before it was too late. I started networking with friends that had IT jobs of all sorts, Reading everything I could in my spare time about HTML, CSS, Java, teaching myself fundamentals of these with the help of Linda training software online (access provided by a friend). 
I took an unpaid internship (Networking paid off) working nights as a help desk technician learning everything I could. 

I got laid off from the construction job a few years ago at the age of 31 and decided not to continue on with that career path but to have faith to continue on with the dream of getting into IT. I was an unmarried Batchelor living alone but this was still a terrifying experience as I had a mortgage and bills to pay. Instead I continued working (unpaid) nights at the help desk job. 

Continuing to network and talk to anyone who would listen it eventually paid off and landed me a job as a sys admin at a newly started school that was heavily reliant on computers as part of the curriculum (known as a 1:1 school). Quickly learning all aspects of device management for apple devices and chromebooks I was the go to person for all IT related issues for literally everything from a broken computer to network issues/configuration. I was Overworked and underpaid but grateful to have fulfilled my dream of changing careers and landing a well paying career in IT. 
Fast forward 2 years I am still working at the school and looking towards the future. I have started college (night classes) at the age of 33 seeking an IT or possibly comp sci degree (haha old man on campus). 

I have always been fascinated by software development and programming but really have no idea where to start.

I primarily wanted to reach out for help to see if anyone has advice or words of wisdom? 
One thing is certain.....I have the capacity to learn and the drive to succeed. Help me oh wise ones...Please?

Sorry for the long read. I wasn't expecting it to be that detailed."

""Good morning, Mr. Williams.""


""Good morning, Sir.""


I pass by a stream of faces, nodding and smiling to recognize their greetings. A few I answer, but not every. The receptionist, definitely. The girls in the clerical pool. A middle manager that is scurrying by, a young man from the right school and the right family that will probably be moving up soon. And my own secretary, of course.


""Good morning, Mr. Williams. I hope you had a good weekend?""


""I did, Alyssa, thank you"". Her plump red lips spread into a pleasant smile, showing pearly white teeth. Her legs are crossed and her skirt is riding up her thighs. I can catch just a hint of cleavage from where I'm standing. She had come to the city to be a model, but at 28 she is just about done with that part of her life. She still looks fantastic in front of my office door, though. ""Give me ten minutes then come in. We have some things to go over"".


My door opens to a huge corner office. Bright light streams in the windows. The city skyline dominates the view. There is a large, sturdy mahogany desk in the middle of the room with two leather chairs in front of it. A big couch sits along one wall, and on the other side of the office four comfortable chairs are arranged around a knee-high glass table. The walls are lined with full bookshelves and various framed photos, awards, and memorabilia. I set my brief case on my desk and take off my light gray suit jacket, hanging it carefully in the corner.


I check myself briefly in the mirror, running my fingers through my short, salt and pepper hair and straightening my tie over my starched white shirt. I've always been vain, and getting older has been difficult. Although I have to admit that the over-all effect is not that bad. Distinguished. I give myself my practiced, charming smile. If nothing else, at least I'm rich. I pull out my own big leather chair and I'm arranging myself in it when Alyssa knocks and opens the door. Ten minutes almost exactly. Her patent leather heels click across the room and she sits, crossing her long legs and balancing her notebook on her knee, pen poised to write.


I lean back and let her go over my week, giving instruction here and there and having her read back each note to make sure she has it. She accepts each of my directions with a ""Yes, Sir"" and I'm confident that she'll do what I ask. She always does. When I'm finished she stands, smoothing her skirt with manicured hands and turning to go.


""Oh, one more thing, Mr. Williams. The interns started today.""


""Oh?"" I swing my chair around to face her, sitting up in interest. ""Have you had a chance to see them?""


""Yes sir"", she replies with a smile. ""And there's one... I'll find her and send her in.""


&gt;So, as those of us working in an office knows, it's intern season. And who doesn't love having an influx of hot, college-aged girls to your otherwise boring and predictable job? You can be the intern, or maybe the secretary, and we'll get kinky in the office. Let's talk about what is special about this intern, and what plans the boss has for her. And whether she loves it, or not so much."

I graduate in December with a CS bachelor's but have had no job offers yet. I've already completed internships at Lockheed Martin and IBM. Lockheed Martin was two summers ago and they told me to let them know when I graduate and they'd offer me a job - but those people have since left the company. I did the IBM internship last summer, but I had just started pain meds for my back, and so didn't do that great. They did not offer me a job.

My plan was to practice interview problems and iOS everday until fall when I can get some good offers (my GPA is a 3.90) and not to settle. IBM is not where I reaaaally wanna be, but since I have already worked there I think it may be my best chance to work at a good company. I have an interview with them tomorrow for yet another internship this summer, but I am feeling like maybe I should just stick with the plan and do interview problems this summer. But on the other hand, if I do this internship maybe IBM will extend me a full-time offer (not sure if I really wanna work there though).

Anyways, just wanted to bounce a question off you guys. Thanks."

I do remember this. I also remember that he said he asked one of our PR professors about PSG Management and that the professor said it was or looked like a scam, sort of like Vector Marketing. 

I did some digging and they seem legit. Their website is professional looking and the few reviews I've read on Glassdoor seem positive. When they called me, the woman on the phone told me that the company is pretty young but that they've been so successful thus far that they are on a hiring spree and looking to rapidly expand. However I couldn't find a single thing about them in the news and their twitter is quite blank with few followers and interactions.

I have a few questions regarding what steps I should take over the next two years to get where I want. I am very interested in AI/Machine Learning, embedded systems, control systems and biotech. My ideal career would be to work at a high technical level in medical devices or robotics. However, I just started the major so obviously this could change, but I have looked heavily into the different fields and those seem the most exciting and upcoming, and they pique my interests in math and software.

My questions are: 

1) Should I switch into computer engineering? I have the option to do so, and it would allow me to take more software classes while still taking some EE electives such as Signals Processing and possibly upper level DSP. I feel like computer engineering suits me better but idk what different career prospects there are/if CE is well respected.

2) I have an offer from a very good company for a Fall Co-op, yet it is in the Energy/Automation business, which does not exactly fit my interests. Should I be taking this internship? I have no internship experience so far. I am starting in a research lab this summer in embedded systems and it is exciting but its been slightly disappointing and has been going very slow (as I have found all research to be thus far). I feel like I should take the internship just to get experience, even if it isn't in the right field. But I don't want it to set me back.

3) I definitely want to at least get my Master's degree; I know that a lot of the exciting high level work is only offered to students with at least a Masters in Engineering (thesis-based, not professional). With that being said, should I focus more on getting good research experience? Is taking an internship a bad idea if I want to go into a research based masters program? Also, how difficult is it to get into top programs (CMU, Stanford, GTech, etc.) for Masters.

4) Should I be thinking Masters or PhD if I want to do high level research work in industry?

Sorry for the long post. Any answers/advice to any of my questions will be greatly appreciated! Thanks."
4jyswz,19,2016-05-18,I just feel sad,meow378meowz,breakingmom,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/4jyswz/i_just_feel_sad/,"Rant ahead. Probably a lot of text. I can ramble. 

I just feel sad today.  Alone. Isolated. Overwhelmed. and DONE. SO DONE. 

My husband deals with depression and has since we've been married, but the thing is - if he gets stressed, even a little bit, he gets SO mean.  When he's depressed, he's just so god damn moody and removed and MEAN.  Oh my god, if I say anything that he takes as a slight he's so mean to me.  

Usually he starts calling me names, or criticizing me.  I know it's because he criticizes himself, and he's taking it out on me, but ITS NOT OK.  He had an incident at work where he reported one of his leads for being condescending to him (he has a pride thing) and apparently the guy got in trouble and now ALL of the leads are giving him the cold shoulder.  When he told me about it, of course now he wants to quit his job and he's super moody.  I told him too bad, he has a family he has to support, he needs to keep the job, this is exactly why you don't shit where you eat, the best you can do is suck up or just brush it off.  Apparently that wasn't what he wanted to hear and so for two days now he's been super distant.  

He's also been (not so) subtly telling me I'm a bad mom, etc.  I've been having trouble putting my son to sleep because our piece of shit rocking chair broke into pieces (literally) while my husband was rocking him the other night.  Now when I try to nurse my son to sleep, he realizes he's getting sleepy and starts physically fighting me to get away and I can't even keep him in my arms.  Cant rock him because no chair. And I can't leave him to cry because my husband works a remote call center position.  I have left him to cry for no more than a few minutes and my husband comes out of his office: ""What are you doing?! The customer can hear that! Do you want me to get fired?!""  So then I sit with my son in the living room with all the lights off until he gets super tired.  By that point I'm tired too and just pass out with him. So no mommy-only time anymore. One night my husband came out on his break and said, ""Give him to me"" gruffly, and surprise surprise, got him to sleep while rocking him back and forth standing up.  Now he thinks he's a better parent than me. ""Well I have no trouble getting him to sleep, why can't you?"" Ummm..... The only reason he happened to fall asleep was because he was already exhausted at that point, not because you are a toddler sleep guru you asshole.  He didn't believe me when I said our son slaps me to get away when I'm trying to put him down.  Then he saw him do it and his response? ""He doesn't do that with me.  You must be doing something wrong"" WHAT?! 

Also, he says I don't understand job stress because ""All you've ever had is that piece of shit retail job, not a real job, you don't get it.""  He's working a job you can get with a high school degree.  I have a bachelor's and have had multiple internship positions with professional organizations. Ummmm ok. I think he's just jealous that I have a college degree and he doesn't, and that my job prospects are actually better than his. 

He's also constantly looking for new jobs, even when he could just work his stupid job and then spend time with us.  Instead he's lost in thought all day ""worried"" about his job and finding a new job, and how he doesn't want to go to work, etc.  Apparently its all he thinks about.  When he's with us he just sits on the computer and barely interacts, then snaps at me if I try to tell him to stop being so fucking negative or to actually fucking interact with us. 

I also have no friends, well I do, but they have their own lives. None of them are at the same place in life as me.  They are all off with no kids making way more money than me. I have no family, no contact with mine and barely contact with his.  I have no one who I can just call and cry to, or stop by at their house and hang out.  I'm just here. Alone. With the baby. WHO IS AWESOME. He's an awesome baby and I don't deserve him.  He's so social and he never gets to see or play with anyone because I have no family or friends. I also end up sitting on my computer a lot because I feel so depressed and deflated and I don't play with him enough.  

Right now I'm hiding in my room typing this after spending an hour just doing the dishes and vaccuming the kitchen and living room.  And I got sweaty and exhausted and I'm wondering how the fuck anyone manages to keep their house clean.  and my kid is just sitting in his playpen alone.  And now he's crying. guess I have to go. "

I just wanted some advice on my situation.  

I interviewed for two different companies for a summer internship this week.

I have an offer with company A for a internship.  I like the company, it looks like a good working environment, but it is not something that I see myself enjoying as much as working in Company B.  Company A isn't as engineering related as Company B, which deals more with process efficiency and has a wider scope of projects available to be worked on that are more related to the Process and Safety side of Chemical Manufacturing.  

Would it really be a horrible idea to contact Company B and explain the situation?  I am definitely extremely grateful with the opportunity Company A is offering me, however, I was definitely hoping to hear back from B first before anything.  

In the end, of course, I do feel very fortunate to even have this opportunity since I know many people have not had my type of luck.

Thanks for all your time."

So I will be starting an internship in New Jersey at the end of this month that is for a total of 2 months and I will be living with my Uncle in NJ.  

As I am a resident of NY I will have to pay both taxes for NJ and NY and I am curious as to if there a way to avoid this.  Can I switch my residency to NJ and switch it back to NY upon conclusion of the internship?  Or am I shit outta luck and have to just pay both taxes and feel like I'm working for nothing? 

The paperwork I have to fill out is a W-4, I-9 and an IT-2104.

Pretty much my main goal would be for me to work this internship and avoid paying double taxes.  At the end of the internship I will be looking for a job in NYC so I'd like to be able to go back to just NYS taxes at the conclusion of the internship. 

Hopefully someone is knowledgeable enough to answer this question, thank you! "

When I sublease, is there anything I have to sign? With him, or the landlord?

Where can I get large boxes to put my stuff for when I move it?

I don't think I know of anyone who has a car and will be able to help me move. I don't have a license either. What should I do about the actual movement of items? I **think** that my uni might be able to give me a cart on wheels so I can move my stuff there, but that's a big maybe.

 I'm currently in my final year of high school and have received my acceptance to BMOS and AEO at Western. I have also been accepted to Waterloo's Computer Engineering program with co-op, and am currently debating between the two. I'm currently leaning towards Western as I'm interested in the prospect of a dual-degree of HBA with Software Engineering, as I'm thinking of going more into business in the future. However, I've applied and been accepted to Western under the BMOS program, so I have a couple of concerns: 

Is it possible to switch from BMOS to a Software Engineering Dual Degree by taking engineering prerequisites during first year? If so, how difficult is it to switch? I've called the admissions office and they've let me known that I can declare my major during second year, and that I would need to take engineering electives in my first year. However, I've also been informed that those currently enrolled in the Engineering program get priority in the Dual-Degree Eng+HBA major option.

How difficult is it to get internships (co-op, work experience) at Western (with Engineering or Ivey)? The major factor that attracts me to Waterloo right now is its dedicated co-op program, and though I know a couple of current Western HBA students with great internships, I have heard that internships depends greatly on grades, luck, and connections. 


Thanks!

Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice. I called admissions and they were willing to admit me in the engineering program instead. I simply have to figure out if I want to do business instead of engineering.

4jzn4c,2,2016-05-18,"Me [21 M] with my ex [21 M/F] broke up a month ago after 2 years, she's seeing someone else now, I'm trying to move on",reddit_orangit,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4jzn4c/me_21_m_with_my_ex_21_mf_broke_up_a_month_ago/,"My girlfriend Jill and I got together in December of 2013 after our first quarter of college. She was my first girlfriend, which has made alot of this much more difficult to deal with. She wasn't just my first girlfriend, but alot of firsts around sex as well (first kiss to just short of having sex). So there are alot of mixed up feelings for me, and I'm finally in a place where I can write about it without feeling like I'm trying to hold on to the relationship.

Anyway, we start going out december of 2013, after spending some time together in the college dorms. Jill had just gotten out of a long relationship with her high school boyfriend, and expressed some concerns about us dating early on because she wasn't sure if she was ready. I listened, we went out once while we were on break from school (we both live in the bay area when not at school) and stayed in touch a bit before going back to school, although I noticed something was off. When we got back to school she told me she had gotten back together with her high school boyfriend, that hey had had sex and were going to continue seeing each other, and that she was sorry if she had confused me since she knew I thought we were boyfriend and girlfriend, and that she felt different about it, but acted the same even knowing that.

This hit me hard because I not only cared about her, but because it was my first romantic experience (first kiss, first real date) and I let her know that, and that I not only cared about her, but that I was serious about her. In hindsight I may have jumped in to things a little too quickly- but at the time it didn't change that this hurt alot.

When she told me that she was back with her ex my feelings were crushed. I told myself I wasn't going to walk out of her life just because I was upset, because at the time I felt like I might have been responsible for her not understanding that I was serious about her. Maybe not her fault, that sort of thing. 

Anyway, I stay pretty close with her after we get back together and she expresses she still has feelings for me and that getting back with her ex-boyfriend was a mistake. But he's planning on coming down for a weekend, so she decided to tell him when he came down that she didn't want to be with him anymore.

So that's exactly what happens. Ex-boyfriend comes down and she breaks things off with him (I actually met him, it felt very weird to me). Anyway Jill and I start dating, more casually at first because she says she doesn't want a label on things yet. But anyway we start going out officially after a few weeks and right off the bat things are going really well. She's really open with me about things that are going on with her, how she is feeling, even when she's upset. She shows me she cares about me alot, and is very affectionate. I was really happy being with her. Her ex-boyfriend (goes to a different university) kept contacting her and telling her he had feelings for her, most notably when he wrote her a letter in the mail. She showed me the letter and told me she knew he was still into her but asked if she could respond to the letter in writing anyway. I felt a little weird about the situation but ultimately trusted her, so I told her that was okay. Needless to say I didn't expect their keeping in touch as well as they did to last as long as they did afterwards. But we had a really good time. We talked all the time, became very invested in each other's experiences and interests. It was very rewarding.

Now for the beginning of the rockiness: A few months later (march or april 2014) she broke up with me for the first time. of many. She told me she wasn't ready to commit to me and that she felt like she couldn't have the lifestyle she wanted to while in college and still be my girlfriend. I was crushed, again. So crushed, that when the next day she came back and wanted to get back together, I said yes in an instant. I was honestly ecstatic.

Unfortunately us getting back together didn't hold- she broke up with me a couple more times before we finished school in June, and I kept getting back together with her. It's important to note that I was always the one going back to her when we did break up. She usually broke up with me for the same reason, citing that she felt like she had alot of growing to do and that she didn't feel like she could do that growing while we were together. She was going through alot academically and financially. She was trying to change majors which is incredibly difficult at our school, and she was also having a very difficult time settling on one. During our first year she had started in city planning, then tried taking some biology classes, thinking she would switch in, and towards the end of the year she changed her mind and decided she would be pursuing architecture starting the next year. Her family was also having a difficult time paying for her education, so her change of majors were pretty big setbacks to them being able to pay since she would be graduating later. I tried to be supportive of her whenever she switched majors, because I knew she was going through alot emotionally and she needed my support.
We had very different views around sex at this time. For the most part I wasn’t ready to take that step with her since I hadn’t taken that step with anyone, and she was very much ready right away. We were still very intimate, but I wasn’t ready to have sex because I felt like it was a big step emotionally, and because of the possible risk of pregnancy, which Jill was VERY casual about. We also had different views on abortion (I’m very much pro-life at least as far as it applies to me, but not to enforcing that on others, Jill was not) which made the conversation that much more complicated. Anyway, we would still be very intimate and often times Jill would bring up the subject when we were either making out or being more intimate, not just talking about it hypothetically or talking dirty or anything like that but actually asking me if I would have sex with her right there even though she knew how I felt about it and then when I said I didn’t want to she would ask me why not and demand an explanation. Very uncool. I was more than okay with talking about it in other circumstances, but was still clear about how I felt. 

Anyway, summer comes around and even though we only lived 40 minutes away from each other, it was a very stressful time. I had an internship that I commuted to for about 3 hours a day (really difficult for me especially since I was doing microsoft excel work all day but I figured it would be worth it to get an internship under my belt so I could get a better job down the road). Anyway, my working through the summer was very stressful for both of us. I would come home from work exhausted and often frustrated with my work, and her home situation was not good either. She had alot of tension with her family (especially her mom, who she had problems with growing up). Jill started telling me that being home made her depressed, and that she really needed to get out of her situation.

Anyway all of this put together produced a very frustrating situation for us. To add to this, she had still been in touch with her ex-boyfriend from high school, who she said was her only friend at home. I tried to be understanding, but I was pretty upset because of what had happened when Jill and I started going out. I told her that I couldn't deal with them spending time with each other and that I couldn't keep seeing her if they were going to keep hanging out. Perhaps not my best move in hindsight but I was still dealing with alot of negative feelings around the situation. She was upset but said okay.

She started breaking up with me all the time again- virtually every week up of the summer on average (sometimes multiple times a week, sometimes we'd be alright for a few weeks). She just kept telling me that she couldn't keep being with me anymore, and I'd come back and try and show her how much I cared about her. We had had some really nice times as well- She helped me work on the engine of my old camaro that I was rebuilding that summer in the little free time I had.

Anyway, school starts again and I thought we were pretty solid, until things started getting rough again a few weeks later. She broke up with me, then told me she had been lying to me all summer and that she had still been hanging out with her ex-boyfriend. I told her it was wrong of me to tell her that she couldn't see him, so she didn't have to feel bad about lying to me about it. I really poured myself into the relationship- her succeeding at architecture was making me incredibly happy, even though she didn’t have as much time to spend with me. I was really convinced that she was going to make it through the program, and it was great to see her find something that she felt like was her calling (she had tried a lot of different things by this point, and was having trouble sticking to any of them).

Halloween of 2014 was probably the worst things got for us. She was invited to a party with some of her friends, and I would have come along, but my car wasn't working, and I had to be back at school early the next morning for a club meeting (I was in a racecar design team at school that I committed pretty heavily to). It’s important to note that by this point we had some very different ideas around partying, and drugs. She had started smoking pot and drinking- not heavily but at least socially. I’ve actually never had a drink, and have never smoked either. Not my style. Anyway, I had a bit of a freak out that evening- I ended up calling her a TON of times because I was basically falling apart and worrying that something was up. The next morning she told me that she had ""casually"" cuddled with a bunch of people the previous night, some of whom were guys. Oh, and that she was breaking up with me again. I kept trying, and we got back together again. Really not sure why I let her get away with this one- she knew exactly where I stood and went around me anyway. Also she was telling me about some guy who had been trying to hit on her at the party who was still trying to get in touch. She was making fun of him, but it was still seriously uncool.

Anyway, get back together we did, and we were actually really solid for a while at this point. We spend alot of time together the next few months, although I did have a big time commitment with the racecar team I mentioned. I would come by her architecture studio during her late nights and bring her food sometimes, and we really enjoyed spending time with each other. We definitely went a little overboard with each other though, because we both ended up really stressed out by school and did very poorly that quarter. Towards the end of the quarter (think late march) she told me she wasn't sure if we should keep going out while I was gone (I had landed an excellent internship for that spring, at an aerospace company a few hours drive away). I talked to her about it alot and we decided things would work out.

I came up most weekends of my internship to both visit her and spend time working on the racecar team at school. After a few weeks she told me she felt really unappreciated and she broke up with me. I flipped out, convinced her to see me the next weekend, and we spent alot of time that weekend and had a great time. About 2 days after I went back to my internship she called me and told me she still didn't want to be together. I was really upset, this time to the point of genuine anger. To make it worse she called me a couple days later and asked me ""where I was at"" with us, suggesting that we should get back together. I was really pissed because not only did she seem to think it was completely okay for her to break up with me again and again but also that she could be so casual about asking me to get back together with her. Finally I said no, and proceeded to try and move on with my life for the first time in almost a year and a half. She kept trying to talk to me, she asked me to help her through her depression, and for me to be there for her. She asked me to go to a concert that I had bought her tickets for for her birthday. I said no- I was really angry and really hurt. I was still there for her and talked to her even when she asked things of me that she really had no place asking given how upset I told her I was. She called me all the time and asked me to tell her stories and things of that sort. She told me that her depression had gotten worse, and that she had considered killing herself. I was really concerned, but was also pretty concerned on guarding myself from getting hurt again. She dropped out of her architecture class that quarter as well. Eventually we did stop talking for a few weeks, and I thought I was done with things. I became interested in a girl at my internship, even though I knew it was a pipe dream (she was from florida, I’m still in California) and spent some time with her- though nothing romantic ever came of it.

When my internship ended in early June I did something stupid. I called her, and asked her if I could see her that weekend. She said yes, and told me about her friend Joe who she said their friendship had gotten pretty serious. I was a bit worried, but figured she would have told me about it if it was anything worth my knowing. I came down that weekend and of course we got back together again. But before things got serious between us again I asked her if she had been with anyone while we were broken up- she told me she hadn’t. Also, she had a picture of a guy (who I later found out was Joe) as her phone background for a few weeks after we got back together- she told me that it was no one and that she just liked that picture of her alot. I spent alot of weekends coming down to visit her (I didn’t have a job that summer, and spent my time fixing an old car, so I had no real commitments). We were pretty solid that summer, save for some issues with her friends at her new house not really liking me. They were all pretty heavy into the drinking/party scene, which I was not interested in at all (I don’t drink, smoke, hookup etc). I don’t have negative feelings towards people who are into that, but it did make it really hard for me to relate to her friends. She was pretty frustrated by this and I also felt really angry because I didn’t feel like she was making any effort to help her friends like me in the slightest. 

So the end of the summer is coming up and Jill tells me she’s taking a trip the last few weeks of the summer. She’s wanted to travel for a while, and while I haven’t always been 100% supporting of the idea (financial stability would be really good for her, and if she could have some money saved up she wouldn’t have to deal with her unsupporting family and her mom). Anyway, when she did tell me she was taking a trip I told her I was excited for her (I was, if it was something that she still felt like was a good idea then I was totally in support) and asked who she was going with. She told me she was going with her ex-boyfriend from high school. I just about exploded because she was incredibly insensitive about my feelings for it. She knew I would be upset and specifically told me she didn’t care about how I felt about it. I talked to her about it a ton, and she kept going off at me about how I was a huge jerk for being upset about it at all, and that she was going regardless of what I thought.

So she did end up going on the trip, and basically spent a few days of it doing damage control. She didn’t talk to me much while she was on the trip, but did leave me some voicemails late at night about how she really cared about me. Honestly at that point I wasn’t too receptive to it- I was really frustrated that she had gone in the first place. When she got back I broke up with her, but stayed in touch and got back together with her a few days later. When we did get back together (which was rocky, I was pretty unsure about things because I had basically been spat on one too many times) she admitted that she and Joe had hooked up (had sex) when we were broken up before my internship ended in June. I was pissed. We fought about it alot. I was furious that she had lied to me about it for three months after I had specifically asked if she had been with anyone. 

Anyway, all this stupid back and forth kept going on pretty much this whole school year (think every few weeks or month from November to about April). During this time I made a really serious effort to show that I genuinely did support her choices, especially the ones that were different than mine. I bought her a bottle of wine one night when I had set up dinner in my apartment, even though I don’t drink- and I picked her up one evening after she was smoking with her friends. She generally didn’t feel like she could trust me on a lot of these issues because she thought I would be judgmental of her choices, so I did whatever I could to show her that I really supported her.  Anyway, in April she broke up with me again, and I was really ready to be though with her, I thought. I had met another girl, Katie, one time when Jill and I had been broken up in late March, and when Jill and I broke up I immediately tried seeing where things might go with her. Katie had been friends when Jill and I were together, but once Jill and I broke up we became close very quickly. She had recently broken up with her boyfriend Steve, as well. Anyway, Katie and I moved very quickly and had sex after seeing each other somewhat casually for a few weeks. Neither of us are into the hookup scene, we just felt very connected very quickly and decided to take that step even though it was fast for us. She was a little wary because this was my first time and she was worried because we had moved really fast and wasn’t sure if we were as close as we thought. Katie and I were also really cool about the other talking to their ex because we knew we had some feelings to work through before we were going to be able to be as close as we really wanted to be. Unfortunately Katie’s ex-boyfriend Steve is a huge jerk and basically bullied her when he found out we were dating, and even more when she told him that we had had sex. Katie had been into hooking up in high school and then decided that it was not who she wanted to be. Steve basically told her that what Katie and I had wasn’t real and that Katie was just reverting to who she was in high school. Steve asked Katie to get back together with him, and she said no, but she said that he had caused her to doubt what we had, and that we should call things off because she didn’t feel like we were being fair to each other by talking to our exes. Katie had talked to Steve pretty regularly after their breakup, but I hadn’t been in contact with Jill very much.

On Saturday, I stopped by Jill’s place to see if she would want to talk. At this point I felt like it was something I needed to do to get closure on things. Boy was I wrong. Turns out Jill had a date with Ron, who she met on Tinder. She told me I had to leave because she was meeting him very soon. Sunday morning she called me back, and we met up and talked about all the crap that had happened in our relationship. Feeling like I needed closure, I told her about everything that happened with Katie- us getting together right after Jill and I broke up, us having sex, and that we were starting to have doubts about things. Jill was covered in hickeys and was clearly hungover- she told me she had been drinking a lot more (I worry she has real unaddressed substance abuse issues), and she told me that she and Ron were seeing each other somewhat regularly. We talked a really long time that day, and even though I told myself I was going to stay guarded and not worry about what had happened with Jill, I ended up digging up a lot of feelings I had. Not a good idea. On Monday we talked again (after Katie and I had called things off) and I told her that I still had feelings for her. Jill told me she didn’t want what we had anymore and that she wouldn’t even consider it. I thought hearing that would put me in a better spot to move on. It didn’t- instead I’m sitting here, even having realized what a huge jerk she was to me, and feeling really hurt that she really may have moved on. She and Ron are still seeing each other, which is fine because obviously I tried to move on too. I'm still in touch with Katie but things have been less than great since we stopped dating and because she's very swamped with her studies so we haven't talked much the last few days.
 
  I know this is reallllllly long, so I’ll probably add a better condensed tl;dr in front of each paragraph and answer more specific questions- I know I missed some things as well, but that’s what happens when you talk about two years of your life with someone. I’d really like to hear your thoughts, and again I’m sorry that this was so long and so disjointed.
I have a few thoughts on all of this:
-I can’t be with someone who lies to me
-I don’t know why I still miss her
-I’m worried about her getting through school and getting a handle on her depression (she’s still having a lot of trouble), but if I’m going to have a chance to actually move on, I can’t spend any time with her for the foreseeable future. It’s way to easy to slip back into this
-I’m not confident in my ability to stay away if she were to come back, and on the flip side
-I still hate the idea of her having moved on

**tl;dr**: Had very off-on relationship with ex-girlfriend of two years. She's moved on faster than I have, trying to sort out alot of feelings.

Other fandoms welcome",bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4jzon4/m4f_house_of_lies_the_office_or_buffy_fan_come_on/,"---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

Longtime lurker here. Details ahoy, but the TLDR basically sums it up.




I live with my lovely, darling boyfriend of about 1.5 years. We've known each other about 2.5 years. We dated briefly when we first met but I ended things after about a month: he was lots of fun but did not have his shit together (never really grew up-- was in a band most of his 20s, finished college late, worked from home at a dead end job earning barely enough to get by). It was sad but amicable.





After a brief no contact period, we began seeing each other strictly as FWBs. It was great and beyond that-- I started to see real change in him. Real effort and movement in a positive direction, with no prompting from me or stress on my part. Interviewing, trying to find a career-path type job, etc. It was pretty inspirational to see someone making that change.





So, when he admitted his true feelings for me about 10 months after our breakup, I thought long and hard and decided to give the relationship a shot. He was by far the sweetest, most caring person I'd ever met. Every day with him I feel cared for, valued, and he is always up for going on adventures with me. These are traits that were sorely lacking in previous relationships.





My former roommate was moving out, so we made the decision to move in together six months ago. Mostly great experience. However, his journey to get his shit together has waned and waxed. He hasn't had an interview in a long time. I made it clear that under no circumstances would I be fully supporting him, so he found a job at a restaurant. He works hard six nights a week and I'm proud of him for that. I used to work in service and I know how tough it is. Sucks that we don't get much time together, but that's the way it is. He makes ok money, basically enough to get by.





I make more than enough money. Not retiring early or anything, but I have worked extremely hard to be where I am. If we didn't live in a major city we'd be quite well off on just my income, but alas this city takes a lot out of you.  I also think I am pretty generous-- we pay rent proportionate to our incomes (my rent went up when he moved in, a sacrifice of a couple hundred dollars per month I was happy to make) and if I want a fancy dinner out or to take a trip together to see my family I'm happy to treat him. And I'm always delighted by the burrito/ice cream/whatever dates he takes me on! I don't need him to make a lot of money, is my point. Yet stability and growth for the future are starting to weigh on my mind.





I value hard work and ambition and my social circle is full of people who feel the same way, and full of couples working together to achieve something interesting together, challenging each other. I wouldn't care if he made an entry level salary if it were doing something that he liked and cared about (and I wouldn't care if he were a waiter forever if he were still making music/pursuing a passion). And he says he wants that, and I believe it, and yet he seems just... content enough. He takes care of minor housework and watches tv or hangs out while I'm working and goes to his job at night, rinse and repeat. We spend his one day off together. I actually value his laid back nature a great deal, it's a wonderful counterpoint to my own quite intense personality. But I worry he has grown complacent, and doesn't have it in him to effect the change he's said he wants (and the kind of life I would find mutually inspiring-- I don't feel challenged by him in that way). In my opinion and from my own experience, he could find the time to intern during the day, or volunteer somewhere, or something, yet he is somehow not able to figure out how to navigate that kind of busy schedule. Our sex life has waned a bit-- it was once almost overwhelming, now is more lots of physical affection in the form of cuddling with sex happening 1 or 2 times per week. I'd prefer more. I've asked him but he says he isn't unhappy or depressed, just comfortable.





I keep thinking... what if we want to marry, have kids? Can I shoulder the financial responsibility? Do I want to? Maybe he could be a stay at home dad, which I'd find pretty great. Yet when I mention that he says no, he wants to work at a fulfilling career!





I'm reaching an age where I want to think about long term and we've been together long enough for me to consider it seriously with him. So I guess... what's important? The day to day happiness or the big picture/long term viability? I know I must accept him for who he is and not expect change (even if I've seen it in him in the past). I value his loving, sweet nature so much-- I dated a millionaire and the lifestyle and security wasn't enough to make up for the sadness in our day to day lives. Plus, no relationship is ever perfect. And I know it comes down to what my dealbreakers are, and only I can answer that-- yet here I am, asking for advice anyway. Am I being too picky? Am I not being grateful enough for what I already have?





I just don't know what to do. Thoughts?





   

**tl;dr**: Torn in two: my heart tells me to keep my sweet, devoted boyfriend while my head tells me I should be with someone more responsible/driven."

So this takes place late-2000s, I'd just finished college in a medium-sized US city and offered a job from my internship company ""Orangered"" (a small IT contract company of ~30 people). This was my first break from retail and in IT. 

Details have been altered for readability, names have been changed to protect the innocent and the guilty, and any similarities found to real events are *completely* unintentional. 

Our cast of characters:

* Myself: fresh college grad and PFY

* Susan: HR and classmate from college

* Dave: Owner of Orangered IT

* Jack: Senior support tech

* Arnold: Support tech manager, ex-Army Drill Sergeant (unconfirmed)

* Randy: Developer

* Jim: Security specialist

&gt; * Internal monologue. We occasionally see eye-to-eye

**Part VIII**

It's beginning to get very cold again, being mid-December Monday. As I'm driving into the office listening to ""Dream of the Shepherd"" from the Aion soundtrack, I can feel my fragmented, sluggish consciousness start to coalesce and realize my destination.

&gt; I could really use a coffee before getting to the office. 

Warm beverage in hand, I stride in. I've had mixed feelings of the location lately: my test IDS has worked flawlessly, but no one in Orangered seems to have batted an eye. Due to issues with $competitorProduct, my IDS has been left on SalesClient's network indefinitely. My accomplishments consistently are overlooked, while faults that have any remote connection to me get hyper-inflated and overly-criticized. Most mornings I'm either too tired to realize I'm going to work, or alert enough to dread the day. Yet, I keep trying and every now and then I get that glimmer of hope that I am on the cusp of success. 

Or something is in my eye. I've not maintained a sufficient level of caffeination to know the difference yet.

Dave, Arnold and Jack are at my desk, waiting for me. Dave seems to be explaining something to the other two, and has a document in his hand. I seem to be intruding on their meeting. 

Dave: ""-would be a real seller of our services if we could get this. Oh, I see Most_Humble *will* be joining us today.""

Most_Humble: ""I'm on late shift this week, it's update week. Was there a meeting invite for this?""

Dave: ""I expected you here already. I was just telling Arnold and Jack that we need to be getting MacroServer certifications. If we can get three certified technicians before the end of the year, we can bid for more upper-end contracts.""

Most_Humble: ""It's already December. Where are the certification tests held? Can we even book slots for those? And why wasn't this brought up over the summer, I got two certifications from Certs-R-Us already.""

Dave: ""Those don't give us the formal approval to apply for contracts for SpecificClients. That's why no one else got those certifications.""

&gt; No one else *did* get certifications.

I find no study material provided, no time to study, exam fee will be reimbursed only if passed, and as I find the only testing site in state has their site closed after this Thurday. I send an email to Dave saying that without any resources for this, time/material/etc I am not going to be able to pass an exam by the end of the week before exam booking is done for the year. His reply really resounded with me:

Dave: ""Book a slot this week. It's update week, we don't have time to give for this.""

At this point, I have gone over and above as much as I can, but with holidays around and feeling setup to fail on this task I'm ready to have this fail in Dave's face. 

I go ahead and book the last slot Thursday night to give me as much time as I can. It usually takes me a few weeks to study for something like this, but given I won't even have a weekend to go through this I know it's going to be for naught. Susan and I chat about it later that day.

Susan: ""Dave's trying to renew a contract for next year, and there's a competitor with these certifications. I'm not sure why you three were chosen, as you three don't work this contract and won't next year either.""

Most_Humble: ""This isn't going to work. I've not had enough time to study for this. I was able to get two others, and these weren't mentioned until now.""

Susan: ""Just do your best, I'll try to play damage control. Arnold and Jack haven't scheduled their slots, and said they would next week.""

ಠ_ಠ

That evening, I'm applying updates to our domain and SalesClient while researching some study material. As I'm reviewing machines on their network, I notice my little IDS still camped out and logging. 

*The next day*

First thing in the morning I have an email from Dave, asking me to stay late and look into HealthcareClient. Jack's updates weren't sent out, and he called in sick. 

&gt; Glad I'll have time to study. 

After my planned activities are completed, I take a look into HealthcareClient's issue. I've worked a few support tickets from them before, but nothing spectacular. It's a small business with a focus on pain relief and physical therapy, with a small emergency clinic. Five sites across two states, and been a client for a couple of years. 

Looked like it should be an easy one. Their equipment is onsite, so I just RDP over and...

Host unreachable. 

No worries, I'll ping and verify...

Request timed out. 

Odd. Time to just call them and see what's going on. Around here is where I start worrying: phone line is unreachable. Digging through the client info, I find a cell number for site manager, Cindy. Time to get to the bottom of this.

Cindy: ""Hello, HealthcareClient. We're experiencing some technical difficulties at the mome-""

&gt; This ... doesn't sound like an automated voice.

Most_Humble: ""Hello Cindy, this is Most_Humble from Orangered. (the cue-card reading stops) I wanted to know more about these difficulties and how I can help.""

Cindy: ""Ugh, I thought you were a CustomerName again. He's called at least a dozen times.""

Most_Humble: ""Jack was unavailable for updates yesterday, but your network isn't responding. What's going on?""

Cindy: ""Oh, our whole town is powerless.""

Most_Humble: ""That explains a lot. PowerCompany give an expected time of restoration?""

Cindy: ""Nope. Once it was back I was going to call, Jack usually calls once updates are finished for me to test out the office.""

Most_Humble: ""I seem to have PowerCompany's contact info. Let me give them a call and I will let you know when we can reschedule updates.""

Cindy: ""Would you mind doing it tonight? We've got a few nights this week with student staff we're training.""

&gt; Well, you did ask nicely.

Most_Humble: ""If you have power tonight, we can do updates tonight. But I will need someone onsite to power up several machines.""

Cindy: ""I'll be here most of this evening. We had two rooms remodeled and I'm setting up our offices again.""

Fast forward a few hours, and I'm pushing updates along. Things are going smoothly now, but I'm still peeved at the certification situation. I go ahead and print off every email regarding them, from Susan confirming the certifications I got were approved, the rules for reimbursement, everything tangentially-connected was printed off and put into a folder (safely thrown in the apartment). By the time I get finished, I have another six hours before my next shift starts.

I just...yeah I'm really in need of outside perspective because this feels kind of surreal.

So before I get to the meat of my issue I think it's appropriate for me to give some background to further understand my bewilderment. Jon, Rachel, and I have been buddies for about 1.5 years.  For clarification I'm a lesbian, Jon a gay man, and Rachel falls under bisexual.  We're just a platonic group of homos that have grown close to each other.

**The backstory drama:**  Last Valentine's day the three of us had made semi concrete plans to go see a movie.  These plans were made *well before* Valentine's day and as luck would have it Jon and I ended up with special people we wanted to bring along.  We broached the subject of it to Rachel and she seemed okay with Jon's prospective date, but the idea that I was bringing a date as well made Rachel feel like a ""fifth wheel."" I figured I wouldn't do that to her, but I would at least try to see if we could compromise... maybe I could bring her a date or a bigger group?  I asked everyone out to breakfast to discuss alternative possibilities.


Cue two days later the three of us go out to breakfast.  Rachel is **pissed**.  I'm talking huffing and puffing, silently scrolling through her phone while Jon and I goof off, ya know... the passive aggressive works.  Finally I bring the topic up, which mind you I had already relented to not bringing this girl....I just wanted to see if maybe if I scored Rachel a date or brought more people it would work.  She explodes.  Crying, feeling attacked, yelling, etc. I calm her down as we're in public, and try to drag it out of her why this is such a HUGE issue.  I told her I cared about her and wanted to have a fun movie time and that at the end of the day I will make sure she's happy.  She never fully alluded to why she was crying so hard.  It bothered me deeply that she was so upset over something so...benign.

So needless to say I didn't bring a date.

Life goes on, kind of.  More drama crops up. Rachel expresses issues solely to Jon in confidence about how close of a bond Jon and I have forged vs. how her and Jon don't have as many similarities. I even have caught her rolling her eyes at me when she thinks I'm not looking.  Jon can tease her or say something and she let's it roll off, if I play at her she gets *very* defensive. I was peeved a bit thinking that  ""Hey I'm a young adult and my friendships don't have to be so incestuous!""  I was also hurt that she seemed to be pushing me away.  I am friends with Jon separately.  I am friends with Rachel separately.  We are all buddies together! Why does it matter?  I felt like it was my turn to be the ""third wheel"", and Jon was just caught in the middle. Jon divulged the information of her opinions to me.  Maybe that was a mistake on his part, but I can see from his perspective how exhaustive playing therapist and keeping all of that in was... so there's that. I can elaborate on more actions for further introspection if necessary, but I need to get to the point.



Keep in mind she never ever talked to me privately about feeling left out or anything of the sort.  It was all one sided venting to Jon and I had relayed information while I tried to scramble and be a ""better"" friend.

**Present day issue:**  Two days ago Rachel and I got drunk together.  It's summer break, I just landed an internship, and I needed a buddy to celebrate with.  It's late at night and we're both rather inebriated and talking about relationships, my girl, her love interests, sex, etc.  During the middle of our girl talk she out of no where asks me something along the lines of 

""If you and I weren't so close and we didn't view each other so platonically... would you fuck me?""  

I was completely caught off guard.  What?  I'm not physically attracted to Rachel.  I never have been.  I figured she was looking for some validation, and a bit of a confidence booster.  I was too afraid to admit I don't find her attractive.  I mean she's my friend?  Don't we all tell each other how gorgeous we are?  So I lied.  I looked down at my bed sheets and awkwardly said something along the lines of 

""Umm yeah totally,  I think you're fuckable...of course!""

I honestly was pretty drunk and very surprised.  I was more worried that ""fuckable""  sounded like an insult.  Now my memory isn't great because, well, I'm a sinner, but her reply was positive and giggly.  Something like...

""Oh yeah we could never fuck.  It would ruin our friendship with Jon.  Hahaha he would be so pissed, yeah we could never do that.""

Wait what?

The night ends nothing else happens.  Fast forward to today and Jon and I are driving down to my girlfriend's apartment to checkout her fish tank while she's out of town.  I told him the story. I told him that I lied to Rachel the other night when we were drinking.  I expressed worry about lying to her and that she might have caught on and felt very insulted.  I was worried it might be brought up again and I felt like an asshole.  I also expressed how out of character it was for her towards me.

Jon's reaction was not what I was expected.  He was super quiet and wouldn't really look me in the eye.  Poor kid is an easy read and I immediately sensed something was off.  I prodded further about *why* she asked those questions.  I wondered if she needed validation and needed to feel desirable.  I asked him what she meant by the prospect of her and I hooking up and pissing Jon specifically off.  I joked about maybe she was really drunk and was crushing on me.  Yeah the look on Jon's was pained.  I stopped in my tracks and repeated the crush theory.  His look said it all.  I asked him what the fuck his look meant then it all came spilling out.

Apparently she has feelings for me.  A lot of them.  For the past three months they have been having at least once a week a 3-4 hour long conversations about me.  What?  Listen.  I'm a homosexual woman.  Okay.  I like to believe I'm good at picking up signals from other women lesbians are a pain in the ass don't be one..but this?  She has *never* heavily flirted with me.  She has checked me out, but who cares?  We all do that. I can't deny this shit though.  Looking back on the way she was looking at me that night...I know Jon isn't pulling my leg.  I acknowledged his loyalty to helping Rachel save face but I pressed on.  She evidently has been denying her feelings for me until Valentine's Day let is seep out.  Her insane explosion prompted Jon to talk to her in private about why she was so torn up.  I would assume through introspection she finally admitted it to herself and Jon.

All of the weird tactics and passive aggressive behaviors revolving around me are centrally motivated by her romantic feelings.  Jon has been bearing the brunt of her outbursts.  He knows I don't want her like that.  He has always known...it's obvious.  He has been trying to prod her into getting over me.  I mean I'm shaking my head right now just typing that... Rachel needs to get over me? The thing is she has been trying to talk to me about it.  To confess it and find...closure?   But she keeps chickening out.  I have no idea how many times we have hung out and she has been trying to either come onto me or confess her struggles of her feelings to me...I don't know? 


I don't want to talk about it.  In a perfect world she would accept me as a platonic friend and move on without involving everyone.  I know I have to have a talk with her because Jon will tell her I figured it out.  Jon is so tired of being pulled into this problem that Rachel has created for herself and now that the focus is starting to be turned onto me....Well, I honestly don't blame him for wanting to be set free from this three month therapy session.  On one hand I feel so bad for her.  The idea that her close friend is someone she has feelings for.  The fact she has been listening to me gushing about every single girl I chase, including my now girlfriend. All of it I feel sympathy towards.  At the same time though I'm fucking furious she let this go on so long and let it turn her into a passive aggressive monster.  I'm angry she has been torturing Jon with this heavy ass information and he has had to just watch me sit there and wonder why the fuck she was pushing me away so much.  

Questions:



What do I even say in this convo I already am dreading??

Do you guys think she is actually trying to get over me, or still trying to make ""it"" happen? I ask this because of the way she was looking at me that night, the fact I was a moron and lied to her about her sex appeal towards me, and the fact the apparent reason we shouldn't hook up is because of Jon's feelings.

Is there any way to make sure this drama dies forever?

**TL;DR:  Close friend has been very passive aggressive towards me and causing drama in the friend group.  She got drunk and said some weird stuff to me.  I asked another close mutual friend what was up with such weird behavior.  Turns out she has had heavy feelings for me for the past three months, and now I think she knows that I know... The attraction is not mutual.  I don't know what to say to her and I don't know if she is trying to get over me or pursue me.**

I'm a rising senior at a well-regarded private college, majoring in Computer Science and Economics (originally was an econ major, then switched to CS). I'm looking to work in machine learning and/or AI, and will probably have taken 5 or so courses specific to this field by the time I graduate. I've done well, and have around a 4.0 in all my CS coursework, which will hopefully stay around that next year. 
The downside: I'm going to graduate with a BA instead of a BS (though the CS program is a joint program with the liberal arts college and the engineering school at my university, I'm in the college), and I'm only going to have a bachelor's degree, rather than advanced degree in the field.
Will I be competitive for the better jobs in this field, or should I consider grad school?
Edit: I worked as a research assistant writing some Python scripts for the econ department last semester and will be working at a bank this semester  writing code, though neither of these opportunities was really in machine learning. I'm a bit disadvantaged by the fact that I switched to the major a bit late in the game, so I had less coursework under my belt than people I was competing with for internships, though I generally interview well."

4k0vfw,5,2016-05-19,Parents decided I should not live on my own. What do I do?,eternaforest,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4k0vfw/parents_decided_i_should_not_live_on_my_own_what/,"Context: I am 18 and just graduated with my AS about 2 weeks ago. I am not currently employed but I am in for some good internships (which will pay more money than any job I'll ever get to have at this age, I am salivating at the possibility of a full time summer internship at $17/hr) and am working around the house and doing odd jobs for friends and family members for money. I'm not making a lot but I'm saving every penny I have.


I applied for university back in the fall (I have really good grades and had no worries about getting in) and already had made plans to move there when I started a year later. I have a medical condition so I will be in their graduate/disability housing which is basically an unfurnished apartment. **You have to be 19 to sign the lease and I will not be 19 until 2 months after school starts.** The school is in another state (I get in-state tuition for being so close) but about a 35 minute drive away. It is a much bigger city than my own and lots of people commute from my town so there would be traffic both ways. Lots of traffic. That was my main reason to move (not to mention the city in question has many opportunities for jobs in my field so I would probably have no issues landing a job or internship after moving). nMom was so on board and we have already started collecting things for when I move (pots and pans, dishes, very small pieces of furniture, etc.) and we had planned on checking out the place before school started.


Fast forward to a couple months ago and nMom was very surprised to figure out my rent would be $7500 a year. (The apartment is owned by the school but has a 12 month lease which you pay per semester, $2500 in spring, summer, and fall) She didn't know how we would pay for it but never said I would not get to move. Last night we had to complete counselling for my government loan (not anywhere what we need but due to parents earnings is all we get) and the numbers finally clicked for my mom. I get a $3,000 scholarship and a $5,500 loan for the year. One year at my school is $20,000. She has $10,000 in a CD that shes saved my entire life and I have $10,000 in my own personal savings (birthdays, graduation money, etc). She now says the breakdown is she will pay the $10,000 she has saved the first year and cover whatever is left after the loans and scholarship and I'll use my $10,000 next year in place of hers and she will pay whatever is left. That leaves the apartment up in the air.


She has made it very clear that she does not want me in the apartment but due to my age she can't tell me no, but we all know how this ends. My mom has always took it upon herself to pay for my school. She does this because she wants to, and not because she feels like she has to. She has made that very clear to me when I have asked. My mom has more than once told me it is my decision but throws a tantrum and makes me do whatever she wanted me to do in the first place when I don't go with what she wants. Doesn't matter how major or minor the situation is. She likes to tell me it is my decision but in the end throws a fit when I don't do what she wants. Typical N.


Today, my dad out of the blue told me he would give me $11,000 (I have NO idea where he is pulling this figure from...if we were scraping where was this money all along?) and I had a choice: spend the money to a new car with better gas mileage (my current car is fine and every time I talk about wanting a new one but not needing a new one I get told 'your car is perfect for you, and you don't need a new one yet') or ""waste it on rent"" and live on campus. I know what I want to do but he said I could take as long as I wanted to make the decision. I have to sign saying I'm living in the apartment on June 1. **They haven't told me I can't yet but I know what is coming next.**


So... I really don't know what to do. I cannot live in this house any longer. Every day I live here I grow more and more depressed, my mom makes me borderline suicidal. My dad is not really in the picture (he works a lot) but I can't say he won't help pay for anything. I can absolutely see them taking this away from me and forcing me to live at home and commute. I know I am 18 and this is my decision but I don't know what to do if they back out and I have to figure this out on my own. I do not have friends or family I can live with until then (your mom only wants the best for you!), and I have no one any closer to campus that I could live with. I need to live on campus and I feel like living there in my own home-like environment and my own space I will be able to branch out and ""change"" but my nMom thinks it is going to turn me into a hermit. I obviously don't have enough money to do this on my own, and my parents would not let me claim I'm independent (they really don't get why I dislike them so much, and they also want to control me as much as they can so obviously me being independent would not allow them to do that). These next few months are going to be very stressful for me regardless, but I am at my ends. 


TL;DR: My plan to move out and live at university was/is going to be thwarted by my nParents. I have to move out for my own mental health, but I do not have enough money for school and living. What do I do now?"

I've made a post earlier this week and found this subreddit very helpful, I thought I'd take a stab at another question.

Some background: I'm currently doing an entry-level intern position with an IT department. I'm planning to look for other opportunities. I also have an interview tomorrow with a very small MSP which consists of 15 employees, so this is why I ask because I've never worked with an MSP before.

I'm curious as what the major differences between working for a MSP vs an IT Department are? I'm still very new into the industry and I'm wondering if others with years of experience could give some insight.

I am a white male of 29 years who still lives with his parents. I am unemployed but currently attempting to rectify that by taking further schooling with an internship built into the curriculum. I am an avid gamer who plays many types of games across several genres, nearly without exception. I also have a strong interest in programming and computers in general, which goes well with my already existing bachelor's degree in computer science. My musical preferences fall within the genres of jazz and classical; but I greatly enjoy listening to the music of video games I enjoy regardless of actual genre. I tend to be of the quiet sort, keeping mostly to myself, especially in group settings; however, I can become very talkative in a private setting with one other person concerning topics that interest me. I have found myself to be my most awake during the nightly hours, where my largely sedentary lifestyle has found me to a sleeping schedule where I go to bed around 8 AM and wake about 3 PM (EST). My days tend to be fairly similar from day to day, but I occasionally add and remove tasks as I find my immediate desires shift and my time awake becoming too crowded. My current large, non-permanent task is self-teaching Japanese, which is coming along with varying degrees of success.

**Who I Am Seeking**

*Virgin* - As a virgin myself and a strong believer of having but a single mate, this falls high on my criteria for numerous reasons.

*Similar Interests* - I feel that a strong relationship is formed on a strong overlapping of interests in which both parties are passionate about.

*Physically Natural* - This set may seem strange to many, and likely where I lose many potential candidates, but physical attraction is important, to a point. Tattoos, piercings, use of cosmetic products such as ""make up"", hair dying, implants; these are all physical turn offs for me. On the inverse, I enjoy seeing females just as they are with intact body hair, not putting themselves in pain with silly footwear like ""high heels"" and not afraid to wear plain comfortable clothes.

*Willing to Start With Friendship* - I'm aware this is a dating oriented group, but I feel that no fulfilling romantic relationship can exist without a platonic foundation. Taking things slow and getting to know one another is more important than anything else. Plus, even if things never progress past a certain point, it would still be nice to make a friend.

*Recreational Drug Free* - In addition to the usual cavalcade of semi-legal and illegal drugs, this also includes legal drugs. So that means non-smokers and non-drinkers, please.

People around my age, with a max of a four year discrepancy is ideal, but I'm not entirely opposed to a larger age gap.

Past &amp; Present-- but where to go from here?,aeskiel,RedPillWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/4k1m9j/embraced_femininity_past_present_but_where_to_go/,"Hi everyone! A little background, I'm 21 years old, 4th year college and been a TRP lurker for 3 years and 6 months for RPW. This post is basically me thanking RPW and in need of advice of where to go from here.
&amp;nbsp;

-------------------------------------------------------------------
**Past Me**
&amp;nbsp;

Growing up I had been very tomboyish. I wouldn't wear anything feminine except during events and I loathed it. I thought that men were weak and that I have to ""man up"" since I grew up in a household with a very strict father who constantly made me do physical work. Guys who fell for me were very feminine and I hated it. 

&amp;nbsp;

My interests / hobbies were very masculine, (e.g. basketball, drums, indoor soccer, powerlifting, etc.) Though I was always cheerful, positive and friendly (my few feminine traits) -- I drank and cussed like a sailor. Might be worth mentioning that though I partied hard, I never slept around. 

&amp;nbsp;

Since I identified myself as a ""guy"" mentally, I instantly subscribed to the TRP philosophy when I was 18 to see how much girls will be attracted to me as it'll make me feel 'awesome'. I thought that guys weren't worth the time. *Facepalm*

*To clarify: I live in the Philippines. Cultural differences. Guys here in Asia are feminine than in other countries, or so I think.*

&amp;nbsp;

-------------------------------------------------------------------
**Present Me**
&amp;nbsp;

Fast-forward to the present, I'm currently with my first-ever official relationship. Though me and my boyfriend are still new, 4 months and going strong. He's my first in almost everything relationship-wise. So the bond here is very strong.

&amp;nbsp;

When he started showing interest 7 months ago, I was still tomboyish. I liked him but it felt awkward because he's very masculine. I didn't know what to do, nor if he really liked me. Nagging thoughts came to my head-- ""How could a masculine guy like a girl like me?!"" ""Maybe he's not serious."". 

&amp;nbsp;

I looked at TRP but all advice were aimed at guys. That's when I found RPW. I read RPW posts like there was no tomorrow. I instantly took RPW's advice and dressed feminine. It was awkward at first but his positive response delighted me so I kept going at it.

&amp;nbsp;

I dropped my bad habits of drinking, cursing and basically acting like a guy. Cooked for him every time he came over and did my best to be pleasant all around. It was a new feminine me in a span of 2-3months. (There were still lots of areas to be improved on of course)

&amp;nbsp;

His family loves me. I love him very much and I could see myself having a family with him. He's 2 years younger than me (19) and still has 1 more year of school after I graduate next year. I know the implications of age differences psychology-wise especially if the guy is younger. But nobody is perfect and i'm determined to work it out. 

&amp;nbsp;

-------------------------------------------------------------------
**Where to go from here?**
&amp;nbsp;

The issue is that my parents wants me to work in the family business. (think chinese family business style) Me and my 4 siblings hate it because we're not growing. Our dad just guilt trips us, gives menial jobs and are emotionally abusive if we don't do what he wants. His POV is that since he raised us and gave us everything we needed, it's our time to 'repay' him by being a slave in his business. 

&amp;nbsp;

The worst part is my dad is cheating with my mom and has another kid with the mistress. (found out 2-3years ago) He thinks that only my mom and eldest sister knows. Mom isn't doing anything because what can she do? No divorce here and same work, same business. If they split, she has nowhere to go and basically no way to provide for (us) her kids. Main reason why I don't want to work in the family business. P.S Court is too messy.

&amp;nbsp;

My boyfriend has been very supportive, even took me with his family on a 2 day beach trip to unwind. The problem is that I catch myself starting to be depressed and complain to him about it. He then gets sad because he can't do anything about it cause it's a family issue. 

&amp;nbsp;

Right now i'm emotionally torn. I don't want to burden my BF with my family issues and yet I get these depressive episodes. I only see him twice every 1-2weeks. Summer break so we're far-- 3hrs drive away. When I'm with him in person I'm very happy and cheerful. But when i'm stuck here in my parents house / business I get depressed and usually rant to him via online / phone.

&amp;nbsp;

I'll be away again for a year this June because internship, meaning I'll only get to see my family once a week. I consider myself a strong-willed person but these issues just keep coming and it's breaking me down. 

&amp;nbsp;

*I'm just really torn. Where to go from here? any advice would be greatly appreciated.* 

&amp;nbsp;


**tl;dr: RPW helped me change and embrace my femininity. Have my very first loving SO in turn. But right now family issues are causing me to emotionally break-down. Afraid it might affect my relationship with my SO because i'm getting depressed, helpless and I complain to him. Emotionally torn. Don't know where to go from here.**

Deloitte certainly made there offer sound more tempting by explaining how innovative and educational there culture is and also friendly. However, from a brief view of their websites PWC seems to offer more of a work-life balance.

Schools 1-5 I'm well above the median mcat/gpa. 6-16 I'm right around the median, and I added a handful of reaches 17-22. My only concern right now is that it's not quite ""safe"" enough, and that I should be adding more schools where I'm well above the average matriculated scores.

4k2x14,28,2016-05-19,r/WiiU's Weekly Kickstarter Post: What type/genre/playstyle of game piques your interest in a Kickstarter game? What do you think of the unpaid intern situation with Lynn? [5/19/16],phantomliger,wiiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/4k2x14/rwiius_weekly_kickstarter_post_what/,"Hello everyone!

So since I forgot to sticky it and I think it is an interesting question, I am going to re-use the same question from last week. What type of game do you like to see in Kickstarters? Older genres coming back that we don't see any more? A new take on a tried and true genre and concept? 

Additionally, how do you feel about the situation regarding Lynn? Obviously it being illegal in the country is a very bad thing. Should they have cancelled the Kickstarter? Do you feel that interns should be paid (ignore the illegality in this specific case)? As always, feel free to comment about any of the ongoing Kickstarters as well.

Not a new Kickstarter, but one that I missed. **Quench** by Axon Interactive has a low poly art style and in the game you control weather in order to herd animals and help save their homes. It doesn't seem like it can reach the Wii U stretch goal within the 33 hours it has left, but it may at least get funded. It is at $18,132/CAD$23,210 pledged of it's $20,312/CAD$26,000 goal.

**Xenocider** has slowed down a bit, only gaining about $3,000 in the last week. It looks like a fun entry in the on-rails shooter genre. They do have a new version of their demo, so go try that out.

**Paper Tails** Has not gained any money and has made no updates. I'm not sure what the people behind it are doing with no updates to it. Maybe they are discouraged with the funding? Who knows.

**Lynn and the Spirits of Inao** had it's funding cancelled. It seems there was some drama with unpaid interns doing animation work. I have not looked too much into the reasons behind it. I am only seeing some of the comments on the latest update post. If anyone wants to take a look and see if they are able to determine what exactly happened, [here is the link to the update post as a starting point.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bloomylight-studio/lynn-and-the-spirits-of-inao/posts/1578143).

Looking more into it, it seems that in France interns have to be paid, otherwise it is illegal. [Here is a reddit post from someone who claims to have almost been one of the interns.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/4jrccr/french_kickstarter_game_lynn_and_the_spirits_of/). It does seem to have some good information and updates about the situation.

**Ren Hu: Rebel Yell** has not seen any updates and has only gained about $100 since last week getting it up to a little above $4,600/€4,098. It looks like a cool concept so I hope some sort of update occurs with more information about the game.

**Almag** is still at the same amount funded and has not had any updates in a while as well. 

As always, if anyone sees a crowdfunding effort on Kickstarter, IndieGoGo or elsewhere, please message the moderators or myself to give us a heads up and I will be able to add it into the [Kickstarter wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/wiki/kickstarter). I also add Kickstarters that are posted to the subreddit.

Additionally, if anyone thinks of any good questions for one of these posts to bring about some good discussion, either comment or message me personally.  Thank you and have a great week!

4k31ly,9,2016-05-19,Started out as open LDR. Closed it. Summer plans geographically separate us. Don't want open relationship again.,troubled75,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/4k31ly/started_out_as_open_ldr_closed_it_summer_plans/,"Hey everyone, it's another relationship post. I tried to keep this short (it's not), so please ask me to clarify something if it's unclear.

**Background**

My boyfriend and I are both college students, and we met on Tinder. We go to different colleges that are 6 hours driving from each other. We met over break, when our break schedules did not align. He visited home, which is near my college.

I downloaded Tinder to befriend other gay guys. I never got into Grindr because I am not into the hookup scene. I want sex to be meaningful. My ideal relationship is monogamous.

My boyfriend has Tinder, Grindr, etc for hookups. He's lost count of how many people he's slept with. Sex is casual for him; emotion and sex do not intertwine. His ideal relationship is not physically monogamous, but is emotionally monogamous. He wants someone who can understand him and help him become a better person.

He admitted I originally was gonna be just another hookup, but I somehow felt different to him. We met up for a few dates before deciding to try a long distance open relationship, just in case we lose interest in each other or find someone better.

He tells me every time he hooks up with someone, and he has noticed that he isn't having sex as frequently after meeting me. I was still hurt, because it felt like I wasn't being valued when he hooked up with someone else. I felt disposable. Physical contact is something that he really desires, and it doesn't matter who it's from.

We meet up every once in a while. We discover that we are pretty compatible with each other. We make each other's life happier and fuller. I voiced how I felt about the open relationship, and he agreed to close our relationship without hesitation.

**Dilemma**

Our summer plans are very different. My internship is abroad and he is staying near his college. I won't be able to visit him, and a time difference means reduced video chatting.

He wants physical contact, partially stemming from his past and his experience with Grindr. He's suggesting to open up the relationship again until I get back. I don't want to relive those days of an open relationship again, but there seems to be no middle ground between a closed and an open relationship.

I know it seems like we're very different people, and we definitely are different when it comes to relationships and sex. In other aspects, we are very similar and very compatible.

I've addressed my concerns with him. We don't know what to do. We both want each other in our lives. What would you do in this situation? Neither of us want to break up, but is it the only option? What advice do you have for either of us? Thanks in advance.

**TL;DR** Boyfriend wants an open relationship while I'm abroad. I want to keep our relationship closed. Do we break up? Is there any future because of our differences?"
4k31sv,1,2016-05-19,How can I better prepare myself?,asianpantygirl,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4k31sv/how_can_i_better_prepare_myself/,"I have my A+, AAS, and am going for my bachelor's. For my senior project (doesn't start until Winter 2017) I will be needing to do an internship which is why I can't do one now. Or I suppose I can, but I don't want to do two internships. Ideally I could have started my senior project this summer term but I didn't take a pre-req to do that... 

So I have been applying for a lot of entry-level and not so entry-level positions. I don't understand why many ""entry-level"" positions require for x years of experience or a bachelor's degree because to me that doesn't seem like entry-level anymore. I just had a phone interview and I'm pretty sure I failed it.

Most of the positions I apply for work with AD. I've used AD for about a year in school but I forgot most of it. I don't have it installed on my computer anymore but I plan on using VirtualBox and installing many MS programs from Dreamspark onto it to re-familiar myself with it. During this interview I was posed a scenario on how I would do a certain task in AD (that I could not answer) and another one where I was questioning an end-user on his problem (that I could not answer beyond ""did you turn it on, activity lights, right display setting"").

I've had multiple interviews, in-person and on the phone, but I don't know how I can better prepare myself beyond looking nice because I have no idea what kind of questions they will ask me. I only had one job offer for an IT company (the position is called break-fix) but there are no benefits and I did not put myself in $20,000+ student loan debt to be paid $12 an hour ($2 above minimum wage, entry-level banktellers get paid more than this...)"
4k3dps,1,2016-05-19,F4M - Celebrity wins hot vacations,[deleted],AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/4k3dps/f4m_celebrity_wins_hot_vacations/,"""By ""raffle"", I won a trip to special vacation resort. This resort is unique because it’s ONLY for couples and no one seems to know much about it, as people who won tickets have to sign nondisclosure agreements. But the rumor is that it’s really great, and most importantly one of the most exclusive in the world. I really want to do that trip, but have nobody to go with, so I ""catch"" you and drag you into it so I can go.

In that resort, a lot of activities are organised for couples. We quickly discover that some are mild, and some aren't at all. Romantic dinners, massage lessons with other couples or just the two of us, sexy cooking lessons, but also more kinky ones. Moreover, some employees can give dares to couples every time they see them, from kiss and grope each other right here (“here” being anywhere from an empty corridor public places)or skinny dipping to have sex in that place without getting caught (or make sure you do get caught by somebody). Each couple can choose anytime between 3 categories and activities and dare at the beginning of the day, but won’t know any details until they start. You can be an employee or a fan, or some rich friend and you have to act like your bf. At the beginning You'd probably kind of shy/nervous because of all of this, hanging out and pretending to be with THAT celeb's boyfriend. On my side I'm having a blast, enjoying myself and keeping us from all the things you'd love to try.

And from here, the scenario can go differen ways depending on what you want to do, your kinks &amp; limits… So let’s discuss it

Do youstart to enjoy yourselfself and we both start to take part is more and more daring activities? Do you figure out that you can take advantage of the situation, start to get more and more touchy every time you can? Trying to get us into the hottest activities, and if I refuse to play along threaten to expose us as a fake couple? Or maybe you start to even blackmail me after getting some serious leverage, and get me to do everything you want.

LOTS of possibilities, with either a young celeb and an older employee, assistant, agent... Or an older one with the new intern or some fan she randomly picked, I'm open to suggestions !

4k3e4x,6,2016-05-19,Help with dealing with massive chip on shoulder in engineering?,disadvantageneer,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4k3e4x/help_with_dealing_with_massive_chip_on_shoulder/,"I know this isn't a usual question, and probably most of you guys will just think I'm whining, but I wonder if anyone here can identify with what I'm going through. 

I'm about to be a sophomore this fall (about junior level class wise) at a top 30 university in the US who's doing somewhat well (straight As and Bs, got into my major, all that jazz) but *every single day* I feel othered by the fact that I grew up really poor (and my family continues to be poor). 

I lived in an apartment this past year with three other girls. One of the other girls grew up a lot like me, except slightly better off. The other two had wealthy families, both parents being engineers. While I'm certainly not the first in my family to go to college, my grandfather and my uncle are the only ones in my immediate family who have (one a pharmacist, one a scientist). My great grandparents are Eastern European immigrants and the higher education bit really started with my grandfather.. 

Anyway, for all intents and purposes, I have it really, really good education wise. I currently have an internship at a fortune 500 company, I have a full ride to my university, and I have a lot of people supporting me. But I still find myself so unshakably bitter. It seems like everyone around me has things easier, and everyone has a safety net that I don't. And I read article after article detailing how upward mobility in this country is failing, so I keep wondering when *I* personally am going to fail, because it can't be possible for me to make it to the top. I honestly feel like this low self-esteem contributes to test anxiety, as I'm so afraid of failure, which is why I get As and Bs and not just As.

 I also have a lot of trouble making friends because I can't relate with anyone. One time, I introduced myself to someone and literally the second words out of their mouth were ""My father is the CEO of ______"". I can't relate to these people. I don't want to be their friend. Despite dressing nicely, working in labs, getting pretty good grades, and being from a nice middle class area (even though my family lives in an apartment in the area), I just can't help but think that everyone thinks of me as a poor, backwards, white trash person. I have somewhat bad teeth on top of that, so I cover my mouth when I smile because I feel like I'm ""giving myself away"". I don't know. It probably seems silly to anyone who grew up well off but it's really difficult for me to deal with. How can I cope with these feelings/get rid of them?

4k3l9s,5,2016-05-19,Recent BCIT grad with a rant about the co-op system.,UnfazedButDazed,BCIT,https://www.reddit.com/r/BCIT/comments/4k3l9s/recent_bcit_grad_with_a_rant_about_the_coop_system/,"When looking for a job the best thing you can have on your resume is experience. As a student, the best way to get experience is through co-ops or internships. Since BCIT are apparently ""known"" for their high hiring rates you would think that their co-op programs, and thus experience, is better than what you get from place like UBC or SFU.

I graduated from the 4 year Mech program and I have to say that BCIT's co-op program is definitely sub-par compared to other Universities. The biggest downside is that we finish our winter semester at the end of May while others finish in April. We get 3 months of experience as opposed to a possible 4. It also doesn't help that most employers looks for co-op students to start in April and if you can't then they'll pick the guy from UBC who can.
Oh and did I mention that we only get one 3-month co-op in our entire four years? Just one! Lastly, it doesn't help that there are very little jobs to pick from. A few of my classmates didn't even find co-op relevant to our degree. 
I just find it sort of sad how BCIT is claimed to be the school where you get hands on skills and then again, UBC has companies like Microsoft, Nvida, Tesla etc asking for co-op students. 

Any thoughts or experiences from people who took other programs?"

It was of course then that my younger sister had grown up. And out, in particular - despite still not being old enough to drive, she had a bustline that defied the lingerie available at Victoria's Secret and required that she go to specialty shops given the slimness of her frame and the ampleness of her breasts.

What surprised me was that wasn't the only part of her that developed above-and-beyond - while her 'special situation' was always something I'd known about since our parents entrusted me with that fact, I wasn't expecting that she was using my never-used Fleshlight (I found it too small), and that she was, as well, finding it too small.

Maybe we could give it a rousing finale together....

****************************

In short - looking for someone to play my 'little sister' in this scene. If you've got any questions, let me know.  I  basically imagine a lot of groping, kissing, frotting, and DPing a poor sex toy into its destruction for this one.

Cheers to all!

I'm excited to be heading back in August and was wondering if anyone has any tips on things I should absolutely bring with instead of trying to buy once I'm in Korea (hard to find items etc.) as I'll be here for at least a solid two years? Also, as I will be in Daejeon and not Seoul, what are some cool things I should make sure to visit/see while I am there? I explored lots of Seoul while I was in Korea last time, but am pretty unfamiliar with what Daejeon has to offer.

If any of you are currently attending KAIST I'd also like to just get to know some of you! (Had facebook link before realizing that isn't allowed so just PM me and I'll add you!)

Last week I accepted an internship offer with Samsung because I had no other offers at the time. However, today I received an offer with Qualcomm, with a position I'd much rather do, in a better city, greater pay and they are willing the pay for housing. This is a huge dilemma for me. Do I renege on Samsung, and go for the opportunity at Qualcomm? Or do I stick to Samsung and not burn any bridges? I've been weighing the pro's and cons of both and I'm having a really hard time making this decision. Oh, and Qualcomm needs to know by the end of today because tomorrow is their last day to submit paperwork for summer interns. Please give me your advice!"

I met a really amazing girl and was just generally in a place where nothing felt like it was going wrong, which was weird because it was winter/early spring and that's usually the height of my depression during the year. Now that it's summer, I've been depressed nearly every day over a multitude of things. At my school in Vermont I am required to have completed an internship by the time I graduate and every place I applied to either rejected or ignored me. In order to stay in my school-designated apartment, I had to have an internship, job, or take classes, so I signed up for summer courses but they wouldn't even let me sign up for the ones I would benefit from. I've been looking for a job but once again places have either not been getting back to me or claim to be having significant issues with my application, so I'm still out of work and at this rate likely to not find any work for the summer at all. I go to school for writing and none of the newspapers or publications in the general area are hiring or taking interns that write, which is really bothering me because my opportunities are so limited. I chose to stay here over the summer because I did not want to go home because none of my friends live there anymore and I live in the boonies where there is nothing to do, and I without fail become exceedingly anxious just being home because of all the negative memories I have from high school and middle school. I also started a YouTube channel a couple months ago for narrating horror stories but I've had no time to work on it with the building construction outside and my focus on getting a job and solidifying my summer housing. I'm just so sick of being so unable to sit back and feel like my life isn't falling to shambles. I'm terrified to graduate college as well because I probably won't see most of my friends again or much at all afterwards and I don't know how to make friends outside of a school and I need pretty regular interaction or I start to get anxious and depressed a lot more often. I'm worried that I won't even get a writing job out of college either even though I've been told the gaming and film industry are constantly looking for writers from various gaming majors at my school and teachers who have worked for the industry. I feel like I'm constantly disappointing everyone as well with no real reason behind it. I just want to fall asleep and never wake up, I'm so sick of nothing going the way I need it to lately. And I can't get my medication prescription filled again for like two or three weeks and I'm almost out and I don't know what I'm going to do without any medication for so long. I just want to fall asleep and not wake up."

I will graduate with both my BS and MSA - along with being eligible to sit the CPA.

For the last 10 months, I have been interning with a Fortune 50 manufacturing company. They recently made me a job offer as an entry level accountant, for almost $72K, with great benefits. They made this offer 1 year in advance of my graduation. The twist, however, is that I have an internship this summer at a Big 4 in Downtown Chicago doing tax. I likely will have the choice between the two companies, and I am perplexed as I am trying to rationalize this decision.

My concern is that if I start in industry, I will have less opportunities in the future. Despite the fact that The public accounting pays significantly less, around $55-60K, how quickly will it even out? The public accounting route attracts me with its prestige and big city promise. This other company is based in small cities and towns across the US and world. Both companies seem to offer tremendous opportunities for Accountants but I want what will be best for me in the long run.

I realize my problem is a good one to have, but it is haunting me. I have to make a decision by the middle of summer. Is $72,000 for my first year out of college too good to turn down? I am trying to be as open minded as possible.

Thanks for the help."

4k4g9x,3,2016-05-19,Who decides which votes to transfer in STV?,rationalities,HelloInternet,https://www.reddit.com/r/HelloInternet/comments/4k4g9x/who_decides_which_votes_to_transfer_in_stv/,"I know this is the HelloInternet sub and it is not an electoral system/political science sub... but let's be honest, there are plenty of voting nerds in here.

At my internship I was listening to the Flag Referendum podcast where Grey and Brady are counting the votes. During this, I was thinking a lot about voting systems and Grey's videos on them. There is one question I have had for awhile but have never asked. Here it is.

**Who decides which votes are transferred under systems like STV?** Here is my example (which is a bit extreme, but I could imagine a scenario where the calculations are more complicated but also more likely): we have 3 candidates (A, B, C), 2 spots, 100 votes (to make the math easy), and are using STV under Droop. So each spot needs 34 votes [(100/(2+1))+1, round down?]. Let's say after the first round before any vote transfers, candidate A gets 98 votes, B gets 1 vote, and C gets 1 vote. The votes look like so,

&amp;nbsp;

Votes

**Candidate A**

First Votes: 98

Second Votes: 2

Third Votes: 2

**Candidate B**

First Votes: 1

Second Votes: 49

Third Votes: 49

**Candidate C**

First Votes: 1

Second Votes: 49

Third Votes: 49

&amp;nbsp;

Obviously A gets the first spot. Now we have to transfer the 64 (98-34) votes to B or C. If the 34 votes we leave with candidate A all have candidate C as their second choice, then we transfer 64 votes, 49 being for B and 15 being for C, and after everything is said and done, our result would be A with 34, B with 34, and C with 32. However, we could have just as easily have gotten a favorable outcome for C by making the second preference of the 34 votes left with candidate A be for candidate B, making 49 go to C and 15 to B, leaving us with a final result of 34 A, 34 C, 32, B. 

All the examples Grey gives us in his videos (both the main videos and the footnotes) are pretty straight forward for the obvious reasons of simplicity and clarity, but STV seems to fall apart to me once the cases are not as clear. I am sure this has been discussed before but have not been able to find anything, probably not using the right keywords. I know this is a bit of an extreme example, but the mathematician in me wants to test all possibilities, especially the extreme cases.

Does anyone know have to reconcile this case? Am I overthinking this/misunderstanding STV/miscalculating?"

I'm in a whole jar of pickles right now.

I'm currently a student in the last leg of my program before I start an internship. Last month I lost my job, and lost a lot of income because of it (I was making close to $1200/month), and have been looking. I just got a job today after over a month of looking! But here's the problem:

They want me to start this weekend so I can be alone starting next week. My school runs from about 1-5, but they want me to work from 4-8. I didn't think this was a problem until my mom pointed out that it will take me an hour to get there, and therefore will only have 2 hours of class time.

But the biggest issue for me right now is that my boyfriend and I planned to take a trip up to his cottage this weekend since it's Victoria day on Monday and they told me I will be starting the job next week. We have been planning this for about 2 months, and when I got the confirmation that I had the job, they wanted me to start this weekend. I told them that I had planned this trip with my boyfriend and they pretty much said, ""Uh sorry, we need you to start this weekend because we have to train you to be alone next week.""

I didn't know what to say so I confirmed that it was okay (my mistake!) and immediately called my boyfriend. He was mad, and I got frustrated because I was just looking for advice or something but I didn't get much. So I called my mom after and she told me to just think it over. I also apologized to my boyfriend for getting frustrated at him but it seems like he really does not want to hear it.

I have no idea what to do. I have never had this problem before. I'm really strapped for cash, too, since I'm trying to owe the bank and government as little as possible. I have considered of going back to a job I had a year ago but that job just gives me anxiety and makes me feel awful, plus my grades suffered. I have also considered a line of credit, but I will have to talk to my parents about that first.

TL;DR; Got new job, want to start during long weekend when a trip was planned and was told I would start next week. What should I tell my new employers?"

I applied to a small startup company and after meeting up with the President of the startup, I realized that there were only 2 other workers in the company. This startup is a research company that was created recently. One worker is another student who is a mechanical engineer and the President described his role as more business oriented but would help work with me on the website. The other student is actually a developer and that student was the person who designed part of the website already. However, that student is going to be interning with another company this summer, so I will only be receiving directions/objectives/tasks/support remotely on the website. This entire website will be built on Oracle APEX.

From the current situation, it seems as if I'm going to be tasked with building the website almost entirely by myself with support from the other students. I'm nervous because I was looking for an internship where I could gain more experience working with mentors and experienced developers. Instead, I'm being tasked with building the website almost entirely myself. 

Has anyone been in the same situation? Any advice/tips on how I should approach this job? 



Is this even considered an internship anymore or is it more of an actual web development position? There was no mention of an intern role so I'm not sure how I would list this job for future purposes.

    
We are still discussing salary but I was told that it would be between $20-25 an hour. What should be a reasonable salary for this role?? I am located in Austin. 
    

Is there any material that will help me prepare for this role? I've had little experience designing a website for commercial use and I want this website to represent my ""computer science skills"" when applying to other jobs later.

TL;DR - Applied for internships, got a position as the lead developer creating a APEX website for a small startup consisting of 4 employees (including me). Any advice/tips/helpful words/bible verses so that I can excel in my position?"

But it's me at the end of the gun barrel this time. 
Broke up with GF of 1 year and a few months. She just stopped talking to me in favour of her new girl friends, after me going into an internship. Felt abandoned etc etc. When I tried to talk with her she said it was horrible stuff to read, and wouldn't stay to read, etc. 
The girl I loved was not giving a shit.

And so I left her. I was angry and sad at the same time. 
But I find myself fixated on thinking about us sometimes. Which turns my stomach, makes me uneasy, and seeing new pictures of her make me nervous, and queasy. Like when someone makes you eat a plate full of that food you completely hate.

And of course the sad periods. I've done the typical things, removed her from Snapchat, Instagram, deleted pictures, Skype, etc. Which was a major punch to the stomach. 

I'm so hurt, and when we last talked she seemed to try to make me feel bad, which she had done so many times in the past, and I'm aware of that, but it still hurts. 

How do I get over, or atleast, stop thinking about us, and such?

I'm already trying to go out more, I'm in a gym, try to go out with friends, ride my motorcycle, which it all helps. 

But at the end of the day, I'm sat here, at my PC. And just looking at the chat bar from facebook and seeing her name there makes me anxious. 

TL;DR Broke up with girl friend, want to get through it.

&amp;nbsp;

Current situation:  
I live in a low COL area, Lincoln, NE, about to be a junior in college (computer science). Turning 21 soon. Internship pays $20/hr. I work 15 hr/week during the school year (8 months) and 40 hr/week during the summer (4 months May-August). They have a 401k but no matching, so I just contribute to my Roth IRA Comes out to $2440 after taxes a month full time. The internship has been extended to May 2018 (graduation)

&amp;nbsp;

Here is my financial situation:  
Since I started working at 16 my dad has had a 50/50 rule. 50% of my paycheck is “his” (goes straight to my savings), 50% is mine, to spend on whatever else. This has stuck with me to this point. Right now the 50% of “his” stake goes towards being able to graduate debt free with his help, and pay for my rent ($800 a month). The reason for this is because my whole college cost is tuition and room/board. I pay full rent during the summer (they still pay for food during the summer) and the difference between my rent and a dorm cost w/ a meal plan during the school year. I do not have payments on phone, car, or car insurance. Basically, no bills until I graduate college.
I do not have a credit card and do not have any credit card debts/other debts.
Currently I have:

&amp;nbsp;

$3400 savings account  

$400 checking  

$2500 Shared savings (50% of paycheck goes here, the college and rent money)  

$4000 Roth IRA ($100 monthly payments set automatically at this time)

&amp;nbsp;

I want to take advantage of this “grace” period in which I have very little bills to pay for before I’m all on my own after college. I feel like I won't have many debts in the near future, I have at least $1000 emergency fund (should I aim for 3-6 months savings now?), I contribute to my Roth IRA (Should I try to max this out?). Any advice on where to go from here is welcome! Thank you"

We get along great and never have major disagreements. Rosie went to a different college freshman year, but she transferred to my school sophomore year and we decided to room together.

We rented out two rooms in a 4x2 apartment where we share a bathroom. There are two other girls (Alex and Mona) who live with us and share their own bathroom. Our lease was from August 2015 until July 2016. 

Half-way into first semester I applied for an internship and was accepted. The internship required me to move out of state for 8 months starting in January 2016. Rosie was super excited for me and encouraged me to go. I subleased my room (legally, through the leasing office) to an exchange student from South America, Polly.

From what Rosie has told me, Polly is quiet but very organized and a respectful roommate. Polly took over my apartment until the end of May. 

During the summer, lots of students sublease their rooms for one reason or another. There's a lot of supply and not a lot of demand so often times it's hard to find someone to take over the lease. Rosie posted a couple ads, but she couldn't find anyone, so she decided to post her room on AirBnB. Alex and Mona are planning on staying at the apartment during the summer, but when Rosie asked them about AirBnB, they said it was fine and Mona is actually greeting guests and cleaning up after them for a cut of the fee. 

Rosie's first gues is coming Friday and staying for 10 days. Polly told her today that she was uncomfortable having a man in the apartment and did not want to share a bathroom with him, or even be in the room next door. If Rosie cancels the reservation there is $100 fee.

I don't know what to tell Rosie in this situation. I think it's completely reasonable that Polly is uncomfortable having to share the bathroom with a stranger. 

Furthermore, I just found a girl to take over my apartment for the months of June and July, and I'm afraid she'll be scared away having to share a bathroom with random people. I can see why it doesn't bother Mona or Alex because of they don't have to share their bathroom with strangers and their bedroom doors lock, but I think it's unfair for the girls in my room to have to deal with it.

I know Rosie is doing this because she doesn't want to (can't afford) to pay rent in a place she's not living in. We live in a city with super high rent inflation so it's not just a few hundred dollars.

I don't want to damage my relationship with Rosie because she is my best friend and good friend, but I don't agree with what she's doing. It's a touchy subject because of the money. How do I tell her?

Tl;dr: Roommate wants to AirBnB her bedroom wich shares a bathroom with my room. I don't think this is fair to the girl living in my room, but I don't know how to tell her without damaging our relationship.


EDIT: Everyone is telling me to check the lease. I don't want to get Rosie in trouble, but I will go to the landlord if necessary. How can I approach her about this first without going to the landlord right away?

&gt; Imagine if your past 5 years of hard work were suddenly robbed from you…if your entire career and future were abruptly ruined. That’s what happened to my husband, Jun Yu.  Jun Yu explains more details of how his Ph.D was taken away from him in this [youtube video](https://youtu.be/fttvfg8ET_s).

&gt; Leading experts have concluded (see pages 21-36 in this public document) that Idaho State University violated standards in professional psychology (e.g., American Psychological Association (APA) Ethics and APA Accreditation standards) and academic norms. So what the document says is that Jun Yu was subjected to Aversive Racism. Whats that you ask? You can read more about Aversive racism [here](http://www.speakingofchina.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Dkt-24-1-Expert-Witness-Report-of-M.-Leslie-Wade-Zorwick._redacted.pdf?8f7a9c) , but its essentially this: *Aversive racism is essentially when people who claim not be racists behave in ways that end up being racist regardless.*

The worst thing about this case is [this](http://www.speakingofchina.com/justice-for-jun/idaho-state-university-ruined-husbands-future-please-help-us-right-injustice/#comment-148715): 
&gt; Yes, it is true it’s not just a problem of the right. In fact, the people who discriminated against my husband were in general liberal people who openly embrace social justice and diversity — yet this is how they treated a diverse Asian student. I’d also encourage you to read the aversive racism report on Jun’s case on the public record. (Aversive racism is essentially when people who claim not be racists behave in ways that end up being racist regardless.)

Heres a few quotes from their lawsuit.

* The alleged educational and professional skill defects cited as bases for dismissal are inconsistent with Mr. Yu’s prior accumulated record of grades and supervisor ratings over his first three years at ISU. 
* No evidence is provided to show that Mr. Yu was on notice regarding a risk of dismissal from the program for any reason
* It is clear that Mr. Yu suffered serious harm because of several significant ethically questionable behaviors at the hands of ISU faculty. These include failure of timely written notice of any inadequacies (if they existed), and failure to prescribe or plan remediation (if needed). The ISU faculty also appears to have failed to provide due process in the course of dismissing him, failed to properly assist him on internship selection, failed to warn him that he was or would be at risk of termination from the program, and failed to re-offer previously acceptable alternative internship placements (e.g., arranging a comparable training experience in China). 

&gt; It took Jun 5 years of hard work to earn the degree. But it only took the university an arbitrary decision to deny it. ISU has robbed Jun of his past achievements. They have stolen his dream of becoming a clinical psychologist. They have ruined his career and future

&gt; The legal fees have been substantial. In the past five months legal bills have ranged from over $12,000 in a month up to over $40,000 in a month. No, that was not a typo — over $40,000 just in one month where the legal team billed 124.70 hours and other expenses associated with litigation were accrued.

&gt; To add injury to insult, Jun is still making monthly payments on the student loans he took out for his education.

## Why should I help?

This shits not right , and any help from people who  are against this racist injustice  would be awesome for this AMWF couple , especially the Jun. His wife , is the writer of the blog at Speakingofchina.com , which is part of a community of blogs from women that are with Asian Men.  Lets support one of our own , because it could be you who had your degree and education taken away because you were asian.

4k64ow,22,2016-05-19,"Moving back in after college, parents want a ""re-entry"" conversation",McLysendorf,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4k64ow/moving_back_in_after_college_parents_want_a/,"I've lived at home during summers and breaks all throughout my college career. Each summer, my parents have a ""re-entry"" conversation, and this time it's more serious since I'm moving in indefinitely. Although my parents are not necessarily narcissists, I thought this subreddit might give me the best advice. 

First of all, I'm 22 years old, looking for a job, and not really financially stable. I'm dependent on my parents right now and I also really love them despite our many disagreements, so I don't want to sour our relationship too much. Still, I don't know how to really deal with their requirements for moving back in. 

First of all, I have a 10:00 curfew. It's not **technically** a curfew, but if I don't come in at 10 on the dot I get a multi-hour conversation about ""being respectful"" and ""being a part of the family"". They demand that I come in at 10 because my two dogs are loud at night, but my parents absolutely REFUSE to train them to be quiet because they want ""security"".  My dad also needs to get up early for work, which is how they decided on 10. After a lot of bargaining, I got approval to stay out past 10 two nights a week (including the weekends) IF I give a day or two of warning. I'm also not allowed to stay overnight with my boyfriend of almost 6 years. My mom mentioned that they might allow me to stay with him a night a two a week now that I've graduated, but this is not substantiated yet by my dad. Still, I'm not able to be out of my bedroom past 10 on the nights I am home. If I even shut my laptop or turn a page the dogs bark, and so my parents always pressure me to get to sleep by 9:45. 

Next, I'm expected to ""contribute as part of the family"". This means 7 hours of housework time on the weekends, not including time on my own room. I might have been fine with this, but I am a pretty clean person and once I'm moved back in my stuff is always put away. I essentially am required to clean up their messes. Furthermore,  my parents do not generally participate in this ""family"" clean-up time. Notably, this cleaning time is ""seven hours worth of work"", as determined by my parents and not necessarily just seven hours. My family contribution also does not include doing the laundry, doing dishes, or any regular chores. 

There are a lot of other similar requirements set out that are generally unspoken. I'm supposed to follow the ""spirit of the law"", and I'm not told what the ""letter of the law"" is. Furthermore, the ""spirit of the law"" changes according to what is most convenient for my parents. They also deny that these changes have taken place. I don't know if they're intentionally trying to gaslight me, or if they simply can't remember what they told me. 

I also don't have my license or a car if I need a break or just to get anywhere because they have historically refused to help pay for the insurance. I'm trapped. 

Furthermore, if I don't fulfill their requirements, I leave the family in ""bad standing"" - I don't get any financial help whatsoever. I have a lot of health problems, so health insurance is a big deal to me. 

I don't know how to deal with this whole situation. Like I said, I love my parents. I respect them a great deal. However, they are consistently unrealistic and over-controlling. I'm trying to put together a list of notes for our ""re-entry conversation"" (which usually lasts around 6 hours). Does anybody have any suggestions for how to deal with this or what to prioritize?

Edit:

After doing some reading, I want to provide some more background. I’m essentially the golden child in my family. My older brother ran away from home about five years ago, got on a bad path, and has fortunately turned his life around. He has been clean for two years and is learning a trade. I try to support both my brother and my parents and have lived my life as an intermediary between the two. It’s very stressful when my brother comes back home, as he will do once the summer is over, because I’m constantly the mediator.

As the golden child, I’m allowed certain privileges as long as I do what my parents want. The issue at stake is that in being an “emerging adult” (a phrase used by my school counselor and regular counselor) I am trying to gain independence. This creates friction.

I don’t have the opportunity to leave my place in good standing now and don’t want to sour my relationship with my parents. I do love them. **What I’m looking for here are suggestions for how I can compromise with my parents while I live under their roof.** I will leave once I have a job in my field and enough money saved to get my own place and my own car. Right now I just want to find a way to have some independence while keeping them happy.

I also said this in a comment, but my theory is that my mom feels like I’m neglecting her by gaining my own autonomy. She went through horrible abuse and neglect when she was younger, and bounced around the foster system for a while. Before she met my dad, she didn't really have any good relationships. I think she goes back to that place when I move forward with my life. I really want to be supportive because that sort of abuse can really mess up a person, but I also need my own autonomy.

My parents have a lot of requirements for my living at home, but sometimes they sabotage my ability to meet them. For example, it’s required that I search for a job from 9-5. However, my mom “needs” my help to do grocery shopping (and then takes five hours) or changes plans and takes up that time. When I haven’t met the requirement, then I’m the one in trouble. But when I don’t help or go along with her plans I’m “not contributing” and “disrespectful”.

I don't know what to do about this situation. I don't want/can't really move out, and I want to keep a good relationship with my family. I've had some great suggestions so far and would love to hear more. Thanks in advance!

**Update:**

Hey! First of all, I want to reiterate how much I appreciate everybody's responses. It's been a while since I promised an update, but it's been a process of figuring things out with my parents. I think we finally might have reached some sort of agreement. It's pretty complicated, so hold onto your horses!

My curfew/bedtime: 
I'm now allowed to stay out late two nights a week AND stay at my boyfriend's two nights a week. HUGE step forward, since last year my parents essentially threatened to kick me out at the suggestion. The other three nights I still need to be asleep by 10 essentially, but they've been better about me being in my room quietly. I'm pretty happy with this compromise. It's not perfect, but me being able to be at my bf's means that I don't disrupt their sleep when I'm home. 

Paying rent/bills:
As long as I'm making ""sustainable, long-term progress"" in my field, I don't need to pay rent or bills for a long time. This means that I'm now free to take an unpaid internship and get my foot in the door with my contacts. It'll be annoying to live at home longer, but I feel this is really a great thing. I probably will get a summer internship, like I have in the past, and broaden my skill set. Then I can move forward. This would have been impossible if I started having to pay bills after a couple months. Although the agreement gives my parents the upper hand if things go bad, I really like it for now. It's a great opportunity in the long run. I'm so down for this. 

Looking for a job:
I need to look for a job 9-5 (8-5 if I take an hour lunch break and breaks during the day). I'm allowed no real breaks and have no freedom to rework my schedule. This means that even though my mom still requires my help, I'm now allowed to leave before she can ask. However, It also means that I can't work her stuff in during the work day, I can't volunteer, do chores, or see friends during the day. This is really limiting and annoying, but I see why they want it.

Fortunately, after our talk, parents (mainly my dad) shifted their position on this a little. Now, instead of forcing myself to work the full day and drive myself to get really really sick as a result (reminder: chronic, unknown health probs), I will work as much as I can during that time and have weekly meetings with my dad. I will slowly increase my load until I'm working traditional work hours, which will help me to learn my  limits in a new way  - a way that college's flexible schedule couldn't.

The weekly meetings last two hours each, which will suck, but I keep on thinking that at least I will learn some great project management skills from it. Our first talk was today and it went well. I think it went well particularly because I am in the process of interviewing for a few internships and have been contacted about a job. Wish me luck!

My ""family duty"" of weekend cleaning:
My parents wrote out an extensive list of chores I have to do every week. At first I was really annoyed because very little of it was concrete (eg. help prepare for the bi-weekly maid vs. clear the floors and put things in piles before she gets here), but after a little talking we got some things nailed down. Furthermore, since I may not be home every day to, say, empty the dishwasher and check if the trash needs to go out, my parents are willing to compromise. Of course, this may play out differently than how we've conceptualized it, but hopefully we'll end up okay. I also have asked them to create a list of weekend projects since the ""ongoing"" stuff doesn't really count.

My mom is still being super passive aggressive (blaming me for fights with my dad over these clarifications, pointedly saying ""that's what family is - we help each other"" when she does something nice like put my cup in the sink, etc) and I don't think that's going to change. I'm learning tips and tricks on how to ignore passive aggressive behavior in order to avoid fights. I'm not perfect, but I'm making progress. For instance, the other night I offered to get her dinner. She said that she didn't want me to wait on her, and so I just said ""Whatever suits you"" and walked away - to her great frustration.

My dad is still be authoritarian and imposing. I also doubt that's going to change. Last week he essentially blamed me for my mom's health problems after she and I got in a fight, and demanded to know how I would change. I also know that notating what I do, exactly, every fifteen minutes is annoying, but it's better to just go along with it.

I understand that this is not the end. If I miss putting my dish in the sink one too many times, if I forget to thank them for a meal, or if I fail to get enough done on my job search, things can still go horribly awry. I'm still at their mercy, but I'm really happy we were able to work out what we have. 

I used a lot of strategies mentioned in the comments, and if nothing else appreciated confirmation that I should be willing to stand up for myself if I'm being controlled instead of supported. Due to the response from here, I've also opened up to a number of friends, and even practiced the talk with them. Thanks to your response, I have a great support network and (for now) an amiable agreement with my parents. I know this is super long, but you have no idea how much this impacted my life for however long I'm home - and my transition away from home. 

Again, I'm really grateful. "
4k66y1,1,2016-05-19,Just starting my new internship and feeling very inept compared to the other intern on my team...advice?,steelmen09,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/4k66y1/just_starting_my_new_internship_and_feeling_very/,"Hey there!

So I just started a summer internship at a large defense contractor, and my major at my university is computer engineering. I was moved last minute from a firmware position to a software engineering position to fulfill a need within the department and I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed. The other intern on my team is a CS major and knows a lot more than I do and it's obvious, especially when we're having these meetings with our team leads and he asks all of these specific questions and I just sit there dumbfounded. We're coding in C# and using Windows Forms to put some finishing touches on a fairly simple application and using version control (which I've never worked with.) While I'm proficient in C, I'm now spending time outside of work trying to catch up with Object Oriented Programming since this codebase we're working on is 200,000 lines and I'm totally lost. I told my leads and my manager that I have a pretty steep learning curve considering my background is only in C and on lower level projects but that I'm a fast learner. I'm trying to focus on my little accomplishments and working my way up from there, but it's hard to stay positive when my team member is operating at a much higher level than I am and making it very obvious to the team leads and our manager.

I guess what I'm asking is, do you guys have any advice for me? How can I help myself standout when the other person on my team is so much more advanced?"

Right now I am all over the place. But all I know is that I really want an internship for Summer 2017, and I don't know if I should continue to specialize in c++. Is it a good idea? since the web app market is so vivid and the C++ market seems very niche.

c++:

1. Basic games with the SDL Library. I made this to prove I can use current tools, but I am not very interested in the game industry. 3 fully fledged basic games.

2. Basic image processing simply using the standard library. Creating and parsing bitmap image files.

3. Basic image tracking with OpenCv in C++ using generic webcams.


C:

1. A profiler application that given an arbitrary set of parameters generates a simulated cache. It uses valgrind generated trace files to analyze cache hit or misses. It helps measure performance of memory heavy applications. And its 100% accurate.


IOS apps: 

0. Something related to a course I'd be taking soon. 

Relevant coursework:

(By the time I'd be applying not counting what I am taking in this fall or spring 2017.) 

1.  Intro to Security
2.  Data structures obviously
3.  Systems and Architecture (the class where you learn Assembly).

I find joy in almost anything I do. I want to hop in a stable and hopefully rewarding field. Which is why I worry because most of my peers are getting into things that are internety. Websites, web apps, wordpress plug-ins etc.  I and I lack in knowledge about networks and databases. Halp."

4k6iki,15,2016-05-20,Double Agent,TheWritingSniper,BlankPagesEmptyMugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlankPagesEmptyMugs/comments/4k6iki/double_agent/,"**[WP] You are a professional assassin for the CIA. But you are also a double agent. One day, you are assigned with killing a foreign agent. This foreign agent is your other alias.**
__________
""I want confirmed kill in twenty-four hours, understood?""

I sat completely still on the other end of the line. It was secure, as was all of my communications with the CIA, but this one was the most important call I had ever received. ""Understood, sir.""

""This is *the* target we've been hunting for the past twenty-two years. You remember him I'm sure, he disrupted you in Venice. He's finally slipped up.""

""I'm going over all of it now, sir. The file is secured.""

""Good luck.""

""Thank you, sir.""

I hung up the phone with a satisfied clunk and took one of the longest, and deepest, breaths I had ever taken. It had been a long time since I heard the name that my *Commander* had just spoke on the phone. Even longer since I even cared about it. And yet, here I was, with the file a few feet from my feet, delivered by an unsuspecting intern, in a brown manila envelope.

I was in South America. On a mission to make sure a drug deal in the area went sour, which would ultimately end in the entire area spiraling out of control. I had already seen parts of my work begin, with fires spreading and civilian evacuating. I was done. And my next mission was to be all that bigger.

I had been with the CIA for twenty-seven years, acting as a professional assassin for the better part of the last two decades. Highly trained, extremely dangerous, and in any part of the world at any different country. I already knew where I needed to go when I heard him tell me the name. I wasn't looking forward to it to say the least. To be quite honest, I wanted to go home and visit my family in America.

But orders are orders and I as grabbed the envelope off the floor I knew this order was going to be the hardest one to accomplish. I slid my finger under the seal and opened it in one swoop. The file was thin, only a few pages. *Nikolai Vinokurov*, former KGB agent operating in South Korea during the Korean War, who went off the grid after that. The file didn't contain a photo of him, but his trail had slipped up. 

In South America.

Convenient.

I skimmed through the file. All of it was still there. The only addition they had added to it was an addendum at the end of the last page, after classifying him as a priority target. I read through it once.

*Transmission intercepted in Brazil on July 17th, 2017. Encryption was heavy, but trace contains Russian backwater company located in the city. Most likely used as a proxy. Mission Alert: Target location identified.*

I had screwed up. I, of course, needed to send my superiors the mission details of disrupting the drug cartel; one in which they had long agreed was necessary. But I had messed up. The proxy wasn't secure or I had used the wrong pass phrase with the Russian business. Ever since the dissolution of the KGB in the early 90's, the general pass phrases and such just seemed like ordinary conversation to other native Russians. I had lost more than half my contacts in those days.

Now, I must've lost more. And I knew if I had messed up here in South America, it would seen be traced. The age of spies had ended long ago and I was lucky enough not to end up on the chopping block like the rest of my comrades. I had survived all of it. The Red Scare that lasted well into the 70's and 80's. The age when spies became obsessions in pop culture. The age of information. It was all in my past and as far as I knew, I was just about the Russian's last spy in the CIA.

I had considered giving it up. Just abandoning all transmission sources with the KGB and the Intelligence Service in each decade. When the times got tough. Russia was as much my home as the boat that took me to America when I was a teenager. The *real* Nikolai Vinokurov had died in South Korea, and I was called upon to take his place when I was only twenty. I had grown up in America, played with Americans, dated Americans. Hell, I had married an American. But I was always loyal to the Motherland. I was always a compatriot in their fight.

When the other spies began to be outed, when men and women I recognized from training were shown in newspaper and TV I panicked, but I did not slip up. I faltered, but I did not lose the fight. Yet now, holding Nikolai's file in my hand once again and seeing everything they said *he* did, and not knowing all the things *I* did as him. Well, right then and there I knew. I wasn't a Russian. I was an American.

Faking a death would be easy. We were trained how to do that long ago. But I didn't want to fake *my* death. I didn't want to fake Jeremy White's death. I wanted to kill Nikolai Vinokurov. I wanted to finish him and be done with the spy life.

I wanted to go home and see my wife and kids. To say hello to my neighbors and cut my lawn. I wanted to smell the fresh air of America because it was the only air I had memories in. Russia, it was just a figment in my mind. My home country yes, but not my country. Not my people.

As I stood there, in that shotty little South American apartment with Nikolai's file in my hand I realized something. Something I had realized a long time ago but never wanted to admit I think. I knew, then and there, that the world didn't need spies anymore. Countries didn't need double agents. Countries needed peace; and the people just needed to survive.
__________
Definitely went a different direction that I intended and I'm not *exactly* sure how I feel about it. I like the idea of a spy abandoning his post, but I also think there should be repercussions ya know? And I'm not sure if I fully got across how he started to think about everything.

I don't know. Let me know what you all think.

Thanks!"

4k6mrp,19,2016-05-20,Help: Does going down the RE(FI) route make sense for my situation?,l0stintheclouds,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/4k6mrp/help_does_going_down_the_refi_route_make_sense/,"First, let me apologize for the wall of text below. I have read the FAQ and will try to follow the posting guidelines.

A bit about my situation first:

* 27, M, Greater NYC Area (not inside city limits)
* Savings: ~230k USD in savings accounts
* Investments: Old 401k with 25k. Current 401k with 20k.

Income:
&gt; * Salary only. Total comp (all cash, no stocks, pretax) was 225k last year. Should be 240-250k this year. I think I can increase this by ~15-20k per year on average if I keep performing and don't get fired.
&gt; * Misc interest/dividends: 100? Should be on DRIP. 

Expenses:
&gt; 
&gt; * Rent: 2300 all included for a 1bdrm.
&gt; * Gym: 100.
&gt; * Phone: 75.
&gt; * Internet: 60.
&gt; * Groceries: 250.
&gt; * Eating out/Entertainment: 300?
&gt; * Commute: 100
&gt; * Random online purchases: 400?
&gt; * Travel: 500 (This is a yearly average and something that I don't want to compromise on for my own sanity).
&gt; * Total: ~4000

I don't have a car and paid off student loans from internships, so I think I've been very lucky so far.

With the various FIRE calculators I've found online, I think I can reach FI comfortably with 1.5M of liquid assets, which at my current savings rate is attainable in ~7 years. 
Also, the 230k in savings accounts seems weird, but I've always worked in an industry with very restrictive personal investment options, so I'm trying to figure out better ways to park the 230k of savings instead of letting it bleed from negative real interest rates in savings accounts. My current employer has less restrictive rules, so I can perhaps move them to fixed income products. I don't really want to get into commodities or fx, which I have no restrictions on. I'm wary of the unusually long bull market we've been in though, so I have no problem sitting on cash for another year or two.

Ok, so now for my real question. I realize that I've been very lucky and fortunate to be in this situation. It was a lot of hard work and also a lot of dumb luck. My problem is that I don't really know what I want to do with my life. I certainly don't enjoy my job and can get very stressed out from it. However, if I were to find 1.5M on the street today, I'm not sure what I'd do with myself. For those of you that are further down the FI path - is this something you figured out when you started out, or did you only figure it out after reaching your FI goal?

While I don't think I'm doing a great job at saving, I think I'm doing a decent job at keeping my expenses reasonable. However, I am not really enjoying life right now. It's just a lot of work, stress, interrupted by occasional boredom. Now, I don't think I could spend myself happy, but I think I might become happier if I move to e.g. Manhattan. This could push my rent above 3000, and would likely triple the amount spent on my commute and double the eating out/entertainment expenses. That would bring my monthly expenses above 5000. Add city tax to that and it'd get close to 6000. I'm having a hard time deciding if that's worth the chance of having a somewhat more interesting social life and thus making life more ""enjoyable"" if you will.

One alternative for me is to buy a car. That'd extend my choice of things to do where I live by a lot. I live in a decently suburban area, but haven't bought a car yet since I live very close to the train station and can take the train to work. This would be a lot less expensive than moving to Manhattan.

The other choice that I have is to continue down my current road, work hard, and hopefully become FI and find something less stressful to do when I'm 34. Somehow that doesn't sound so enticing as it's 7 (boring) years away. 

Please poke holes in my thinking and show me the light. Is there something I am missing? Am I missing an obvious third option? I'm having a hard time ""thinking outside the box"". Any general life advice would also be highly appreciated!

Thank you for your time"

4k6szj,1,2016-05-20,Yalgobaoth,TwilitKing,TwilitKing,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwilitKing/comments/4k6szj/yalgobaoth/,"##**History**

Yalgobaoth has not always existed in the same way as the interns had found it. It came into existence about the same time that the universe began, but only started to have any sort of activity about the same time that humanity began to arise.  It used to be very much like the Gehenna of Hebrew tradition, as in it was a plane of unending fire where some of the souls of wicked humans would end up and be burnt away until nothing remained at all. Some clever wizards even made Yalgobaoth into their own personal dumpsite. Even with this plane of seemingly unquenchable flames something would sometimes be left over, and these pieces would lay the groundwork for the formation of Yalgobaoth proper.

At first, it would be an island of rock and metal mixed in with the burning souls, only for it to be melted back into the flames. As time passed though, these islands would become more and more cohesive before they began to cover Yalgobaoth for the most part. With these lands formed, the wizards’ dumpsites ended up bringing more and more substance to the plane, with waters forming and mixing with the soul remnants to create Aqusía. Eventually even life began to brew on what would have been a plane of oblivion and punishment, with some things from Earth being incidentally transplanted to Yalgobaoth in some fashion.

At first life on Yalgobaoth was simple, but something about the nature of humanity’s souls prompted the growth of intelligent life. There was also some failed Golems that were trashed by alchemists that landed in Yalgobaoth and acted as sorts of ascension devices (think 2001 Space Odyssey’s Monoliths), but not in the same sense that they just triggered evolution but more like guided the early Baothians into using tools and magics. Through the Golem’s guidance, society quickly formed and began to match that of Earth at the time, which is to say very feudal.

About the same time as Baothian society had solidified, Golems acted as the kings of manors and had tense negotiations among each other. A small war here and there for mining sites of Psyanimite or the other soul infused ores. They collectively agreed to place a ward over Yalgobaoth to prevent magic from coming through, that way so nothing could challenge their rule over the Baothian society. It worked fairly well, and the Golems got to keep their disputes to fairly petty things instead of worrying about a new Golem or creature trying to overthrow the status quo.

Unfortunately, their barrier was imperfect, instead of blocking things from entering Yalgobaoth, it acted more as a filter, catching whatever tried to pass through and leaving it there to degrade and fester along the sort of magic mesh. Sometimes these rotten blobs would leak into Yalgobaoth because of it, with whatever sentience remaining in them becoming almost entirely malefic and corrupted nearly anything it touched, leading to the creation of several monstrous individuals of Baothian history. 
One of the more notable instances was the corruption of Ika, who was originally the patron Golem of a small and edenesquely kept kingdom of Iksand. He often used his gardens to host meetings with the other patron Golems to show off the pristineness of his lands, and used the wealth he had to buy out other kingdoms for protection. Early in an evening of the 1000th Spring, Ika was struck by one of these blobs and felt as if his metal body immediately being corroded by the sludge as it warped him. His once pristinely kept body cracked open all over into ravenous maws as his mind was consumed with a vile hatred of the world and a desire to consume all. Unfortunately, he did not lose his mind entirely, as he knew he could not merely eat everything, so he used his magic to make himself look whole again and organize a meeting of the four strongest patron Golems and also warped them the same sludge until they kneeled before his rule.

In less than a few months, all of Iksand had become a corrupted place, with fiendish Baothians and Golems growing in strength by the day. The kingdoms set up by the patron Golems were falling apart, and many Golems worth their salt in magic escaped the realm of Yalgobaoth to evade the disaster. This left only the Baothians and the corrupted Golems left in Yalgobaoth and it seemed like all was lost until a hero by the name of Parbelo trapped Ika in a suit of armor and sealed his compatriots and their corrupted lands to allow none to come or go. Parbelo took the title of king after this victory and took the Castle Along the Blue Sea and began the Parbelo line of rulers.
Under the Patron Golems, the Baothians were only allowed to use the magics and technologies that the Golems allowed and were not allowed to develop those beyond what they were given. Seeing that the only reason that Yalgobaoth avoided destruction by Ika’s hands was because of using these forbidden magics, one of King Parbelo’s first acts was legalizing the development and usage of any magic or science. When combined with the secret magic and information that the Golems had been hiding, Parbelo’s kingdom was able to go into a period of flourishment and prosperity that had never been witnessed before, nearly matching that of Earth at the time (about 1700 AD), but with magical innovation replacing where humans had developed technology.

Emperor Jeizabela marked another strife-filled point in Baothian history, as she disallowed the free usage of magic. She had a reason for doing this of course, as her advisors had led her to believe that there would be an attempt to overthrow the government if such an action weren’t taken. After having such an engrained part of their society taken from them, the kingdom couldn’t avoid the revolt that bordered on civil war between the two factions. The rebelling faction would eventually choose to leave the mainland of Yalgobaoth and traveled across the Blue Sea. The aftermath of all this led to the ruler’s choosing to have their officials and advisors chosen by the public through elections.
It took that conflict in order to spur Yalgobaoth into what most would call the modern era, with a bit more implication of technology in the lives of the Baothians instead of the heavily relied on magics. While at first people were slow to associate technology with magic, they quickly began to when magitechnicians began combining magical ideas with scientific discoveries. It was during this era that the first factories began appearing to create and combine magic into physical materials and creating fuel sources by infusing magic into crystals and harnessing them.

Tragedy next struck with Prince Plagé Parbelo’s reign when a royal archiver by the name of Ariados discovered the origin of Yalgobaoth and the Baothians. The very idea of their entire realm being made of the dead of another world, and even they themselves being made of the very same and needing it all to survive felt utterly wrong to him. He wanted to destroy all of Yalgobaoth in order to escape what he thought would be an affront to all life, so he developed a weapon (which he named the Fang) that would break apart the souls from Yalgobaoth and restore it to its fiery state.

The artifact was a failure fortunately, as it only slowly warped the lands of Yalgobaoth instead of completely destabilizing them. This led to the creation of the silver mountains and caused the desolation of the Royal Road as well and costed Yalgobaoth countless lives. The Fang of Ariados was eventually sealed in the tallest spire of Castle Along the Blue Sea after a final confrontation with Prince Parbelo that costed Ariados’ and Parbelo’s lives as tribute for the sealing spell. Yalgobaoth would be saved, but Marinia Parbelo would be forced to ascend to the throne and the Castle Along the Blue Sea would still be under the influence of the Fang, causing its already bizarre architecture to become nearly intraversable even for its denizens.


##**Government**

Very simplistically, Yalgobaoth is ruled by a monarch who has advisors that are elected by the civilians. This monarch gives themselves a title when they ascend to the throne generally, but no two monarchs are allowed to share the same title and the currently used titles are as follows: King, Baron, Monarch, Queen, Emperor, Empress, The Lion, Princess, and Prince. Additionally, rulers are only allowed to have a single birth to avoid conflicts of interest in allotment of power. The current ruler Mariana Parbelo, does not have a title as she was unprepared to suddenly take the throne from her father after his passing. Rulers are able to instantly and fully install new laws whenever they please, but on lower tiers (basically going State, Province, County, and City) officials are allowed to set their own laws and decide how they are set. These lower tiers are generally elected positions as well, but some are based around lineage and competition.

With Emperor Parbelo, magic usage became much more restricted as a safeguard for her citizens. The restrictions made it so that only individuals with special permissions (law enforcement, development mages, and those with special situations) would be allowed to freely use magics that had been labeled Tier 2 or higher. Later on this would grow to include physical and hybrid weapons of Tier 1 or higher, though with slightly laxer requirements needed to be met to successfully get a permit for Tier 1. Some districts would decide to strengthen these restrictions of course. Other laws are logical, do not steal, do not murder, do not attack people for no good reason, things that lined up similarly with that of Earth’s.

Punishment depends on crimes. Imprisonment is generally handled by lesser districts, but it is not the common option, with most assigning community service instead for misdemeanors. For felonies, imprisonment is avoided altogether for a rather new alternative. This alternative punishment is the application of a mental magic to seal the criminal inside their mind for a period of time (relative to the seriousness of the crime) where they experience the same suffering they’ve inflicted on others approximately once per week until the sentence is fulfilled. While the criminal may feel as if they have spent months or even years, the actual length of time is only a couple seconds at most. This Mind Lock was developed to aide in the rehabilitation process by taking as little time and resources of the government as possible.

##**Culture**

Baothian culture is an odd mixture of magical reliance, a pseudo medieval government, and Nuclear Age ideals. While the technological level seems to be on par with Earth of the 1950’s, it is actually a mixture of magic and technology instead. In a similar sense, because of the long time reliance on magic, several scientific advancements that took place on earth never happened on Yalgobaoth. This is especially true in the realm of ailments and chemistry, where diseases and mental illnesses are handled through spells or enhancement crystals and chemistry is circumvented by the usage of alchemy. Along with this, things like guns and vehicles and factories look different from how they would on Earth, not totally different, but just enough to be very noticeable. For example, some guns look more like the retro future style (with tubes and containers connecting to magical sources) instead of how they would look.

The government was mentioned in the other section, but on a more local level places are going to seem more like a township democracy with elected officials. Some more rural areas may have slightly more meritocratic or feudal set up however, where those with the most ability to protect the community from being attacked by roaming creatures. Due to Prince Parbelo’s actions however, many of these creatures have been captured or killed or sealed away in the forbidden land of Iksand. This has led to said communities experiencing a shift towards the more urban councilships. This is not to say that there are not still some meritocratic set ups in place, especially in mining communities where the head of the operation is more often than not also in charge of the town.

In urban and suburban areas, lifestyles are close to how Americans lived in the 1950’s where Baothians are encouraged by their own competitiveness to pursue bigger and better things. This also means a very consumer driven culture where people work long hours to earn pay raises and bonuses in order to purchase big houses and expensive luxuries. Unlike in America, instead of strictly physical sports being king competitions hybridizing magic and physique reign supreme in mainland Yalgobaoth. Baseball is still popular though, though there is some controversy related to players using enhancement crystals on themselves and their equipment.

##**Boathians**

Yalgobaoth’s dominant form of life are the Boathians, which like everything else in Yalgobaoth are the product of the remaining scraps of some of humanity’s crueler souls. This combined with the golems influence caused the Baothians to be very human, but with some key differences. If all humans are considered to have some sort of spark for magic, then Baothians are born with a raging fire, and magical ability is as natural as eating and breathing is for them. Unfortunately, these raging flames lead to magical accidents in about the same way that human babies have diaper accidents, but a bit more explosively. They also have diaper accidents like human babies, to be clear. Thankfully, from the sheer lack of control that they have and the relatively lower amount of power babies have, these accidents just cause some small cracks or dents in furniture or appliances or flooring. Also like in humans, magical ability is something that comes with a certain amount of natural potential, but can be trained into something greater.

It may come from their origin of being made from the dark side of humanity, but Baothians are close in appearance to demons. Skin tone can range anywhere from a ruddy red and purple and pink colors to char black or bone white. They also have inhuman eyes, with much larger irises and pupils so that sclera can hardly be seen, and some having only orbs of color for eyes. Boathians, like demons, have horns and they can be shaped like antlers (deer- and antelope-styles) or like traditional horns (ram, bull, water buffalo…) or can be nubs. A few Boathians also have tails or cloven feet, but are in the major minority. The following quality is more because of the environment, but could also be seen as demonic, heat below 2000 C° does not really bother them.

Many Boathians have some of disorder based on region however, but the usage of Enhancement Crystals allowed them to get around their problems. Some are essentially mandatory, like numbing the violent tendencies in a community where people are too close and the damages could be very high, but others are more cosmetic or luxurious in nature, such as increasing physical abilities or making oneself more romantic for a partner. Recently though, Enhancement Crystals and their usage have been looked at with more scrutiny after reports of the Vin Ohn Governor was discovered to have used the Crystals to force a woman into being his perfect wife (The Mind Lock procedure was not used as his punishment due to foresight, and the governor was actually chosen for execution for such blatant violation of a person’s rights). Going off of this, the application of Enhancement Crystals is a permanent procedure for any but the most minor Enhancements.

Strangely unlike humans, Baothians have not had true superpowers form in their population. The usage of magic could easily be called a superpower of course, but it is not out of the ordinary among them, so to call it a power would not be accurate. This may in fact be because of their reliance on magic and alchemy, which caused physical adversity to be low enough that it fails to truly trigger anything wondrous from happening.

4k6vz3,1,2016-05-20,F4M - Celebrity wins hot vacations,[deleted],AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/4k6vz3/f4m_celebrity_wins_hot_vacations/,"""By ""raffle"", I won a trip to special vacation resort. This resort is unique because it’s ONLY for couples and no one seems to know much about it, as people who won tickets have to sign nondisclosure agreements. But the rumor is that it’s really great, and most importantly one of the most exclusive in the world. I really want to do that trip, but have nobody to go with, so I ""catch"" you and drag you into it so I can go.

In that resort, a lot of activities are organised for couples. We quickly discover that some are mild, and some aren't at all. Romantic dinners, massage lessons with other couples or just the two of us, sexy cooking lessons, but also more kinky ones. Moreover, some employees can give dares to couples every time they see them, from kiss and grope each other right here (“here” being anywhere from an empty corridor public places)or skinny dipping to have sex in that place without getting caught (or make sure you do get caught by somebody). Each couple can choose anytime between 3 categories and activities and dare at the beginning of the day, but won’t know any details until they start. You can be an employee or a fan, or some rich friend and you have to act like your bf. At the beginning You'd probably kind of shy/nervous because of all of this, hanging out and pretending to be with THAT celeb's boyfriend. On my side I'm having a blast, enjoying myself and keeping us from all the things you'd love to try.

And from here, the scenario can go differen ways depending on what you want to do, your kinks &amp; limits… So let’s discuss it

Do youstart to enjoy yourselfself and we both start to take part is more and more daring activities? Do you figure out that you can take advantage of the situation, start to get more and more touchy every time you can? Trying to get us into the hottest activities, and if I refuse to play along threaten to expose us as a fake couple? Or maybe you start to even blackmail me after getting some serious leverage, and get me to do everything you want.

LOTS of possibilities, with either a young celeb and an older employee, assistant, agent... Or an older one with the new intern or some fan she randomly picked, I'm open to suggestions !

**Our Relationship:**

My best friend (Red) and I have known each other for more than a decade. We became friends in middle school before we moved to America. I moved into her place in the US after I graduated senior high school and she’s been nothing but caring and supportive. She has helped me when my family was going through a tough time by buying groceries and just treating me well. We talk about everything, but sometimes it’s very hard for me to tell her how I really feel because she becomes very passive-aggressive and won’t bulge until I apologize, so I tread carefully around her. For example: a long time ago, she was mad at me for something I promised I was supposed to do but didn’t do; she would write a note on my door telling me to not bite the hand that feeds me. I really do feel that I owe her a lot for the 2+ years she’s taken cared of me, so I really choose what to say to her. I currently live with my boyfriend[28M] (Blue) and our cat[1.5M] (Tea), in the same city as Red.

**Introduction to the Issue:**

She became an intern at a zoo in another state last year and worked there for three months. During her stay, she befriended a stray cat (Cookie). She told me all about him and how she really wants to bring him back to our city after her stay. There are other resident cats at the zoo, but since one of them do not get along with Cookie, the zoo would have to let Cookie go if Red couldn’t take him with her. Blue and I rented a car and drove 10+ hours to the zoo to pick her and Cookie up because we really want to help her. We got them back to the city and everything was fine.

A couple months later in March this year, she told me she’s going back to the zoo to intern because they were short on interns and she was bored of having nothing to do in the city (she didn’t get the internships she applied for). I offered to catsit for her since she’ll be back in June. She has visited us with Cookie before and Tea seems to not have too much problem with him. She said she’ll buy the food and litter for us if we ran out. Then she left.

In mid-April, she told me she’ll have to stay at the zoo during the summer too, since there’s no downside to that. She said she’ll fly back here during the week of my birthday in May and she’ll take Cookie back with her. I thought, okay, good, because a lot of problems showed up between Cookie and Tea, and it’ll be best if Cookie leaves soon. 
What Blue and I noticed is that Tea becomes very alert and skittish when Cookie’s around. Tea became more distant towards Blue and I. 

Cookie on the other hand, is a sweet and attention-seeking cat, but he’s been eating a lot (even Tea’s food), he peed on our bed a couple of times, and he and Tea play-fight too aggressively, to the point that Tea bled near the ear and had to see a vet for a scratched eye. I’ve kept them both in the living room and closed off the bedroom, because we can’t really just close off Cookie, since the litter boxes are located in the guest bathroom. Blue and I miss having Tea sleep next to us or even being affectionate towards us.

**The Issue:**

After a while, Red texted me and told me that one of the interns that’s coming to the zoo to work during the summer season is allergic to cats. She becomes hesitant whether or not should she bring Cookie once she comes back in May. I told her to really ask the intern if he’s okay with a cat around. Sometime later, she showed me an email sent from the intern saying that his allergies aren’t trivial and a little interaction with some cats can cause him to go into sneezing fits for up to 2 days. Other cats, he can interact without an issue. He tentatively said it’ll be fine for Red to bring her cat to the zoo. Red added on that he needs allergy shots and it sounds like a big deal to her. I said, “Well, what are you gonna do, will you try?” She said, “What do you mean try? I can’t send Cookie off if it doesn’t work out.” I don’t want to tell her straight on that I’m sick of Cookie, so I told her that it’s an issue since she planned to only be there till June, because Blue and I have made travel arrangements with Tea during the summer. She just said that she’ll pay for a sitter or boarding place while we’re gone for 10 days in July and 3 days in September. I said, “Alright.” Since she said to not make any reservations yet, she’s still trying to figure things out; I thought she might be able to take Cookie with her eventually. 

I did suggest to her that she could probably keep Cookie just in her living space at the zoo dorm, but she told me that she can’t control him and that Cookie goes where he wants.

It’s May and Red’s here with us right now, staying at our place for a week until she needs to leave again. I am afraid of her reaction, so I dropped some comments on how Cookie is making Tea colder towards Blue and I; how Cookie eats Tea’s food and it’s hard to control him. How originally, Blue and I planned to adopt a dog after Cookie leaves because summer time is perfect for us to bond with the new dog while I’m not in school. She just says, “Ha! Wait till after Labor Day! I’ll be back then!” or just generally tell me that Cookie does/goes where he wants, shrugs. 

I’m so scared of how she’ll respond if I just seriously straight on tell her that Cookie is making it difficult for Blue, Tea, and me. I talked to Blue about it and he asked if he should be the bad guy, I said that Red would know I’m shifting the responsibility to you. Also, Red and Blue doesn’t chat too often, since Red and I usually chat in another language. We’re planning on talking to her about it tonight, but we don’t really know how to address it to her.


/R/Relationships, what would be the best way to tell Red we don’t want Cookie here anymore without causing her too much trouble? 


**TL;DR**: BF and I have been catsitting for my best friend since March. She was supposed to retrieve her cat in May/June, but now she’s keeping him with us till September because a person at her workplace (out of state) might be allergic to her cat. Her cat is making our cat colder towards us and other problems; we don’t want to catsit till September. I’ve owed her a lot in the past and am scared of her reaction if I told her the truth. BF and I are planning to tell her how we feel tonight. What’s the best way to tell her that her cat is causing us too many problems and we don’t want him here anymore?

as the title suggest I wan't to know what are my options when it comes to intern-ship,recently I have seen some post regarding some dude asking for intern-ship help and I tried a lot to find that post but couldn't ,so instead I posted a new one,people often talk about paid intern-ships,there are into this kind of shit ?somehow I cannot digest the fact why do I need to pay to work in a company? I admit through some bad decisions I ended up in a private shit engineering college and now I have to pay to get a good internship program? WTF!

well sorry I didn't even said in which period of engineering I am,well I am about to attend the 5th sem of the Computer Science engineering and meanwhile my prime focus is Web Dev,since a week I have started web dev course from youtube and yeah I am pretty much getting myself acclimate to the new concepts of CSS the header and footer today I started with bootstrap,from one year now onwards I can vouch that I will be good in Web Dev well not the best but good.And I guess I am about 1 year away from the period where I have to apply in different companies for intern-ship.

I am really freaked out because I don't know how I will get good intern-ship since I have already ended up in a mediocre college,I can do almost anything to get a good intern-ship,what are some good platforms to get a good opportunity?

is there an entrance exam to intern-ship,is web-dev an okish skill for intern-ship or do I have to expand my knowledge-base? do I have any chance to get a intern-ship in some start-up companies?"

I found an internship in a society working for new technologies (connected glasses allowing technicians to be in real time communication with expert a bit like teamviewer...).
I haven't really got much training from the company who hired me as intern and I don't really have anyone to ask programming questions to. 
So far I got told that my mission would be to ""develop an app that allows people to detect POIs like Layar for mobiles""

So me and another intern working on this project guessed that the simpliest way to do something satisfying would be to use the Layar SDK to develop the app (since we guess our superior wants to have virtual reality included to detect nearby POIs via camera)

My problem is that my Android experience is very basic (made a game applications with Android for a class so I know a bit of the basic and have used Android studio)  and I had never really used any GPS/map using app, so I checked few video tutorials but many of the things that were used in those seems to be decrepated &amp; API 23 permissions makes it really annoying to test app on my AVD.
What I am looking for is somewhere (or someone) to ask questions to that could be extremely basic and that could answer a few of them regularly (not always), Stackoverflow etc seems to be more of a site where you'd ask one question on a very particular matter and less questions about ""what is the best way to implement a solution for this problem"" or less ""newbie/stupid"" questions, if anyone has an idea what I could do, I'm a bit lost and as I said I don't reallu have someone to ask questions to in my internship."

and I wanted to make an application (for an internship I'm currently doing) that more or less does what is shown in this tutorial (basically I want to use my phone's camera &amp; augmented reality to get icons showing the direction of nearby POIs that I would find in a database.)

As a newbie, I'd like to know if this is manageable only with PHP (and Layar) or if there is need to add any Java code to manage the map geolocation functions etc...?

Also if you know any alternative method that could allow me to have my phone's camera show the direction of nearby POIs let me know !

4k8u3s,176,2016-05-20,A Goodbye,ravenpride,TagPro,https://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/comments/4k8u3s/a_goodbye/,"I know this post is pretty long, but I sincerely believe in the importance of its message and spent a substantial amount of time putting it together. If you could take the time to read it in its entirety rather than playing one more pub, it would mean a lot to me. Thank you.

---

Like many members of this community, I began spending a notable amount of time hanging out around TagPro because it filled holes in my life that needed attention. The fall of 2013 was my first semester of college - a time that marked the end of my competitive debate and tennis careers that died when I graduated from high school. It also was a period of time in which I was almost completely alone, as I essentially left all my friends behind when I moved away from home. Without the competitive and social outlets I had grown accustomed to for years, I found a temporary home in TagPro, which I discovered on November 27th, 2013.

However, online communities and games are merely temporary bandages; they cannot serve as permanent solutions to gaping holes in one's personal life. As my time in college wore on, I slipped into a depression that became more and more severe. I was taking classes I didn't care about for a major I hated, had a minimal number of friends despite my once-social persona, and constantly worried about grades that didn't satisfy my perfectionistic tendencies. For many stretches of time, thoughts of suicide were a daily occurrence. On top of that, I was diagnosed with moderate-to-severe Crohn's Disease at the end of 2014. The disease added to my already-crushing fatigue, and a reaction to the medication I was prescribed even left me unable to walk for about a week. My grades took a hit, and my self-esteem tumbled. My depression deepened.

At some point, I realized that my situation would not change in any meaningful way unless I took deliberate steps to dramatically alter the course of my life. However, because of the huge amount of pressure I felt from both myself and the people around me, it took me an embarrassingly long time to work up the willpower to right the ship that is my life. I think, though, that I've now reached that point. Over the course of the last month or so, I've dramatically altered my study plans, started dating the nicest and most supportive woman ever, and (just yesterday) landed a dope internship that will occupy most of my time this summer. The next step in that process is leaving TagPro.

For a long time, TagPro was an excellent way for me to escape from reality. Now, it's little more to me than a major source of negativity. Certain players, many of which I'm forced to interact with on a daily basis as a captain and a member of the CRC, seem to have taken it upon themselves to spread as much hate and vitriol throughout the community as humanly possible. Some of them act the way they do because of unpleasant circumstances in their personal lives. Some of them are trolls who actually enjoy upsetting other people. Some of them (one in particular) care so much about winning and so little about others that they routinely abandon all kindness and decency, causing others to [suffer](https://i.imgur.com/Kh7qKlh.png). These people know who they are. Their fellow players do too. These people are the reasons why the positive impact spending time in the TagPro community has on my life no longer outweighs the negative impact it has.

I call attention to these things not in an attempt to paint myself as a perfectly kind vanguard of moral justice; I'm fully aware that some of you don't like me, and I totally understand why that's the case. You got to know me in the most miserable ~2.5 years of my life, and as a result, not every one of you is going to come away with a positive opinion of me. Rather, I want this post to be a wake up call. More than likely, the people you talk to in game and/or on Mumble are going through some tough shit. Don't be the one who dampens their respective moods. Don't be the one who pushes them over the edge. TagPro would be a much better place if everyone made a conscious effort to [remember the human](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1ytp7q/remember_the_human/).

Thanks for reading, and keep on rolling.

4k8x6b,3,2016-05-20,25 y/o Lost College Grad with a Passion for Music at a Crossroads,ta123789456,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/4k8x6b/25_yo_lost_college_grad_with_a_passion_for_music/,"I’ve got some things I need to get off my chest and just get down onto a damn page.

I’m at a place in my life where I feel lost, unsure of which path to take on the crossroads I’m currently at. I quit my last job 3 months ago because, although it paid well, it beat the hell out of my body and I’m still feeling those effects today. So I had to get the fuck out of there. I’m 25 and still living at home and I desperately want to move out and become self-sufficient. I also have a lack of real friends that I can lean on and confide in. This has made me consider going to either grad school or to community college to study/get training in something that would help me land a decent job while enabling me to meet other people roughly my same age and connect and build new relationships. A kind of two-for-one deal.

I’m not sure about much in my life at this point, but one thing I do know is that one of the most important things in my life is creating music and sharing it with other people. I’m in a band that will be playing our first shows in the next month and I’m super fucking excited about that because I feel most alive when I’m sharing music with other people. I enter this space where I’m not able to think about past regrets or get caught up in anxiety about the future, but live directly in the current moment and that is sublime.

Anyway, on to my current options:


1.) If I went to grad school, I would like to go for an MS in Environmental Science since I love learning about nature and geology. My reservations about this plan come from a few things: I have no prior science experience working or academically – my undergrad was a BA in Economics, so I fear I would have a hard time getting hired after I graduate. Hopefully I would be able to get some experience during my grad studies as an intern, but I’m unsure. This path would mean at least another year and a half of staying at home while I take the science pre-reqs I need to get into grad school (I would be willing to work some during my time doing this, but I don’t want to have to juggle full-time work and full-time school). I feel out of my element doing this because I don’t have any idea what I would write my thesis about either. But maybe that would come as I study in the program. Another downside is that there aren’t many geologist/environmental jobs in my area, so I’d likely have to move away and leave my band behind. Being in a band and making music is one of my biggest dreams, so this would blow. Financing it isn’t a huge concern because I’d only be looking at about $10k in loans – still, it’s debt and that blows.

2.) Another path I’m considering is doing a 10-month Dental Assisting program that would set me up for a decent job right out of the program. Some DA jobs don’t offer benefits like health insurance/401k/etc. and the pay is on the lower end ($35k median) so there’s the downside to that. But it would allow me to move out and have a stable job in 1 year. That’s what is really attractive about this option. Plus, I would have some option for moving up – becoming a dental hygienist for one, which makes double what a DA makes. I’d most likely be able to stay local and close enough to my band to practice and play gigs around town.

3.) Going to community college and getting an AS in computer science. My job prospects would be good, along with the social aspect of meeting others and hopefully forming new friendships. Comp sci is not something I’m particularly passionate about, but it would be a good skill that would help me land a decent job while I move out and live my passion of being in a band. Downside is this would take about 2 years to do – 2 more years of living at home and feeling like that weirdo who’s 25 still living with his parents.

Right now I’m really leaning towards the Dental Assistant option because the work sounds somewhat interesting, pay is decent enough to allow me to move out and become independent, and I’ll most likely be able to stay local, close to my band. I feel like I’m being pulled in so many different directions right now and it’s all so uncertain.

What would you do in my situation?

Which is to be expected when attending a 4 year college. My situation is a little different; I am 29 (I know, a little late to the party but still) and I work full time in technical support and am getting my bachelors degree in Software Engineering from Arizona State online. Due to working full time already I don't have the ability to take any internships, and being that technical support does not really relate to SE. I am concerned I am not going to have the resume to get interviews for a programming position when I am out of school. Obviously I plan on working on side projects and projects for work that I would be able to put on my resume. But big picture should I be worried about attending classes online combined with not having any internships? Should I be doing something more to help my chances down the road?"

How has it helped you?",95shane,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4k98or/successful_entrepreneurs_what_was_your_major_if/,"There's a lot of debate about majoring in STEM (eg engineering) simply because of job prospects. There is a lot of controversy over this as well because a degree doesn't guarantee the job (most of it comes down to networking, internships, projects, extracurriculars, etc. just like any other job).

And the fact of the matter is that none of that convinces me anyways. Because I don't want a 25+ year career *working for someone else*.

Is it worth majoring in something you like (which *could* be engineering or *could* be philosophy, for example)? Shouldn't college be about an education, networking/connections, critical, analytical, creative thinking, and learning about yourself -- how to meet deadlines, how to learn, how to prepare, etc?

For those of you who now run or in the past have ran your own successful business(es), how has your college education helped you? What are your thoughts?"

And welcome to the premier online airing of Channel 20's 24-hour Wasteland News Network. If you're just joining us, I'm your head anchorperson Buck Johnson here to keep you up to date with the latest happenings in these obliterated United States and if we can manage it, the world!

So let's dive right in shall we? Our top story tonight is the touching reunion of a father and daughter. One-year-old Artemis was traveling alone and unsupervised in the woods one afternoon when she came across her long-lost biological father known only as Spootin. Onlookers later reported that while they did not witness the event itself, they were sure that had they been there it would have been sufficiently awkward for everyone involved. Here's Patricia Pattingston with more, Patricia?

Thanks Buck. It's like something out of the old world Disney classics that we all knew and loved: Flash-grown test tube baby identified only as Artemis was reported several days ago to have met the father she had never known. It seems that the head of New America had impregnated Artemis's mother only to leave her with the task of raising twins while he carried out his affair with a young FCC Smith defector. Artemis is reported to have grown up alone and ""generally disliked"" save by her twin brother Ares, before moving to the Confederacy in Massachusetts. It was there that she finally came face to face with her mothers baby daddy. 

Fascinating stuff Patricia. Now tell me, has abandoning his twin genetically-altered children at an early age and having a relationship with multiple women at all affected Mr. Spootin's electability in New America?

Well Buck, word coming out of Los Vegas is that in spite of these numerous personal scandals Mr. Spootin's popularity with his people has remained surprisingly high. Particularly amongst New America's military personnel, which as you know Buck, comprises at least half of the country's population. When presented with photos our interns managed to take of Mr. Spootin's baby mama walking both children in their toddler stages of hyper maturation alongside a dangerous mountain lion in a clear case of reckless endangerment, many NA citizens commented that the picture looked ""badass"" and ""super-f#cking cool. Way to go boss"". One respondent even told our reporters in Vegas that he was surprised to learn that Mr. Spootin had children to begin with and that he would be paying the new family a visit very soon. Back to you Buck.

Thank you Patricia. We now go live to our on-sight reporter Scott Cassedy who is attempting to interview Mr. Spootin personally concerning his criminal negligence and his most recent attempt at healing his shattered family. Scott, what do you have for us?

""W-wha? Who are you? M-My name's not Scott, it's-""

Now Scott, I'm told that when you attempted to approach Mr. Spootin and his illegitimate daughter that Spootin's personal Reaper guard opened fire on your news team and are now hunting you for sport like an animal. Is that correct Scott? 

""News team? What? Wh-who are you people? How did I get here? I remember going to bed, a-and then someone told me to ask someone something. What's going on?""

*Buck nods head appreciatively* 

And Scott, what can you tell us about the appearance of Artemis? Has her time in the forest affected her appearance at all? What was she wearing?

""I-I don't know anyone named that. I'm sorry. Where am I? Wait, what was that? *sounds of gunfire* Oh my g-aieeeeee!""

Scott? Are you still with us? Scott?

""*Pant, pant* they're-they're coming. I can hear them. I-I think my arms been hit... Loosing allot of blood. What did you do to me you son of a bitch? How did I get here? Who the hell are you people?!""

Well it looks like I'll have to check back with Scott at another time. Though let it be said that the opinions discussed here are not necessarily those supported by Channel 20 News and its associates, you family friendly friend in the post-apocalyptic age. *looks at watch* Well, I think that's all the time we have for today folks. Stay tuned for more juicy updates on the situation in the Spootin family. But before we go, Patricia can you tell them what to expect when we come back?

Sure can Buck. Later at nine: shocking sex tape is released by American Remnant President Bill Jameson after our interns installed a hidden camera in his train car. Here's a quick preview of the tape. 

*image switches to a grainy video feed showing the darkened interior of Jameson's personal car. Lights come on. A woman holding a bath towel over herself steps out of the shower on the far side of the room. A figure in the bed rolls over to see to her. Towel starts to fall.*

Thank you Patricia, that promises to be some stimulating news indeed. This is Buck Johnson with Channel 20 Wasteland News Network, signing off. "

4k9wb8,1,2016-05-20,Question about my decisions and how it affects my job outlook,MoWards,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4k9wb8/question_about_my_decisions_and_how_it_affects_my/,"Hey guys, getting a bit panicky and wanted some advice from you guys. So after I graduated high school I went to a state college for a liberal arts degree. I didn't really want to do stem stuff for a living back then and wanted to explore life if that makes any sense. I just finished my second year at the college and took a few CS classes and FELL IN LOVE. I love coding and what you can do with it. So because I wanted to switch majors but after only taking non stem classes I realized that I would have to stay another 4 years to get my BS is computer science. The tuition is crazy high and taking on 6 years of high loans seems crazy. So I thought about it and decided to go to a lower level state school (SIUE) that is an ABET credited school so I can take on less loans and graduate a bit early. So my questions to you are a couple things:

1. Did I make a stupid decision going to a lesser known cs school? It is next to the st. Louis area so a lot of internship opportunities get offered to that school but the quality of the education is obviously a bit lower. Some people have told me that ABET doesn't matter at all and that school ranking matters a lot, while some people have said that ranking doesn't mean Shit and that after internships and showing your skills it doesn't matter much in terms of having good salary and job prospects. Just wanted to get you guys' opinion on this.

2. Will employers not like the fact that I didn't pursue cs from the start and that i went to another college for a liberal arts program? Unfortunately even though i got great grades in math,science in high school i didn't really think at the time that I wanted to do it. Will employers look at my age of entering a cs program and think I'm not passionate as people who started cs degree right away?

3. Should I be thinking about a bubble burst in the cs world? It seems like everyone is getting paid so much off the bat that I'm getting worried about the future of salaries and job outlook in cs. I heard there was a crazy burst near the 2000 era and I am worried about that happening again.

4. Because I am going to a not amazing ranked school for cs, how will it work against the supposed outsourcing to other countries for cheaper pay? I heard that companies are starting to outsource code to India for lower pay and am worried that my college not being high ranked will hurt my chances of getting a job.

5. Am I too late for a successful career? I look at people who start coding at a young age and can't help but sigh in frustration. Not only am I starting college again at the age of 20, but I'm not going to a top school but a lower level state school. I feel like i will be so behind the curve that I will end up unemployed after I graduate.

6. How does cs transition into other industries? Even though I like coding and all, as a guy who originally wanted to pursue a major in political science I still like the idea of working with people as a living. Does cs degree anchor me to a programming job or have people found transition into other industries easy and smooth?

I apologize for the long worded questions but I am in a bit of pickle in terms of choosing my direction in life and wanted to know from you guys, how is life of a cs graduate from a non top cs program? Thanks guys."
4k9xo1,1,2016-05-20,"Me [19 M] with my ex-GF [19 F] of one year, recently broke up because of long distance, her grandfather was just diagnosed with late stage leukemia.",youngandconfused11,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4k9xo1/me_19_m_with_my_exgf_19_f_of_one_year_recently/,"Hey /r/relationships, I've lurked here a lot, but now I need some help dealing with everything. I'm so lost and confused, and this is was my first serious relationship. I'm using a throwaway and have changed names for the sake of privacy.

**Background:** Ashley had a crush on me throughout most of high school, but was always in a relationship with someone, and I generally wasn't looking for any relationships. Finally, right around spring break of our senior year when we were both single, I decided to act on our mutual interest in each other and asked her over to my house. My parents were gone, I lost my virginity to her, and then after a couple months of messing around I asked her out officially because I couldn't ignore my feelings anymore, even with college looming so close. Her boyfriends before me were assholes who were abusive and constantly cheated on her, so I made sure to be the best boyfriend possible to her, and we loved each other very much (still do). One more thing that I should mention is that during the first week of our freshman year, when she was at a university that is an 8 hour drive from mine, we tried breaking up but were both too lonely so we decided to try out long distance.

**The Relationship/Breakup:** The whole long distance thing stressed me out. I'm currently going to college for a degree in Software Engineering, and the time and effort that it requires is insane. I constantly felt bad when I couldn't give Ashley the time and attention I knew she needed, but she's a great person who understood that I was struggling. All the while, I felt that both of us were changing and going separate ways in life, and the only thing holding us together was our past. Don't get me wrong, she is a kind, caring, and intelligent person, but generally the reason that people do long distance is because they can see themselves winding up together one day in the future. Every part of me wants to commit everything to her, but something is holding me back. For example, when I brought up the fact that long distance was stressing me out, Ashley mentioned something about looking back at our lives when we were 60, and I froze. I panicked. I'm simply not ready for that level of commitment, and by continuing our relationship, I felt like I was committing the rest of my life to Ashley. Hell, I don't even know if I ever want to get married, but I know she wants to get married as soon as she can. And for those reasons we broke up.

Right now we're in a state of limbo. We're both back in our hometown, living 5 minutes away from each other, but we can't be together. We're both miserable. I'm between school and the beginning of my summer internship, so I've been going to the gym every day and have been trying to hang out with friends, but everything still hurts. As for her, we were planning on spending the summer together, going to concerts, taking trips, and I was going to help her with an online Calculus class, but now all of those plans have gone to shit. Ashley decided that it would be best for her to move back up to her college town to do her class because she said that the only thing here for her in our hometown is me. So that's that. She's going to leave in a week, and we'll be out of each others lives.

**The Problem:** Today, the third day after the breakup, Ashley sent me a text that her grandfather, who pays for her college tuition, was just diagnosed with late stage leukemia. She didn't know who else to talk to, so she texted me. Guys, I feel so god damn bad for this girl that I'm trying so hard to get over. No one deserves something like that. All I want to do is run to her, hug her, and tell her everything will be okay, but I can't. I refuse to let myself play with her emotions. We've already broken up and gotten back together once, and nothing will fix the issues I have with juggling a long distance relationship and my education, which is the single most important thing to me right now. I just want the girl I love to stop hurting.

What do I do? Do I stay away from her? Do I try to help her through everything or cut contact completely? I know /r/relationships likes to tell people to go no contact, but I think she might need me. My goal here isn't even to make things easier on myself, I want things to be easier for her.

   
**tl;dr**: High school girlfriend and I tried long distance, it didn't work out, but we still love each other. She's moving away after our breakup, but just found out that her grandfather has late stage leukemia. I don't want to make a shitty situation that got shittier even more shitty by doing something that could hurt her more."

4ka9cc,19,2016-05-20,Me (28F) with boyfriend (30M) of 1 year. Boyfriend is using his PTSD as a crutch and an excuse to not grow up and get a job,throwawayy83787,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ka9cc/me_28f_with_boyfriend_30m_of_1_year_boyfriend_is/,"I (28F) have been with my boyfriend (30M) for about a year. Literally the first time we ever spoke he divulged to me that he has severe PTSD, anxiety, and depression caused by the fact that when he was younger his father was addicted to drugs and has since tried to kill himself on several occasions, including once just a few years ago where my boyfriend found him in bed after slitting his wrists.

I felt very sympathetic toward my boyfriend and don't doubt that these events significantly impacted him. There are certain aspects of his personality that are very clearly scarred by his past, but lately I have been feeling like he uses his father-issues as a crutch and as a way to manipulate people.

For example, my boyfriend cannot keep a job. He is educated and has a masters degree in psychology, but he is 30 years old and the only work experience he has ever had is a few (3 I think) internships that each lasted about 3 months and were mandatory for school. When we first met he was doing an internship but ended up quitting because he said he was going to have a mental breakdown because of all the anxiety it caused him (it was a twice a week unpaid internship where he literally just sat at a desk and did research all day).  

He guilt-trips his mother by telling her that she ruined his childhood by not leaving his father and that she needs to make up for it now, so while he sits at home doing nothing she works a full-time job and gives every penny she earns to him. I realize the way she enables him is part of the problem, but I don't feel like it's my place to do anything about it.

Up until now the work issue wasn't a huge deal to me because he always paid his half of the rent and bills and I assumed his mom was just helping him out until he finished his unpaid internship. Now I've come to realize he has never once in his life financially supported himself, and on top of that his mom just had surgery and can't work for a month, meaning he won't be able to pay his half of rent, bills, or anything else and I will have to cover it for him. I'm put in an uncomfortable position because if I don't help him out rent and bills wont get paid, but if I do I feel like I'm enabling him and letting him think that this is ok. 

I told him I wasn't happy about this and we argued, and I got a little nasty and made a comment that he is 30 years old and has never had a job. He responded back with an equally nasty comment that he didn't get to grow up like a privileged spoiled brat like I did and I should have more sympathy for him. FYI- I had a normal childhood but my family didn't have a lot of money and we had our issues like many families do, I appreciate that I have a good family but I was by no means privileged or spoiled.

Anyways, I am wondering two things. First, how should I deal with the current situation where I am expected to support him financially while his mother cant? Obviously I'm not going to give him spending cash or anything, but what about rent and bills that have to be paid? Second, am I wrong to have lost sympathy for him? I feel bad that he has had a tough past, but a lot of people have issues in their lives and most of them are still able to function as normal adults.

TL;DR Boyfriend is using his PTSD as a crutch and as an excuse to not grow up. Not sure how to deal with it.

4kachv,2,2016-05-20,"I'm married, but I have feelings for my best friend",throwaway_26729,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4kachv/im_married_but_i_have_feelings_for_my_best_friend/,"I've been with my wife for 8 years now, 3 of which we've been married. Right after we got married she started grad school, and it's been a rough road during that time. She's always busy, and often times chooses to hang out with her other friends instead of me. I'm very introverted and am usually happy to keep to myself. My closest friends are still my college buddies, none of who live nearby anymore. She has become very close with one of her male peers (I'll call him Randy). They are both outgoing and like to go to bars and parties.

About 6 months ago, we met a new female grad student who was just starting (I'll call her Jenny). My wife and I became friends with her and began hanging out. Both of them share a lot of superficial interests, like anime and pokemon kind of stuff. Jenny really looks up to my wife as sort of a mentor.

From the moment I met her, I was drawn to Jenny. I was really impressed by her personality. I began trying to get my wife to invite her to hang out a lot, and eventually I got her number so I could talk to her directly. Normally I'm extremely slow to make new friends and let people in, but with her it was the opposite. Whereas I'm usually drained by social interaction with people, around her I felt energized. She almost seemed like the female version of myself.

We quickly became good friends and began to text a lot. We started hanging out more and more, often times just the two of us. I had her take the MBTI and she got the same type as me: INFP. I felt like I could related to her better than I could with anyone else. She's an introvert, and she's very kind and considerate, almost to the point of being comical. For instance, when I'd give her a ride somewhere (she doesn't own a car) she would thank me like 8 times for it.

We took up roller skating together, we went to a concert together, she tried psychedelics for the first time with me, we went on a road trip, we hang out and do art together, we hike together, we cook meals together a lot. I took care of her one night when she got too drunk and lost her keys to her apartment. We've seen each other or texted every day for the last several months. I'm so excited about this friendship, I feel like a kid again.

It's been tough on my relationship with my wife. As you can imagine, she feels jealous about my friendship with Jenny. Now it's awkward when the 3 of us hang out. I feel like my wife tries to dominate Jenny's attention and take control over the situation. They are still good friends, but they don't really communicate that much other than sending each other cute pictures of animals.

My wife and I have grown quite distant over the last few years. About 4 years into our relationship, she cheated on me, sexually, with another guy. I was devastated at first, but I forgave her. The problem is that I have had a hard time trusting her since. She is very outgoing, but very insecure, and she can be borderline flirtatious with other guys, especially when she gets inebriated.

When she became close with Randy, I had a really hard time with it. I was jealous a lot and I didn't like how much they hung out or how she acted around him. I feel like at some point I just realized that either I could worry about it, or I could just let her go and not care anymore. And I guess I chose the latter.

This is the part where I really need to get it off my chest. No matter how much I try to deny it to myself, I have to face the truth: I have romantic feelings toward Jenny. I feel like I can't tell anybody else because I'm married and I'm not supposed to have those kind of feelings for anybody else. I still care about my wife a lot, but I'm not sure if I still love her.

I don't know if Jenny has romantic feelings toward me. If she does, I'm positive that she would not act on such feelings or reveal them, because that's against who she is. But she does want to hang out with me all the time. I'm fairly sure I'm her best friend right now. I try to analyse her behavior a lot to figure out how she feels about me, but it's impossible to tell. When we're at social events together, she doesn't interact with me much. Sometimes it feels like she's avoiding me.

My wife has an internship for the summer 6 hours away. She leaves in a week. I'm planning to go and visit her every few weeks. After the summer, my wife and I are planning to move somewhere else so she can start a job in her field.

Jenny and I have are sorts of fun plans for the summer. I feel like I'm marching towards a cliff. I don't know what's going to happen. I'm afraid if I tell Jenny about my feelings, it will ruin our friendship, and I would rather have a close platonic relationship with her than a nothing. I'm so anxious about the thought of having to move away from her. She's a beacon of light in my life, and I haven't felt this alive in a long time.

I hate myself for becoming so cold toward my wife. I feel like an asshole. Or maybe a coward. I know I need to make a big decision. Either I need to focus on my marriage and cut ties with Jenny, or I need to admit to my wife that I have feelings for another person and that I don't think we should be together.

It's probably not hard to guess which one I want. I want to be with Jenny. But I'm scared of what will happen once I admit it.

I'm sorry this is so long. I guess that's the point here is to get shit out. I feel so ashamed for the situation I'm in, and I'm not even sure I want to submit this. I don't think I want any advice, I just wish I could talk to someone about this without feeling judged. If anyone read this, thanks for listening.

edit:

There's a few details I forgot to mention. My relationship with my wife was my first major relationship. She had one major relationship before we met. Jenny has been in one major relationship that ended badly a few years ago. I'm the only person she's told about it.

I don't think anything has happened between my wife and Randy. But I do think she has some degree of romantic feelings toward him. I don't think he has any feelings toward her. He's in a long distance relationship and will be leaving this summer to go live with her."

But I'm honestly not sure what to expect from the interview. I've read CTCI for Software Engineering roles in the past but not sure how this role differs. Should I prepare in a similar fashion. The recruiter gave me some tips and there's a few things on there that I've never even done (like networking and Linux).

Just a general idea of how to prepare would be awesome.

Nervous, excited and full of hope.",stexasguy27,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4kaeg0/ready_to_start_this_journey_nervous_excited_and/,"Hello. Thank you for taking some time to read my post. I'm at work right now, which is a blessing because a lot has been going on in my life and it's a miracle they let me keep the job. 

Drinking started for me in college. I messed up with community college right out of high school, so I didn't end up going to a four-year university until I was like 22 years old. That meant I was the guy invited to all the parties. I used student loans to finance new friendships built around drinking and parties. At first, it was just every Friday or Saturday, usually after a football game. People started to stop by to hang out and for the first time, I kinda felt like one of the cool kids. Of course, a lot of them were just there for the free booze. Anyway, I liked the way the alcohol made me feel and how people thought I was so funny when I was drinking. I have sort of a cheery personality and I really bring out the good jokes when I have the drinks flowing. 

When I would go home to visit my parents, we would all drink and relax and celebrate being together. It made drinking a totally appropriate and acceptable behavior in my eyes. Why not? Mom and dad are relaxing. I'll join in as well! Then my grandma, a good time in the family circles, came to live with my parents. That made me want to go see them even more. Grandma was a total hoot and we really started laughing when I would see her. Grandma had alternate versions of every story we had heard a million times. However, it was always funny and I loved being with her.

After I left college, I moved to a nice city with a lot of nightlife and young people. I was alone and broke and staying in the worst apartment, but I was doing an internship so I figured it wouldn't be this way forever. Drinking helped when I was feeling down, or feeling great really. There was just always a reason. Friends would come to visit and we would, of course, go out and drink. They started to come to town every weekend and it was the same thing every time. My student loans were gone, but we had one guy in our group who kept the rounds coming,

It started to get hard not to want a drink before bed. That was going to be expensive, but in college, I had found this cheap stuff at the gas station that did the trick. It was just enough to give me a buzz and get me to bed. I started to pick one up on the way home each night.

One was good, so two would be even better. That was okay for awhile, then I started to crave three. Three is where it's at right now. My friends moved away, so I don't have them to go out with. That was the first time I decided to go alone. I was trying to grasp that feeling I used to get with my friends. I figured I would just keep drinking until it came back somehow. I discovered Long Islands. Don't care for the taste, but it wasn't really what I was looking for. I just wanted - needed - that old feeling again. 

In November, I went to see my parents and grandma for Thanksgiving. My mom at this point is also an alcoholic, but that wasn't a problem really in the eyes of the rest of the family because they didn't know and when they did see mom, it was always for a celebration. When I got to the house, it was like 7pm.  Mom was kicking back enjoying a Miller Light and both of my grandmas were having some wine. Mom started to get a little loopy and argumentative. Grandma had grown tired of these fights and she decided to take a walk to the lake. Mom eventually ended up going in her room and I went to see where my grandmas were. We I went outside, grandma was walking up the hill breathing heaving. I asked if she felt better and she started really grasping for air and tried to run up the hill to a swing in the lawn. She was having a heart attack. My other grandma ran in and got mom, who is a nurse. We started CPR but it was too late. 

I had lost grandma, my favorite person in the world, on Thanksgiving after a drunken fight with mom. My world was crushed. I didn't know what to do. I turned to the liquor store as an outlet. 

Last week, mom had a heart attack. The whole family flew to be with her and I think it was really an eye-opener for her. She's happy to be alive and will be starting treatment after she gets out. 

I'm working on stopping. I have counseling lined up for the grief and depression. I found an AA meeting to attend right by my house. I just think it is time to stop. I've been reading the AA Big Book and reading SD and it's helping. I'm trying to mentally prepare myself for this life-long process of recovery to begin. I'm tired of feeling down, shitty, anxious, stressed. I'm tired of the health issues. I'm tired of acting like an ass and blaming other people for my issues. I'm ready to stop having to sneak empties out of the house and get to the liquor store by 9pm and organizing my commute around whichever beverage I might be in the mood for. I'm ready to get my blood pressure under control, get my liver back into shape, get my stomach to stop hurting.

I'm ready to start this journey. Nervous, excited and full of hope. 

Thanks for reading. Any comments and encouragement is appreciated. "
4kajfi,6,2016-05-20,[Question] What imaging/provision tools can I learn at home?,[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/4kajfi/question_what_imagingprovision_tools_can_i_learn/,"I'm a student doing an internship at $Corp this summer. I haven't started yet, but in my free time I want to start learning imaging/provision tools for Mac/PC that I can play around with home. I have 1 cloud server and the ability to create VMs on my Macbook. Any suggestions are appreciated.

I started learning Ansible/Linux Sys Admin (I only know a minuscule amount so far) but I think I am more interested in workstation provisioning. Hence this post.

I come from a very conservative family and am currently in college. In college I've been suffering from academic failure - just last semester I was on academic probation and I've seen more C's in the last year than I had in all of my elementary education. Last year I started have some serious depressive ""episodes"" (not sure what to call them) and so I went to my school's mental health program where they essentially said I probably have depression and to see someone professional and that they can't help because they're understaffed, underpaid, overworked, and overwhelmed. It seemed to get better a little bit after that so I wanted to wait it out and see if the summer would help. It didn't. 

If anything it's worse than before. My father is aware of that meeting and the results of it, but neither of my parents are particularly helpful - they're suffocating me. My entire college career has been filled with self-doubt, this feeling of almost panic attacks coming and going, depression, and the insecurity of not having any close friends who understand. I need to find someone professional to talk to, but don't really know how to go about doing that - my school's organization doesn't seem like it'll be helpful and my constant moving around due to school, home, and internships makes it so that I won't have a steady relationship with any one psychologist. I'm not sure what to do and I'm really scared.


EDIT: Thanks for the responses. I'm going to do some research and see if I can find someone for next week and get some type of roadmap going. "

I love the interface and I really want to have a linux distro on my laptop.    
I have 4GB RAM is that ok?    
I also pretend to use it for this tasks, tell me if it is good enough:  
- Twitch streams and azubu;  
- Youtube videos;  
- Spotify online or the software;  
- Watch movies and tv series online;   
- Gaming (I heard linux is not really good for this one :/);  
I also have nvidia GPU and intel CPU.  
More questions:  
- Is it easy to install?  
- Is it easy to get around?  
- Is it easy to install apps?   
- Best browser on elementaryOS?  
My two last requests:  
- Can you guys show me how you customized your desktop?  
- I heard/saw in other posts about LOKI can someone explain me what LOKI is?  
- Also what's a LIVE CD exactly and how can I use it?  
I posted this in elementaryOS subreddit but they haven't answered and it's been 50 mins. I'm slightly in a hurry because I don't have much time since I'll be an intern in a company. I kinda pretend to install it this weekend :/."

She's going back to her native country to do an internship but will be back to finish school here in the U.S. in September. I feel a bit lost and alone. We were always there for each other and now that she's back home, it's become different. I know that four months isn't THAT long of a time but she's my first serious girlfriend that I've had. I miss hearing her laugh, the intimacy, my best friend. We both talked about how we're going to make it work and we're going to video call and text every day. I feel like this won't be enough as we typically can't go a few days at a time without really missing one another. 

How can I keep a LDR from fizzing out?

4kazt4,1,2016-05-20,Quantitative role for a finance major that doesn't want to be in finance?,jonnyske7ch,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/4kazt4/quantitative_role_for_a_finance_major_that_doesnt/,"Hi guys/gals,

I'm hoping you may have some advice or could point me in the right direction regarding a role to pursue. I'm asking here first because I have a general direction but don't want to waste any time if someone else knows what I'm looking for.

Quick background:

I just graduated from my university with a degree in business administration and a concentration in finance. My previous work experience includes retail (cashier), intern at a medical device startup, and my current internship as a growth marketer at a fintech startup. I have the opportunity to continue working at my current internship (which I would love/plan to do) but the startup doesn't have the money yet to pay another person. I will need to start job hunting soon to support myself. I am also straying away from finance and more towards technology, i.e. I don't mind starting a job in finance (it would probably be easier with my degree) but would most likely get out at the first opportunity. The money isn't as important as how much I enjoy the role. I would say I gravitate towards quantitative topics and statistics. I also am learning programming in my spare time (python, java, sql) as I took one programming class in uni and enjoyed it. However I am not proficient enough to land a full on programming job. If there is an entry level role that I could possibly get in programming or finance with some easy programming aspect to it please comment! I also have a professional website which I will send if requested as it may help get a better picture of my experience/personality.

Thank you for reading, I truly appreciate any help you can give! :)

4kb2pz,8,2016-05-20,"Going to college in the fall, but i'm worried that I'll be a huge financial burden to my parents over the course of the four years.",ridlehprime,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4kb2pz/going_to_college_in_the_fall_but_im_worried_that/,"Sorry for the format as well as writing a long post. Long story short, my parents urged me to go to Emory because its one of the best school in the country and what not. I was excited at first until I received my financial aid package. Even taking into account all of the grants and work study offered, We'll still be about 6-7k in debt. College counselor told me we can take out a loan up to 5.5k and just pay off the rest ourselves. 

The problem is that my parents combined have a total income of about 26k, as well as my older brother already in college, and my younger sister going in 5 years. Neither they nor myself know how we'll find the money to pay for all of this, but they keep reassuring me that everything will be ok, and that I should just focus on my education there. My dad said he'll probably have to take a loan out on the house or sell it in order to pay but I really don't want him to because they recently just finished paying for it. He's also hoping that once my older brother graduates he gets a job and help pay as well, but I feel that it sucks for him because he has to spend his first couple paychecks paying for me when he could spend it on himself.

Basically, I feel really uncomfortable going knowing that everyday my parents will struggle paying for me to even be there. But every time I bring this issue up my college counselor and parents just keeps telling me that a degree from Emory will open up a lot of doors for me, and that a degree in computer science (the major i picked) is going to easily help me pay off the loans.

They keep telling me that I'm too worried about the present when the future is worth it all, but honestly I can't help myself. How am I supposed to enjoy myself there knowing that my parents probably had to cut tons of expenses and work even more just for me? They're working their tails of for one out of three children. It really sucks and I feel bad.

 I tried applying to outside scholarships but I've been rejected from all of them. I have an internship starting next month that will pay me $750 at the end of 4 months. I was planning on buying new glasses and some clothes with the money and putting the rest in a savings account. Currently I have $360 in a checking account and $120 in savings. Is there hope for our situation or will my parents really struggle for 4+ years paying for all of this?

4kb3r2,2,2016-05-20,more experience than a normal bootcamp grad.. how much leverage do i have for my offer?,woowoo3,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4kb3r2/more_experience_than_a_normal_bootcamp_grad_how/,"I finished a year-long bootcamp program that included an internship. It was about half full-time instruction and half internship at a real company working on a team.

 The junior dev role I got offered after interviewing is geared towards bootcamp graduates. However, the pay is about 15% less than what SDE1s make in my city on average. The company justifies it for this role due to the fact that I don't have a real CS degree. most bootcamp grads get this role with no internship experience and only were in class for 3 months.  
 

many people from my program got offers at a higher wage closer to the average at the SDE1 level at other companies. my other classmates negotiated a lot for their offers and it went well because it was for an SDE1 position and there wasn't really a distinction of a lower level for a bootcamp grad unlike at my company. My role is actually ""lower"" than SDE1 on the ranking scale at the companyI want this job because of other reasons, but i want to negotiate and advocate for myself for a higher salary.  


My concern is that I feel like I am dispensable due to the amount of other bootcamp candidates for this role. There are many other less qualified bootcamp grads they interviewed who would jump at the opportunity without negotiating. and this company knows that there are a lot of desperate folks.

I don't want to walk away, but I want a higher salary since I have more experience. Am I shooting myself in the foot by doing so since there are probably like 5 or more candidates lined up after me?"
4kb4z4,11,2016-05-20,What was your interview rate for internship applications?,hungryforinternship,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4kb4z4/what_was_your_interview_rate_for_internship/,"What was your interview rate for applying for internships?

I just finished my second year in a CS program and I have been applying for internships since the beginning of April. Out of about 94 applications I received: 1 interview, 1 offer to interview for an unpaid internship, and 1 coding assignment that I’m working on now. The interview I had went very well, but turned out to be for a full time but unpaid position.


I’m in a big tech city, go to a no-name state school and have a good GPA. I’ve posted my resume and brought it to career services, although my resume is definitely limited by no personal projects or previous tech work.


Has anyone else here tried to get internships applying later on? I’m hoping this interview rate is just due to applying too late. Most big(N) companies stopped taking applications before I started applying, and I suspect they might give more interviews than smaller companies, but with much higher standards to get hired.


Also, has anyone found a personal project to make a big difference for getting interviews?

4kb8zt,16,2016-05-20,How 53 days of NoFap has changed my life more than I could ever imagine,blessyouallz,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/4kb8zt/how_53_days_of_nofap_has_changed_my_life_more/,"Hello all,

I first want to thank you all for the community that NoFap is. I just found this sub after going 53 days clean (still going!) and it warms my heart to see other people all fighting toward the same goal. I figured I would share my story and what the outcome of it all has been.

**About me**:

I've struggled with pornography ever since about 7th/8th grade. This has led to confidence issues, lack of motivation in most aspects of life, and low feelings of self worth. I could barely talk to girls or hold decent conversation for more than 5 minutes.

Fast forward to today: I am a Sophomore in college, and have been porn free and fap free for almost 2 months. This has been a challenge I have tried in the past, but could never even go longer than 2 weeks without slipping up. The temptations are not even in my mind anymore and it has been such a blessing.

**What went different this time?**

*I hit rock bottom*. I hit such a low point in life where I desperately NEEDED change, or I was going to be an emotional mess. I consider myself a strong Christian man and porn was always something that affected my life more than anything else.

Second semester of college this year was rough. I was losing motivation in classes, I got an underage drinking ticket, almost failed a drug test for a dream internship because of a dumb choice made in Colorado, and was not being fair to my friends.

After all these events happened and fapping for the last time on April 28th, I broke down crying. I could see how much my life was falling apart, not only because of pornography, but it being the main factor in my unhealthy relationships with others.

**What has been the outcome from all of this? Are there actually ""superpowers"" you gain?**

1). My motivation and overall happiness everyday is at the highest point its been in my entire life. I've finally put in the effort to go to the gym, go out of my way to make conversation, and not be ashamed of who I am. Not one day this summer I would consider wasted so far. You would be surprised how much extra time you have everyday when you cut bad habits out. I've been bettering myself in all ways possible! 

2). I've met the most wonderful girl. 2 weeks into NoFap, I realized the incredible amount of interest I had to pursue a girl, and not just for her physical attributes. I was aroused by her personality, her feminine vibe. This is a feeling I had not felt in a LONG time because of porn. We have been really hitting it off the last month and it is so refreshing knowing it can only get better.

3). I pulled myself together and passed two classes I was failing. Ended up with B's in both when I had failing grades beforehand! 

There is SO much more that has happened and changed in my life in the short 2 months it has been, but I won't bore you any longer.

**THANK YOU ALL. I FINALLY FEEL FREE! GOD IS GOOD**"

4kbfv7,82,2016-05-20,summer internship cancelled because of background check,tohearstories,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4kbfv7/summer_internship_cancelled_because_of_background/,"I.m in Philly and I.m a Computer Science major, with a 3.44 gpa, starting my senior year in the fall.

In 2003, when I lived in Texas, I bounced a $30 check to a grocery store. Texas has weird naming conventions and called it ""theft by check.""  It was a class B misdemeanor, which is on par with grafiti, DWI, etc. I paid a $400 fine and that was that.

I have a summer internship with a wealth management company which was supposed to start on 6/6. I just found out that this bounced check came up on a background check and because it contains the word ""theft"", they cancelled my internship.

So, I'm very discouraged.  I interviewed and got the internship in February. By waiting until 3 weeks before my start date to run a background check on me, they effectively screwed my entire summer. I could have gotten another internship with a company that didn't care about a bounced check from 13 years ago.

My question is this: is this normal? am i going to have a hard time getting a job when I finish my degree because of this?"

4kblfs,1,2016-05-20,Should I give my parents my friend's number and address?,ElectroClan,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4kblfs/should_i_give_my_parents_my_friends_number_and/,"My parents have just told me in a phone call that they want my friend's number and address so that if something bad happens to me, they have somebody to contact for information (or the other way around).

Background: I go to a university on the other side of the country from my Nmom and my Edad, more than a thousand miles away from them. I have a research internship at another university near mine that starts in June, but school for me ended in the beginning of May. Instead of setting foot in my old house again, a friend of mine from the group therapy I go to is letting me stay in his apartment while he's visiting family for the month. 

Because pretty much all the other students are gone, the only friend I have here is a guy who has his own apartment who just graduated. 

When my parents called today, the one who asked for my friend's number and address was my Edad. Something I've noticed  when I'm on the phone with them is that my Edad is always the one who's asking me questions that my Nmom would usually be asking. By now, she's realized that I'm not going to listen to anything she tells me to do (I have hung up on her before), so she has my Edad as a puppet because she knows I'm closer to him. 

However, he told me that it would be best if he and my Nmom had my friend's address and number just in case something bad happened to me and they couldn't contact me. I told him that I didn't know his exact number or address at hand, so he asked for me to get it soon. 

I don't feel good giving other people's numbers and addresses to my Nmom. [She has asked for other people's numbers before for different reasons,](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3sr9a7/my_roommate_had_to_move_out_of_my_dorm_room/) but this reason sounds much more legitimate. After all, I'm a young girl living in a big city all by myself. Although I don't go out after dark, always watch my surroundings, walk confidently with my head up on the street, have taken self-defense classes for six months, etc., you can't be too safe when you're in my position. 

However, I got this text from my Nmom earlier today:

&gt; ELECTROCLAN, WE had to call you and you have not call us. WE GET WORRY because your cellular is the only source you had provide us. AFter almost 10 months you leaving there we do not know from you a full name of a person you had made as a real frienship. I sometimes wonder if you are still doing crasy writting in the internet and lying doing weird actions. By actions you can say a lot. 

I would've been fine with her worrying for my safety, but everything after the second sentence in this text completely overshadows that. Those ""crazy writings on the Internet"" is referring to when she found out I was writing fanfiction almost a year ago, and that's just one of the ""weird actions"" she scolded me for doing while I lived there. 

Also, she's lying about not knowing any of my friends' full names. There were times when she asked for my friends' last names, and I told them to her. Then again, I think the emphasis she's trying to put on is the ""real friendships"" part. 

If I'm going to give away my friend's number and address, I'm definitely going to ask him for permission first (and probably warn him about anything fishy). There's nobody else here I know who can fill this position, so my friend is my only choice. However, I need to know if this is a good idea or not. Is this a safety measure I should take, or is there something else I should do?

4kbo3w,156,2016-05-20,The Legend of $FlatCap,waydeultima,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4kbo3w/the_legend_of_flatcap/,"[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4kas2r/not_the_greatest_computer_technician_prologue/)

I was in charge of training $FlatCap. There wasn’t really anyone else, because the only other “main” technician, $Goodman, (we didn’t have formal titles) had been relocated to single-handedly operate $Comshop2, which had soft-launched by this point. It still wasn’t fully renovated and ready for business, but $Boss decided that he was tired of losing money on it and wanted to get it up and going as soon as possible. Spoiler: opening the shop didn’t fix the “losing money” situation, but that’s neither here nor there. Well, I mean, it’s there… But anyway:

$FlatCap is a super nice dude. Good taste in music, we shared a lot of interests, great sense of humor. Quality banter was enjoyed by all. I was particularly happy because I could retell all of my bad jokes and funny stories and he actually seemed to enjoy them.


But…


Weeks passed. Things seemed to be going okay. The winter slowness began to fade, and business was picking up. $FlatCap seemed to have a pretty decent grasp on things, and my quality assurance of his work dropped off over time, because I had actual repair work to do. The dust had settled and things were returning to normalcy.


Monday morning. Several voicemails left on Sunday. A lady sitting in her car in front of the shop. 15 minutes until opening time. She hasn’t seen me yet. Ah yes, unopened box of Tully’s House Blend K-cups. House Tully. Family, duty, honor.

One coffee later, I casually exited the back room and, looking surprised, rushed to unlock the front door 2 minutes early. The “rushing” was a mannerism I picked up from $Boss over time, where you kind of look like you’re jogging but you’re not moving any faster than if you just walked briskly.

&gt; $Viruslady: I’ve been trying to get in touch with you guys all weekend! I picked my computer up Saturday afternoon, and it’s still doing the same thing! It’s not fixed!

I called up her previous work order on the computer. The technician’s notes were blank. The field for inputting the computer specs contained the text “hp dv 7 laptop”, all lowercase, with no other information. The charges section had a dollar amount with the dollar sign on the wrong side, and no description saying what she was paying for.


The “Technician’s Name” field… Was blank.


I apologized profusely and checked the laptop back into the system properly, with “RETURN” at the top of the description of the problem.

After she left, I put the computer onto my own bench and began my inspection. Windows desktop, so far so good. Nothing weird in the system tray. Lots of processes running in the task manager… Google Chrome opened. Blank white page, two obvious adware buttons next to the menu button. 10+ items in the extensions.


Years earlier, there was a period of a couple of months where it seemed like two out of every three computers we worked on would come back the next day, and it was always either a) something stupid we overlooked or b) a new problem. Since then, we’d gotten **very** thorough. We usually did somewhat more work than we should have, simply because it was more worth it to spend an extra 20 minutes or so idiot-proofing the computer than to have to waste our own time and the customer’s time when they brought it back.

At this point, I was of the mindset that she had taken the computer home, installed something dumb, and was blaming it on IT. And so appwiz.cpl.

*All of this junk was installed over a week ago.*

Honestly, the only evidence I could find that it had even been worked on was a recent scan with Malwarebytes.

Queue $FlatCap, whose schedule has him coming in an hour after opening time for some reason.

&gt; Me: $FlatCap, did you work on the computer for $Viruslady on Friday or Saturday?

&gt; $FlatCap: *looks at laptop* Yeah, that was one of mine. She had a really bad virus popup.

&gt; Me: Okay… And so you cleaned it up?

&gt; $FlatCap: Yeah! :D

&gt; Me: Okay…

Shortest explanation possible: Our virus cleanups were a set procedure, and one I’d walked $FlatCap through many times at this point. Safe mode, manually delete obvious files in appdata, programdata, temp folders, program files, etc. Then normal mode, Combofix, Adwcleaner, JRT, Hitman Pro, uninstall anything left in appwiz, browser extensions, etc. Maybe a few other things, it’s been awhile. But you can see a general idea of what goes into it. We had a $Intern whom I made a checklist for at one point. It was thorough enough that it took care of 90% of malware-related things, then actual troubleshooting would get you through 8% more, Google for the remaining 2%. Ransomware is obviously a different procedure, but you get the idea.

ANYWAY. I did the cleanup myself. I frustratedly had a few words with $FlatCap about his quality of work. He “thought he’d cleaned it up”. He didn’t do the work order because it “got super busy all of a sudden”. He didn’t run Combofix because it “said it was out of date and wouldn’t run”. Lol.


But, you know. It was a mistake. It happens. When we make mistakes like that, we learn from them. Grow. We take our negative experiences and turn them into KNAWLEDGE.


Right?

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5R0IlmBqzpjGS5fsODH2CQ

---

A common criticism of the 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene by many, Kirkus Reviews and Professor Jeffrey Pfeffer included, is that it offers no evidence to support his world view.

I used to just vaguely accept the book, but it was so easy to find studies advocating for each law, even if I was searching for something to contradict it, It has made me think ""holy fucking shit. 48 Laws is the real deal."" Seriously. If you want to trust any book, so far this one has been a safe bet. It will help you understand people much better than a book like [Everybody Wins](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KX4HFEEGL.jpg). This quote from How To Win Friends and Influence People comes to mind.

&gt; “When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.”

I thought I would share my progress so far for your personal reading. I will find a study to support all 48 Laws. When I am complete, I will post the full list and create a video for each. Feel free to contribute studies yourself or criticise anywhere where I fall short.

---

**Law 1. Never outshine the master**

&gt; The results support the social exchange model of fairness, showing that higher levels of envy and perceived unfairness result in higher levels of interpersonal counterproductive work behavior (Study 1), especially among high self-esteem individuals (Study 2).

http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/apl/92/3/666/

&gt; We integrate moral disengagement, social identification, and social norms theories to develop, test, and replicate a model that explains how and when envy is associated with social undermining. In Study 1, a two-wave study of hospital employees, results support the prediction that the mediated effect of envy on social undermining behavior through moral disengagement is stronger when employees have low social identification with coworkers. Study 2, a four-wave, multilevel study of student teams, shows that the indirect effect of envy on social undermining through moral disengagement is stronger in teams with low team identification and high team undermining norms.

https://www.polyu.edu.hk/mm/jason/doc/Duffy-Scott-Shaw-Tepper-Aquino%202012%20AMJ.pdf

&gt; Humblebragging – bragging masked by a complaint – is a distinct and, given the rise of social media, increasingly ubiquitous form of self-promotion. We show that although people often choose to humblebrag when motivated to make a good impression, it is an ineffective self-promotional strategy. Five studies offer both correlational and causal evidence that humblebragging has both global costs – reducing liking and perceived sincerity – and specific costs: it is even ineffective in signaling the specific trait that that a person wants to promote. Moreover, humblebragging is less effective than simply complaining, because complainers are at least seen as sincere. Despite people’s belief that combining bragging and complaining confers the benefits of both self-promotion strategies, humblebragging fails to pay off.

http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2597626

**Law 2: Never put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies**

&gt; Close friends and relatives, rated nearly equal on closeness, showed very different rates of envy. Envy by close friends was reported nearly three times as often as envy by relatives.

http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/whos_the_enviest_of_them_all

&gt; Companies that hired people with experience working for rivals in the same industry were the biggest winners. They put up a median return of 182%.

http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/It-s-best-to-hire-from-a-rival-study-shows

**Law 4: Always say less than necessary**

&gt; Since power activates abstraction (e.g., Smith &amp; Trope, 2006), perceivers may expect higher-power individuals to speak more abstractly and therefore will infer that speakers who use more abstract language have a higher degree of power. Across a variety of contexts and conversational subjects in six experiments, participants perceived respondents as more powerful when they used more abstract language (versus more concrete language). Abstract language use appears to affect perceived power because it seems to reflect both a willingness to judge and a general style of abstract thinking.

https://msbfile03.usc.edu/digitalmeasures/wakslak/intellcont/WakslakSmithHan_final-2.docx

**Law 5: So much depends on reputation --- guard it with your life!**

&gt; This ‘stranger’ has an incentive to help if the individual in need of help has previously helped others (indirect reciprocity). The stranger might have observed these actions or heard gossip about them. Evolutionary theory predicts that if the person has helped more often than refused help they have positive image score or reputation and should be helped [33]. For indirect reciprocity, reputation needs to be known; for direct reciprocation of help remembering a face is enough. Any costly investment in others increases a person's reputation. Reputation is a strong driver of cooperation, serving as a currency for future social exchange [87].

http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/1687/20150100

**Law 6: Court Attention At All Costs**

*Mere-exposure effect*

&gt; The mere-exposure effect is a psychological phenomenon by which people tend to develop a preference for things merely because they are familiar with them. In social psychology, this effect is sometimes called the familiarity principle. The effect has been demonstrated with many kinds of things, including words, Chinese characters, paintings, pictures of faces, geometric figures, and sounds.[1] In studies of interpersonal attraction, the more often a person is seen by someone, the more pleasing and likeable that person appears to be.

-

&gt; Gossip is a form of affective information about who is friend and who is foe. We show that gossip does not influence only how a face is evaluated—it affects whether a face is seen in the first place. In two experiments, neutral faces were paired with negative, positive, or neutral gossip and were then presented alone in a binocular rivalry paradigm (faces were presented to one eye, houses to the other). In both studies, faces previously paired with negative (but not positive or neutral) gossip dominated longer in visual consciousness. These findings demonstrate that gossip, as a potent form of social affective learning, can influence vision in a completely top-down manner, independent of the basic structural features of a face.

http://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6036/1446

&gt; Can negative information about a product increase sales, and if so, when? Although popular wisdom suggests that “any publicity is good publicity,” prior research has demonstrated only downsides to negative press. Negative reviews or word of mouth, for example, have been found to hurt product evaluation and sales. Using a combination of econometric analysis and experimental methods, we unify these perspectives to delineate contexts under which negative publicity about a product will have positive versus negative effects. Specifically, we argue that negative publicity can increase purchase likelihood and sales by increasing product awareness. Consequently, negative publicity should have differential effects on established versus unknown products. Three studies support this perspective. Whereas a negative review in the New York Times hurt sales of books by well-known authors, for example, it increased sales of books that had lower prior awareness. The studies further underscore the importance of a gap between publicity and purchase occasion and the mediating role of increased awareness in these effects.

**Law 9: Win through your actions, never through argument**

*Backfire effect*

&gt; The ""backfire effect"" is a name for the finding that, given evidence against their beliefs, people can reject the evidence and believe even more strongly. The phrase was first coined by Brendan Nyhan and Jason Reifler.

*Confirmation Bias*

&gt; Confirmation bias, also called confirmatory bias or myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses, while giving disproportionately less consideration to alternative possibilities.[Note 1][1] It is a type of cognitive bias and a systematic error of inductive reasoning.

&gt; An extensive literature addresses citizen ignorance, but very little research focuses on misperceptions. Can these false or unsubstantiated beliefs about politics be corrected? Previous studies have not tested the efficacy of corrections in a realistic format. We conducted four experiments in which subjects read mock news articles that included either a misleading claim from a politician, or a misleading claim and a correction. Results indicate that corrections frequently fail to reduce misperceptions among the targeted ideological group. We also document several instances of a “backfire effect” in which corrections actually increase misperceptions among the group in question. 

http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/nyhan-reifler.pdf

&gt; Context: Misperceptions are a major problem in debates about health care reform and other controversial health issues.

&gt; Methods: We conducted an experiment to determine if more aggressive media fact-checking could correct the false belief that the Affordable Care Act would create “death panels.” Participants from an opt-in Internet panel were randomly assigned to either a control group in which they read an article on Sarah Palin’s claims about “death panels” or an intervention group in which the article also contained corrective information refuting Palin.

&gt; Findings: The correction reduced belief in death panels and strong opposition to the reform bill among those who view Palin unfavorably and those who view her favorably but have low political knowledge. However, it backfired among politically knowledgeable Palin supporters, who were more likely to believe in death panels and to strongly oppose reform if they received the correction.

&gt; Conclusions: These results underscore the difficulty of reducing misperceptions about health care reform among individuals with the motivation and sophistication to reject corrective information.

**Law 10: Infection --- avoid the unhappy and unlucky**

&gt; Studies reveal that when people are exposed to emotional facial expressions, they spontaneously react with distinct facial electromyographic (EMG) reactions in emotion-relevant facial muscles. These reactions reflect, in part, a tendency to mimic the facial stimuli. We investigated whether corresponding facial reactions can be elicited when people are unconsciously exposed to happy and angry facial expressions. Through use of the backward-masking technique, the subjects were prevented from consciously perceiving 30-ms exposures of happy, neutral, and angry target faces, which immediately were followed and masked by neutral faces. Despite the fact that exposure to happy and angry faces was unconscious, the subjects reacted with distinct facial muscle reactions that corresponded to the happy and angry stimulus faces. Our results show that both positive and negative emotional reactions can be unconsciously evoked, and particularly that important aspects of emotional face-to-face communication can occur on an unconscious level.

&gt; Recent studies conclude that happiness and depression may be highly contagious across social ties. The results may be biased, however, due to selection and common shocks. We provide unbiased estimates by using exogenous variation from college roommate assignments. Our findings are consistent with at most small contagion effects, with no evidence for happiness contagion, modest evidence for anxiety contagion, and modest evidence for depression contagion among men only.

**Law 12: Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim**

&gt; This ‘stranger’ has an incentive to help if the individual in need of help has previously helped others (indirect reciprocity). The stranger might have observed these actions or heard gossip about them. Evolutionary theory predicts that if the person has helped more often than refused help they have positive image score or reputation and should be helped [33]. For indirect reciprocity, reputation needs to be known; for direct reciprocation of help remembering a face is enough. Any costly investment in others increases a person's reputation. Reputation is a strong driver of cooperation, serving as a currency for future social exchange [87].

**Law 13: When asking for help, appeal to people's self-interest, never to their mercy or gratitude**

&gt; Human decision making in situations of inequity has long been regarded as a competition between the sense of fairness and self-interest, primarily based on behavioral and neuroimaging studies of inequity that disfavor the actor while favoring others. Here, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments to study refusals and protests using both favoring and disfavoring inequity in three economic exchange games with undercompensating, nearly equal, and overcompensating offers. Refusals of undercompensating offers recruited a heightened activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Accepting of overcompensating offers recruited significantly higher node activity in, and network activity among, the caudate, the cingulate cortex, and the thalamus. Protesting of undercompensating fixed offers activated the network consisting of the right dlPFC and the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and midbrain in the substantia nigra. These findings suggest that perceived fairness and social decisions are the results of coordination between evaluated fairness norms, self-interest, and reward.

&gt; Strongly influenced by their self-interest, humans do not protest being overcompensated, even when there are no consequences, researchers in Georgia State University’s Brains and Behavior Program have found.

&gt; This could imply that humans are less concerned than previously believed about the inequity of others, researchers said. Their findings are published in the journal Brain Connectivity. These findings suggest humans’ sense of unfairness is affected by their self-interest, indicating the interest humans show in others’ outcomes is a recently evolved propensity.

**Law 16: Use absence to increase respect and honor**

&gt; Many people assume that it is challenging to maintain the intimacy of a long-distance (LD) relationship. However, recent research suggests that LD romantic relationships are of equal or even more trust and satisfaction than their geographically close (GC) counterparts. The present diary study tested an intimacy-enhancing process, in which LD couples (a) engage in more adaptive self-disclosures and (b) form more idealized relationship perceptions than do GC couples in the pursuit of intimacy across various interpersonal media. The results demonstrate the effects of behavioral adaptation and idealization on intimacy, and suggest that the two effects vary depending on the cue multiplicity, synchronicity, and mobility of the communication medium employed. Implications for understanding LD relating and mix-mode relating are discussed.

&gt; In 2 experiments, a total of 200 female undergraduates rated the value and attractiveness of cookies that were either in abundant supply or scarce supply. In the scarce condition, the cookies were either constantly scarce or they began in abundant supply and then decreased. Ss were told that this decrease in supply was either due to an accident or to a high demand for the cookies. In the abundant condition, the cookies were either constantly abundant or first scarce and then abundant. The increase in supply was either due to an accident or to a lack of demand for the cookies. These conditions were crossed with a manipulation in which Ss thought either a high or low number of additional Ss were still to participate in the study. Results indicate that (a) cookies in scarce supply were rated as more desirable than cookies in abundant supply; (b) cookies were rated as more valuable when their supply changed from abundant to scarce than when they were constantly scarce; and (c) cookies scarce because of high demand were rated higher than cookies that were scarce because of an accident. With regard to abundance, cookies that were constantly abundant were rated higher than cookies that began scarce but later became abundant. Results extend commodity theory. Reactance was hypothesized as an intervening process responsible for some of the results. The 2nd study was performed to rule out the possibility that demand characteristics were responsible for the obtained results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

**Law 24: Play The Perfect Courtier**

&gt; In this study, we examined internship as a recruitment and selection process. On the basis of impression management theory, we hypothesized that both organizations and interns make efforts to impress the other party during the internship if they intend to hire or be hired. Using longitudinal data collected at 3 points from 122 intern–supervisor dyads in the United States, we found that 60% of internships turned into job offers from the host organizations. Interns wishing to be hired were more likely to use self-promotion and ingratiation, which increased the likelihood of job offers. Organizations wishing to hire appeared to be more open to interns' creativity, which increased interns' application intentions. For interns who indicated prior to their internship that they were not interested in working in their host organizations after graduation, supervisory mentoring did not influence their subsequent intentions to apply for full-time employment.

&gt; The goals of this study were to define the psychological and personality characteristics that physicians attribute to their patients and to determine whether these attributions affect treatment decisions. A Physician Attribution Survey was developed to achieve the first goal, and demonstrated that likeability and competence were salient features of the physician-patient relationship. Videotapes were then created demonstrating patients with three different combinations of likeability and competence: likeable-competent (L-C), unlikeable-competent (U-C) and likeable-incompetent (L-I). After being pre-tested with several samples of health professional students, the tapes were shown to 93 primary care physicians. These physicians then completed both a Physician Attribution Survey and a Patient &gt; Management Problem describing their proposed treatment.

&gt; There were significant differences in treatment on five of nine treatment dimensions, depending upon the characteristics of the patient. First, the L-C patient would be encouraged significantly more often to telephone and to return more frequently for follow-up than would the L-I or U-C patient. Second, the staff would educate the likeable patients significantly more often than they would the unlikeable patients. Third, the physician would offer significantly more patient education to incompetent patients than to competent ones. Fourth, the unlikeable patient would receive significantly more interviewing regarding the psychological aspects of care than would the likeable patients. Fifth, the L-C patient would receive augmented medication more frequently than either the U-C patient or the L-I patient. There were no differences in the use of the physical examination, referral to staff, frequency of return or hospitalization based on the personal characteristics of the patient, although some of these variables were significantly affected by the attributed disease. There were no interactions between patient characteristics and disease as determinants of management. These findings have implications for medical education, studies of medical decision-making, and assessments of physicians' quality of care of patients. The methods developed provide a basis for more extensive and detailed studies of the explicit and implicit theories physicians have regarding the relationship between the personality characteristics of their patients and treatment decisions.

&gt; Leaders frequently form stronger relationships with certain subordinates moreso than others, creating an inner circle of close friendships and an outer circle of more distant relationships. Three studies examine the effects of inner-circle membership on group dynamics and interpersonal influence in hierarchical teams. Study 1 finds that, compared to outer-circle members, inner-circle members feel safer and participate in the group discussion more, and leaders recognize them as making a greater contribution and allocate a larger bonus to them. Consequently, inner-circle members influence the groups' decisions more, and team decision quality improves when inner-circle members possess expert knowledge. Study 2 finds that leaders attended to and recalled suggestions from their inner circle more regardless of argument strength, suggesting heuristic information processing. Study 3 replicates these findings using intact teams in a large governmental agency. Implications for leadership and group decision making are discussed.

**Law 26: Keep Your Hands Clean**

*Negativity bias*

&gt; The negativity bias[1] (also known as the negativity effect) refers to the notion that, even when of equal intensity, things of a more negative nature (e.g. unpleasant thoughts, emotions, or social interactions; harmful/traumatic events) have a greater effect on one's psychological state and processes than do neutral or positive things.

-

&gt; The seminal academic paper here is called “Bad is Stronger Than Good” [pdf]. Roy Baumeister and his colleagues draw on a huge pile of peer-reviewed studies to show that negative information, experiences, and people have far deeper impacts than positive ones. In the context of romantic relationships and marriages, for example, the truth is stark: unless positive interactions outnumber negative interactions by five to one, odds are that the relationship will fail.

**Law 27: Play on People’s Need to Believe to Create a Cult like Following**

&gt; So to find out more, we conducted our own study. We began by collaborating with a respected organization in the telecommunications industry whose leaders scored well above average on most managerial competencies. We identified 33 individuals who scored at or above the 99th percentile on innovation, as measured by their peers, subordinates, and bosses in a comprehensive 360-degree feedback survey.  We believed these closest colleagues would have the most accurate view of what made this group of leaders stand out from the pack in this large organization.

&gt; Why is it that people follow leaders? We propose in this article that there are at least three motivational grounds for persuading followers to change their organizational behavior: utility, identity, and values. These motivational grounds are sensitive to the national (and corporate) contexts in which leaders operate. Here, we discuss two CEO-led change programs, one in a U.S. company and the other in a Japanese organization. We seek to describe and contrast the motivational bases of the CEOs' change efforts in the two cases and draw attention to the leader approaches in the two national and organizational contexts. In the U.S. case study, leadership was based on the assumption that a “right” agency (in terms of utility sought or values held) will result in the “right” consequences. In Japan, the link from leadership to followership was different: it was assumed that a “right” (corporate) identity will induce “right” behavior on the part of the followers. We propose that further studies consider the follower context in more detail, thus contributing to the understanding of what makes leaders effective in the United States and Japan.

**Law 30: Make your accomplishments seem effortless**

&gt; Promises are social contracts that can be broken, kept, or exceeded. Breaking one’s promise is evaluated more negatively than keeping one’s promise. Does expending more effort to exceed a promise lead to equivalently more positive evaluations? Although linear in their outcomes, we expected an asymmetry in evaluations of broken, kept, and exceeded promises. Whereas breaking one's promise is obviously negative compared to keeping a promise, we predicted that exceeding one’s promise would not be evaluated more positively than merely keeping a promise. Three sets of experiments involving hypothetical, recalled, and actual promises support these predictions. A final experiment suggests this asymmetry comes from overvaluing kept promises rather than undervaluing exceeded promises. We suggest this pattern may reflect a general tendency in social systems to discourage selfishness and reward cooperation. Breaking one’s promise is costly, but exceeding it does not appear worth the effort.

&gt; Humblebragging – bragging masked by a complaint – is a distinct and, given the rise of social media, increasingly ubiquitous form of self-promotion. We show that although people often choose to humblebrag when motivated to make a good impression, it is an ineffective self-promotional strategy. Five studies offer both correlational and causal evidence that humblebragging has both global costs – reducing liking and perceived sincerity – and specific costs: it is even ineffective in signaling the specific trait that that a person wants to promote. Moreover, humblebragging is less effective than simply complaining, because complainers are at least seen as sincere. Despite people’s belief that combining bragging and complaining confers the benefits of both self-promotion strategies, humblebragging fails to pay off.

&gt; Differences in fourth, sixth, and eighth grade (10-, 12-, and 14-year-old) students' willingness to portray themselves as diligent to their popular peers and teachers and their perceptions of the social value of effort and ability ascriptions were examined. The results revealed that the fourth- and sixth-grade students desired to portray themselves as effortful to teachers and peers, whereas the eighth graders were more reluctant to convey to their popular peers than teachers that they study hard. Consistent with these findings, the fourth graders perceived high effort to increase teacher approval as well as popularity among peers, whereas the eighth graders viewed diligence as facilitating teacher approval but low effort expenditure as improving peer popularity. Reasons for youngsters' changing notions of the social value of achievement ascriptions and their self-presentation tactics in school are discussed.

**Law 32: Play to People's Fantasies**

&gt; The most popular students in school sometimes are the best liars, according to a study conducted by University of Massachusetts psychologist Robert S. Feldman and published in the most recent Journal of Nonverbal Behavior.

&gt; The study found that older adolescents were more adept at deception than the younger ones. Younger or older females were more likely to excel at lying than their male counterparts. Among all ages and genders, those adolescents with the highest level of social competence were the most talented liars. They were able to verbalize untruths while controlling their nonverbal behavior, including facial expression, vocal pitch and mannerisms, posture, and eye contact. Those youths with the poorest social skills had the most trouble controlling their nonverbal behavior when lying.

&gt; ""This study tells us something about people: It’s unrealistic to expect them to always tell the truth. In fact, it’s not even the way we want people to always behave,"" Feldman said. ""Children are taught at an early age to be polite and say something nice in social situations, even if it’s not the absolute truth. In fact, pretending is part of many children’s and adult’s games.""

&gt; Honesty plays a crucial role in any situation where organisms exchange information or resources. Dishonesty can thus be expected to have damaging effects on social coherence if agents cannot trust the information or goods they receive. However, a distinction is often drawn between prosocial lies (‘white’ lies) and antisocial lying (i.e. deception for personal gain), with the former being considered much less destructive than the latter. We use an agent-based model to show that antisocial lying causes social networks to become increasingly fragmented. Antisocial dishonesty thus places strong constraints on the size and cohesion of social communities, providing a major hurdle that organisms have to overcome (e.g. by evolving counter-deception strategies) in order to evolve large, socially cohesive communities. In contrast, white lies can prove to be beneficial in smoothing the flow of interactions and facilitating a larger, more integrated network. Our results demonstrate that these group-level effects can arise as emergent properties of interactions at the dyadic level. The balance between prosocial and antisocial lies may set constraints on the structure of social networks, and hence the shape of society as a whole.

*In-group favoritism*

&gt; In-group favoritism, sometimes known as in-group–out-group bias, in-group bias, or intergroup bias, is a pattern of favoring members of one's in-group over out-group members. This can be expressed in evaluation of others, in allocation of resources, and in many other ways.

&gt; To explore both of these possibilities, we explicitly studied the relationship between political ideology and trust among a representative US population. In particular, we had paired subjects play a simple trust game with either the same or opposite political identity partner. We found that there are partisan identity-based differences in trusting rates. Whereas Republicans do not exhibit different trust rates between partners of different partisan identities, Democrats trust partners of their own partisan identity more than Republicans. The mechanism that explains this difference seems to be driven by beliefs about partner trustworthiness and not by a taste for discrimination based on partisan identity.

&gt; A new study suggests including religion in campaign speeches feeds a belief that those who are religious to some extent are trustworthy and viewed more favorably. The study was conducted by Scott Clifford of the University of Houston Department of Political Science and Ben Gaskins of Lewis &amp; Clark College.

&gt; Group polarization occurs when people's attitudes become more extreme following discussion with like-minded others. We hypothesized that people underestimate how much a relatively brief group discussion polarizes their own attitudes. People often perceive their own attitudes as unbiased and stable over time. Therefore, people's polarized post-discussion attitudes may cause them to misremember their pre-discussion attitudes as having been more extreme than they were. In two experiments, participants engaged in 15-minute discussions with 4–6 like-minded others regarding two political topics: whether Barack Obama or George W. Bush was the better president (Experiment 1) and whether they supported Barack Obama or Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential election (Experiment 2). Group discussion polarized participants' attitudes, and participants misremembered their pre-discussion attitudes as having been more extreme than they actually were. Participants' polarized post-discussion attitudes significantly predicted their recalled pre-discussion attitudes, controlling for their actual pre-discussion attitudes, suggesting that their post-discussion attitudes guided reconstruction of their pre-discussion attitudes. These findings have implications for people's awareness of psychological biases and for the societal effects of partisan enclavement.

**Law 45: Preach the need for change, but never reform too much at once!**

*Status quo bias*

&gt; Status quo bias is an emotional bias; a preference for the current state of affairs. The current baseline (or status quo) is taken as a reference point, and any change from that baseline is perceived as a loss. Status quo bias should be distinguished from a rational preference for the status quo ante, as when the current state of affairs is objectively superior to the available alternatives, or when imperfect information is a significant problem. A large body of evidence, however, shows that status quo bias frequently affects human decision-making.

&gt; The longer something is thought to exist, the better it is evaluated. In Study 1, participants preferred an existing university requirement over an alternative; this pattern was more pronounced when the existing requirement was said to be in place for a longer period of time. In Study 2, participants rated acupuncture more favorably as a function of how old the practice was described. Aesthetic judgments of art (Study 3) and nature (Study 4) were also positively affected by time in existence, as were gustatory evaluations of an edible consumer good (Study 5). Features of the research designs argue against mere exposure, loss aversion, and rational inference as explanations for these findings. Instead, time in existence seems to operate as a heuristic; longer means better.

&gt; Change aversion is a natural response, which technology often exacerbates. Evolutionary changes can be subtle and occur over many generations. But Internet users must sometimes deal with sudden, significant product changes to applications they rely on and identify with. Despite the best intentions of designers and product managers, users often experience anxiety and confusion when faced with a new interface or changed functionality. While some change aversion is often inevitable, it can also be managed and minimized with the right steps. This case study describes how our understanding of change aversion helped minimize negative effects for the transition of the Google Docs List to Google Drive, a product for file storage in the cloud. We describe actions that allowed for a launch with no aversion.

**Law 46: Never appear too perfect! --- Only gods and the dead can seem perfect with impunity!**

*Pratfall effect*

&gt; In social psychology, the pratfall effect is the tendency for attractiveness to increase or decrease after an individual makes a mistake, depending on the individual's perceived ability to perform well in a general sense. A perceived able individual would be, on average, more likable after committing a blunder, while the opposite would occur if a perceived average person makes a mistake.

-

&gt; An experiment was performed which demonstrated that the attractiveness of a superior person is enhanced if he commits a clumsy blunder; the same blunder tends to decrease the the attractiveness of a mediocre person. We predicted these results by conjecturing that a superior person may be viewed as superhuman and, therefore, distant; a blunder tends to. humanize him and, consequently, increases his attractiveness.

&gt; Honestly, I can't stand it. I get paid way too much to be my own secretary and interview all these idiots. However, boobs are fun to stare at.

Meanwhile,

&gt; People are leaving and not being replaced. There are definitely more parking spots available at 10am. More and more long term employees are leaving and John has no intention of retaining them. We have always had high turnover, but this seems different. It seems we are approaching the endgame whatever that is.

&gt; ... revoking the dealer license to distribute ranch derived products would finally kill the reputation of SCBT. It would take too long to recover unless some drastic changes happen instantaneously.

&gt; Imagine a $10k fine for each of the thousands of animals. I'm sure it would be appealed and hang up in court for years, but a good outcome is unlikely.

OP: 

&gt; ... within two weeks of working here the atmosphere is really anti-John and seems like our CEO tries to screw people that work for him bad. i literally haven't met anyone that has anything good to say about him yet. and wage-freeze? i'm new and not even thinking about raises yet, but knowing i won't ever get one if i stayed at this company isn't exactly going to keep me here. looks like i'll be applying for other jobs in a few months.

&gt; why haven't SCBT employees tried to organize in some way if everyone seems to dislike the leadership? they've got to listen if people are more vocal about it.

reply:

&gt; Btw, there is no negotiation or organizing with John. If I'm reading between the lines here, you might be referencing unions and such, well, he would just fire everyone. He already has a bad reputation with employees and the community, so he has nothing to lose. People have talked about organizing since the 90's.

Incidentally, the news outlets still don't know whether the thousands of goats and rabbits that [disappeared just before a USDA hearing](http://www.nature.com/news/thousands-of-goats-and-rabbits-vanish-from-major-biotech-lab-1.19411) were euthanized or sold.

[**""Tech sales department dissolved in Dallas office yesterday""**](https://np.reddit.com/r/scbt/comments/3omcf5/tech_sales_department_dissolved_in_dallas_office/)

&gt; hey guys, so I came across this subreddit today while looking up the newest info on the USDA case. I just got laid off, fired, whatever you wanna call it, yesterday along with four others from the tech sales department. John has dissolved the technical sales department and those they kept are now assisting the technical service dept. We were called into the conference room and the HR rep. non-chalantly told us that our jobs had ceased to exist over the phone, with all of us in the same room. 

&gt; ...

&gt; My guess is that this USDA case has become very expensive for them, especially since it sounds like they will be settling. I have been in countless meetings directly with the Stephenson's, and I think I can speak for all of my former colleagues and I'm sure most others who work or have worked for scb,t in saying that we were just bodies to John. I never once performed the job description that I was initially told I would be doing. Our jobs changed on a weekly basis. I'm I'm still not sure he even knew my name by looking at me. I honestly feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders but it is a bit terrifying knowing I have about 2 weeks to find a job.

I also sent out a lot of replacement vials due to the original one being broken or compromised in some way when it was delivered.

&gt; I honestly felt worse about working for a company with USDA animal abuse issues than sending people crap products.

[**""SCBT taking advantage of students""**](https://np.reddit.com/r/scbt/comments/43x0wf/scbt_taking_advantage_of_students/)

Apparently managers asked student interns for their library credentials so they didn't have to pay for scientific journal access.

&gt; Im certain that there are other workers at scbt with integrity and they can contact ucsc library administration with their concerns. Is getting even as good as a raise? Probably not, but John isnt going to sell his house in Hawaii to keep anyone in SC employed.

[**""$15 minimum wage""**](https://np.reddit.com/r/scbt/comments/4c7201/15_minimum_wage/)

&gt; What I think a lot of people are noticing lately is that people who quit are not being replaced. Several departments seem to be shrinking a little. So if the CEO is forced to pay lab workers $15, he will just hire fewer and make everyone do more work.

So I just completed my undergraduate studies and I come home to my parents deciding I no longer need to live at home and need to move out by the end of the month. Situation isn't too good, but I think I've got it under control for the short term. This issue is in the long term when I'm supposed to attend graduate school in the fall. Here are the facts:

1. I have about $30000 saved from internships and odd jobs throughout my undergrad education.

2. I don't need to worry about paying undergrad school loans. I've paid those off fully.

3. Rent for the new place is about $500/month, but I'll only be there for 2 months.

4. In August, I'll be moving out of the country for grad school, and have already confirmed that I can take a loan out for the entire cost of my education, which will thankfully be only 10 months.

My question is this. I have no means of transportation, will be taking a taxi from my current house to the new apartment, and will essentially be on my own once there. How do I go about making my savings last? I don't want to burn thru $30000 quickly, but at the same time I can't think of a place that would hire someone for less than 2 months. Do you have any suggestions? My minds kinda numb with trying to process everything that's happening so sorry if this seems rushed or confusing. Please let me know if you'd like further information.

Thank you

Meanwhile I have been attending college and met a girl in one of my classes that I think is very special. There are a few things that are confusing me though. So when we first met we sorta connected, she seemed to like me and asked me a lot of questions and we talked a lot about our similar taste in music,etc. Also, she liked that I was from California b/c I brought a somewhat laid back vibe that she said made me different than all the uptight New Yorkers. I could tell she was shy and introverted, and somewhat socially anxious. I think we may have connected, b/c I am in a way similar, but not as bad. So I got her number and said we should chill sometime and she sounded like she was down. She jokingly said that we should go surfing sometime since I am from Cali. I then made a mistake by inviting her to a party, and I could tell she wasn't really into that sort of thing, and she said that wasn't really her scene. I sort of knew that beforehand, but for some reason I thought it'd be a good idea. Either way, I got her number and we started texting a bit. After texting for a couple weeks, I found out that she has had a bf for 2 years. At this point, I was kind of confused b/c usually a girl would tell me right away when asking for her number or inviting her to hang out. This made me think she was either unhappy in her relationship, she was just being polite, or she was looking to upgrade. She is from an area in the city that is sort of ghetto, and she claims that she is poor. I have been living in Times Square only b/c my family owns real estate there(I myself am not rich and am not a trust fund baby like most other members in my family.) She knows that I live in Manhattan and asked once about my family's company and I just told her that they do real estate, but didn't talk much detail b/c they're one percenters and I really hate talking about them b/c its easy for ppl to think im being cocky or whatever. Also, one of my uncles is Robert Durst, who is a murderer awaiting trial, and I often avoid this conversation bc talking about it is kind of awkward. Either way, as the semester went on, we would continue seeing each other in class and talk a lot, but since I knew that she found out about my family I began to think she was only showing interest bc of my connection, and that maybe she was using me for an internship or something idk. Anyways, for some reason I really liked this girl and it seemed she liked me too. I could tell with other ppl she seemed very uncomfortable and rly anxious, but with me she seemed comfortable enough to talk and laugh and sort of be authentic. We would still text and talk about trivial stuff, but we would also send music to each other.I was back home in California for spring break and I was texting her, and jokingly said I wasn't coming back b/c I hated NYC. Later in the conversation she sent me this song  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDNCsA2I0o. I tried not to overthink it, but it seemed like a random song and I didn't know how to interpret it. I asked if there was meaning behind the song, but she said she just liked it. Anyways, the semester continued and she would still save me a seat everyday in class and sometimes when I would have to talk to the professor after class she would wait for me outside of class. We both usually went home after class, and we walked in similar directions so we would walk together. So our last class was last week and I didn't really get a chance to say what I wanted to her so I had to resort to texting, which I usually hate. I told her I thought she was a really special girl and that she had staying in my mind when she shouldn't have b/c she was taken, and some other corny stuff haha. She said thanks and stuff, saying it was sweet and that I was also a very awesome guy and that we should still stay in touch even if we didn't have class together. At this point, I honestly don't know if it is worth talking to her or thinking about her. For some reason, I was really intrigued by her shes pretty, super intelligent, and not caught up with fitting in and being like everyone else. I know this post was way too long, and its hard for anyone to really give advice b/c my post was sort of vague, but yeah I did my best haha. Any thoughts?"
4kcsp4,3,2016-05-21,"Me [30 M] with my fiance [27 F] of 2 years, is the insecurity too much to fix?",relatthrowaway428952,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4kcsp4/me_30_m_with_my_fiance_27_f_of_2_years_is_the/,"I've been dating my fiance for 2 years, proposed last year. During this time, there have been a lot of red flags that I've been trying to deal with and I'm not sure if its time to throw in the towel.

I'll start by saying that my fiance is a fairly insecure person in relationships. Her last ex cheated on her and I'm not sure she ever got over it. One of the issues we had in our relationship was that when we started dating, she was still continuing to talk with her ex. Not in a ""just friends"" type of way, but rather she was still emotionally attached and she admitted she was still in love with him when we started dating.

Either way, here is a short list of things that really are bothering me right now:

When we were still in law school, she would be upset at the fact that she would constantly text me/IM on gchat, and I didn't initiate contact much while I was in school. This is because I'm not very good at multitasking and can't have conversations with people and still pay attention in class. This would upset her because she thinks I didn't like her as much as she liked me, and assumed I never thought about her when we were apart.

When I started working on my summer internship, she would get angry when I wouldn't reply/chat with her when I was busy learning how to work in court. I took my job very seriously and this upset her and she would say I care more about my job than her. I would still try to find time to call her and we would always talk every night (we were doing LDR during this summer).

She would also constantly question me about women I work with, if there were attractive women, if I mentioned I had a girlfriend to them, etc.

During this time, she also told me that she couldn't handle me having any female friends that were anything more than acquaintances - her reasoning being that if I'm close friends with a woman then it means I want something more. THis really pissed me off because she continues to foster close relationships with men and would constantly talk to them about our relationship woes. She would always tell me how so and so thinks I'm wrong about some fight we have. I don't really care about her male friendships, but it seems kind of unfair.

Most recently I got my first job as an attorney, and she has become more upset than ever when I talk about really liking my job and the people I work with. She says that she thinks I'm going to leave her for someone that works in my area of law (she works in a different area of law) because they would have more in common with my career. She thinks because she doesn't share this important aspect of my life that we aren't good for each other. She would also grill me about what women I work with, if any of them are attractive, etc. She even went so far as to look up one of my coworkers on linkedin and then grilled me about the fact that she thought this woman was very attractive and thought I would form an inappropriate relationship with her.

She doesn't want me to go hang out with my new coworkers during happy hour without her because she thinks I will form friendships without her and she won't be included. I tell her I want her to join us but I would still want to go if she can't be there. I should add at this point that I moved 1000 miles away from home to live with her in our current location - I finally just got this job after being unemployed for 5 months and I have no friends or family here. I told her that making friends and socializing with my coworkers is important for me to transition into a permanent position (my job is currently temporary). She also continues to engage in the same behavior as when I was doing my internships - would get mad at me if I don't reply to her messages or don't call her on time during my lunch hour. She thinks I just want to get drunk all the time with my female coworkers.

I've never cheated on her and I'm not really a flirtatious guy. I've been with a lot of women in the past and that is one reason she cites for being insecure, and she also says I'm not very affectionate or make her feel secure. She says her last boyfriend acted very codependent and was always demanding her time and attention and I'm like the exact opposite - I like to have my own hobbies and friends (although I don't really have that now). We basically spend every night together. I just can't see why she doubts my commitment so much when I've proposed and uprooted myself across the country to be with her. I also seriously dampened my career prospects by moving to a new area where I had no networking connections and I'm just now trying to build professional relationships with people. I feel like she doesn't want me to have a career that I like and friends that aren't necessarily her friends.

I really like everything about her except this but its starting to really become a problem for us. I've gotten really upset at her when she pushes against my boundaries and it seems to just fuel further insecurity into an endless cycle. I keep trying to tell her how much I love her, but she thinks that if I actually did then I would want to constantly call her and make her my #1 priority all of the time. I just give her that kind of attention when I'm just starting out as an attorney and learning procedure. She admits that a lot of the insecurity is her own problem but just throws her hands up in the air and says she just can't be with a guy like me and needs someone who is a lot more like her ex who basically made her the centerpiece of his world.

What do I do?

All in all my mentor at my internship hates the guts out of me. They treath me completely different than the other intern (I had to leave for school like 3 times and got in massive trouble for that and he just gets 2 weeks off for no reason) and generally seems to try to make me feel even worse.

So i've mailed my teachers again, and they invited me for a meeting on school. In that meeting I basically got blamed for everything... this is what basically came out of it:

* ""Your Portfolio kinda sucks right now""
* ""You're really not good in selling yourself""
* ""You're way too introverted""
* ""You didn't get hired at first because of that, it's basically your own fault""

We talked about optons because i really don't feel like I belong in this company, the work they make suck and they work in a way i used to work before I even started this education, they work like massive amateurs. and what came out of that is that i just have to deal with it and go though it for the coming 7 weeks. so they called my mentor and he gave the following feedback as well

* ""She sucks at communicating""
* ""She's not motivated at all""
* ""She's not open to other ways of working""

And basically what everyone's saying is that it's my own fault and honestly I just want to jump of a building and die so all this shit is over. i'm an student enrolled in the excelence program, why is this shit happening to me?!

I want to be game dev (I want to be a game designer, but I'd like to be really well versed in the art of programming) and this semester I've got a programming course where I am learning sorting algorithms, linked lists and such (algorithms and data structures, basically).

I have already managed to collect enough points for a D (no pun intended), but I'm not sure I'll collect enough points for an A over my continuous assessment model (Bologna). 

I put pressure on myself to have an A because I feel that that A is going to prove that I'm good at programming. But I also want to pass everything over continuous assessment model  (no matter what the grade), so over the summer I can go home or maybe even work as an intern in one game dev company (we'll see how that goes).

I've been working for past 1.5 months as an intern in this company. After the next 2 weeks, there will be an opportunity for me to finish my internship and getting a junior position. 
My boss will probably present me with an offer, because of fast company growth and not enough people to code.

Here's the thing: I hate working here. I did everything I could to improve my well being and some things changed for the better, but overall I am not treated too well, boss is a dickhead, company's policy is morally wrong to me and so on. Still, staying here would be a nice entry in my CV.

Now, I recently got mostly positive feedback from 3 other dev companies, and they want me to take part in final recruitment steps for them. Generally there is a high chance of getting a job and those ones are good. But they will finish their process in about 3-4 weeks, about 1-2 weeks after I am to sign my new contract.

Would it be a smart move to just plainly go and tell my boss (after 2 weeks from now) that I want to postpone my promotion a little bit, because of other job offers? 
This would be a crazy thing, sure, but it would either result in my boss wanting to give me a better offer (profit) or him developing bias to myself (so nothing changes) or him firing me (kinda profit, because I hate working here and I might grab a chance from other companies).

What would you do if you were me? Have I lost my mind somewhere in those 1.5 months here or this is legitimate move?"

This resort is unique because it’s ONLY for couples and no one seems to know much about it, as people who won tickets have to sign nondisclosure agreements. But the rumor is that it’s really great, and most importantly one of the most exclusive in the world. I really want to do that trip, but have nobody to go with, so I ""catch"" you and drag you into it so I can go.

In that resort, a lot of activities are organised for couples. We quickly discover that some are mild, and some aren't at all. Romantic dinners, massage lessons with other couples or just the two of us, sexy cooking lessons, but also more kinky ones. Moreover, some employees can give dares to couples every time they see them, from kiss and grope each other right here (“here” being anywhere from an empty corridor public places)or skinny dipping to have sex in that place without getting caught (or make sure you do get caught by somebody). Each couple can choose anytime between 3 categories and activities and dare at the beginning of the day, but won’t know any details until they start. You can be an employee or a fan, or some rich friend and you have to act like your bf. At the beginning You'd probably kind of shy/nervous because of all of this, hanging out and pretending to be with THAT celeb's boyfriend. On my side I'm having a blast, enjoying myself and keeping us from all the things you'd love to try.

And from here, the scenario can go differen ways depending on what you want to do, your kinks &amp; limits… So let’s discuss it

Do youstart to enjoy yourselfself and we both start to take part is more and more daring activities? Do you figure out that you can take advantage of the situation, start to get more and more touchy every time you can? Trying to get us into the hottest activities, and if I refuse to play along threaten to expose us as a fake couple? Or maybe you start to even blackmail me after getting some serious leverage, and get me to do everything you want.

LOTS of possibilities, with either a young celeb and an older employee, assistant, agent... Or an older one with the new intern or some fan she randomly picked, I'm open to suggestions !

With FC Cincinnati offering $5 tickets for students, I couldn't pass them up!

I've always loved the idea of grassroots soccer and huge amounts of support, regardless of place on the league pyramid; I'm blown away at the fact that 20,000+ will pledge their support for a club in what is regarded as the third tier in American soccer. Last summer I worked as an intern for Crew SC, and I certainly know how to appreciate a good crowd. 

Anyway, I was wondering when would be the best match to attend and plan around, with regard to the remaining games of the regular season. Also, I'd like to get some information on parking.

I plan on watching this with a friend who goes to UC and is down there for the summer, so he has an apartment very close to campus. I'll update the relative location once I finalize it with him.

Can't wait to experience a match down there, good luck with the rest of the season, and we hope to see you past Tampa Bay so we can meet up in the US Open Cup!

After 2 years, I was put on academic suspension so I left the school and took a year off. I then enrolled in a community college and did much better. I graduated now with an associate's degree in engineering science and a 3.8 GPA and As in all the Calcs and general science/physics/basic engineering courses. But I was rejected from all the 4 year schools I applied to. Every single one told me they couldn't look past my poor performance in the past. What can I do now? Are my dreams of being an engineer over?

I am a rising sophomore at an ""okay"" state school. This summer I will be interning at a company making $8,000 a month for 3 months. My apartment, transport, and food are paid for so I have virtually no expenses. Because of financial aid my mom is able to help pay for school, but she expects me to start pitching in with the money I earn this summer (which I agree with). I am 18 years old and have no debt aside from federal loans. 

What I'm concerned about is financial aid in a year from now (for the 2017-2018 school year). Since the money I earned this year has increased significantly, I know that my financial aid for my Junior year will be significantly smaller. Of course, I'll try to get an equally (or greater) paying internship for next summer, but there is no guarantee of that.

My questions are:

* Should I pay off my existing loans so they don't pile up, or use everything towards paying my tuition for this school year?

* Is there anything I can do to minimize the impact of having little/no aid in my Junior year?

Any other general financial advice regarding my situation is also greatly appreciated. Thank you! :)"

But I figured the question of pay is well suited for here. Having second interviews for a CMMS start up. 

So, basiclly the job is,

- In a very low cost of living location in Canada. Rent for me is 600$. 900$ is nice 1 bedroom rent. 
- For a 12 person start up with 3 remote agents overseas. 
- About 10 years old, has several major local clients but less outside of the area.
- Duties explained as 30% remote training and teaching for the program. 
- 60% being Sales Liaison for previous clients and incoming sale leads, gathering data and getting quotes and feature listings. 
- 5% in person training and quotes. Low possibility of travel outside city. Rare possibility of US travel.
- 5% coffee running intern, receptionist, dropping mail off at post office
- Full time, permanent, salary, Mon to Fri 9-5, basic health benefits package, no RRSP matching 

Job Requirements,

- CS degree or marketing degree
- 3 years sale experience 
- Knowledge of SalesForce MeetingtoGo and some assorted programs
- Technical aptitude, good customer service skills, about 5 more soft skills

What I actually have,

- 6 semesters of Applied Computer Science
- Associates-level degree in TV and Radio 
- 10 years retail, food, call center experience 
- 6 months management 
- 3 years (freelance) paid web experience
- Knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and WordPress. Basic knowledge of Python, Java ( and Flash ActionScript I haven't used in a few years and AppInventor )
- Several years of teaching parents and union reps how to use WordPress, QuickBooks, Excel... general computer repair knowledge. Some paid work fixing phones and computers. 
- Valid passport for US travel, car access for on site

They seem to be taking my bullshitting of well I've freelanced and therefore have experience selling my self and are calling me back for a final interview. Money will come up soon.

My friends are saying to ask for 1.50$ over minimum wage ( so 12.50$ ) but some of the CSJ / internship jobs in other fields are paying up to 14-17$ a hour. I don't want to price my self out of the market but I don't want to make minimum wage. 

My gut feeling is 30k to 40k a year is the range, and I'd love to make 32-35k. It's been hinted that there is a large possibility of a raise once I get my degree finished and I plan on staying 2-4 years depending on my ablity to finish school part time.

Anyone who's been in this kinda job want to share their salary? The company is not on GlassDoor."

In the recent months I have found that motion design has become a possible career for me rather than just a hobby.  However before I commit to a degree in graphic/motion design I want to see how a job in the field would be like.  I've researched a few internships in my area, but after looking at some of the requirements t seems that I am able to meet a few requirements but not all.  I am also not confident that the experience I have is exactly what is looked for in an intern.  Since I am self taught I am not familiar with any professional standards or norms.  I was hoping to learn these standards as an intern, but I am not completely certain if that would be acceptable.

Right now my main problem is that I cannot find any courses offered by my school district that I can take to meet the requirements needed, and the online courses needed are way out of my price range.

Basically I'm asking if I should still apply to the internship, or wait til college to take a courses in motion design.  And if I should wait what can I do in the mean time to improve myself."
4kf8h8,0,2016-05-21,"Questions from a transfer student (totally new school, totally new major)",MoWards,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4kf8h8/questions_from_a_transfer_student_totally_new/,"So after high school I went to a public state college for 2 years for a liberal arts degree. Even though i had high grades in math and science in high school with high honors I still didn't think I wanted to pursue a scientific career. I love working with people and am very involved in our government affairs so my major was political science. I just completed my second year... and although i kept up my high grades I just didn't see a path for me in poli sci. I took an introductory cs class and fell in love with coding. I wanted to switch to cs major but my current school has a crazy high tuition and I would have to go for 3 more year at least to complete the BS. Fuck that. So right now I've made a decision to go to a smaller state school and do kind of a fresh start. Unfortunately while many of the liberal arts classes can transfer, the BS program at this smaller school just doesn't require that much gen ed stuff. So with those classes transferring and some cs and math transferring it looks like I will be around a sophomore stance when i start school in august. So in conclusion even though I am a junior in terms of college experience my ""fresh"" start will put me at a sophomore level. So here are a few questions

 1. What on earth do I put on my resume as my current stance? Do I put junior but add that I'm a sophomore standing? Do I just put sophomore? There's a small chance that I will be a second semester freshman level too so then what do i put? 

 2. What do I say about my 2 years prior to changing school/major? I didn't get an associate degree. Just took classes. Do I just not mention the fact that I went 2 years to another school for a different major?

 3. Am I screwing myself from internships and opportunities? I see so many people here getting internships and research work as a freshman and if I transfer I feel like ill be behind a lot of people.

 4. Will employers look suspiciously at the difference between my high school graduation date and college graduation date? It will most likely be a 5 to 6 year difference which might give off the idea that I screwed around for 6 years in the degree.

 5. Am I at a disadvantage because I will graduate at an older age?

All in all I just want some guidance on whether I am making a responsible choice for my future. I like coding and it is honestly interesting to me on a deep level. I'm just afraid that I will miss out on opportunities that would have been given to me if I just started with cs and am feeling kinda depressed that i wasted 2 years on something I ended up not being passionate about. Thanks for reading guys I know its a bother to read these panicky Shit but you guys honestly help a lot."

I'd first like to apologize if this isn't the correct subreddit to be posting in, I was unsure of where exactly to post to get the best advice. 

I'm currently an undergrad (rising senior) who recently decided to pursue a career in InfoSec. I'm an Economics major and have only basic knowledge of programming but I do attend a public university regarded for having one of the best Computer Science departments in the world.

I am currently considering 2 options:

1) Stay an extra semester in college to complete a Computer Science degree. It would be rather rigorous since I'll be having to cram a major into 1.5 years (including summers, meaning no real opportunity to pursue an internship or get work experience in the industry before I graduate.)

2) Simply graduate early with an Economics degree, try to get into internships/jobs in an InfoSec/IT-related field (which will definitely not be easy) and get work experience and learn about InfoSec material/learn how to code on my own through online resources. 

I just wanted to ask you all for advice on what my best course of action would be. Thank you for your time.

4kfrwv,14,2016-05-21,My [19F] mother [40sF] tries to manipulate me into doing nothing but study. I feel caged now that I’ve returned from college. Help?,snagglet00thvanzejy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4kfrwv/my_19f_mother_40sf_tries_to_manipulate_me_into/,"I have contemplated making this post for ages. Here it goes. (it's long, I'm sorry)


My parents are extremely conservative Christian immigrants from Hong Kong. Sex, drugs, alcohol are all unthinkable. Living with a boyfriend before marriage is wrong, and probably a disown-able offense. My mom is more overbearing than my dad is; he takes a more passive role in my life, and sides with my mom on basically everything. 


On the other hand, I’m an introverted 19 y/o who has moved away from the church (breaking news of that to my parents was quite the shitshow; my mom still constantly tries to drag me to church, coerce me to pray, read the bible, etc). I have sex, drink, smoke sometimes—all under the radar (and I’m careful not to let any hints drop, because I’d probably be disowned). 


I’m pretty independent, in that I don’t really need nor want someone telling me how to manage my life; in high school, I’d divvy up my time such that I always got my work done. My mom, however, would needlessly ride my ass about doing homework or studying. She still does this, but instead of homework, it’ll be “did you call the clinic yet?” or “remember to pick up your order.” Additionally, I’m a packrat while she’s an anti-hoarder. 


You can see why we don’t mesh very well. We've never been close.


Growing up so sheltered in suburban America, I always felt like an alien. I wasn’t allowed to read Harry Potter, because “it was about witchcraft.” I wasn’t allowed to Trick-or-Treat, because I shouldn’t celebrate the Devil. I wasn’t allowed to play soccer, because “that’s a boy’s sport.” (When I was 15 and my unathleticism caught up to my health, my mom suddenly flipped and said I could “play any sport.” By then, it was too late to get started on the years of training others have had to be competitive for team sports.) We couldn’t watch football, because my dad thought it was stupid to watch sports instead of playing them (????????????). 


My mom always disdained my efforts to fit in; she always told me that “friends come and go, but God is forever.”


Despite this, I feel like I’ve raised myself, and cultivated the best parts of me. I graduated high school with top honors, and as one of the best writers in my class. When I realized the tutoring program my mom enrolled me in was a stupid waste of money, I stopped going and self-studied for the SAT, and passed with kickass scores. I received a 4.0 my first two semesters of college (and I completely acknowledge that there are classes way harder than the ones I took my freshman year, but I’m trying to explain that I am in no way a slacker or lazy about school—actually a bit of a workaholic). I read up on sex ed and taught myself everything I needed to have safe sex. I eased into alcohol with caution. I undid all the racist and homophobic ideology she conditioned me to believe. And currently, I’m trying to hone the social skills I’ve neglected for years through forcing myself to engage in small talk—but that’s a different issue.


**My parents hate my boyfriend.** Last summer, they found a long love letter he wrote me, which talked about how much he loved parts of my body (a bit about my butt, but more about my undercut, hands, that sort of thing). My mom found it somehow and read through the entire thing. She justified it like this: “I’m sorry for reading through it—it was just lying there!” They’re convinced he’s a sexual predator, when he’s actually the furthest from one—think respectful of boundaries, loving, caring, etc. 


They’ve been awful about my relationship ever since; my boyfriend’s family will invite them over for Thanksgiving, for Christmas—my mom will just ask me when I’m coming back. This has been really heartbreaking for both him and me.


Which brings me to how **my mom never respects my privacy:** when I was younger, she found and read through my diary during a fight between us, and told me she was disappointed I was so shallow. (I was in elementary/middle school, and only wrote in my diary about boys and drama, because those were the only notable things that happened in life then. Whoops?) 


When I was 16, she read through a Skype chat I had with a friend about sex (not sexting by any means, just talking about porn and masturbation) and grounded me for a month. My computer doesn’t have a webcam, so I had been Skyping my ex/then-boyfriend on her laptop and forgot to log out. She claimed the chat was just open on her computer, but to find what she did, she had to open the chat with my friend (remember, I left it open on my ex) and scroll waaay back to find anything incriminating. 


**My mom is awful at respecting my passions and desires.** When I started winning poetry contests, she told me to keep “writing more stock.” She called my writing “stock,” as if it was something devoid of effort or talent. She complains that I use Facebook too much when I don’t go out; when I go out, she complains that I go out too much (more on that below). 


Last summer, I took up SEWING as a serious hobby. She told me I needed to stop wasting my time sewing. When I was excited about getting into my dream school (a bit of a reach), she told me she “already thought [I’d] get in.” She also didn’t want to help finance my dream school—understandably, but she wouldn’t take any measures to land me there at all: I asked her about writing a letter negotiating scholarship money, and she told me to do it myself. I ended up going to my state school. 


**My mom is always passive aggressive with me whenever I leave the house and “stay out late.”** When I was younger, she would give me pushback about hanging out, but I thought it was just because she didn’t want to drive me around all the time. Now, I can drive myself, but she’ll still give me grief about how I “hang out too much.” My parents don’t hang out at all: no coworkers are ever over, no friends are ever visited. In turn, my sister [17F] and I rarely hung out with friends when we were kids. Even now, her friends will come over to our doorstep, only to be turned away by my mom—“I’m sorry, she needs to study.”


My curfew feels arbitrary; it was once 11pm, rarely 11:30, and she eventually pushed it back to 10:30. When I’m out, I’m usually with my boyfriend. Sometimes other friends will be there and it’ll be a gathering of sorts, but his presence is a given. I’m not always explicit with her about this, but I think she just assumes this to be true regardless. She'll always stay up ""late"" for my return. When I come home, she'll usually open the door before I can, and give me a glare + passive aggressive words before she storms off to sleep.


On NYE, I went to my boyfriend’s house for a gathering. She told me I had to be back by 1am, then later said 11pm. I came back at 1am and got the evilest eye, along with “I said to come back by 11.” (The ball fucking drops at 12, and she knows this; we used to host NYE parties all the time til 1 or 2). 


Sometimes when I get home, she tells me that if I’m only going to “date” when I’m back from college, I might as well not come back. My sister defended me once, asking her what I was supposed to do instead. She told my sister to shut up and promptly walked upstairs.


Yesterday, she gave me permission to stay out ‘til 12. My sister told me that while I was out, my mom vented about how I always go out, and said I should spend more time studying. (I just moved out of college and finished my final exams. What could I possibly have been studying?) She’ll also complain about how I didn’t do many chores in high school, but guess what I was doing all the damn time back then?—**STUDYING**. 


Once, I showed her what my boyfriend brought back for my sister from his vacation, in an attempt to show his thoughtfulness. She told me to tell him to stop buying my sister gifts, and that I shouldn’t date guys for money, and that I should turn back to God instead of using guys to compensate.


**Fights with her are the worst.** Gaslighting, manipulation, and anything I’ve EVER done wrong will come into play. Even if I use the soundest logic known to man, she won’t respond but will continue to glare at me. She also never apologizes anymore. I’ve learned to just not talk to her when one of us is upset at the other.


I’ve suspected her to be a mild narc for a while now; I think I’ve inherited some of her more negative traits (gaslighting, manipulation, scorekeeping), and I’ve recently began thinking I may be borderline—so take that into perspective when you read this. 



I’ve given a lot of background and explanation here; **my main issue at the moment is that being home with her is insufferable.** I’ve considered going NC once I save up enough money to dip, but right now I have pretty much no savings, and my internship this summer is 9 hours + 2 hours commute time, all unpaid. Is there any way to get her off my back so I can leave the house without feeling stressed each time about an impending blowout or passive aggression? What are your thoughts?
   

**tl;dr**: My (probably narcissistic) mother complains whenever I use my computer ""too much,"" or hang out ""too much."" She even complained when I took up an innocuous pastime (sewing)–said I was spending too much time on it. **I literally can do no right unless I am studying.** I'm home from college, and I want to be able to leave the house without feeling like a criminal when I return home. What can I do?

First of all, sorry for any grammatical mistakes - I am not a native english speaker. Ok, let's get started: I have been searching the internet for quite some time now, asking people if they know recruiters or someone working in HR who could possibly answer my question - but no luck so far. Then I stumbled onto this subreddit and thought to give it a try.

I'm a guy in his mid 20s living in Germany. I did my Bachelor's in Business Administration (specialized in Operations Management) and I am right now doing my Masters in Business Administration (Major Operations Management, Minor Finance). I have less than two semester left before I graduate, so not even a year. My grades are not perfect but definitely above average. The part about my life that keeps worrying me right now, is, that I have never done an internship. But: I have been working for over three years at the IT department of my university. We basically are the main IT help desk for students as well as employees and have a wide range of tasks regarding all kinds of IT-related things you can imagine at a university.

I have read ""you will never find a job if you haven't done any internships"" so many times. And this scares me due to the fact that I haven't done any. You are probably asking why?! One reason is my long distance relationship (we're talking 5000 miles). Schoolbreaks were the only time we really had time to see each other for a couple of weeks. So that took up half of the time of almost every break. Reason 2 is that my current IT job at the university needs me. We are always open and there is a constant demand for our assistance and due to my unique position (I'm the only person giving OSX/iOS support), I'm kinda needed. During some lectures, we had many guest speakers from large companies which also talked about career opportunities and how they won't offer internships under 3-6 months. Since our breaks aren't as long as of americans (we usually have two 6-8week breaks per year) there wasn't really much time for long internships without me quitting my job and missing a whole semester of classes. Quitting my job was never an option because it provided safe and constant income for my whole time as a student and I really like it as well (I'm kinda into technology and computers, too).

So what I'm actually wondering is if i will be able to get a job (I know it's sad wondering about that). On the one hand, yes, I have not done any internships. On the other hand, when I will be graduating, I will have 4+ years job experience at the university's IT department. I'm just having doubts about how a recruiter will think about this job since it has not directly anything to do with degree. Will I be fine and shouldn't worry or should I try to get an internship before I graduate (I would probably just do it after my master's thesis)?

Thanks for any advice in advance and for reading all that text. I will highly appreciate EVERY reply!! :-)

Update: Fixed some spelling boo-boos :).. 

TL;DR: Soon graduate. Mid 20s. B.Sc. in Business Administration (Major Operations) &amp; soon M.Sc. in Business Administration (Major Operations, Minor Finance). Never had an internship, but after graduating 4+ years of job experience at university's IT department. Will I find a job? Or should I do an internship asap?"

I have a plethora of skills and I am in need of a huge change. I am willing to intern or apprentice under someone if possible. I learn new tasks quickly and have a unique work ethic.

I graduated HS in 09' went directly into Community college with 17 credit hours the first semester. After two semesters I began working for a pool company designing 3D Cad renders for clients.

Decided to take a brake from the pool company after a year and school and went into the Oil and Gas sector for 1.5 years until it went south recently and the company let me go along with a hundred other people.

This role made me very professional as I was in all three fields (office, plant, and field) and saw how a professional Billion dollar company ran. My computer skills were a huge bonus and got me very far. I was their technician for their product and would go into remote areas thousands of miles from home on a seconds notice without any refusal from me because I wanted to make money. A major one is the understanding of a business from entire financial side and being careful with ""consumable"" products and items that the business uses.

I Spent 6 months applying to oil field companies and never got any leads, huge waste of time as they were all completely going down hill. I almost never want to go back into that sector.

I found some guy on Craigslist running a wood shop out of his home. It was near my home, about a 15 minute drive. And he was genuinely a very nice person. We had more in common then differences. He too was in oil and gas... But still employed at the time.

He left me in his workshop at his house with all his tools while he went to church. I felt good that he trusted me and I respected everything 100% and didn't sit on my cell phone. I always helped him clean up the shop too. It was only a Christmas seasonal item so It was just a temporary thing.  I learned so much from him and really fell back into love with woodworking.

So I began building a few business plans and ideas to work for myself, such as pressure washing driveways/patios and doing mobile car detailing/maintenance. But before I run myself into a hole trying to work for myself, I really want to try and see what else is available for me. The only thing local to me is service/food/entertainment paying min wage (7.25) and barely getting 10 hours a week.

I refuse to accept help from the government after I was laid off. I was somewhat stuck with bills and no income and needed to rethink my necessities. I hit rock bottom paying auto insurance and my bills. Sold my car and bought a much older vehicle, now my insurance is 1/5 the cost and I have more flexible spending. I only eat in now also which saves a ton of money. I am now officially a frugal man.

I really want to thrive.

*Skilled in Horticulture/Botany 
 -with extreme knowledge in marijuana growing, including sex identification, cloning, disease identification, cleanliness and I am huge on contaminations. Thinking well outside the box on things.

*Automotive maintenance/repairs/diagnostics/modifications/lifts

*Full car audio installs/lights/switches anything and everything.

*Very experienced with 12v installs both on cars and similar applications that could be very essential for solar power systems.

*I can build custom computers/diagnose hardware issues in seconds.

*Extremely computer savy, Photoshop to Autocad and 3Ds Max and much more.

*and much more"

I am enrolled as a dual enrolled student meaning I only take college classes which count as both high school and college credit. I intend to graduate with a Bachelors in Computer Science by the time I'm 19 which is pretty impressive. The problem is that I have a speech impediment. The severity of it changes day to day, but worsens in stressful situations. To give you an idea, I would say that I have a 2 second pause near the beginning and possibly again sometime in the middle of the sentence where my face tenses up and I am unable to speak.

I have always gotten accommodations in school so I could avoid speaking situations, but I am getting to the age where I need to start thinking about applying to a internships and jobs. Although I have yet to apply or interviewed for any jobs, I know that I will have a hard time getting a job due to my stutter. The thing I fear the most is the interview process. I would say that I am pretty smart and I have a lot going for me, just I would like to know how I can express this in an interview without getting rejected. I would also like to know any general tips you can give me on how I can approach an interview with a stutter.

4kgkc2,382,2016-05-21,"How to be slightly less of a scrub, in Dota 2 and in life. (Special shout out to 4k players.)",FunkadelicJiveTurkey,DotA2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4kgkc2/how_to_be_slightly_less_of_a_scrub_in_dota_2_and/,"This isn't a guide about improving your game mechanics or farm efficiency. This is just some advice, which to me should be obvious but my experience with Dota has shown otherwise. This has applications outside of Dota and will potentially help you progress in any merit based field throughout your life.

Enough suspense. Since we love memes, this can be summed up with 2 quotes from The Rock: ""Know your role and shut your mouth. (Jabroni)"" and ""It doesn't matter what you think.""
Essentially, learn to acknowledge your betters.

Now most Dota games consist of players of relatively close MMR. Most of the 2k games with team infighting and accusations of 'noob' are the proverbial pot calling the kettle black. Minor differences in MMR (personally I'd say even so far as 500+\-) don't really mean much. However the greater the difference, the safer it is to assume that this person is indeed a better player than you. Sometimes you get matched with a person who is significantly higher than you. Typically this happens when that person is in a party and has significantly higher solo than party MMR. This also happens naturally in solo queue at around 4.3k+. This is why these players get a special mention, congratulations you've made it into the top 1% or so of all players, and going forward the player base thins out so much that sometimes you get 6k+ players dumped into 4k avg games. The 6k+ players stuck in these games though, more often than not...they. fucking. hate it.

Full disclosure, I too am a mid4k scrub at the moment so I can't truly speak for these 6kers but I believe I have a very good idea of why they hate it so much. (And if 6k peeps read this, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.) Part of it is surely because they'd rather be challenged by their 6k peers but that's not the brunt of it. The main reason is that the 4k scrubs they're playing with, quite often, are so smug and full of themselves that they believe themselves equal if not better. This is a huge problem because...sorry 4k bros but the vast extreme, I can't emphasize this enough, majority of the time you are not. The problem with presuming yourself the equal of a superior player, is that you're less inclined to listen to them. You could be treating this as a valuable opportunity to learn from someone, but instead you're busy fighting this guy over mid - and if the other team also has a 6k who goes mid vs you (and who didn't buy their account) then more likely than not you will finish 1-12-4 struggling to come up with excuses for why it's not your fault.

I've seen this happen often enough but what compelled me to make this post is a special case I witnessed the other day. Our team had a TI winner on it. He had to pick relatively early because half the team felt they needed to hide their brilliant drafting skills (from both teams) til 4th or 5th pick. We get to 5th pick. We need a second support. Our first support is a KotL. The enemy has a bounty. TI winner says ""Even at 4k BH is obnoxious. Can you please get sentries and a support that can roam mid. Spirit breaker would be great."" We wait in anticipation as the timer ticks to zero and our 5th player continues to scroll through heroes seemingly at random and we get....Oracle. Nice. The person who has won the biggest Dota 2 tournament and does this for a living asks 1 simple request from you...and you can't grant that cause you know better. (PS: He didn't get sentries either, from either support iirc.) He still did quite well all things considered, but he couldn't really snowball, and it seemed like half our team was doing their best to undermine him. WHY? Him being a known pro player made it, to me, particularly egregious but even if he wasn't if he was just some random nobody that is over 2k mmr above you...might you entertain the notion that he might know what he's talking about and it's worth entertaining doing the thing that he politely asked of you?

That problem is endemic to Dota across brackets. Sometimes I play with friends who are half my MMR or less and the same thing happens. Now hey low 2k players, I am not Arteezy, or Miracle, whomever your Dota idol is. I'm not even close. But newsflash, 4.5k is quite a big leap from 2.1k. It is safe to assume that I play better than you, and that I know better than you. Even if you don't, I understand this, and have adjusted accordingly. I am not interested in flaming every little mistake you make or micromanaging what you should be doing. Those games tend to go one of 2 ways for me: Either the team listens to the little things I ask (""Hey guys, it's 8m, can someone make the chick fly please?"" ""TP is on cd 15s. Don't fight that. Stick by the tower."") and games are easy, or they actively ignore and do the opposite of what I ask which usually results in unnecessary deaths and the game becomes entirely dependent on if I am able to snowball in spite of everything vs a fed enemy.

This advice, should you choose to heed it, will serve you well in life in any field that has a high skill and\or knowledge ceiling. I, as a good but not exceptional guitarist, have had the pleasure to sit in with some truly world class musicians (arguably living legends). In these cases, I've treated it like an honor, studied what they do, and if they tell me to play a chord progression I'm happy to oblige. I don't start blasting fuzzbox solos every time they try to speak. Good luck going through medical school when you're asked to assist on an operation and when the head surgeon asks you for a scalpel you reply ""Nah fuck you, have some forceps cause I said so."" Good luck staying on a film shoot when you, the intern, start condescendingly lecturing the director of photography how to capture this next shot. And so on and so forth. 

Ok. End rant.

TL;DR: Get a grip. Realize you are not the bestest at everything. Pay your dues and respect the people who already have. Maybe one day you will be the best Dota player the world has ever seen but that day is not today; and that day will definitely never happen if you're hellbent on being a smug, conceited, shit heel to the many talented people you will meet along the way.

Edit: Somewhat abridged upon request. Still long. Can't really be helped. There's tldr for that anyway.

Edit 2: Thanks for the responses and the upvotes. For the record though, I didn't write this to justify being a condescending asshole on account of epeen either. I thought it was clear that there are many players of all ranges of MMR that these criticisms don't apply to. Also, there's nothing inherently wrong with being mediocre in a video game you play for entertainment. There is something inherently wrong with not listening to constructive and simple instructions\suggestions\whatever you want to call it given by someone with more knowledge on a subject, often said for your own benefit too, in a collaborative setting; because outside Dota that's the difference between ""Gj"" and a hospital visit when your Father asks you to hold a ladder."

I just found out that who she hired a few weeks ago is a 20 year old, very tall, very attractive male.

She told me in passing about him and a couple of the other interns, but I thought nothing of it. I just had the image in my head of a snot nosed college student trying to learn the ropes, nothing to be intimidated by.

Well a friend of mine called me the other day and told me he saw my wife out to lunch with this young guy and that he just wanted to let me know.

I brought it up to her and she told me it was her intern and that they go out to lunch on occasion just to go over things.

I got upset and I haven't talked to her since. 

I looked him up online and he is far more attractive than I am and I am just not comfortable with this situation.

She knows I am upset and has asked me to talk, but I don't know what to say right now. I don't want her to lose attraction because of my jealousy.

**INTRODUCTION**

My name is Andrew, 28 year old professional from New York. I am 6'5, 220 pounds, blonde hair, blue eyes, with a strong build and broad, muscular shoulders. My hard outer appearance is contrasted sharply and juxtaposed by my sweet tender inside and penchant for kindness.

I share a deep affinity for story-telling and writing in general and my past prompts and posts have usually tried to demand a higher level of grammar, imagination, detail and literacy in the responses as I feel that's the best way to keep a story alive and fresh and prevent it from becoming stale or having either side decide they may as well just watch some porn.

I've been posting on DPP for a long time and today I am in the mood for something a bit more vanilla as I hope to engage a more diverse population of those individuals who frequent this lovely sub-reddit. I've been seeing some especially great prompts recently and want to make sure I'm not alienating anyone by requesting the same prompts/kinks.

**PROMPTS**

I've narrowed down my prompt ideas into separate categories, each with their own plot lines and twists and can incorporate other ideas as well and are all up for discussion!

**(1)NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR**

I've just moved in to town from the high powered life of New York City as an attorney working in Manhattan. I've grown tired of the constant hustle and am looking for a more small-town feel. I've gotten a job at the local law firm, a boutique operation specializing in real estate closings and is more in line with the slower pace I hope to find. You have been living in the small town of Paradise Springs your whole life and are intrigued at the new neighbor that you have. We spark a conversation and begin a slow and gentle courtship.

**(2)THE CO-WORKERS**

Similar premise to the above prompt, only we have been holding on to a work friendship for nearly three years now. Always amiable to one another, we never really felt any kind of emotional spark together, just a simple friendship between two people who understand each other. Perhaps one of us goes through a particularly harrowing time (i.e. a breakup, death in the family, etc.) and relies significantly on the other for support, where a new tenderness seems to blossom.

**(3)THE ANNIVERSARY**

This one would center around a pre-existing romantic relationship and be premised upon a one year anniversary, perhaps even six months or something of the like to mark a very special time in a budding new love affair.
Long-time lurker here and have finally decided to put my ""hat in the ring"" so to speak and try my hand at roleplaying and seeing if I can get any quality responses and to return the favor!



**(4)OFFICE AFFAIR**

The office affair with some kind of added twist. You could be my boss, peer, secretary or intern but we are both married and over time the sexy innuedos and flirting get taken further and further as we both realize we don't get what we want at home. But there's more to you than meets the eye. You decide what it is! 

**(5)THE ELEVATOR**

The woman in the elevator. Weeks have gone by and at least twice a week I ride the elevator up with you. It's the best 60 seconds of my day. My god you're gorgeous and you always give a crooked smile when I get on. And that little hair flip as you tell me to ""Have a nice day!"" when I get off the elevator knowing I've been checking you out. But one day the elevator is overly crowded and we are pushed against each other and I just can't stop myself from getting hard and you feel it against your ass...

**(6)INCEST**

Mom/sister drama queen. You're always the damsel in distress and every time you come to me over something petty and annoying but I know you rely on me quite heavily and I'm always there for you. But this time it's serious. You're going to have to hide out with me in my apartment for who knows how long. And that sexual tension that's been there since I was 12... surfaces and I have to try and deal with you getting a little too close when my mind is else where. 

I've written much longer prompts before that are more specific and if you wanted to check those out by all means please do. I really want to find a long term roleplay partner but I understand we have to be able to connect for that to happen. 

**KINKS**

My favorite kinks are: 

* Vanilla/Romance
* Anal
* Facials
* Blowjobs
* Cuddling
* Kissing

PM me and let me know what you'd like to try and if there is anything you would like to change or add to any of the prompts. I really enjoy having my partner have equal say in the set up and role of characters! 

I can't wait to talk to you soon"
4kh9u1,904,2016-05-22,"My [47M] son [19M] is angry that my niece/his cousin [19F] moved in with me. Today, he locked her out of the house.",disrespectfulson19,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4kh9u1/my_47m_son_19m_is_angry_that_my_niecehis_cousin/,"Hello, everyone. In advance, thank you for reading this post. I’m at my wit’s end here and I really need some unbiased insight. 

First, I’ll provide some background that I think is relevant.

My son “Seth” is my only child from my second marriage. His mother “Lydia” [47F] and I divorced when he was four years old. He was very upset when this happened. The entire process was very hard on him. All he wanted was for us to get back together. However, it was Lydia who decided that she didn’t want to be married and that she didn’t want to raise a kid. She just wanted her freedom back, what she had when she was living the single life. I wanted to go to marriage counseling and work things out, but she just wanted a divorce. Eventually, I acquiesced. Seth went to live with her, and he came to my house on the weekends. (Lydia didn’t want to raise a kid, but she did want a kid around when she felt like having one around. She only wanted to be a parent when it was fun.) Currently, Lydia and I are courteous with each other, but we only talk when we absolutely need to. Seth is much, much closer to her than he is to me because she’s the “fun parent” and because I remarried to a woman that he dislikes.  

I remarried when Seth was fourteen to my current wife “Michelle” [45F]. I dated Michelle for ten years before I married her, and she moved in with me three years into our relationship. The reason why I dated Michelle for ten years before I married her is because of Seth. He has never liked Michelle. To him, this woman has been trying to replace his mother for his entire life. I thought that marrying her would drive him away, and I didn’t want that. So I waited. For ten years, yes, and I understand that that’s a ridiculously long time, but I just wanted to do what I thought was best for Seth. I didn’t want him to be unhappy. I didn’t want him to hate me. I made this major sacrifice because I didn’t want to completely lose him to his mother, who may be the “fun parent”, but is irresponsible, immature, and a bad role model. She is not a good influence on Seth, and because of the way she approaches parenting (which is not really parenting at all), he will never reach his full potential. I wanted to make sure that he would grow up right, so I tried to stay in his life as long as possible by keeping my relationship with Michelle at bay. But after I married her, Seth grew much more distant, as I feared but ultimately expected. However, he still has his own bedroom in my house. I always invite him to family functions, even though he always turns me down. I keep the door open for him in case he ever wants to reconnect. He knows that he’s always welcome in my home. He has yet to accept it, but I remain firm on being there for him. 

Now, onto the actual issue. 

Michelle moved in with me when Seth was seven years old, and after she moved in, her niece “Olivia” started visiting us, and her and Seth grew very close. They spent almost all of their time together as children. They were best friends. They were completely inseparable. 

However, around the time that Seth and Olivia became preteens, Seth started protesting about Olivia. He didn’t want her to come over anymore. He didn’t want to spend time with her. He didn’t want anything to do with Michelle’s family, and that included Olivia. And I listened to him. Olivia stopped coming over. If she did come over, it was with her parents, and it was always when Seth wasn’t around. Currently, Olivia and Seth rarely talk. They haven’t been true friends in years. However, I still continued to see Olivia often because of Michelle. 

Last June, Olivia’s mother (Michelle’s sister) and father died in a car accident. Michelle and I made arrangements for Olivia to move in with us. She went off to college, and she came back for Thanksgiving and winter break. She is now back for summer vacation. She was already an independent adult when she moved in with us, so we’re not her legal guardians or her adoptive parents. But we do care for her and look out for her as if she were our child. After her parents died, she needed parental figures in her life, even though she was technically an adult. 

Seth didn’t discover that Olivia has moved in with me until recently, and that’s because he rarely talks to me anymore. (I’m not sure where he thought she was living after her parents died…but it doesn’t matter.) He currently lives in the basement of his girlfriend’s house (she’s still in high school) and he has a job working on cars. So he’s living his own life. To him, he has no reason to care about what goes on in my house.

At the beginning of this month, Seth came to my house to pick up some clothes, and when he walked into the basement, he saw where Olivia’s been living for the past year. He asked Olivia what was going on, and when she explained everything, he ran upstairs and started yelling at me. He was angry beyond belief. I tried having a rational conversation with him, but he wasn’t having any of it. He kept saying things like “she’s not even your daughter” and “she’s an adult, why can’t she get her own place?” It was extremely frustrating. He wouldn’t listen to a word of what I had to say. He left soon after. I didn’t hear from him for several weeks, until last week when he came over to retrieve some of his music from our desktop computer. He dropped by, did what he had to do, and left without a word. 

Today, Olivia had a Skype interview at 4PM for an internship position. At 3:30, she went outside to move the trash cans to the curb. When she went outside, she passed by Seth as he was walking in and said hi to him. He stops by whenever he needs to get something, so she didn't think anything of it. However, she didn't get to go back inside. When she went outside to move the trash cans, Seth locked all of the doors. She had also left her phone inside, so she couldn’t call me or Michelle for help. Around 5, Seth finally let her back in. I got home around 5:15 to see them having the most major shouting match they’ve ever had. After Seth stormed out, Olivia explained to me what happened. Seth told her he locked her out because “she deserved it” and because “you shouldn’t even be living here, let along having a fucking job interview on our computer”. 

Last week when he was over, Seth must’ve seen that Olivia had a Skype interview today, as she posts sticky note reminders to herself on the desktop of the computer. So he came over here today just to purposely sabotage her. This makes me angrier than I’ve been in a very long time. I can’t even begin to describe how upset I am with him. He cost her an important job opportunity. 

So, Reddit, what do I do? Should I try to talk to my son about this? Should I change how I’ve been treating him thus far? Could that be the reason why he’s behaving so maliciously? This is not the boy I know. He feels like a complete stranger to me. I can’t believe he would do something so spiteful. Can anything be salvaged from this?

**TL;DR: When my son Seth was four, his mother “Lydia” and I divorced, and it was very tough for him. Currently, he is much closer to her because she’s the “fun parent” and because I remarried to a woman “Michelle” that he dislikes. When Seth was growing up, he was best friends with Michelle’s niece “Olivia”, but eventually he stopped wanting to see her. Last June, Olivia’s parents died in a car accident, and Olivia moved in with us. Seth didn’t discover this until the beginning of this month, and he was extremely angry. Today, when Olivia was doing a chore outside, Seth locked her out of the house, causing her to miss a very important Skype interview. I’m very upset with my son. What do I do?**

edit: I saw some questions about Seth's relationship with Michelle and Olivia, as well as some questions about Lydia, so I'll add my answers to the post.

When Seth was a kid, Michelle tried hard to connect with him. He accepted her, but as he got older, he didn't want to engage with her anymore. She respected that. She didn't force him to spend time with her or anything like that. She always invited him to do things with her, but she didn't create drama or negativity when he turned her down. She is nice to him and has never done anything malicious to him. If she had, I never would've married her.

Seth's desire to stop seeing Olivia wasn't immediate. As time went on, he started asking me more and more, and when he became visibly angry about it, she stopped coming over. So she started to come to my house less and less often. As far as I know, nothing particularly terrible happened between them for him to start acting like this. Olivia thought that they stopped being close because they were preteens and it was that awkward stage when kids of the opposite gender felt weird spending time with each other. I plan on asking her if something happened that she hasn't told us about.

As for Lydia being an irresponsible parent...sometimes during the week, I would open my front door to find her standing there with Seth, and she would ask me to watch him for a while because she just couldn't deal with him at the moment. ""For a while"" and ""At the moment"" turned into days sometimes. She was all too happy to take him to the amusement park, but she never wanted to do things like go to his parent-teacher conferences. Even though she didn't want to raise a kid, she wanted custody of him because she didn't want me to have more influence over him. Because she didn't want to raise a kid, she treated Seth more like a mini-adult than a child. I believe that wanting to raise a kid and wanting to be around a kid are two different things, and she wanted the latter. Anything serious was left up to me.

Lydia is immature because she still acts like she's in high school. She skips work when she isn't sick. She gossips about her friends behind their backs. She hates commitment of any kind; she wants to have her way until it's too much work to keep it that way. I know that she doesn't like Michelle, and I strongly suspect that she has turned Seth against her. When I married Michelle, Lydia was very immature about the entire issue. I had to prohibit her from coming to the wedding. She gave Michelle second thoughts about marrying me in a very underhanded way. Those must've spread to Seth as well, because he stopped wanting to spend time with Michelle after I married her.

edit 2: all of these comments about how I enabled my son's entitled behavior are very eye-opening. I hadn't realized this. I just want to add that I appreciate the honesty. 

edit 3: a poster was appalled that I did not include any information about what happened to my niece after my son sabotaged her. So here is what I told them. I called the company the day of the incident and explained what happened. They understood but didn't re-offer the position. I have since talked to my niece about everything.

I plan on posting an update that will elaborate on this once I feel that there is enough to warrant an update. "

4khe82,1,2016-05-22,[23/f] needs help processing bad relationship with ex-boyfriend [25/male],tiredgoddess,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4khe82/23f_needs_help_processing_bad_relationship_with/,"Hi Reddit. I need help processing my bad relationship with my ex-boyfriend. We were together almost three years, from my junior year of college to post-grad adulthood. When we first started dating, I thought I had won the jackpot. He was so caring and sweet to me and we had similar interests and passions but I could definitely tell he had a dark side. When I told people about him, I described him as the ""perfect man"" (ha ha ha I was so wrong). It turns out that he had anger issues and a very volatile personality but I was young and stupid and thought that just by being the happy, positive person I am, I could help he work through whatever it was caused his anger problems. I never did get down to what causes his anger and it seems from talking to him and even his mom that there was nothing concrete that happened to him to make him this way. 

 At first, he never took his anger out on me, he would yell a lot in the car at other drivers or get angry at someone for doing something dumb. Like for example, one time we were meeting a dear family friend of mine for ice cream because he was visiting our campus with his son for a sporting event. He ended up running late which I was totally fine with, parking and driving on campus on big game days was always crazy but the whole time my boyfriend (lets call him Steve for the purposes of this post) was so angry and kept asking me when this ""child"" was coming and talking really negatively about this person that I loved and knew for a long time. It made me so uncomfortable but as soon as my friend came, he did a total 360 and was super pleasant with him and there was no indication of his earlier anger. It always scared me how he could make this total change in behavior in an instant. 

I'll never forget the first time he yelled at me. He visited my parents house for the weekend to meet them in the summer and at the end of the weekend I went back to school with him. We had a great weekend and my parents really liked him and I couldn't have been happier. So we were driving and about five minutes from my house when he started getting road rage. He was asking me which lane to merge into to get onto the highway and I hesitated very briefly because I wanted to make sure that I was telling him the right thing. When I hesitated he got this cold angry tone with me that I had never heard him use. I was honestly shocked and slightly frightened and became quiet. He yelled at me one more time when he took the wrong exit to get onto another highway an hour and a half later. At that point I was in tears and sitting as far away from him as I could have. This trend of him screaming at me or the people around him in the car continued throughout the rest of our relationship. It got so bad a few times that I genuinely was terrified that I wouldn't make it out of there alive. When I say screaming, I mean he would just scream. As I'm typing this right now I'm shaking remembering it. After the first incident, the yelling became more frequent. One time he berated me in front of our friends at a tailgate for dumping out the beer pong cups while I was helping clean up at a tail gate because he wasn't done playing even though he hadn't played for at least an hour. It was terrible. Other times he would just yell at me about little stuff. Before this relationship, I have never been yelled at so much. He apologized sometimes but other times seemed to have very little remorse. I ended up always walking around egg shells with him and dreading to get into the car with him because I never knew when he was going to blow up. 

There were obviously very good times in our relationship to but the bad stuff really overshadows the good. We drank together a lot. I turned 21 in the midst of our relationship. We were usually fine but our biggest fights would obviously happen when we were drunk and these were the only time he would physically hurt me. There were three times but it was three times too many. The worst part about it was that it was always really hazy the next day when it happened so we never really spoke about it. The first time, was during our second year together. We were drinking at a friends apartment, having a great time and goofing around. I was dancing on him jokingly because there was music playing and he asked me to stop in what I thought was a joking tone which was so stupid of me considering his past behavior. When I didn't stop he turned so quickly and grabbed my neck and pushed me away. It was terrifying. I obviously started crying but the rest of that night was a blur. It was a lot of crying and his friend offering to drive me home since I was so distraught and his friend taking him aside and talking to him but I ultimately let him drive me home after we had sobered up. The other time we were walking back to my apartment drunk and arguing about something stupid that was definitely politics related. I don't remember what we were arguing about and why but he pushed me down and ran away, I fell and scraped my leg up. So he ran in front of me and I was calling after him once I got up because I was now alone, scared and really drunk in the dark. I remember coming home and him sitting in my living room and basically my roommate had to calm me down because I was hysterical. He ended up leaving while we were in my room and then I was even more upset because he didn't apologize to me after hurting me. The next day he apologized and felt really bad about it so I decided to stupidly give him another chance because afterall he was drunk and it was hazy. The last time he hurt me was when we were kissing. We had just gotten back from the bar and our sex life was basically dead at that point anyway but we were drunk and making out on the couch and then out of no where he bit my lip super hard, hard enough to draw blood and make me cry from pain. I ran into my room and he didn't even try to apologize but he definitely heard me crying because A. I was in pain and B. this was the second time within a month that he hurt me. My lip was bleeding and ended up being bruised the next day. When I confronted him about it he told me that ""I would be fine"" and ""It doesn't look that bad"". He never fucking apologized. Our sex life was already pretty much dead and this just added to it. 

I ended up moving back home after graduation to do an internship and not be in my college town and he stayed because he is from the area. We tried the long distance thing and for a while it was really good because I was really happy with my internship and being at home that I didn't have time to dwell on how volatile my relationship with this person was. It was like when we were apart he was so sweet and was willing to make it work, at least for a little bit. When we saw each other (we tried every month) it was great because we missed each other and he never yelled at me. It was hard to make it work and he hated talking on the phone so we interacted through text a lot which frustrated me. The end of our relationship is very anti-climatic. We simply just drifted apart and stopped speaking to each other, like a mutual ghosting. I suppose it would have been good to have closure or at least a formal ending but I think it was truly over when we were still back at school together. It may be weird but I kind of prefer it this way because his temper scares me and I really did not want to open a can of worms. It's been nearly a year since I saw him and I've just noticed such a change in myself, I'm happier and feel freer and cry less. I've been working a lot and having a social life so any thoughts on my failed relationship got kind of pushed to the back of my mind except recently I have been thinking about him and trying to process what exactly happened. I've been so angry lately at him and also at myself for letting this happen to me and not being strong enough to just realize my worth and leave him. I did not consider myself a victim of abuse but I realized while writing this that there was a lot of things that I was blocking out about our relationship. I know abuse takes many forms but all of his actions don't fit into a prescribed model of abuse like cutting me off from friends and family, monitoring my whereabouts, calling me names (when he yelled at me he never called me names just yelled). He got along so well with my family and friends. Sometimes I wonder if he has some form of sociopathy (I made that word up I'm sorry) or psychopathy. I came to reddit because I need to sort out my feelings and I need to find a resource to help me. I don't have time to see a therapist right now and I normally feel happy and I don't think of him but when I do I just get so angry. When I say a resource I mean anything, like an article, a poem, a message or anything. 

I apologize for how lengthy this post is and I hope I formatted it in a readable way. Even if no one answers this, I feel better just typing this out. My friends and family only got little glimpses at how bad it was and never knew the true extent so writing this was almost cathartic. "

I just want to go outside.,ssCMi,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4khfgu/i_dont_want_to_hurt_myself_i_just_want_to_go/,"I'm really hurting and it's impossible to find anyone who understands. I need to see a doctor, but I cannot leave my house. I get really anxious when I go outside and get panic attacks. I dress up. Shower, hair, makeup, comfortable clothing and stare at my door. It'll be 10:00AM and before I know it, it's 6:00PM.
I don't think anything can help me. The last time I went to the doctor's I could barely describe any of what I was feeling before I was rushed out the door. It doesn't help that I don't have a phone, I don't have a job, I'm not in school, I don't drive, and my family doctor is in the next city. I try to talk to my father but he gives me the whole ""Be stronger, it's all in your head"" speech. I know a lot of what I feel is because I don't like the way I look, but I don't even think weight loss can help me because I think I'm hideous. 
The other part to this is that I don't care what any one else thinks, so compliments don't help me, because I'm only worried about what I think. How do I take the first step when I can't even leave my home? I hate that I had all this support in high school, but now that I'm older no one wants to help. 
I'm not even strong enough to kill myself. It's so sad.
I wanted to start cutting again, but every time I look at my arms and see my scars, especially the risen ones, I get so sick because it only makes me uglier, which intern makes me feel worse, and then more depressed. There's literally nothing I can do but lay here until my heart stops. 
I think it would be easier to take a bunch of pills.
I don't want to hate myself anymore. I don't have motivation to change, I don't have support, and I don't have the strength to stand when I step outside. 
I understand that some people can really be alive for no reason at all despite what I've learned in church, because I'm one of those people. 
I can't even be in love because I hate myself so much, I don't deserve such nice things.

One of the primary reasons I chose Berkeley was because the admissions counselor said I would be able to double major in Computer Science and Political Science while at the school. This is a problem at most other schools since most of the time colleges completely house off Computer Science from all the other students in an engineering school, which doesn't make much sense to me since knowing computer science has pretty much become helpful in any line of work. 

I've done a good amount of prior work in both political science and computer science, so hopefully that may help. If anything, I think it will ensure that I won't get bored and slack off in either field.

Anyway, do you think it would be possible to major in these two fields and still have time for social life, internships, clubs..? Also, does anyone have any advice for how to take advantage of both programs? Any advice on how to best manage double majoring in the two?

So, I've just finished all my exams and I'm about a month away from graduating from uni (hopefully) with a bachelors degree in economics. I've not received my results yet but I'm almost certain I'm going to end up with pretty bad/mediocre grades since I have very little interest in the subject and was too lazy to really work hard despite this. I made a very rash decision to drop computing science after first year and have been regretting this ever since I've realised that economics is probably even worse for me personally. 

I'm quite a shy person and live a pretty sheltered life too (think stereotypical asian nerd). For the past few years in uni, I've not really put much effort into trying to bolster my CV either - I've not had any internships and the only work experience I've had to date (if this even counts) is volunteering in a charity shop for a few months and a very short 10-week trial at Mcdonalds, after which I was told they didn't want to keep me, which I can't deny, didn't bother me too much since I really didn't enjoy my time there anyways. 

Needless to say, I'm currently in a spot of bother to say the least, and have no idea how to proceed. Throughout my teenage years I kept asking myself what I actually wanted to do when I'm older but never found an answer, I was convinced that I'm probably just too lazy to actually enjoy anything that resembles work. This led to me short-sightedly indulging on as much procrastination as humanly possible throughout my university years and here I am. 

I'm not sure what more I can say to help you guys in giving me advice. I may be 21 now, but at heart, I'm still the unmotivated teenager who wastes his time watching movies, anime, playing video games etc. which is why I really want to change now. I've even dabbled into ""video games journalism"" but quickly became disillusioned by the volatility of those types of jobs, as well as doubting my own ability - I've actually done some paid work for a certain website, but the guy in charge cut me off after about 2 months. Aside from this, I'm a chinese guy born in the UK, so I can speak (unfortunately, I've forgotten how to read and write over the years) cantonese at a decent level (sadly not mandarin which is infinitely more useful). 

Right now, I'm just a fairly straight-forward guy who doesn't really have any grand aspirations with life, so I'm open to most things that don't involve heavy manual labour, though as mentioned previously, I think economics-related jobs are out of the question for me personally. I have a feeling that I should get some proper work experience before I actually commit to a full-time career. One of my relatives who shares a similar background, moved over to Hong Kong to gain some experience doing data entry as an office clerk, perhaps I could follow in his footsteps? I think I need to become much more independant as a person as well as more sociable if I'm to have any chance of finding even an average office job. 

I'm currently exploring options such as volunteering (not sure about this), working holidays, TEFL, moving to HK etc. What should I do next?

Thanks reddit, any advice is appreciated! "

4kic7q,64,2016-05-22,Are there any part time jobs that don't pay minimum wage?,Sheehan7,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4kic7q/are_there_any_part_time_jobs_that_dont_pay/,"I have been working retail part time all year while going to college full time. Now I work as an intern at an office and it's still min wage but it's full time and these checks are something I can actually live off of. The retail job mainly just pays for my car, gas, and food while in college but even still my checks were like $120 a week if that, didn't leave much room for fun or saving. I like my retail job quite a lot (I'm into fashion and it's a fashion forward company) but $10 an hour just isn't cutting it anymore, I feel like the amount of work I put in is worth more than that. 

I have like 3 years of retail experience, 6 months of restaurant experience, and 8 months of internship experience and I would really like to get a part time job next semester that isn't minimum wage, something I can actually have enough to put away a savings and pay some of my college. I tried to get a job at my community college but no luck there but I'm not even turning away labor jobs, I love to work hard. Actually that's one of the only things about retail I hate is standing around when it's slow I'd rather be working it makes the time fly. My classes go from 8am-12am and then ideally I would want to work like 3 days out of the week after class and then weekends. 

Anyone have any ideas on where to look for a part time job that pays above minimum wage? I'm open to consider all possible jobs, hell I'd be a garbage man if they didn't work when I was in class. "

This resort is unique because it’s ONLY for couples and no one seems to know much about it, as people who won tickets have to sign nondisclosure agreements. But the rumor is that it’s really great, and most importantly one of the most exclusive in the world. I really want to do that trip, but have nobody to go with, so I ""catch"" you and drag you into it so I can go.

In that resort, a lot of activities are organised for couples. We quickly discover that some are mild, and some aren't at all. Romantic dinners, massage lessons with other couples or just the two of us, sexy cooking lessons, but also more kinky ones. Moreover, some employees can give dares to couples every time they see them, from kiss and grope each other right here (“here” being anywhere from an empty corridor public places)or skinny dipping to have sex in that place without getting caught (or make sure you do get caught by somebody). Each couple can choose anytime between 3 categories and activities and dare at the beginning of the day, but won’t know any details until they start. You can be an employee or a fan, or some rich friend and you have to act like your bf. At the beginning You'd probably kind of shy/nervous because of all of this, hanging out and pretending to be with THAT celeb's boyfriend. On my side I'm having a blast, enjoying myself and keeping us from all the things you'd love to try.

And from here, the scenario can go differen ways depending on what you want to do, your kinks &amp; limits… So let’s discuss it

Do youstart to enjoy yourselfself and we both start to take part is more and more daring activities? Do you figure out that you can take advantage of the situation, start to get more and more touchy every time you can? Trying to get us into the hottest activities, and if I refuse to play along threaten to expose us as a fake couple? Or maybe you start to even blackmail me after getting some serious leverage, and get me to do everything you want.

LOTS of possibilities, with either a young celeb and an older employee, assistant, agent... Or an older one with the new intern or some fan she randomly picked, I'm open to suggestions !

&gt; It was the crowning achievement for a nation that boasts more top-200 Scrabble players than any other country, including the U.K., Nigeria&amp;#039;s former colonizer and one of the board game&amp;#039;s legacy powers.

&gt; For decades, a computer revolution has been building in Scrabble, each improvement advancing the science of rack management, said Stefan Fatsis, author of &amp;quot;Word Freak: Heartbreak, Triumph, Genius and Obsession in the World of Competitive Scrabble Players.&amp;quot; These days, competitors use applications to analyze, in real time, the wisdom of every letter laid, comparing their moves to those artificial intelligence would play.

&gt; His own Wellington Foundation for Scrabble and Mind Development in Africa lobbies the government to add Scrabble to the national curriculum, alongside math and science.

&gt; Dozens of Scrabble clubs scout high schools for talent, sometimes poaching players.

&gt; Using those analytics, his team came up with a secret list of the five-letter words that are hardest for opponents to utilize, code-named &amp;quot;Ajuwires,&amp;quot; Nigerian slang for an intern.

&gt; At game time, Mr. Mackay, exhausted from days of Scrabble, watched as a visibly relaxed Mr. Jighere slang a succession of terse, defensive words, such as DACOIT, YOW and AAH. The Brit broke into a lead with AVOUCHED-an eight-letter bingo for 86 points-but spent the next five rounds managing awkward racks, playing words that scored in the low 30s and high 20s. With QUIZ, Mr. Jighere popped ahead. At the final score, which was 449 to 432, the winner&amp;#039;s teammates lifted their champion around the room, singing a Nigerian pop tune: &amp;quot;We Done Win.&amp;quot;.

My GPA at my state university (Computer Engineering) kind of sucked, 3.1. So, I decided to take a step back and rebuild my foundation courses. I took two semesters and strengthened my math fundamentals and programming. During this interim, I was going to return to work but ended up picking an INTERNSHIP at a SOFTWARE company... however... the job role was in IT rather any sort of software, development, or engineering.


During this time, I become a pretty stellar student; lots of peers turned to me for assistance in our math/programming courses etc, the fundamentals really helped me leap forward.


To the point: I'll be starting my Junior year in the fall. I am performing excellently in my current ""intern"" role. I am often the fallback for our lead, and can provide answers for my team...but alas this is IT. I was thinking I could stay with this software company until the spring semester is over, then find an internship for this and next summer, before hoping to transition to the real world...


Is that waiting too long? Should I leave this role and search for a Computer Systems Engineering related internship immediately? Will this internship help with my growth even though it is of the IT disposition? After all, Software is in the company name.


Thoughts? Also, what is one to do about the confidence issues related to the very first CS/CSEinterview hunt? I am pretty good with discrete math, coding(java,javascript,C++), and general preparation (IE I often read my textbooks cover to cover....I'm reading my Fall semester textbooks now over the summer). However, I really feel so unprepared for my field in general.

OH! and almost forgot to add. I am taking about 15-18 credits an hour each semester and working between 30-50 hours at my current internship a week.

Am an introvert and a shy one at that- thats like being dead twice.. She was perfect. She would call me all the time, text me all the time. We were in a LDR. After a while though I realised she had a lot of attitude and anger issues. Turns out she comes from a broken home. I got diagnosed with manic depression and bipolar and she was there all through. And now the crap. She once cheated on me with a girl but she didn't think it was wrong because it was a girl. She neglected me and I always found evidence of her flirting with just about every guy who came by her. She then cheated on me this time with a guy. I found out and forgave her anyway. She would go through periods when she would grow cold and distant and rare moments when she would treat me like a king. Her mother has been struggling all through and I was financially supporting her. I would sacrifice my allowance for her. I have slept hungry for a few days quit a few times just so that she eat. Months ago she fell sick, told me it was backpain so i i went to visit her at hospital and I discover that she had a baby. It was a dead shock. However I accepted the child despite not knowing with certainity that it was mine (remember the affair). Fast forward. I went to visit her last month. She was working as an unpaid intern so she would leave me with the child all day. I would wash him feed him change him and I love that kid. But when she came home she and her best friend would spend the whole evening talking. She would just cook and spend the evening ignoring me and the child. One time she comes home changes into her party clothes and leaves all night. The kid was 5 months old then. She was also physically abusive when she got angry she would hit me sometimes gave me nosebleeds. But I loved her through it all. I loved her. Last week she kicks me out and says that I am stopping her from having fun. Since then she has spent the week partying and having sex with all the men she can find. I finally told her that unless she wants me back its going to be NC. I am hurting I don't have anyone to even hold me. I am seriously considering killing myself. I miss her so much. And the boy too.please tell me it gets better."

4kj56q,6,2016-05-22,There's something in my house,Hogger18,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4kj56q/theres_something_in_my_house/,"So Im not really a writer or anything so this is going to be a bit informal. I got out of school for the summer in May and I dont start my internship until June so I've just been relaxing at home this month and I've started to notice some strange things. Really unsettling things.
First, it started with the birds at the window. In our living room, there is a large, uncovered window near the ceiling that sort of acts as a skylight during the day. Earlier this month, a bird began to peck at the window and act as if he was trying to get inside. It was kind of annoying and in a house by myself, I could pretty much hear it everywhere. The weird part is that not only did he do this all day, he's been doing it for two weeks now. Every single day. A few days ago a second bird joined in so I started throwing my dog's toy up towards the window so they would fly away. But they would always come back. I asked Reddit why they would be doing this and answers varied from ""seeing their reflection"" to ""a bad omen"". So I took this with a grain of salt. But then some other weird things started to happen.
I have never had nightmares before coming back home this month. I have no way to prove that, but it is true. But lately I've been having these absolutely bizarre dreams at night, or even when I nap during the day. They never have a central theme and honestly are just too weird and strange to make any sense at all, but I have been waking up sweating/nervous from my dreams. They range from my friend being shot in the head and me cutting someone's hand off in revenge to robbing a bank in broad daylight and having to leave my family forever. They don't sound that scary when you think about them but it has been far worse in the dreams. Almost like a feeling of dread? 

Now this is where things start to get a little more weird and I'm a little uncomfortable talking about them. 

I find that things around the house aren't where I put them or where they are supposed to be. For example, just yesterday I was walking out through the garage (after my mother got home) and picked up two plastic bags of old letters (from my grandparents house, the letters being old don't really have anything to do with this) and put them on the shelf in the garage. I thought maybe my mother had just forgotten to put them in the car. So I come back down through the garage a while later and they are on the ground again, same place I saw them before. I asked her if she had meant to leave them on the ground and she said that she must've forgotten to put them in the car. But that didn't explain why they were moved back down. I'm typically a pretty rational person so I kind of played it off as some sort of deja vu. But it has been bothering me nonetheless. 
This sort of thing has been happening for the past three days now. I'll put something down like my wallet and then I'll find it in my back pocket half and hour later. I left my computer in the charger for a few hours and came back to find it in my bookbag. It's things like this, nothing too creepy like chairs flying around the room but it sort of feels like Im losing my mind a little. 

Two nights ago I went over to my friends house to smoke a little bud. Not something I do often but when I'm back in town I'll partake with some of my old friends. I was feeling alright when I drove back home (Im an excellent driver, so lets not harp on the fact I drove back, it's only 3 minutes away) but when I got back I had some crazy out-of-body experience. It was something I never experienced or felt before in my life. It was crazy and creepy and I knew I would not be able to talk to my mother properly so I just went straight up the mancave (a room above our garage, has a tv, couch, surround sound, beer fridge, you get it). Knowing she would likely bring me a sandwich or something (my mother is a very sweet and thoughtful lady) I went into the bathroom and pretended to be on the phone. Of course, she came up and I told her I was on the phone and thanked her for the food. But while I was in the bathroom waiting on her, I could hear all these crazy voices. The bathroom fan was on and it was like everything was coming out of that. I was almost mesmerized and just stood there listening. I couldn't really make out any of the words I heard but it definitely sounded like more than one voice and didn't sound positive.  

I don't know if any of this classifies as creepy enough for this sub but living in this house for the past month has been extremely unsettling. Maybe Im just going crazy or maybe it's the birds."
4kj8q4,1,2016-05-22,My [20/M] Gf [20/F] doubts my feelings constantly and complains I don't care enough.,Throwaway_bastard_24,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4kj8q4/my_20m_gf_20f_doubts_my_feelings_constantly_and/,"So myself and this girl started dating a month and a half ago.

A little backstory: she had a crush on me (we are in the same program at uni) and as we became closer and closer I started developing feelings towards her. After almost a year, she confronted me and asked this: ""If I were to date this guy - let's call him Guy 1 - that confessed his feelings towards me, how would you feel?"". At the point I told her that I like her and things picked up from there.

Fast forward to now.. and she still occasionally brings up the topic of how I should've been the one who confessed his love first and that I'm the guy so I should be the one who initiates physical contact more.

I'm not a touchy person myself and I explained that numerous times but she still doubts my feelings because I don't initiate physical contact whenever we're out. From my perspective I'm not very comfortable initiating them but would be more than happy when she does, but she sees it differently.

She always complains that I might not like her and that I only said it because she put me ""on the spot"" so to speak that day. I actually genuinely like her and her constant doubts are just throwing me off.

Another thing is: I spend a lot of my time either a) talking to her on text/sometimes phone and b) meet with her at least once or twice a week after work - we're both interns now. Remember Guy 1? While I told her it;s ok if they stay friends, he now talks to her daily and she even said a few days ago that he talks to her MORE THAN I DO. She's like ""he seems like he cares more"". Nothing pissed me off more than hearing those words coming from her mouth.

I'm really devastated and I don't know what to do. Every week she gets depressed at night and this same topic comes up. She always asks me to re-evaluate my feelings because they don't feel sincere even though I actually put a lot of things aside to be with her sometimes. I wrote her a card with love notes and I greet her every morning with a lovely text. I also heard from our mutual best friend that she talks about how slow our relationship is going and that she wasn't expecting that before to Guy 1. And I can't confront her with that because she'll know who told me as my best friend is a close friend of hers and he knows Guy 1 too.

So Reddit, I need your opinions as I really need someone who isn't biased to talk to. I wanna know if it's really my problem or hers, as I really can't sleep well or carry on my daily activities without feeling a bit down when this shit happens.

TL;DR: Gf complains that I don't feel romantic enough for her, and she talks to another guy who liked her (and she chose me over) about our relationship. I'm getting depressed as all my efforts are not being noticed just cuz I'm not doing it her way. She also always tells me that she has no feelings for that guy whatsoever, and that she has strong feelings towards me."

4kjaui,3,2016-05-22,Can someone tell me the difference between a Diplom-Bibliothekar and a wissenschaftlicher Bibliothekar?,clouddoctrine,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/4kjaui/can_someone_tell_me_the_difference_between_a/,"I plan to move to Germany next summer after graduating from university with a master's degree in Library and Information Science. I already have a lot of experience working in the field of research libraries, and I have a pretty good grip on the German language. I will even be doing an internship at a German library this autumn which will in order to gain more experience and also to brush up on my German.

There seem to be a fair amount of job openings in my field in Germany, so I am hopeful that I will be able to remain a librarian. But I will need to look for the right job openings, of course, and I cannot for the life of me figure out what the difference is between a Diplom-Bibliothekar and a wissenschaftlicher Bibliothekar. 

From what I can gather from the German Wikipedia entry on librarians, a Diplom-Bibliothekar is someone who has studied at a Fachhochschule while a wissenschaftlicher Bibliothekar is someone with a university degree. Is that correct? And is that the only noticeable difference between the two? Are some libraries, for example research libraries or university libraries more inclined to hire one or the other?

I hope someone here can help. Thanks in advance!"

4kjkn8,2,2016-05-22,[M4F] Nothing Is Sweeter Than Vanilla!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4kjkn8/m4f_nothing_is_sweeter_than_vanilla/,"Hey there DPP!

**INTRODUCTION**

My name is Andrew, 28 year old professional from New York. I am 6'5, 220 pounds, blonde hair, blue eyes, with a strong build and broad, muscular shoulders. My hard outer appearance is contrasted sharply and juxtaposed by my sweet tender inside and penchant for kindness.

I share a deep affinity for story-telling and writing in general and my past prompts and posts have usually tried to demand a higher level of grammar, imagination, detail and literacy in the responses as I feel that's the best way to keep a story alive and fresh and prevent it from becoming stale or having either side decide they may as well just watch some porn.

I've been posting on DPP for a long time and today I am in the mood for something a bit more vanilla as I hope to engage a more diverse population of those individuals who frequent this lovely sub-reddit. I've been seeing some especially great prompts recently and want to make sure I'm not alienating anyone by requesting the same prompts/kinks.

**PROMPTS**

I've narrowed down my prompt ideas into separate categories, each with their own plot lines and twists and can incorporate other ideas as well and are all up for discussion!

**(1)NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR**

I've just moved in to town from the high powered life of New York City as an attorney working in Manhattan. I've grown tired of the constant hustle and am looking for a more small-town feel. I've gotten a job at the local law firm, a boutique operation specializing in real estate closings and is more in line with the slower pace I hope to find. You have been living in the small town of Paradise Springs your whole life and are intrigued at the new neighbor that you have. We spark a conversation and begin a slow and gentle courtship.

**(2)THE CO-WORKERS**

Similar premise to the above prompt, only we have been holding on to a work friendship for nearly three years now. Always amiable to one another, we never really felt any kind of emotional spark together, just a simple friendship between two people who understand each other. Perhaps one of us goes through a particularly harrowing time (i.e. a breakup, death in the family, etc.) and relies significantly on the other for support, where a new tenderness seems to blossom.

**(3)THE ANNIVERSARY**

This one would center around a pre-existing romantic relationship and be premised upon a one year anniversary, perhaps even six months or something of the like to mark a very special time in a budding new love affair.
Long-time lurker here and have finally decided to put my ""hat in the ring"" so to speak and try my hand at roleplaying and seeing if I can get any quality responses and to return the favor!



**(4)OFFICE AFFAIR**

The office affair with some kind of added twist. You could be my boss, peer, secretary or intern but we are both married and over time the sexy innuedos and flirting get taken further and further as we both realize we don't get what we want at home. But there's more to you than meets the eye. You decide what it is! 

**(5)THE ELEVATOR**

The woman in the elevator. Weeks have gone by and at least twice a week I ride the elevator up with you. It's the best 60 seconds of my day. My god you're gorgeous and you always give a crooked smile when I get on. And that little hair flip as you tell me to ""Have a nice day!"" when I get off the elevator knowing I've been checking you out. But one day the elevator is overly crowded and we are pushed against each other and I just can't stop myself from getting hard and you feel it against your ass...

**(6)INCEST**

Mom/sister drama queen. You're always the damsel in distress and every time you come to me over something petty and annoying but I know you rely on me quite heavily and I'm always there for you. But this time it's serious. You're going to have to hide out with me in my apartment for who knows how long. And that sexual tension that's been there since I was 12... surfaces and I have to try and deal with you getting a little too close when my mind is else where. 

I've written much longer prompts before that are more specific and if you wanted to check those out by all means please do. I really want to find a long term roleplay partner but I understand we have to be able to connect for that to happen. 

**KINKS**

My favorite kinks are: 

* Vanilla/Romance
* Anal
* Facials
* Blowjobs
* Cuddling
* Kissing

PM me and let me know what you'd like to try and if there is anything you would like to change or add to any of the prompts. I really enjoy having my partner have equal say in the set up and role of characters! 

I can't wait to talk to you soon"
4kjo6f,1,2016-05-22,"For World’s Newest Scrabble Stars, SHORT Tops SHORTER: Nigerian players dominate tournaments with the surprising strategy of playing short words even when longer ones are possible",autotldr,autotldr,https://www.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/4kjo6f/for_worlds_newest_scrabble_stars_short_tops/,"This is an automatic summary, [original](http://www.wsj.com/articles/for-nigerian-scrabble-stars-short-tops-shorter-1463669734) reduced by 79%.
*****
&gt; It was the crowning achievement for a nation that boasts more top-200 Scrabble players than any other country, including the U.K., Nigeria&amp;#039;s former colonizer and one of the board game&amp;#039;s legacy powers.

&gt; For decades, a computer revolution has been building in Scrabble, each improvement advancing the science of rack management, said Stefan Fatsis, author of &amp;quot;Word Freak: Heartbreak, Triumph, Genius and Obsession in the World of Competitive Scrabble Players.&amp;quot; These days, competitors use applications to analyze, in real time, the wisdom of every letter laid, comparing their moves to those artificial intelligence would play.

&gt; His own Wellington Foundation for Scrabble and Mind Development in Africa lobbies the government to add Scrabble to the national curriculum, alongside math and science.

&gt; Dozens of Scrabble clubs scout high schools for talent, sometimes poaching players.

&gt; Using those analytics, his team came up with a secret list of the five-letter words that are hardest for opponents to utilize, code-named &amp;quot;Ajuwires,&amp;quot; Nigerian slang for an intern.

&gt; At game time, Mr. Mackay, exhausted from days of Scrabble, watched as a visibly relaxed Mr. Jighere slang a succession of terse, defensive words, such as DACOIT, YOW and AAH. The Brit broke into a lead with AVOUCHED-an eight-letter bingo for 86 points-but spent the next five rounds managing awkward racks, playing words that scored in the low 30s and high 20s. With QUIZ, Mr. Jighere popped ahead. At the final score, which was 449 to 432, the winner&amp;#039;s teammates lifted their champion around the room, singing a Nigerian pop tune: &amp;quot;We Done Win.&amp;quot;.

4kk3mb,6,2016-05-22,An Open Call for New Community Leaders: The Neighborhood Connection Project,CitizenJac,ChicagoNWside,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicagoNWside/comments/4kk3mb/an_open_call_for_new_community_leaders_the/,"Building Community by Beautifying Community

Greetings Neighbors! 

Are you ready to build community by beautifying community? The Neighborhood Connection Project ""NCP"" (Learn more about NCP on Facebook and below) is looking for a few good citizens to become a few great community leaders. Is this you? Are you ready to be the leader your community needs you to be? What ideas to beautify your community are you interested in bringing to life?  

Join us for a conversation about becoming an NCP community leader no matter what neighborhood you live in, city or suburbs, no matter what experience you have, no matter what background you have. All are welcome.

Interested citizens are invited to meet on Wednesday, May 25 from 6:30 PM - 7:45 PM at the Edgebrook Library (5331 W. Devon). You'll meet with the current group of NCP citizen-leaders, learn about NCP and be able to share your thoughts about how you might want to beautify your community. This will be a fun and casual gathering. Youth welcome. NCP welcomes citizens of all neighborhoods, city and suburbs alike.

Questions? Please ask. Jac.charlier@gmail.com We hope to see you there! 

Started in Spring of 2010, the Neighborhood Connection Project (NCP) is a democratically gathered, citizen-led initiative to build community by repairing and beautifying the Metra railroad underpass located at Kinzua, Hiawatha and Lehigh.  Completed in August 2015, NCP is the largest outdoor public art bricolage mural on Chicago's Northwest side.  Thanks to community funds raised and the financial support of After School Matters (ASM), NCP also provided summer internships for 90 local teen apprentices.  

After securing the input and support of a diverse (and still growing!) cross section of over 400 citizens, four civics, 23 businesses and many other community institutions, NCP was joined by our partners, Green Star Movement (GSM) and ASM. GSM worked with ASM's teen apprentices, our local artists and community volunteers to produce the mural on the East side of the underpass, which was completed as part of Phase I in Summer 2013. Phase II was completed in August 2014 when the West wall work was finished.

Phase III, the middle section, was completed in August 2015. This involved joining the two bricolage murals together in the center.  The joining of the East and West sides of the mosaic was done in the same way our American railroads were completed...by meeting in the middle with a golden stake.  In the case of NCP, we created a gold spike located in the center of the mural.  

The themes of the mural were decided by the community and the actual art reflects both our neighborhood's history, as well as the greenery and vegetation of the area. Special homage is paid to our Native American predecessors and the famous Hiawatha train that ran on these very tracks.  

For more information about the Neighborhood Connection Project, contact Jac Charlier at jac.charlier@gmail.com or Gina Metelica at gina.metelica@gmail.com. You can also check us out on Facebook and stay tuned to Nextdoor.com, EveryBlock, Neighborhood Square and Reddit.

Growing up my parents and others always told me that I'll have to work with people I dislike and that I'll have to ""get use to it"".  But then again it is my life . You can have some control over which shit storm you want to sail through and I decided this shit storm wasn't worth the stress. 

I then applied to a couple other internship opportunities while I continued to work my summer job. I got an interview and job at a place that I didn't meet the gpa requirement. 

So what I'm trying to say to those who  are putting up with a crappy position, don't be afraid to leave and take a leap of faith and apply to everything. Social skills matter so much in this industry. I now understand why that is stressed so much.

However, we've seen with several huge commodities/rares tests that nothing works. Thus, I would really like to know if there is an in-game way of preventing UA damage to our ship. (MB, please? *3*)

Just my thoughts. May we all bask in the truth that is The Empire.

&gt; So, just out of curiosity, why did it take so long to get an answer on this, when we first flagged it some time ago? People have been strung along because of this bug trying things (and wasting their valuable and limited game time, and that of others discussing it) thinking it was a deliberate game mechanic and part of the UA mystery. That is not right or proper, and I am starting to concur with Silent Pact in general. The same thing happened with the ""disappearance"" of the Voyagers and speculation about it being UA-related. Obfuscation through deliberate silence around known bugs and unacknowledged changes to internal game mechanics and their effects on previously known conditions (Voyager locations and how to find them) does not equal engaging game play or content. Yet sadly there seems to be some sort of deliberate pattern developing here.

- The simple answer is that I missed it. The progression of story is primarily through things that we check via the server. I keep an eye on here as well to see what is being discussed as well, but that's not my primary source of information. I'm not going to comment on false avenues as that's for the player's to explore, but when I realised that you were following one that was because of a bug I let you know. Michael

Originally Posted by clavain

&gt; The problem with this Michael, as was pointed out by Derthek, we got an ""answer"" which deliberately led us down the false lead rabbit hole. I don't mind going down it on my own, or with the connivance of other players, but when we are just strung along for no purpose by FD employees, that is where I call [redacted]. Like we were with the reply from support for the ""missing"" Voyagers, and as we were with Zac's response here.

- I'm not really sure what else I can say - the mistake was mine, we'll try not to let it happen again, but to err is human. Michael

I'm just hoping to get some advice and different perspective on my current situation. I'm 23 and moved to a new city last year after college because I got an internship in the sports industry. I've always loved sports and was stoked about the opportunity. That internship lead to another internship in the same city in the same field. After That internship was over I got a job for a sports company but in a warehouse logistics role and I hated it. I had about a hour and half commute in traffic, had a rude and un-supportive direct supervisor, and felt like I was setting myself for a career I didn't want. A part time opportunity came up at the place I last interned at and I jumped at it. I just wanted to get out of where I was and back in sports. This meant I had to find another part time job to make ends meet. Now I'm in a situation where I enjoy where I work, but I work every single day at odd hours and make a lot less than I did before and it is definitely stressful making ends meet. On top of that i never have time to do anything. I feel like I should have really thought about what two part time jobs would entail and sometimes I regret leaving. Now I am looking at a full time opportunity at a company that is still in line with what I want to do career wise and where a lot of my former co-workers work, but am worried that my short tenure at jobs will look bad. I am also worried that I will burn a bridge if I take a new job only 3 months in. It is all really stressing me out and I go back and forth on what I should do all the time. 

Anyone have some advice or been in a situation like this?

4kkx0a,2,2016-05-22,"[NeedAdvice] Please, Help Me Organized My Routine!",silveri5,DecidingToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/4kkx0a/needadvice_please_help_me_organized_my_routine/,"I’m a freelance writer and translator, my workflow isn’t as stable as full-time work. Sometimes I have a project I need to finish in few days and get so busy. However, when the workflow is very slow like this month, I think I screwed up my routine. I will break into several points so I can give a clearer idea about my day and what I want to achieve.

My screwed up routine at slow workflow:

* I woke up late, sometimes I sleep earlier and then wake up in the middle of the night and stay up to morning. I do my project but not rushing it because I still have a lot of time.

* I eat when I remember to eat, I’m now underweight and I have no idea how to gain any weight even after trying to eat a lot and healthier for few weeks. I think this situation is affecting my mental health as well.

* I use my spare time on reddit to read some amusing stuff. I have been wanting to meet new pals here but when I do, I lose interest. I think part of me want to talk but most of the time I don’t want to talk. I think I have severe mood swing on this one.

* Half of my day (when I have finished all of my work) is used to browse new job or talking about work opportunity with my friends here. But, I think it’s useless because I have no interest to actually apply for now. But I need to work somewhere else to gain experience. This will be relevant to what I want to achieve later.

* I quit yoga or light stretching. The only thing I do in my other time is sleeping, I can’t work well if I don’t sleep enough. Other time, I clean up the whole house which drains my whole energy. I quit yoga that I used to do because I’m already in the shape that I want. But I think I should do some exercises for the sake of my physical health.

* I go out to visit family, watching new movie on cinema (mostly alone), buying my favorite cakes, buying make up product, go to ATM machine, buying fruits or just to do some other errand. For now, I don’t like going out without purpose. I limit my time to meet friends or hang out with cousin because I feel like wasting my time. I better do my work or sleep.  

So, those are my screwed up routine. When I have lots of works, I only sleep 4 – 5 hours a day and other time I use it for work.  Now, these are some stuff I want to achieve in the next few months:

* I have download Passion Planner, I got the suggestion from one of redditors. I want to organize my life and being more grateful of my life.

* I have few projects I have to finish, mostly personal projects such as:

1. 	Writing an essay for free internship program competition (deadline is on 10 June)

2. 	Writing an essay for blog writing competition (deadline is on 31 may) I also have to advertise it to gain the traffic to my blog.

3.	I have to start my web development study after quitting for so long. I’m still learning HTML and CSS (very basic one).

4. I have to start yoga, even 5 minutes yoga should be started soon.

5. I have to learn about Google more, because I’m planning to apply again once I get more professional experience and they open another job.

6. I’m planning to visit my friend in Bali probably at July, we have talked about this and I need this vacation.

7. The last is gaining weight and mastering stoicism.  

Those are some of my goals or projects I have to finish in few months. But like I said, I’m very lazy and unmotivated. Besides, I’m going to do fasting for the whole month which I’m sure will affect my body health because I’m still underweight and lack of proper nutrition. So, I hope someone here can help me how to maintain my routine and achieve all of my goals and projects successfully. 

Thanks a lot for participating, I hope I can get beneficial responses here."
4kl2vz,6,2016-05-22,[Salon Recommendations] Looking for a place in lower Manhattan that I can trust to handle touching up the roots of hair that was previously very damaged.,3llkay,FancyFollicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/FancyFollicles/comments/4kl2vz/salon_recommendations_looking_for_a_place_in/,"My natural hair is a level 2 or 3, and I worked with my stylist over a period of 6 months to get it up to a level 9 or 10. Sometimes it's platinum, sometime's it's more of an ashy blonde, depending on how toned it is or if I'm having issues with brassiness. Anyhow, during my internship in NYC last summer, I went to a salon in Greenwich Village for a root touch up... The stylist offered to get brassy patches out of my hair, and I thought she was going to do this by toning it. Alas, she instead re-bleached entire sections of my hair, damaging it extensively. I couldn't even use toner on it after this incident because the peroxide would ""reactivate"" the damage, as my stylist later said, and cause additional breakage. It's been about 10 months since this occurred, and all of the damaged parts that were affected have pretty much broken off at this point. By deep conditioning, using bond reconstructors such as olaplex, and overall pampering my hair while still bleaching new growth to maintain my color, the texture and strength of it has been restored and I don't have problems with breakage anymore. However, it's now collarbone length (it used to reach the bottom of my shoulder blades... I still tear up when I think about it) and I have to deal with big chunks of breakage growing out, most of which are around the frame of my face. I usually wear clip in human hair extensions to disguise it. 

Throughout all of this, I've stayed blonde. I'm really, really determined not to go back to brunette. However, I'm graduating soon and am moving back to NYC (SoHo), and I'm terrified of having to find a new stylist. I don't want another disaster, especially not an overpriced one that I end up paying $300+ for. I've included some pictures of the damage, without my extensions in. There are so many salons in Manhattan that it's overwhelming - if anyone could recommend a specific place or stylist that they find to be trustworthy, I would be so grateful. I'm making the move in about a week.

I figured that they would be too competitive, and I could save a bit of money if I took summer classes at a community college and graduated a semester early instead. Still did not get the best grades either since I only got a GPA between 3.25 and 3.3, however, my university has a reputation for being tough.

&amp;nbsp;

I did not realize every job required multiple years of experience (usually at least 2 or 3) and skills I do not have as a math major. I got a very worthless minor, Computer Architecture, since I have a genuine interest in computer hardware. It still included basic programming skills, but programming jobs require a lot more than just a year of object oriented programming classes in Java.

&amp;nbsp;

I focused my math electives in Statistics (up to time series) and Numerical (Differential Eqs. and Linear Algebra) courses. The statistics do not help because statistician jobs primarily require a master's degree. I do not have any finance courses to back up the statistics either. I took a course in data mining as a free elective because data analysis sounded fun, but once again those jobs are primarily master's degree only. The numerical courses would help with algorithms, if only I knew any languages past the basics.

&amp;nbsp;

I do not really have anything else. I have the Java programming, half a semester of C, a lot of MATLAB, and a bit of R.

&amp;nbsp;

What I do not have: SAS (the statistical package companies actually use), SQL (pretty important for Data Analysis, Statistics and quite a few QA Testers), Excel (excludes me from 99% of jobs. It does not look hard at all with even my background in programming, but I don't feel comfortable lying and saying I know it.), every other programming language, a teaching certification, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

Where do I go from here? Are there any sub-entry level jobs I should try to find that would get me skills and experience that would help me get an entry level job?


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: I managed to make my degree completely worthless by only making poor choices on which classes to take. What do?"

So from lurking on this sub for a few years I have noticed that the general consensus when it comes to going to grad school is that it isn't worth the time and money- but what if my undergrad degree is in something like 'game programming'?

Sure, I learn many of the fundamentals that any CS student would learn, and I learn it well- but a lot of that is applied towards graphics and game production more than anything.

I'm doing pretty well for myself. I have one internship under my belt at one of the largest interactive entertainment companies in the world, and this summer I just moved to Seattle to intern at the biggest game engine developer. I also have gotten to onsites with Microsoft, etc.

Case in point, I will be graduating with one of those 'weird' degrees but will have 2 incredible internships completed, as well as a lot of sick projects worked on.

So, grad school in this context; what do you guys think? The only reason I really consider it at the moment is because I want further specialization in graphics engineering."

Ever since I was young, my relationship with my father has been rocky. He's always been hard on me. Despite spending a lot of his time being stoned, he sets extremely high expectations for me to achieve. 

My whole life, I've been trying so hard to gain his approval. I always study hard, never skip classes and always get 90% and above on tests. I work part time at a paid internship in engineering.


The problem is, he's never been impressed by anything, and the abuse I've had to suffer from a young age seems to be getting worse and worse as I'm getting older.

Mom left us when I was only five years old, and ever since then it's just been me and my father. He works hard and makes enough money to support me. We live in a nice neighbourhood and I have things that I want, material things.


When it comes to emotional and personal necessities, I feel like I am devoid of it.

It has severely affected my relationship with friends as well. I know it sounds so petty and immature of me, but I have lost friends because I see how well their fathers treat them, and I'm truly envious of what they have, despite telling myself that I cannot be like that, I just cannot help it. I begin to distance myself from my friends and eventually fall out of contact with them.


How can I communicate with my father that I'd like him to pay attention to me and treat me like his child? How do I make him proud of me, and how can I stop his daily abuse towards me?


**TL;DR;** Father is neglective and abusive towards me. Trying to find ways to mend our relationship."

So there's this girl with me in college which I really like. It started as friendship and I have grown to like her more as I discovered we were really really similar (and that's very rare). 
Thing is, at first, I thought she wasn't interested at all.
But then, as time passed and messages were sent, she became more straightforward in her messages. 
We set up a first meeting which was going to a restaurant. It was very much like a date, and I got to know her more and tell more about myself. After this messages got better, she started to answer instantly (as opposed to before, when we were just ""friends"") and she answered positively to some daring messages. She also told me after dinner that she was happy we had ""found each other"" and that she'd liked it very much.
2 days ago we had our 2nd ""date"" after which she came home to have tea (it was her idea), and I thought this tea time would be the ideal moment to ""confess"", just as I thought it was a huge signal from her.
The issue is she didn't react that much to my signals such as ""we're really similar and I've never found a girl like you, I like how our relation has changed"". Granted, I didn't say openly that I liked her, but I was trying to escalate until that. She didn't give me the chance to as she only smiled and talked about something else.
We had a somewhat mundane conversation and I didn't do anything... it was the last time I saw here before 2 months. During the goodbyes, I wanted to hug her but she only kissed me on the cheek. This was the biggest disappointment.
In 2 months we'll meet again in another part of the world for an internship (happens we'll be in the same city).

I'm really bothered by the situation, I just want to be sure how she looks at this relation. Maybe she doesn't want to get involved into it seriously as we won't see each other for 2 months. Or maybe she's really not interested (which would be weird from someone who sees you twice in a week...).
Should I send her a message to get my answer? Or should I wait till we meet again in 2 months? She might lose interest totally (if there's any).

Clothes. Should I buy clothes for winter before I leave or buy there? What basics do I need to have?

Accommodation: I am looking around for accommodation at the moment in augsburg but have no idea where to look. Its really hard to decide where I would like to live in Augsburg, especially when there isn't google street view in most of Germany. I will be earning under 1000 euro a month, and I assume I would want to have a room alone, but I feel I may get lonely, as I'm not super outgoing anymore. Also, would I be able to have guests over for a few days in the accommodation? My bf will be visiting me in Germany, so would want an accommodation that allows guests I suppose.

4knj7f,33,2016-05-23,"The ""Perfect"" Mom: Intro",justnocrazychurch,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/4knj7f/the_perfect_mom_intro/,"In my previous stories (used my main account), I mentioned that the reason my MIL isn't scaring me so much is because my own mom is worst. I was encouraged to share stories about my mom, and I'm more than happy to, but I'll limit it to stories revolving around her transformation into the MIL from hell. So here's the beginning...

_______


When my now husband and I first decided to get married, we obviously had a long talk about deal-breakers. I told him one of my deal-breakers was if he ever left our future kids alone with my parents. He thought I was being melodramatic and would just go, ""Aww, cutie. But they're your *parents*."" 

This story starts the chain of the events that made him change his mind, and declare that his dog would make a better babysitter for our future kids. 

All the drama started when my sister made up some crazy stories about my then fiancé and I, and yelled all the gory, imaginary details to my parents and I. Stories that would get us into a LOT of trouble and potentially jeopardize our careers as well, since we're living in a conservative Asian country. They were bad enough lies, that if I were not considered ""old"" (27), my parents would have tried to make me break up the engagement. I said ""tried"", because I obviously would not have listened, but it's pretty common here for parents to break up engagements. When I was 22, my mom even warned me, ""Don't think I'm not willing to break up your engagement if you ever get engaged.""

I forgave my sister because I had too for my parents (Asian family emotional bondage ftw!).....and then she did it again. 

This time, she had to up the viciousness. She told me (with my dad present as a reluctant witness) that she knew ""for a fact"" that my fiancé wanted to be with someone else and was forced to settle for his ""second choice"". She knew there was another woman and she knew who she was. This could potentially break up a less secure relationship, but well, my fiancé and I had (still have!) a solid relationship. I just laughed in her face. 

My dad reacted by just running off so he could pretend there's nothing wrong as usual. I like to call his parenting style as The Ostrich Method (stick your head into the ground and pretend everything is all good, until something chomps off your ass). 

Obviously, after all this, I didn't want her at my wedding. I know this is a drastic decision coming from an Asian family, but fuck it. She's insane. 

I met my mom in the morning (we all live in the same house since it's socially unacceptable to live away from your parents until you're married..it's even relatively common to live with your parents for few years after you're married), and I made the mistake of leading in with, ""I don't want Psycho (names have been changed) at my wedding.""

That got my mom pissed and I knew that since she immediately stopped looking at me. 

I tried explaining the situation, but I already lost my mom. She kept flipping through a Christie's catalogue and pointedly ignoring me. 

She cut me off and flippantly told me, ""I'll talk to her.""

""Mom, I already forgave her last time and she did it again,"" I tried explaining, ""She crossed a line and I don't want her at my wedding. You can say that her company won't give her leave, so she can't fly off to Korea for my wedding.""

My husband and I have friends from all over the world so we picked a destination wedding in Seoul to accommodate all our fiends. The fact that it's a relatively long flight from Indonesia would give my parents the perfect excuse to explain my sister's absence without losing face. 

I got no reaction from my mom as she continued to ignore me. This is how she always dealt with any disagreement since I was a kid. I want to do be a research assistant for a UCLA study instead of interning at a bank? Too bad. She'll just buy the plane tickets, agree to the internship on my behalf, and ignore all my frantic phone calls. I usually ended up caving in to what she wanted and she knew that. 

After a long, awkward silence, I tried again, ""Mom, I'm serious.""

She continued flipping through the Christie's catalogue and ignoring me."

When she changes something and saves the document and she scrolls down she can only see like the next 20ish pages (the scroll bar remains the size as if there are 80 pages). 

At first I thought it was the 32bit office they used (because some shifty software doesn't work with 64bit), but it doesn't work on 64bit either. Word only uses like 50MB of RAM so that's not it either.

**INTRODUCTION**

My name is Andrew, 28 year old professional from New York. I am 6'5, 220 pounds, blonde hair, blue eyes, with a strong build and broad, muscular shoulders. My hard outer appearance is contrasted sharply and juxtaposed by my sweet tender inside and penchant for kindness.

I share a deep affinity for story-telling and writing in general and my past prompts and posts have usually tried to demand a higher level of grammar, imagination, detail and literacy in the responses as I feel that's the best way to keep a story alive and fresh and prevent it from becoming stale or having either side decide they may as well just watch some porn.

I've been posting on DPP for a long time and today I am in the mood for something a bit more vanilla as I hope to engage a more diverse population of those individuals who frequent this lovely sub-reddit. I've been seeing some especially great prompts recently and want to make sure I'm not alienating anyone by requesting the same prompts/kinks.

**PROMPTS**

I've narrowed down my prompt ideas into separate categories, each with their own plot lines and twists and can incorporate other ideas as well and are all up for discussion!

**(1)NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR**

I've just moved in to town from the high powered life of New York City as an attorney working in Manhattan. I've grown tired of the constant hustle and am looking for a more small-town feel. I've gotten a job at the local law firm, a boutique operation specializing in real estate closings and is more in line with the slower pace I hope to find. You have been living in the small town of Paradise Springs your whole life and are intrigued at the new neighbor that you have. We spark a conversation and begin a slow and gentle courtship.

**(2)THE CO-WORKERS**

Similar premise to the above prompt, only we have been holding on to a work friendship for nearly three years now. Always amiable to one another, we never really felt any kind of emotional spark together, just a simple friendship between two people who understand each other. Perhaps one of us goes through a particularly harrowing time (i.e. a breakup, death in the family, etc.) and relies significantly on the other for support, where a new tenderness seems to blossom.

**(3)THE ANNIVERSARY**

This one would center around a pre-existing romantic relationship and be premised upon a one year anniversary, perhaps even six months or something of the like to mark a very special time in a budding new love affair.
Long-time lurker here and have finally decided to put my ""hat in the ring"" so to speak and try my hand at roleplaying and seeing if I can get any quality responses and to return the favor!



**(4)OFFICE AFFAIR**

The office affair with some kind of added twist. You could be my boss, peer, secretary or intern but we are both married and over time the sexy innuedos and flirting get taken further and further as we both realize we don't get what we want at home. But there's more to you than meets the eye. You decide what it is! 

**(5)THE ELEVATOR**

The woman in the elevator. Weeks have gone by and at least twice a week I ride the elevator up with you. It's the best 60 seconds of my day. My god you're gorgeous and you always give a crooked smile when I get on. And that little hair flip as you tell me to ""Have a nice day!"" when I get off the elevator knowing I've been checking you out. But one day the elevator is overly crowded and we are pushed against each other and I just can't stop myself from getting hard and you feel it against your ass...

**(6)INCEST**

Mom/sister drama queen. You're always the damsel in distress and every time you come to me over something petty and annoying but I know you rely on me quite heavily and I'm always there for you. But this time it's serious. You're going to have to hide out with me in my apartment for who knows how long. And that sexual tension that's been there since I was 12... surfaces and I have to try and deal with you getting a little too close when my mind is else where. 

I've written much longer prompts before that are more specific and if you wanted to check those out by all means please do. I really want to find a long term roleplay partner but I understand we have to be able to connect for that to happen. 

**KINKS**

My favorite kinks are: 

* Vanilla/Romance
* Anal
* Facials
* Blowjobs
* Cuddling
* Kissing

PM me and let me know what you'd like to try and if there is anything you would like to change or add to any of the prompts. I really enjoy having my partner have equal say in the set up and role of characters! 

I can't wait to talk to you soon"

***

""Oh, for the love of—"" Loose sheets of paper and a tablet tumbled from Rick's hands onto the pavement, followed by a torrent of hot mocha from a paper cup, as he glared at the man who had bumped into him. ""Watch where you're going, jackass!""

It was just not his morning, he thought as he bent down to gather his belongings. Thirty minutes late to an important meeting because some idiot had decided to lie down on the subway track, only to discover during the meeting itself that some intern had messed up the slides the night before. His boss wasn't going to be happy when he learned that the client had spent more time lobbing thinly veiled insults at him than discussing the deal itself.

Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a pair of feet shuffle closer. That idiot was still hanging around. At least he would have someone to shout at. Leaping to his feet, Rick prepared to give the person the shelling of his life.

However, the fellow wasn't looking at him, but straight upward. He looked horribly malnourished. The skin was stretched taut over his face. His eyes were deeply sunken in their sockets. His mouth was open, his teeth rotten-looking. Together, the effect gave him a skull-like appearance. The two-piece suit he wore was shabby, but looked like they had once been finely made.

Before he could say a word, the man said in a hoarse voice, ""Will you let me save you?""

""What?""

""No more time,"" the man said, and tackled Rick to the ground.

There was a thunderous crash upon impact, as though the world itself was breaking apart beneath them. Or maybe it was his back that was breaking. Fearing the worst, Rick shoved the crazy man and tried to get up, but what he saw made him freeze.

A pile of concrete blocks was lying where he had been standing only a while ago. There were panicked shouts coming from above and around him, but Rick's mind couldn't process the words. He had been so close to death. So close, if not for ...

His savior was still on the ground, looking dazed. Rick knelt and gripped his hand. ""Thank you.""

The man's eyes seemed unable to focus on him. ""Will you save me?"" he whispered.

Confused, Rick said, ""Yes. I mean, you saved me and all ...""

He trailed off when he realized the man had closed his eyes, with a finality that told him his gratitude would no longer be heard.

***

Rick woke up in the middle of the night feeling like a desert had taken residence in his mouth. He rushed into the kitchen for a drink, but when he had filled up a glass, his shaking hands caused half of it to spill on his clothes when he tried to take a drink.

The water brought no relief, but seared his mouth and throat going down, bringing on a furious bout of coughing. What the hell? he thought. Was this the lingering haze of some bad dream? He took another drink, and the pain became even more pronounced, as though someone had lit his nerves on fire.

Gasping, he threw the glass into the sink and staggered back to bed. When he fell asleep, he was still clutching his throat.

***

Rick didn't know what time it was when he woke up. His room was still dark. Feeling as though someone had shoved a mallet through his head, he pulled the curtains open, and screamed.

The world outside looked much like it did, except the colors looked like they had gone bad. Reds, blues, yellows and greens of the apartments and the park outside his window had been drenched in a uniform shade of tar. The sun shone bright in the sky, but its rays were a sickly yellow beneath a filter akin to cigarette smoke. People appeared as no more than raggedy outlines of shadow.

""That man,"" he said, and winced, tasting the metallic tang of blood. The simple act of speaking seemed to have ripped something open in his mouth.

It took what felt like forever to get dressed, so lethargic he felt. His breakfast of leftover pizza tasted like dust in his mouth, and swallowing made it feel like nails going down. His body felt feverish, and yet chilly. Touching anything with his skin brought on mild discomfort to pain depending on the pressure applied.

But the worst was yet to come. The moment he stepped out of the house, his heart went into frenzied beating. Swiveling around and clutching his chest, he almost collapsed upon seeing his neighbor standing nearby. The man's face was barely visible on the seething mass of darkness that was his body.

""Morning,"" Hwang said, the word booming in Rick's eardrums. ""You okay? You look tired.""

""I'm ... I don't—""

The heartbeats were becoming more and more amplified, almost as though he had two hearts. Turning around, he saw another person of shadow approaching. And then it felt like three hearts, four hearts ... beating in his chest and head.

And then he felt it. One of these ""hearts"" was going ballistic, as though trying to tear its way out of his body. He swore it felt almost like it was going ... left?

He looked up just in time to see a car swerve around a woman who had crossed the road while engrossed on her phone. Even as the driver blared his horn at her, Rick whispered to himself, ""What the hell is happening to me?""

***

Emma scrambled to her feet, ignoring the painful scrapes she had received on her knees when she had fallen on the tracks as she rushed to the raised lip of the deserted subway platform. It was all her fault; she should've paid more attention to her footing instead of her phone.

Twin lights were slowly growing in the dark tunnel, but she didn't have enough strength to lift herself over the edge.

""Help,"" she screamed, hoping a guard or cleaner would hear her. ""Help me, please!""

A man leaned over the edge so suddenly, it was as though he had appeared from thin air. In appearance he was like one of the cadavers she had worked on in medical school, but right now he was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen. She reached for him, but he made no move to take her hand.

""Please,"" she said, glancing at the oncoming train in fright.

""Will you let me save you?"" the man named Rick asked."
4knr94,2,2016-05-23,[M4F] - Sweet Vanilla Prompts To Cure The Monday Blues!,[deleted],eroticpenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticpenpals/comments/4knr94/m4f_sweet_vanilla_prompts_to_cure_the_monday_blues/,"Hey there DPP!

**INTRODUCTION**

My name is Andrew, 28 year old professional from New York. I am 6'5, 220 pounds, blonde hair, blue eyes, with a strong build and broad, muscular shoulders. My hard outer appearance is contrasted sharply and juxtaposed by my sweet tender inside and penchant for kindness.

I share a deep affinity for story-telling and writing in general and my past prompts and posts have usually tried to demand a higher level of grammar, imagination, detail and literacy in the responses as I feel that's the best way to keep a story alive and fresh and prevent it from becoming stale or having either side decide they may as well just watch some porn.

I've been posting on DPP for a long time and today I am in the mood for something a bit more vanilla as I hope to engage a more diverse population of those individuals who frequent this lovely sub-reddit. I've been seeing some especially great prompts recently and want to make sure I'm not alienating anyone by requesting the same prompts/kinks.

**PROMPTS**

I've narrowed down my prompt ideas into separate categories, each with their own plot lines and twists and can incorporate other ideas as well and are all up for discussion!

**(1)NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR**

I've just moved in to town from the high powered life of New York City as an attorney working in Manhattan. I've grown tired of the constant hustle and am looking for a more small-town feel. I've gotten a job at the local law firm, a boutique operation specializing in real estate closings and is more in line with the slower pace I hope to find. You have been living in the small town of Paradise Springs your whole life and are intrigued at the new neighbor that you have. We spark a conversation and begin a slow and gentle courtship.

**(2)THE CO-WORKERS**

Similar premise to the above prompt, only we have been holding on to a work friendship for nearly three years now. Always amiable to one another, we never really felt any kind of emotional spark together, just a simple friendship between two people who understand each other. Perhaps one of us goes through a particularly harrowing time (i.e. a breakup, death in the family, etc.) and relies significantly on the other for support, where a new tenderness seems to blossom.

**(3)THE ANNIVERSARY**

This one would center around a pre-existing romantic relationship and be premised upon a one year anniversary, perhaps even six months or something of the like to mark a very special time in a budding new love affair.
Long-time lurker here and have finally decided to put my ""hat in the ring"" so to speak and try my hand at roleplaying and seeing if I can get any quality responses and to return the favor!



**(4)OFFICE AFFAIR**

The office affair with some kind of added twist. You could be my boss, peer, secretary or intern but we are both married and over time the sexy innuedos and flirting get taken further and further as we both realize we don't get what we want at home. But there's more to you than meets the eye. You decide what it is! 

**(5)THE ELEVATOR**

The woman in the elevator. Weeks have gone by and at least twice a week I ride the elevator up with you. It's the best 60 seconds of my day. My god you're gorgeous and you always give a crooked smile when I get on. And that little hair flip as you tell me to ""Have a nice day!"" when I get off the elevator knowing I've been checking you out. But one day the elevator is overly crowded and we are pushed against each other and I just can't stop myself from getting hard and you feel it against your ass...

**(6)INCEST**

4knx5u,0,2016-05-23,"flair:Employment I had 2 interviews for my summer internship, both offers are good, but I'am stuck with a choiuce. (LV)",Deekum,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4knx5u/flairemployment_i_had_2_interviews_for_my_summer/,"Good day.

I'am a student and during this summer we have an internship which is mandatory. My major is Finance.

I applied for 2 companies and here comes the problem.
Currently I study abroad via Erasmus programme in Sweden, originally I'am from Latvia, and I come back this summer back to Latvia to have an internship. As I am abroad, It was tough to have those interviews. Lots of emails, skype calls, phone calls, etc., but somehow I made it. 

(C1 - company 1, C2 - company 2)

C1 has responded, offered me a Financial controller internship position, smaller salary and what is most important: maybe a permament position in the company afterwards.

C2 told me to wait for their decidison for 2 weeks (from last friday), however they offered me higher salary (like a real employee, not an intern), but they said directly that It's gonna be a temporary position.
C1 company turnover in 2014 was 2,4 billion EUR, C2 - 30 billion eur.

As a student, where shall I go?

EDIT:

C1 clearly made an offer to work as a Financial controller

C2 asked to wait for their response and only then they will offer me to chose a department and more precise duties."
4ko8ix,0,2016-05-23,Twitch Streamers are Kings,wtfmantwitch,sodapoppin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sodapoppin/comments/4ko8ix/twitch_streamers_are_kings/,"Okay from what I've seen these ""broadcasters"" call people who don't subscribe plebs which means ""peasants"".

So it means they feel like kings. Okay I get that.

Then you have people who subscribe and tell the ""kings"" that their lives suck without them. 

You know maybe you people should get lives instead of watching someone online, maybe you'd feel better about yourselves then.

So okay I get it the ""subs"" feel special and like they are in a special club or something because their lives suck so much and have no meaning otherwise. Let's be honest that is what its all about. They sit on a computer and think they are in a special club now because they are ""subscribers"".

Okay then you have the mods who i find more sad who sit in a channel all day? So my question do any of these mods even get paid in all these channels?

8 hours a day for years and you don't get paid but oh you get to play games with the kings from time to time and that makes you feel special? You aren't fucking interns. 

I really just find this whole twitch culture really sad you people are just so sad worshiping your ""kings"".

I know you are all going to throw your insults at me but I really don't care. I just feel pity for you people."
4kococ,2,2016-05-23,"Nmom causes a lot of inner turmoil, just need to vent",piper-and-the-shrew,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4kococ/nmom_causes_a_lot_of_inner_turmoil_just_need_to/,"Just a rant to vent and get some things off of my chest...

When I was in 4th grade, my Nmom (stay at home) decided to homeschool my sister and I. 
My Nmom was met with a lot of criticism when she decided to homeschool the two of us, usually by family friends who worked in education. 
It was really great the first couple of years. She did a good job, we were part of an institute that provided tutors and all kinds of things like that. 
My two older siblings who had started high school by the time we started homeschooling, stayed in school. 
The institute we worked through was bought out by a religious company, and things started changing with how they ran and operated, which my Nmom didn't agree with. We've never been religious, and she has always been displeased with anything religious. Not totally relevant to this section- but she is also a free-wheeling hippie who openly believes in love, kindness, and acceptance. So in my eyes, she is essentially a giant hypocrite, because she's she first one to tell you her opinion and why you're wrong. 
After the institute closed, she decided she could teach us on her own. It was pretty fun, we went on road trips to museums, hung out a lot around our older two siblings while they did all their high school marching band stuff. I joined a local choir, things were fun.

When I was 12- things took a pretty drastic change.   My grandpa (Nmom's side) passed away, and shortly after he passed, we discovered my grandma had developed the early stages of Alzheimer's. My grandpa was aware but hiding it from everyone. His death was unexpected- he passed in his sleep.
This is where it really started getting muddy. My Nmom, who genuinely thinks she can help anyone and everyone and make their lives better, decided she wanted my grandma to move in with us instead of going to a care home. 
Well that caused fallout with some extended family, because we lived four hours north, and they didn't want her so far away. 
Over the next year or two- time was spent between My grandmas house and my family home, favoring the grandmas house down south, because my Nmom had the flexibility to be down there. 
I had to stop participating in choir, and basically- anything educational stopped at this time.
Also during this time, unfortunately my moms diabetes was getting worse and her health wasn't doing too good. 
My Nmom's also one of those people that would comment on anything I chose to eat or do as far as health. She'd rant about healthy eating and being organic, but she'd be the first one to suggest getting KFC for dinner. 
General hypocrisy across the board.
Sorry for veering off course, back to the main storyline!
So a lot of time was spent between our home and the grandma's home down south, until a remodel on my parents home was finished. Then the final move, where grandma came to stay for good, happened.
I have to say, my grandma was amazing to have around. The Alzheimer's was a bitch, especially as it progressed. But she was still my best friend. My older sister who was homeschooled as well, is very dramatic and made a big show about not being able to help out with care, so it was just down to my mom and I to help her bathe, dress, go to the bathroom and do any basic care.
This is just how my teen years went. My two eldest siblings left for college early on, when I was 16 my sister went off to culinary school, my mom's health was getting worse, grandma was getting worse, and I did my best to help out. All of my time was spent either taking care of grandma, doing house work, or goofing around on my computer. From 13-18 that's all life was. 
I never complained as a teen, because how cool was it that I didn't have to do school work and Nmom never monitored my online activities? I had a lot of freedom. Freedom that as I'm getting older, looks and feels a shit ton more like neglect. 
I always wanted to be helpful, not try to cause too many problems, and just breeze my way through.
The only thing I ever wanted as a teen, was to become a writer. This was met with comments like, ""You should pick something more realistic."" 
If I ever asked her to read something I wrote, I'd be told, ""I'll read your work when it's been published."" ""I'm sure it won't be any good until a professional has edited it.""
As I got older, the responsibilities got more and more. By 17, a typical day was wake up and help get grandma dressed and going, make her breakfast and give her her pills. My mom was usually sleeping because she's a total insomniac. By the early afternoon, she'd be up but have ""errands"" or ""business"" to tend to, so I'd still be hanging and sitting with grandma who can't be left alone. Making lunch, and eventually dinner, so my dad who worked hard all day (out the door by 5am, home by 6, asleep by 8) could come home to a meal. 
It was pretty frequent that even at the end of my day, I'd be yelled at by Nmom for not contributing enough, and at the very least I could just do the dishes from dinner, in her eyes.
I was treated like a lazy coworker, more than a daughter.
I started community college when I was 18, and during winter break after my first term, my grandma started actively dying and passed away a few days before Christmas. 
I was laying next to her when she passed away, and my mom had achieved never putting her in a home. Of course the price to pay for that was her younger two children not getting an education past middle school level. 
Through my teen years, as if to offset the fact she didn't pay any attention to us, my Nmom would take us to concerts, and on cruises. I did get to travel the world as a teen, and that was pretty cool. 
However, that didn't help prevent me from flunking out of college and having to work full time as a caregiver in a facility by 19.
Caregiving was the only thing I was qualified to do. I didn't have money for college, I didn't have a diploma or GED, I did the best I could. 
My older two siblings never understood why I didn't ""just get my GED,"" not realizing I'd just fail the tests because I can't even do basic division and multiplication without a calculator. 
I still wanted to write though, and that was/is my goal. I didn't want to keep failing courses, put myself in debt I could never pay off, so I just worked. I supported myself the best I could. I moved out from my parents house when I was 20, moved in with my eldest sister, eventually joined by our other sister (that had been homeschooled with me and recently finished an internship in Texas.) My eldest sister has a great job, bought a house and can support it by herself. My other sister does pretty well as a baker, and my eldest sibling, my brother, married with a kid on the way- also a great job.
I never felt like I was doing good enough though. I constantly got comments from my eldest sister and parents like- ""Why don't you go to school? Get a degree and a better job?"" 
It seems everyone forgot my education stopped when I was 12.
At the facility I worked in, I managed to become a supervisor, and I was a damned good caregiver. 
After awhile, the facility started wearing me down, and I left the facility to work in home health, where I made the most money I ever had.
It still just wasn't good enough. 
Fast forward a bit, and I'm 25, living with my fiancé who I'm getting married to in August. 
He is very supportive and understands everything with my family and my relationship with them.
My Nmom absolutely adores him, and thinks he is wonderful.
She also thinks I'm a fuck up still. I receive unsolicited advice on my life and wedding. She tells me what she thinks I'm doing wrong, and if I dare stand up for myself, she starts to cry or gets overly sensitive saying she just loves me and doesn't understand what she did to upset me.
An example of the things she gets up in arms about, I sent a funny snapchat of a cute guy to my single friend (who is a family friend) saying I found her a man, she thought it was hilarious and told my mom when they saw each other next.
My mom called me the next day and spend 43 minutes telling me I was going to be a bad wife, and I need to represent my husband appropriately because anything I do and say goes back to him and reflects on him.
My fiancé found this ridiculous, especially because he was sitting next to me and knew I was sending that snapchat. 
That's just an example though, there are countless other instances.

I know as far as my childhood goes, my mom had a lot of pride and couldn't admit she made a mistake by taking in my grandma or choosing to homeschool. I don't hate my mother and I don't want to go no contact, I just wish she'd respect me. But that's a snowballs chance in hell.

My fiancé and I have decided in two years we are moving across the country to live in the same state as his family. Much to my mothers disappointment though. I've gotten comments like- ""Oh you love your new family more than us,"" or ""You like his mom so much more than me. You forgot about me.""

My fiancé has a great job, and he is currently supporting me. I've left caregiving, and currently don't work. 
This has most of my family telling me I'm making a mistake and I shouldn't use him like that and I need to pull my own weight.
I've explained, that me leaving work is now giving me to opportunity to give writing an actual chance, and our household doesn't need my piddly income when just before I left work, my fiancé got a raise that alone, covers what I was bringing in.
My fiancé and I are both overweight, and since I've left work I've had the time to make all home cooked and healthy meals. He's lost 80 pounds and I've lost 40. It still isn't good enough to most of my family, because I'm not working and contributing financially.
I frequently get comments from my mom like- ""Oh he is looking so good! I don't recognize him anymore! His hard work is paying off.""

I've kind of lost all fucks to give as far as that's concerned, and I'm starting therapy in July to help move past some anxiety hurdles. 
My fiancé's family is amazing and supportive, and I'm fairly certain they don't think I'm using him like my family tends to think.
I'm very lucky with how things have come together with my life, but that still doesn't stop me from needing to rant every now and then.

This morning while talking on the phone with my dad, in passing he said, ""You know we try to respect your choices even if we don't agree with them.""
That sparked some frustration from me, which prompted me to to vent on here. Definitely didn't mean for it to get so long winded but here we are.
Now to go have a cup of coffee and get on with the rest of my day. 
Have a good one, and keep on keeping."

The Starbucks by the office is open all hours, and I find myself walking back there somewhere around two in the morning. Andrew still hasn't returned from going to visit Sarah and I can feel my insides twisting at the thought of what's going on wherever they are. The shift has changed, and a new man in a green apron greets me. I order a black coffee and then sit in the chair that Sarah had occupied earlier in the night. 

My head is down on the table when I hear the chair across from me scrape against the ground and someone sits down. I know it's Andrew without looking up. There's no one else it could possibly be. Sure enough, when I lift my head it's Andrew's eyes I'm looking into. 

I'm not sure what I expected the Grim Reaper to look like. It definitely wasn't a pale man with light brown hair and hazel eyes. Andrew is handsome. Even when he is wearing the grimace. It's the face that makes me think I know where his name came from. 

""You know, I'd kill to be sitting in your chair right now."" He reaches out and grabs my coffee, bringing it to his lips. It's too hot to drink still but he doesn't wince as it goes down his throat. I wonder if it's a grim reaper thing - if they just don't feel any pain.

I wonder if all the killing deadens their nerves as well. I've never asked Andrew how old he is, but now doesn't seem to be the time. He's looking at me with this glint in his eyes. His expression changes. I don't like the smile that comes over his face. 

He takes another sip of my coffee. ""I didn't kill her, you know. I brought her back to the office.""

The blood drains from my face. ""Why would you do that?""

""Because you're going to be the one who reaps her, John.""

There's a creeping feeling that runs down my spine. I shake my head. ""No. I won't do it.""

""You *will* do it. Because that's your job.""

I push my chair back and shoot Andrew a look. ""Then I quit. You don't have an intern anymore. Alright?"" 

""Can't quit, John,"" Andrew is just drinking my coffee now. He puts it down on the table and links his fingers together. ""I mean I guess you *can*, but I'm not reaping Sarah's soul. Do you know what happens to a soul when it isn't reaped on time?""

I stand quietly at the edge of the table. I don't dare to engage him, but I can't move away either. 

I don't look at him but I'm fairly certain I can hear the smile in his voice. ""Their soul rots, John. Their soul rots away and they're just left a shell of who they once were. They feel no happiness. They feel pain, and fear, and all of those negative emotions that no one would want to wish on their loved ones."" 

My eyes are starting to burn and a lump is rising in my throat. ""You're lying."" 

""Maybe. Are you sure you want to take that gamble?"" 

I put my fist on the table and close my eyes. The truth is that no, I do not want to take the gamble. Not for Sarah. 

""You're a bastard.""

""Death and all his friends,"" Andrew opens his arms wide to embrace the room around him. ""Oh, right. There's a reason I don't have any."" 

""I'm quitting after this,"" I say. Death stands and gives me a little shrug. He downs the rest of my coffee and I feel the tug of sleep as it pulls at me. 

""We'll see,"" he answers. He heads toward the door and I follow him. Large flecks of snow fall around us. They stick to my jacket and get stuck in Andrew's hair. I think that it's not fair for there to be beauty in the world like this on such a terrible night. But I also wonder if perhaps the beauty is some sort of equalizer. One half to give back to the world what Sarah will cause it to lose. 

She's there in the office when we get back. Her scarf is draped over my desk - the small city of paperwork that I've long since forgotten about. It occurs to me that it's strange to care more about one soul than the thousands of losses that I had started the night out processing. But she's sitting there with her black hair still in braids and her collar bones jutting out against her skin like they could cut. 

""John?"" she says. Now her voice carries this tone that I think must be worry or anxiety. *Does she believe me now?*

""Don't talk to her,"" Death tells me. ""That only makes it harder. Just do it. Get it over with quickly.""

""John!"" Sarah cries. I take a step toward her and she shuffles back, jumping up from her chair but not before I have my hands around her throat. *Why did you come with him? Why didn't you run? Why couldn't you believe me when I told you to run?*

""Because it wasn't her fate to run away,"" Andrew says like he can hear my thoughts. I look away from her, squeezing my eyes shut. As she goes limp I feel a part of myself darken. A curtain somewhere is drawn. 

""I'm done,"" I say to Andrew. ""I'm done. I'm finished. I quit.""

""Afraid not,"" Andrew shrugs. ""You've been promoted. From intern to apprentice. I won't be around forever, you know."" He pushes the bridge of his glasses up his nose. His face fits his name now. ""Oh, don't look so grim now.""

4kom1n,1,2016-05-23,[F4M] Basic Protocol,CrowmeatDPP,raceplaypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/raceplaypenpals/comments/4kom1n/f4m_basic_protocol/,"""War"" may be a bit of an exaggeration, but anyone who claims that Western society is living in racial harmony has their head buried in the sand. Just turn on the news, the US, Europe, it's the same story everywhere. It's not anyone's fault, really- we're genetically designed to associate with those like us. But we're also designed to compete and conquer...

Let's introduce the Black Broadcast Capitalist Enterprises. International underground firm that is part of almost every market imaginable. News broadcasting, commercials, auctioning, farming, construction, law, politics, the film industry, sports... Everything. Though they always have cover-ups, ghost companies used to hide them from true sight. Most of the world has slowly been taken over by BBCE, and now they control enough to start moving.

Nearly every employee for the BBCE and their underling companies is of African descent, and the ones that aren't are very attractive white girls. Well, they weren't very attractive white girls at the start, but the BBCE works in the research industry and the cosmetic industry, and also the plastic surgery industry. They are very attractive now. Though they don't date, they deny any man that talks to them. Apart from a black man. And then if a girl talks to them, well, they'll introduce them to that high-paying secretary job at BBCE, and the cycle continues...

Now, however, they can start their original goal. To make the Black Race supreme. They've always been working towards this goal. Money is funneled into interracial porn productions, sent as child support payments to Black men and the women they breed, used to fund tuition for Black students to attend historically white colleges and universities and support the propaganda spewing Tumblr blogs they write filled with smut. In fact, BC Enterprises is the largest source of funding for the advancement of the Black race the world has ever seen- and it's working. Only, they are ready to launch a new initiative.

the Basic Protocol. Designed to target basic white girls, ones that are cute and the ones that are stunningly hot, the goal is that by the end of the year, nearly every white girl will dream of BBC stretching them out and being filled with the superior sperm. Of course, that takes time... And testing. If people suddenly get suspicious of the copious amounts of interracial porn that they can watch, targeted towards them in particular... No, the BBCE got to where they are now by patience and waiting. They were slaves by these stupid white men, now they'll enslave them. Only, they won't realize they are being enslaved until all their women are breeding black children and every job is taken by the superior black race.

The BBCE control everything, as mentioned above. And when I say everything... I truly mean everything! Every market, every business, everything is managed and monitored. If the BBCE want a famous celebrity to go black, for example Kim Kardashian... They start to influence her. Replace her friends' thoughts and let her friends convert her. Whisper in her ear. And then they put down their hand-made celebrity Kanye West to sweep in and finish the job. Now, millions of teens on instagram look up to Kim, and her sexy black husband...

This is only an example. The first step to the project is to pick a fresh target. I am sure that you boys can find a nice picture of a pretty girl who is ready to be tested and moulded into her ideal image! Then, the influence begins. Start replacing boys in her school with black ones, have her watch her crush get beaten up by a gang of muscular black guys. Surround her with pretty black men and... Her friends. Her friends will be converted in advance, on a more... Enhanced version of the protocol. Sped up. Her friends already love black cock and eagerly work for BBCE. They giggle and point out things like how much bigger and more dominant black men are...

And then they steer it towards sexual conversation. Is it true that black men are bigger? Is it true that once you go black, you can't go back? Stuff like this. Questions that keep our target up at night, pondering about them... At this point, we'll begin to convert her family. Take the men of the house out, her brothers and father, replace them with a new black step-father. This is a long process, but the black agent who will play as the step-father will begin to play subliminal messaging and hypnotic videos that are disguised as films. Ones that get her horny as the sex scenes get steamier, the ones that make her close her eyes at night, but not for sleeping.

Then we amp it up after a few weeks of this. After this amount of time, she's into black guys. But still into whites... And that can't do. We'll make her give a BJ or have sex with a white guy and his tiny penis, and then afterwards, a few days later, have her accidently walk into her step-father, or maybe find a beefed out black guy in the gym showers... Maybe asked on a date from the basketball player in school. And they'll get it on, slowly but surely.

She should have her first black cock within two weeks of amping it up. Then, we give her more black cock, and tiny white cock as well. From there, she'll make her choice. We'll get her addicted to the stunning pleasure of BBC, and then the BBCE will give her an internship at one of their prestigious offices, far away from her family. There, they'll pump her up into an airheaded bimbo secretary and... Rinse and repeat. Until they get the formula for the Basic Protocol down.

Then... They can release it upon the world.

---

The best message to me would be starting off the roleplay by writing about one of the girls. You'll play any man that comes up, and the world and how it reacts to the Basic Protocol, but also about the brainwashing and the effects it has on the four girls! So mentioning how they find themselves thinking about black men... Stuff like that. I'm more likely to ignore you if you don't write a response to the roleplay and get stuck in straight away, just because I can see your writing talent and whether we'll be a good match! "

The title says the basics of my problem. I'm going into my third year of college, but I've only taken 2 intro-level programming courses, which taught me programming logic and Java basics - probably similar to everyone else's programming intro courses.  
  
I've had a couple internship interviews that didn't even result in a call back to tell me I didn't get it. But I'm not too discouraged, because I didn't think sophomores with my amount of inexperience could even get interviews... if anything, it just made me feel like there's an amazing market for CS majors - and I live in Georgia!  
  
**On to the main point.** The interviewers both asked me one question in common: are you more interested in front end or back end? And I had to tell them that I had no idea. And that I had no idea what I really wanted to do... and that isn't really what worries me - I know I'm still really early on and there's plenty of time to find out what I enjoy doing. However, I do worry about what I currently dislike doing, and that's most of this problem solving that I see people recommending here in the sidebar: subreddits like r/dailyprogrammer, websites like Codewars, etc. that give you boring ass problems that are, honestly, a bit over my head at the moment.  
Don't get me wrong - I completely understand the point of them is to build logical thinking, problem solving, and Googling skills. But... they're just so mind-numbingly boring to me.  
  
So here's what I do like.  
I love working on GUIs and connecting functionality to every piece of the GUI I've made. I've always enjoyed design and data visualization. Web development is interesting and I've learned a lot on my own about it. But that's about all the experience I've gotten so far, so who knows what I'll enjoy? I don't know if I'll enjoy working with databases, because I haven't learned how to yet.  
  
So what's a good path (career-wise) for someone who enjoys those things?  
  
Any advice is appreciated, and thanks in advance!"

4kowrn,188,2016-05-23,.NET Wizardry,rmg22893,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4kowrn/net_wizardry/,"So I currently intern for a local government's IT department. It's pretty great, all things considered, aside from not being paid (at least yet). Many of the city's departments use an IP camera monitoring software. It works well, but it has some weird quirks, specifically to do with .NET, in which case all logic flies out the window.

So far, I have seen this particular software installed three separate times. I will also mention that all three of these times have been with me taking a quiet, observational backseat to the admin I'm shadowing, so they do most of the installation process. 

The first time, it goes as expected. During installation, it pops up a dialogue saying ""Hey, you haven't installed .NET yet; install it and try again."" But, the admin, being a seasoned veteran, closes the dialogue without even looking at it, and I have to point out the dependency to him. No sweat, everyone makes mistakes. I put a note in the back of my mind to remember, remember, the 5th of .NETvember.

The second time, I am with a different admin, and we spend, no exaggeration, six hours setting up a new machine (a machine that was supposedly already configured, but was inexplicably vendor-stock) with this software, due to various issues. One of the issues is that the camera software just won't open after installation. It takes about 45 minutes before I manage to convince him that we need to install .NET, and poof, it magically opens. He thanks me profusely and we leave.

Fast forward a few weeks, and we're installing it yet again. This time, the machine was actually configured ahead of time by another admin, but somehow doesn't have the camera software that he claims to have installed. We go to install it, and the unpacking dialog does the strangest thing. The progress bar fills up, it closes, and then it opens another below it, causing a cascading dialog box effect. We have no clue what's going on, but after twenty minutes of scratching our heads, I ask him if I can take the wheel, and I quietly install .NET. No more issues, works like a charm.

**TL;DR:** Always check for prerequisites before installing a program. Don't assume a program will fail in the same way every time because of the same issue. Don't assume a third party has done the proper setup."

* I've spent the last three summers volunteering to teach gifted children  (culminating to about 300 hours of volunteer work)

* I'm a co-President of environmental club

* I'll have been in NHS for two years by Senior year

* I've been in student government since freshman year

* I'll be a president or vice president of the Home Ec club hopefully next year (courts still out on this one)

I live in Gainesville, Florida, home to the University of Florida. Which *should* mean that there are plenty of internships and job opportunities, **however**, the market is saturated with 50,000+ students. Every time I apply for an internship, I'm told that they prefer to work with at least undergrads as minors are liabilities, minors end up receiving ""special care"", etc. Jobs are even worse as businesses have access to an endless and renewable source of cheap labor that doesn't require ""special treatment"" for being a minor. 



I see people on here with really awesome internships and other ECs and I wonder how the hell they got them. So, in short, what can I do to improve my extracurriculars? What ECs do you have that you're really proud of? How did you start them?

He essentially treats her as a slave, forcing her to do all the cooking and chores and often physically punishing her if she makes a mistake. My mother does not speak English very well and has no resources other than my older sister (22f, graduated in 2015 and is working several states away) and I (18f, just finished first year of college in a state three hours away, home for the summer). Once my mother told my Dad that she wanted a divorce and he replied, ""I dare you."" Another time, she said that she would go to the police and he was not intimidated at all, letting her walk out the door. Like my father expected, she was afraid to tell the police because she didn't know if they could really help her and because she was afraid of my father. When my father is extremely angry, he often threatens to choke us to death and lunges toward our throats. I do not know what my father is capable of and I do not want to know.

When my sister and I were younger, my mother was one of the most loving and caring moms there is. She was always strict with us, but she explained that it was because she didn't want my sister and I to end up helpless like her. After my sister entered high school, it seemed to occur to my mother that everything had become more high-stakes. She became emotionally abusive toward my sister; e.g. screaming that my sister would wipe her classmates' asses for a living when my sister wasn't performing perfectly in school and even rubbing salt into the wound whenever people hurt my sister. One of my sister's flirtatious female classmates often sought my sister's boyfriend's attention and led to my sister breaking up with her boyfriend. Whenever my mom didn't think that my sister was living up to her standards, she would bring up the flirtatious classmate as a weapon against my sister, saying that the classmate knew how to get what she wanted and that my sister was a good-for-nothing or that my sister would never be as good as the classmate because the classmate got into a higher-ranked college.

Since my mom was so disappointed in my sister's college admissions and was later so disappointed in my sister's salary (even though my sister attended an Ivy League and has a starting salary of $70,000) my mom keeps saying that I am her last hope. I have tried to be perfect but I can't be.  My mother became emotionally abusive toward me as well, and it is becoming harder and harder to cope. I just came back from freshman year of college (another Ivy League) with a B+ in one class (and a 3.73 GPA overall, down from 3.85 for the first semester), and my mother screamed hurtful things at me all day, telling me to go die, saying that she should kill herself for raising me, and asking what the hell I was doing at college if I had gotten grades ""this bad,"" failed to obtain an internship, failed to get a boyfriend, and gained nothing but weight. She also yelled her same-old, go-to insults about wiping my classmates' asses and being a good-for-nothing and whatnot. The next day, my mother refused to talk to me or even look at me unless she thought of something to yell at me. What my mother doesn't know is that I was diagnosed with severe depression this semester, that I have been seeing a therapist at my university weekly, and that I have a long-distance boyfriend (18m, my high school sweetheart and best friend) who was the only person there for me when I had suicidal thoughts. My sister and I used to be close, but nowadays she hardly responds to my messages and often calls me idealistic or childish.

I would never commit suicide because I'm certain that my adulthood can't be worse than my childhood and because I know that some people do care about me, but I don't know how to be happy. I am financially dependent on my father and will be for a long time because he will force me to pay him the entirety of my Ivy League tuition and other college costs by taking a significant chunk out of every paycheck I earn (it will take forever to save enough money to break away). I often resent my mother, but I am determined to save her from my father somehow. I love my boyfriend and my boyfriend loves me, and it worries me that all my baggage is taking a toll on him. My academic performance has high stakes because I want to be financially independent as soon as possible and because I want to appease my parents in the meantime, but my father controls my course registrations and is forcing me to major in a subject of his choosing. I don't particularly like this subject and am not particularly good at it.

Can any redditors relate?

tl;dr: My physically abusive father and emotionally abusive mother have extremely high expectations for me and control every aspect of my life that they can.

My parents told me that when I was in kindergarten for the first half year I didn't talk to ANYONE there. I only answered with yes/no when someone asked me something and that was it. I always sat alone while other kids were playing with each other, and I litterally didn't have any friends. 

My parents got called from kindergarten and got told that they should seek help (therapy) for me. I was really smart for such a young kid, but I had completely no social contact with other kids or people working there. I remember I didn't mind it at all.

Fortunately, some day I just completely changed (?) and started playing with other kids. Soon I had a lot of friends and was a 'normal' kid. My parents never thought about therapy anymore, because I finally was fine.

As I grew older it was getting a little better, but I'm still struggling with it. Everytime I come in a new surrounding (new work, new class, new friends) I'm extremely quiet. It takes really long (sometimes even a few years) for me to open up. I'm at college now and this first year (from september) I litteraly didn't even have a chat with any of my classmates except one.

My now best friend tried to be friends with me for 3 years and in those 3 years I never had a chat with him, I only sometimes answered some of his questions and that was it. After 3 years I finally opened up and we became best friends.

I've been on an internship for past 4 months and this is the hardest time for me. I'm trying my best to talk to everyone there, but it makes me so exhausted and stressed. When I was at school or work nobody really cared about that. They just found it weird. But at my internship I really get problems because of this. My boss wants to talk to me about it all the time, which brings me to another problem.

Everytime someone brings it up I literally start crying immediately. I can't control it and I feel really ashamed when I cry. It's not only with this. I cry everytime someone wants to talk about me. It doesn't matter what if it's something positive or negative, when I hear something or have to talk about myself I can't help but crying.

I remember one time in high school my teacher wanted to have a talk with me. We had a long talk about who I am and why I am like this (shy, quiet, extremely passive and all my teachers always thought I didn't care about anything), we were just talking and at some point he said ""do you love yourself?"" and I completely lost it, I mean really lost it. I started crying so bad he couldn't calm me down for good 40 minutes and we finished the talk. The next day he came to to apologize and said he had no idea I would react like this and he only wanted me to stand up for myself and say ""ofcourse I do"" when he asked it.

The thing is, I really don't know why I reacted like this. I don't know if I love myself or not. I don't know myself and I have no idea why I am like this.

In a few weeks I have an appointment with my academic advisor as I'm probably failing my class and he wants to know if there's any reason to it. Well my reason is that I'm not attending all my classes because I don't want to/ can't socialize with the people there and it's making me stressed and completely exhausted when I do, I also feel very exhausted and empty like I have no motivation to study eventhough I really want to pass.
I don't know how to talk to him about it, as I'm really bad at talking about myself without crying as I said. It's really important for me because if he finds my reasons serious enough, he could let me pass the class with some extra work. I really don't know how to approach this problem and I'm afraid I will completely fuck it up. I don't know how to start and how to explain it all to him.

I really don't know if it's just who I am or if it's some mental illness, that's why I came here. 

I'm sorry for such a long post, there's much more I'd want to tell, but I think those things are the most importnt.

Does anyone recognise this or could give me some advice?"

4kpt9i,1,2016-05-23,Relationship with grandparents is falling apart because of grandmother's dementia.,GrandKidofDementia,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4kpt9i/relationship_with_grandparents_is_falling_apart/,"This might be long and I'm sorry. Throwaway account.

I'm looking for advice on how to talk to my grandpa and what I should do to be a good grandkid to my grandmother.

TL;DR: My grandmother has always been difficult but is now intolerable due to dementia. She's incredibly angry with me. My grandfather is miserable and has given up his entire life to take care of her, and I really don't have the wisdom to know what is the best course of action.

My grandmother has dementia. She has always been a fairly insufferable person, just her personality (that's another post for another time), but she has always been a wonderful grandmother and loved her family with her whole heart. I'm not lying when I say that the only people that like her are members of her own family. 

She was diagnosed with dementia a few years ago along with some other health problems. She's deteriorated especially in the most recent years and she now has to live in a nursing home, which she hates. She is rude to staff, she refuses to socialize with other residents, and is incredibly demanding. All of the staff hates her and I don't blame them or hold anything against them because they're right; she's awful.

Her husband, my grandfather, was one of the happiest, jolliest people to ever live. I have never met a single person who had the slightest bad thing to say about him. He was active, social, hardworking, volunteered, very doting on family/grandkids, liked everyone he met no matter their lifestyle or politics or anything. For the majority of my life I had never, ever seen him in a bad mood. 

But he's very old fashioned. One of those ""you stick by your spouse no matter what as long as you physically can"" and he's doing that. He's not the grandfather I remember. He's miserable, doesn't smile, is exhausted, had to give up his volunteer work that he was passionate about, no visiting family and friends, gave trips and vacations, gave up job that he loved, and his free time. Basically, he gave up everything that he should be doing/enjoying in post-retirement life. 

He takes care of my grandmother for 12 hours a day, every day. No breaks, no day off. He sits with her at the home, carts her back to their house for 6 hours a day (every day) because she hates the nursing home. He can't be more than 10 minutes away from her or the nursing home because she calls at all hours (confused) and he has to rush there to help because she fights the staff. He's healthy for his age, but he's not a spring chicken anymore and age has taken a toll as well.

He counts the days he does this. He cooks or brings her all her meals because she won't eat the food served there. Her mind is deteriorating, but with modern medicine, she can still live for a number of years. 

The family is starting not to be able to stand my grandmother. My aunt (their daughter) hardly ever visits because she's awful and mean. My dad (their son) lives across the country and hates calling, for the same reasons. My cousins are busy or don't visit, and I live an hour away with no car. I'm a busy student so I literally get up, go to school, do homework, study, and sleep. When I am free, it's usually too late at night to call. As a result, my grandmother is pissed at me and mean when I do visit. I've tried to explain and to apologize and do the best I can, but it's not good enough for her. She's ordered all my pictures (or anything that relates to me) taken down and removed.

I handmake all my Christmas gifts, but this past Christmas I was busy with finals and an internship so I didn't get them done as quick as I would have liked. I finished my aunt's by the holiday, but my grandma's wasn't done yet. I left my aunt's gift with my mom and my mom dropped it off by aunt to be nice. My grandma flipped out and was so mad that I didn't have one for her that she disowned me. My mom and grandfather tried to explain that I did have a gift for her, it just wasn't finished yet, but she wouldn't be reasonable.

I don't even want to see her at this point. I missed my cousin's birthday/mother's day celebration because my grandpa told me that she wasn't going to be happy to see me, even though he and my family miss me. I have my own stuff going on in life (as we all do) and I couldn't bring myself to take time to go and be yelled at by her. 

For most of my life I've been a dutiful grandkid. Gracious and polite, spent more time with them than my cousins combined. Put up with my grandma's quirks, always called, visited, and did stuff with them even if it was ""old people stuff"". My dad has told me that they think I'm ""special"" since I'm the only granddaughter, and my grandma always wanted a granddaughter, but with life, growing up, and these added things, it's a lot harder to keep it up. 

I haven't seen my grandma since thanksgiving. She didn't say a word to me. 

I know dementia isn't her fault, I do love her and I know that this is much harder for her than it is for me. I don't want to be one of those young people that just ignores their aging relatives. But I'm angry. I've talked with my aunt and we're almost at the point where we want to hold an ""intervention"" of sorts because it's so hard to see my grandpa so miserable, when that's not who he is. Everyone in the family is quickly becoming resentful of the situation in general.

I want to reiterate that I love my family. I have very fond memories of both my grandparents and am grateful for them. Which is why I feel so awful. Part of me is guilty, but I just don't know how much I can take at this point. I've tried telling myself that it's not her fault and I've accepted that the ""old her"", so to speak, is gone. I don't know why I can't bring myself to tolerate it for her sake. I know it's pointless to be angry at her, but I am. 

Am I bad a person? Am I just being ""young and selfish""? Am I disappointment? I know I don't have a ton of life experience in this area. I'm in my 20s so I don't know what it's like to watch people you love age and deteriorate, powerless to stop it. I don't know what the right course of action is, and I really lack the wisdom of what to do here. Should I try to mend things even if I'm the one doing all the work? Is there anything to help my grandfather? "
4kq00u,3,2016-05-23,"[NEWS] PM gets Education Bill passed, expanding education and job skills programs along with the new large Education Budget.",Frostbitte,worldroleplay,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldroleplay/comments/4kq00u/news_pm_gets_education_bill_passed_expanding/,"Today after passage through the Congress of Deputies and Senate the Education Bill introduced by the Prime Minister and Education Minister allocated large discretionary funds after the Budget passed which almost doubled the percentage of how much the government allocates towards Education. This is apart of Prime Minister Díaz's plan to raise Spain's level of college educated workers to produce a more modern and professional economy. Currently 57% of adults aged 25 to 64 have upper secoundary education, Díaz wants to raise that to the OECD average of 76%.

The Education Bill allocated all of the new massive discretionary funds in Education provided by the Budget:

* €8 Billion Undergraduate Public University Fund - This money will be dispersed to public universities based on need to increase expansion, offer new programs, lower fees, modernize classrooms for Undergraduate persons, and hire more professors.

* €5 Billion Secondary Education Fund - This money will be dispersed to secondary schools based on need to modernize classrooms, fund expansions, offer new classes, and hire more teachers.

* €1 Billion New Secondary Schools Fund - This money will be used to fund construction of 20 new Secondary Schools where overpopulated secondary schools exist.

* €2 Billion Job Apprentice/Internships Program - This creates a new program where low income citizens can apply for up to €15000 in grants from the government for general aid while they are in apprenticeships and internships that are unpaid or only provide minimum wage to insure that no citizen turns down additional education due to lack of funds or the ability to do such. The government projects around 150,000 citizens will be able to partake in the program. Directly assisting poor persons financially and educationally.

The Education bill also allows autonomous communities to raise the compulsory age of education from 16 up to 17 should they choose.

Díaz says with a combination of creating additional education infrastructure, that not only will it build a more competitive and educated Spain but a more productive and economically positive Spain."

How do I cope?",throwaway_0901_2012,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4kq0pq/update_me_21_f_with_my_boyfriend_26_m_of_35_years/,"**Link to original post** https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4jzimw/me_21_f_with_my_boyfriend_26_m_of_35_years_hes/

Hi everyone, my original post didn't get much attention but I love reading updates on here, so I'll post my own. The comments on the original post really hit home for me that my ex-boyfriend was not the right one for me if he had to choose between me and someone else. You guys had a lot of great quotes, and it just hardened my resolve to leave him, so thank you. My best friends and even my one random classmate who found me crying in the bathroom echoed what was already said on here. It was easy for me to calm down once I made up my mind, so I kept myself busy with school, internships, friends, and family until I met my ex. 

So on Saturday, I met with him and he told me his decision, which was to end things because of the long distance and already lost feelings. He said that didn't necessarily mean that he was going to be with his coworker from Starbucks, because he realized that he still didn't actually know enough about her to know whether it would be a good idea to enter a relationship with her. I said that I was planning to dump him either way, and I packed up my stuff from his place while we talked, and I burned all of the Polaroids of us in his fireplace. I think he was taken aback by the action. 

At least he made the break up easy by agreeing with and repeating all the things that I said, which was that he screwed up because he was stupid and weak, and that he has to work on the long-distance thing if he wants to follow his dream of joining the army. I also asked him if he had fully communicated with his coworker about everything between us, and he said that she only knows that we were going through a ""rough time"" and that we were meeting Saturday. I told him, ""Our relationship just failed because of the lack of communication, and you think it's a good idea to start your next one without full communication??"" Come to think of it, I didn't get a solid response out of him but long-term planning was never his strength anyway and it's his problem.

His friends still love me and want to hang out, so that's a small victory that I hope will annoy him and the other woman. They all know that I was the best thing that ever happened to him, and they're sad that we broke up and hope that things go better for me. Thank goodness that I'm objectively in a better position in life than him and according to him, there's nothing wrong with me, so it's easy for me to keep my chin up. I'm just dealing with the anger of what he did and that he may present the situation as a natural fading of feelings instead of emotional cheating, but I have no more sadness because the relationship and him are dead to me.

**tl;dr**: My ex was choosing between me and his coworker from Starbucks, and I decided to break up with him because I'm better than that. He knows that he screwed up and that he has a lot to work on. No sadness is left in me, only anger."

I just recently got into learning Pen Testing through the Hackers Playbook 2, Black Hat Python, and Offensive Security Metasploit. I feel like this was a great starting point to get introduced into Pen Testing, tools, procedures, exploits, etc. 

I'm already well versed in Java, Javascript, HTML, PHP, Python, SQL, Bash and PowerShell (currently learning Assembly x86/x64 and some Ruby). I'm a year away from my BA in Information Technology concentrated in Data and Database Assurance with a Minor in Math. At the same time I'm a current IT Intern working a Help Desk (IT Support Analyst). I want to move into security from this position when I graduate. (*Generally I want to get a job in Pen Testing/Cyber Sec Consulting*)

My question is... is it a good idea to start a personal blog with posts containing my learning experiences? Such as a few days ago my company got a phishing email sent to them. I took a stab at reverse engineering (if you can call it that) the link and finding the payload by Base64 Decode, de-obfuscation, etc and finding out it was a spam network. 

The reason for this blog is to show future employers stuff that I worked on in my spare time and mini projects that I undertook to prove technical skill and knowledge. 

With that I go to my second question, I am planning getting a Master in Network Security after I get my BA. I wanted to attain the OSCP certificate after my BA. But due to little experience in the Info Sec field a lot of people told me to get my Net+ and Sec+ from CompTIA to bypass HR Filters and to learn the basics of computing.

So should I attempt doing the Net+ and Sec+ before the OSCP if I want to get into Pen Testing/Consulting? Or should I go straight for the OSCP and learn along the way?

Thanks all for your help! "

[What was your favorite story to cover ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4kosr3/iama_soledad_obrien_im_a_journalist_and_all/d3gjdn1?context=5)|Don't really have a favorite.  love reporting on sports for RealSports, love reporting on race (black in america and latino in america docs). Very excited about my new film coming out tomorrow (one day only!) about veterans with PTS--it's beautiful and I think the conversation that follows the doc is really important.  (shameless plug: go to fathomevents.com to buy tix and see theater locations)
[Have you experienced sexism or disrespect by people you have interviewed?  If so, how did you deal with it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4kosr3/iama_soledad_obrien_im_a_journalist_and_all/d3glv62?context=5)|Yeah, sure.  i think the key is to not let others idiocy throw you off your game.  in the moment i tend to deal w it by smiling nicely and informing them that i'm happy to get them a cup of coffee and i'm looking forward to interviewing them too.  that tends to un-nerve them.  for the most part i ignore people disrespecting me--it takes too much energy to focus on that crap and i have a lot to get done. 
[What are your thoughts on the news outlet bias that seems to be the future of news media?  Is it difficult to report on issues that directly impact your identity, i.e. race, gender, political beliefs?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4kosr3/iama_soledad_obrien_im_a_journalist_and_all/d3gmsn8?context=5)|Hmm no, i never found that.  i think identity is really interesting--but i'm a big believer in using studies and data as the basis of my reporting.  i believe good storytelling always rules.  the doc that's running tomorrow (The War Comes Home --go to fathom.com for theaters and to buy tix) is about the identity of veterans.  getting and up close and authentic look i think is very helpful to the doc--it makes it much better.
[Hi. I hear you have a foundation. What does it do?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4kosr3/iama_soledad_obrien_im_a_journalist_and_all/d3gl1d9?context=5)|We send girls to and through college--mostly girls who lack financial support.  it's called the Starfish Foundation.  We also hold PowHERful conferences, for girls,  where we host a day long summit, in cities across the country, for high schoolers and college students looking to access info about jobs in STEM, opportunities for internships, and more!

There are of course live shots from terribly tragic scenes--those are often the hardest to do because you're crying between shots.  
[What are some of your favorite documentaries?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4kosr3/iama_soledad_obrien_im_a_journalist_and_all/d3gjt8s?context=5)|Just finished my 41st doc.  my faves--first Black In America doc, the one about Silicon Valley too.  Loved the doc I did about female rescue workers at ground zero.  love my new project--The War Comes Home following two young men, both veterans with PTS, as they go through a week long program called Save A Warrior.
[I am Latina trying to tell the stories of fellow Latinos in my community, do you have advice on how to get out there and talk to people and their stories? Is there a good starting point?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4kosr3/iama_soledad_obrien_im_a_journalist_and_all/d3gnzgw?context=5)|Yeah, don't interview people--just talk to them.  you won't get any good stories if people don't trust you.  just hang out with people and when you do tell a story, whoever it features, make sure you fully feel the onus of doing a good job.  having someone's story in your hands is a lot of power--respect that.

Have you ever dealt with shyness growing up?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4kosr3/iama_soledad_obrien_im_a_journalist_and_all/d3gngb2?context=5)|I was pretty outgoing as a kid.  i think for a twenty year old (or really everyone)  try stuff.  do internships, volunteer, expose yourself to interesting opportunities to get a sense of what your passion might be and how that might intersect with what you're good at.  informational interviews are exhausting but helpful too.
[I've finished my journalism college last year, I'm happy to ask another journalist some questions!  What inspired you to become a journalist? Do you have any tips for a starting young journalist? Do you believe we could make a difference on the world?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4kosr3/iama_soledad_obrien_im_a_journalist_and_all/d3gmp4x?context=5)|First, congrats!  i started interning and immediately loved it (wbz tv in boston, which was back then an nbc station)  tips? write write write.  all the time.  get your foot in the door.  there is no question in my mind that journalists have a huge capacity to bring attention to important issues and thusly, facilitate change.

[How often are you recognized on the street?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4kosr3/iama_soledad_obrien_im_a_journalist_and_all/d3gnfdw?context=5)|Fairly often, to the point i've had to stop running around in sweats and my hair in a scrunchy when i'm grabbing a quart of milk because there's a good chance i'll be in someone's selfie.  
[I used to work with Cliff Stoll and met you once on the set of The Site. What was it like to work with Cliff and Leo Laporte?

[You are always so effective in giving speeches, answering questions, and formulating arguments. Really inspiring to watch you speak. How  do you prepare for speaking engagements or for interviews? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4kosr3/iama_soledad_obrien_im_a_journalist_and_all/d3gnwt2?context=5)|Be clear on what your message is--then build your speech to that point.  be clear and concise--write like you'd speak, so it doesn't sound 'speechy"" .  i think the best strategy for sounding good is to really be prepared re: what you're talking about.

Got the internship of my dreams :),engrstudentthrowaway,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/4kqr50/hard_work_is_paying_off_got_the_internship_of_my/,"Hello!! I just wanted to share a neat opportunity that came up. I am an engineering student and the last year has been pretty unsettling. Sure school can be difficult, but the main issue I was having was that [I was afraid my education and the time I was putting towards my degree (sitting in class, studying for exams, etc.) was not leading me to my dreams.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3ujixz/im_lost_and_could_use_some_advice/) I have always had a passion for aerospace, especially spaceflight. It is the only reason I studied engineering... most of the coursework itself doesn't interest me, to be honest. College is definitely the way to go about realizing these dreams, but sometimes in the midst of it all, it is very easy to lose track of why you're really there. 

Anyways, I recently got accepted for a NASA internship dealing with human spaceflight. This is an absolute dream come true-- it is the pinnacle of everything I have worked for these past few years. 

That said, I wanted to assure you all that you CAN achieve your goals. Make a plan-- start as early as possible and research what you need to get there, and talk to people who have been there. Surround yourself with people who will help you and pull you forward. As a college student, I am amazed at how willing my professors have been to help me-- all it takes is a little demonstrated initiative. Take advantage of all opportunities that you can find-- start small, and build yourself up from there. Take advantage of the skills you have, and improve the skills you'll need to achieve your goals. 

If your will is sincere, you will find a way. "
4kqrlt,6,2016-05-23,"failed calc, should I retake it in the summer or fall?",al3xisnic0le,rutgers,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/4kqrlt/failed_calc_should_i_retake_it_in_the_summer_or/,"Just want to thank whoever takes the time out to read this.. it really means a lot.

so I failed calc after getting a 70 on a makeup midterm when I needed a 90. Kinda unfair because I got into a car accident 2 days before the exam and still took the exam with a head and neck injury. Not sure if I could fight that and if I could, who I would even fight it with... so let's assume I have to retake it. 

My options are to now take it during the summer (Monday, Wednesday, Friday from 6:00pm to 8:40pm). In case that didn't sound awful enough, let me emphasize FRIDAY UNTIL 8:40 PM. 
My other option is to take it in the fall and partially ruin my great schedule next semester (which I'm resentfully ok with).

Here's my dilemma:
I am a pre-business (with intentions of Finance and Accounting) major, and upon contacting career services they told me the big fish (such as a J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs and other ""Wall-Street guys"" start recruiting as early as September/October. I ended with a 3.2 last semester and ignoring my F in calc (which puts me at a 2.625 for this semester, and a cumulative average of 2.846), I end this semester with a 3.5.
I think I can get at least a B in Calc if I take it over the summer so my GPA would be at about a 3.31. A 3.31 (B) looks a lot better than a 2.8(C+). 
Although they will see what classes I'm currently taking, see that I had all A's/B's for my other classes spring semester, and see that I am retaking Calculus, I feel like they would immediately be turned off by the cumulative GPA to look into how it got to be that. 
I am also working for a small CPA firm this summer, for your reference.

So my options are basically ruin my summer because of that Friday class and during the week not be able to work at a CPA firm in North Jersey (too far to drive back and forth to), or risk not getting a good internship because I didn't re-take it in the summer and now my GPA sucks.

Anyone who could give me any advice on what would be the smartest thing to do, it would be greatly appreciated.

I thought I would take some time to reflect on my career path this fall Sunday, and more importantly, countless mistakes I had made with my resume.
This morning I found a file of old resumes as I was cleaning my hard drive. In fact, I was able to locate one from each year of college.


Let’s profile the progression of an undergraduate student resume to help you benchmark your current resume. Use this analysis of past resumes to identify best practices, learn when to seek help, and what mistakes to avoid.


###Freshmen Year^r^r^r^r

A lack of professional experience coupled with insufficient knowledge of resume mechanics will make it difficult to position yourself as a competitive candidate, especially for those who are seeking their first internship.


Freshmen don’t have time to worry about effective resume preparation, let alone educate themselves on tedious resume details. I was not an exception. Rather then grouping sections by experience, I chose to organize sections by competencies and use examples from various self-directed projects and organizations to support the claim. This approach resulted in some weird resume/cover letter hybrid:

[Freshman Year Resume](https://rezi.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Y11.png)
##Resume Elements include

• Objective

• Skills summary

• Skills and Experience

• Computer Skills

• Education and Training


Luckily, as an undergraduate, you’ll have many university provided resources at your disposal. I suggest reaching out to your university’s career advising center…but heed my warning, those guys are busy; really, really busy. If I remember correctly, they suggested I highlight any time I learned or used a technical skill.


###Sophomoreo Year^r^r^r^r

While freshman year should be spent integrating yourself into student organizations, exploring academic opportunities and developing technical skills (I suggest you take advantage of free university-provided software training classes. These courses will help develop a foundational technical understanding and can be included on your resume). Sophomore year is a time where the ambitious gain an advantage by applying to competitive internships or research positions. A proper resume is paramount to landing such a position…


Fall semester of my sophomore year I started an e-commerce business and was faced with a dilemma…how does this new experience fit into my existing resume? The answer: It didn’t. The resume of freshmen year had to go.


This iteration of my resume focused on proper formatting mechanics (poorly) more so than the content:

[Sophomore Year Resume](https://rezi.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Y2_Page_1.png)


##Resume Elements include:

• Objective shortened

• Education highlighted

• Defined experience sections. Organized by themes of freshmen achievements

• Introduced bullet points

• Skills section in list form to increased ATS readability

• Font &amp; typeface selection

If you’ve developed great experience but have little knowledge of formatting,  take a look at the [Rezi BETA Resume Template.](https://rezi.io/optimized-resume-template/) Let our knowledge of resume mechanics take care of the dirty work while your experience does the talking.

###Junior Year^r^r^r^r

Career fairs, mock interviews, networking…junior year should be your busiest yet. Hopefully by now, you are well emerged in student organizations and maybe your persistent dedication has landed you a leadership position (LPT: that’s the goal of student organizations).

Your chosen career path should be more clearly defined. Now that you’re past the halfway point, you should really think about want you want to do post-graduation. The summer following your junior year will be the launching pad of your career. Aim to use this period to excel in a position related to your vocational goals.

Keep in mind these positions are even more competitive. Your resume must be on point, master the tedious mechanics if you want to see results. Luckily, my roommate was a resume reviewer for the university business school. Here is the resume we created together:

[Junior Year Resume](https://rezi.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Y3.png
)
##Resume Elements include:

• Objective deleted

• Education highlighted

• Defined experience sections organized by accomplishments

• Introduced well thought out and actionable bullet points

• Skills section in list form to increased ATS readability

• Font &amp; typeface selection

In this iteration I focused on quantifying accomplishments and making sure my experience descriptors contained critical elements. I also made a major shift in the format. This is the resume was used to land my first “competitive” internship

If you are behind in your resume at this point check out the [Rezi Complete Resume](https://rezi.io/). It’s a safe bet.


###Senior Year^r^r^r^r

Senior year was essentially building on the experience I developed during the previous years and tailoring my resume to reflect this. It was around this time that I first heard about Applicant Tracking Systems, or ATS. The first version was used to land my second “competitive” internship. The second semester version of this resume is my first attempt at optimizing it to pass ATS.  Let’s take a look:

[Senior Year 1st Semester Resume](https://rezi.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Y4.1.png)

##This is the final resume:

[Senior Year 2nd Semester Resume](https://rezi.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Y4.21.png
)

Your resume may take a similar path of continued improvement but we suggest you skip right to the punch. Take advantage of years of development and check out the Rezi BETA Resume Template.  From the students Rezi has talked with, a commonality that we are seeing with student resumes is they do a pretty poor job of pulling key skills out from education. 

Many students don't have relevant work experience to highlight those skill sets. The goal of the [Rezi BETA Resume Template](https://rezi.io/optimized-resume-template/) is twofold, to show the employer that the student has learned the skills they need to be a successful employee, and simultaneously increase employer knowledge on educational programs to increase the perceived relevance and value of education.

4krqaq,8,2016-05-23,Question for any of you who are employed within a brewery doing QA/lab work,csml23,TheBrewery,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBrewery/comments/4krqaq/question_for_any_of_you_who_are_employed_within_a/,"Hey guys. 




So I've recently been applying to job posts for lab positions at local breweries but have been coming up empty, not even a call or e-mail back. For those of you who are currently working in a brewery doing QA work I'm curious as to how you got to where you are and your course of action.  I've recently started reading a book called Quality Management: Essential Planning for Breweries, and am aware that it may be difficult for me to get hired on at the smaller places as they don't usually budget for a dedicated quality program (it's usually undertaken by various other individuals). 




A bit about my self, I graduated with a BS in Biology and worked for three years in a contract food safety lab (Silliker) doing micro on everything from raw ingredients and processed foods to environmental swabs. From there I went to work for a beverage co-packer as a QA tech doing mostly line checks, finished product analysis (ph, TA, brix etc.).  This transitioned to me coming over to my current job where I have been for the past 1.5 years. I am currently a QA tech at a large dairy/dairy alternative beverage manufacturer. My duties again focus on doing line checks, analysis of finished goods, microbial testing of finished goods for product release, analysis of ingredients for receiving. 



Aside from this professional experience I have recently began home brewing, I have only done one extract batch thus far but am setting up to do an all-grain batch. I have done the Certified Beer Server certificate through the Cicerone program and am moving towards Certified Cicerone. In addition to this I have recently started an online course to receive my Lean Six Sigma Black Belt certification. 




I would like to think all of this adds up to a decent looking resume but I continue to come up dry. I realize experience is very important and I lack that in a brewery setting, knowing this I have gone as far as to submit myself as an unpaid intern so that I can gain the experience. However, I still come up empty. 



Can anyone give me any suggestions as to what I might do to get better results?




Thank you for reading this long winded post and any advice you may have. "

4kse8l,4,2016-05-24,Yalgobaoth,TwilitKing,randomsuperpowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4kse8l/yalgobaoth/,"##**History**

Yalgobaoth has not always existed in the same way as the interns had found it. It came into existence about the same time that the universe began, but only started to have any sort of activity about the same time that humanity began to arise.  It used to be very much like the Gehenna of Hebrew tradition, as in it was a plane of unending fire where some of the souls of wicked humans would end up and be burnt away until nothing remained at all. Some clever wizards even made Yalgobaoth into their own personal dumpsite. Even with this plane of seemingly unquenchable flames something would sometimes be left over, and these pieces would lay the groundwork for the formation of Yalgobaoth proper.

At first, it would be an island of rock and metal mixed in with the burning souls, only for it to be melted back into the flames. As time passed though, these islands would become more and more cohesive before they began to cover Yalgobaoth for the most part. With these lands formed, the wizards’ dumpsites ended up bringing more and more substance to the plane, with waters forming and mixing with the soul remnants to create Aqusía. Eventually even life began to brew on what would have been a plane of oblivion and punishment, with some things from Earth being incidentally transplanted to Yalgobaoth in some fashion.

At first life on Yalgobaoth was simple, but something about the nature of humanity’s souls prompted the growth of intelligent life. There was also some failed Golems that were trashed by alchemists that landed in Yalgobaoth and acted as sorts of ascension devices (think 2001 Space Odyssey’s Monoliths), but not in the same sense that they just triggered evolution but more like guided the early Baothians into using tools and magics. Through the Golem’s guidance, society quickly formed and began to match that of Earth at the time, which is to say very feudal.

About the same time as Baothian society had solidified, Golems acted as the kings of manors and had tense negotiations among each other. A small war here and there for mining sites of Psyanimite or the other soul infused ores. They collectively agreed to place a ward over Yalgobaoth to prevent magic from coming through, that way so nothing could challenge their rule over the Baothian society. It worked fairly well, and the Golems got to keep their disputes to fairly petty things instead of worrying about a new Golem or creature trying to overthrow the status quo.

Unfortunately, their barrier was imperfect, instead of blocking things from entering Yalgobaoth, it acted more as a filter, catching whatever tried to pass through and leaving it there to degrade and fester along the sort of magic mesh. Sometimes these rotten blobs would leak into Yalgobaoth because of it, with whatever sentience remaining in them becoming almost entirely malefic and corrupted nearly anything it touched, leading to the creation of several monstrous individuals of Baothian history. 
One of the more notable instances was the corruption of Ika, who was originally the patron Golem of a small and edenesquely kept kingdom of Iksand. He often used his gardens to host meetings with the other patron Golems to show off the pristineness of his lands, and used the wealth he had to buy out other kingdoms for protection. Early in an evening of the 1000th Spring, Ika was struck by one of these blobs and felt as if his metal body immediately being corroded by the sludge as it warped him. His once pristinely kept body cracked open all over into ravenous maws as his mind was consumed with a vile hatred of the world and a desire to consume all. Unfortunately, he did not lose his mind entirely, as he knew he could not merely eat everything, so he used his magic to make himself look whole again and organize a meeting of the four strongest patron Golems and also warped them the same sludge until they kneeled before his rule.

In less than a few months, all of Iksand had become a corrupted place, with fiendish Baothians and Golems growing in strength by the day. The kingdoms set up by the patron Golems were falling apart, and many Golems worth their salt in magic escaped the realm of Yalgobaoth to evade the disaster. This left only the Baothians and the corrupted Golems left in Yalgobaoth and it seemed like all was lost until a hero by the name of Parbelo trapped Ika in a suit of armor and sealed his compatriots and their corrupted lands to allow none to come or go. Parbelo took the title of king after this victory and took the Castle Along the Blue Sea and began the Parbelo line of rulers.
Under the Patron Golems, the Baothians were only allowed to use the magics and technologies that the Golems allowed and were not allowed to develop those beyond what they were given. Seeing that the only reason that Yalgobaoth avoided destruction by Ika’s hands was because of using these forbidden magics, one of King Parbelo’s first acts was legalizing the development and usage of any magic or science. When combined with the secret magic and information that the Golems had been hiding, Parbelo’s kingdom was able to go into a period of flourishment and prosperity that had never been witnessed before, nearly matching that of Earth at the time (about 1700 AD), but with magical innovation replacing where humans had developed technology.

Emperor Jeizabela marked another strife-filled point in Baothian history, as she disallowed the free usage of magic. She had a reason for doing this of course, as her advisors had led her to believe that there would be an attempt to overthrow the government if such an action weren’t taken. After having such an engrained part of their society taken from them, the kingdom couldn’t avoid the revolt that bordered on civil war between the two factions. The rebelling faction would eventually choose to leave the mainland of Yalgobaoth and traveled across the Blue Sea. The aftermath of all this led to the ruler’s choosing to have their officials and advisors chosen by the public through elections.
It took that conflict in order to spur Yalgobaoth into what most would call the modern era, with a bit more implication of technology in the lives of the Baothians instead of the heavily relied on magics. While at first people were slow to associate technology with magic, they quickly began to when magitechnicians began combining magical ideas with scientific discoveries. It was during this era that the first factories began appearing to create and combine magic into physical materials and creating fuel sources by infusing magic into crystals and harnessing them.

Tragedy next struck with Prince Plagé Parbelo’s reign when a royal archiver by the name of Ariados discovered the origin of Yalgobaoth and the Baothians. The very idea of their entire realm being made of the dead of another world, and even they themselves being made of the very same and needing it all to survive felt utterly wrong to him. He wanted to destroy all of Yalgobaoth in order to escape what he thought would be an affront to all life, so he developed a weapon (which he named the Fang) that would break apart the souls from Yalgobaoth and restore it to its fiery state.

The artifact was a failure fortunately, as it only slowly warped the lands of Yalgobaoth instead of completely destabilizing them. This led to the creation of the silver mountains and caused the desolation of the Royal Road as well and costed Yalgobaoth countless lives. The Fang of Ariados was eventually sealed in the tallest spire of Castle Along the Blue Sea after a final confrontation with Prince Parbelo that costed Ariados’ and Parbelo’s lives as tribute for the sealing spell. Yalgobaoth would be saved, but Marinia Parbelo would be forced to ascend to the throne and the Castle Along the Blue Sea would still be under the influence of the Fang, causing its already bizarre architecture to become nearly intraversable even for its denizens.


##**Government**

Very simplistically, Yalgobaoth is ruled by a monarch who has advisors that are elected by the civilians. This monarch gives themselves a title when they ascend to the throne generally, but no two monarchs are allowed to share the same title and the currently used titles are as follows: King, Baron, Monarch, Queen, Emperor, Empress, The Lion, Princess, and Prince. Additionally, rulers are only allowed to have a single birth to avoid conflicts of interest in allotment of power. The current ruler Mariana Parbelo, does not have a title as she was unprepared to suddenly take the throne from her father after his passing. Rulers are able to instantly and fully install new laws whenever they please, but on lower tiers (basically going State, Province, County, and City) officials are allowed to set their own laws and decide how they are set. These lower tiers are generally elected positions as well, but some are based around lineage and competition.

With Emperor Parbelo, magic usage became much more restricted as a safeguard for her citizens. The restrictions made it so that only individuals with special permissions (law enforcement, development mages, and those with special situations) would be allowed to freely use magics that had been labeled Tier 2 or higher. Later on this would grow to include physical and hybrid weapons of Tier 1 or higher, though with slightly laxer requirements needed to be met to successfully get a permit for Tier 1. Some districts would decide to strengthen these restrictions of course. Other laws are logical, do not steal, do not murder, do not attack people for no good reason, things that lined up similarly with that of Earth’s.

Punishment depends on crimes. Imprisonment is generally handled by lesser districts, but it is not the common option, with most assigning community service instead for misdemeanors. For felonies, imprisonment is avoided altogether for a rather new alternative. This alternative punishment is the application of a mental magic to seal the criminal inside their mind for a period of time (relative to the seriousness of the crime) where they experience the same suffering they’ve inflicted on others approximately once per week until the sentence is fulfilled. While the criminal may feel as if they have spent months or even years, the actual length of time is only a couple seconds at most. This Mind Lock was developed to aide in the rehabilitation process by taking as little time and resources of the government as possible.

##**Culture**

Baothian culture is an odd mixture of magical reliance, a pseudo medieval government, and Nuclear Age ideals. While the technological level seems to be on par with Earth of the 1950’s, it is actually a mixture of magic and technology instead. In a similar sense, because of the long time reliance on magic, several scientific advancements that took place on earth never happened on Yalgobaoth. This is especially true in the realm of ailments and chemistry, where diseases and mental illnesses are handled through spells or enhancement crystals and chemistry is circumvented by the usage of alchemy. Along with this, things like guns and vehicles and factories look different from how they would on Earth, not totally different, but just enough to be very noticeable. For example, some guns look more like the retro future style (with tubes and containers connecting to magical sources) instead of how they would look.

The government was mentioned in the other section, but on a more local level places are going to seem more like a township democracy with elected officials. Some more rural areas may have slightly more meritocratic or feudal set up however, where those with the most ability to protect the community from being attacked by roaming creatures. Due to Prince Parbelo’s actions however, many of these creatures have been captured or killed or sealed away in the forbidden land of Iksand. This has led to said communities experiencing a shift towards the more urban councilships. This is not to say that there are not still some meritocratic set ups in place, especially in mining communities where the head of the operation is more often than not also in charge of the town.

In urban and suburban areas, lifestyles are close to how Americans lived in the 1950’s where Baothians are encouraged by their own competitiveness to pursue bigger and better things. This also means a very consumer driven culture where people work long hours to earn pay raises and bonuses in order to purchase big houses and expensive luxuries. Unlike in America, instead of strictly physical sports being king competitions hybridizing magic and physique reign supreme in mainland Yalgobaoth. Baseball is still popular though, though there is some controversy related to players using enhancement crystals on themselves and their equipment.

##**Boathians**

Yalgobaoth’s dominant form of life are the Boathians, which like everything else in Yalgobaoth are the product of the remaining scraps of some of humanity’s crueler souls. This combined with the golems influence caused the Baothians to be very human, but with some key differences. If all humans are considered to have some sort of spark for magic, then Baothians are born with a raging fire, and magical ability is as natural as eating and breathing is for them. Unfortunately, these raging flames lead to magical accidents in about the same way that human babies have diaper accidents, but a bit more explosively. They also have diaper accidents like human babies, to be clear. Thankfully, from the sheer lack of control that they have and the relatively lower amount of power babies have, these accidents just cause some small cracks or dents in furniture or appliances or flooring. Also like in humans, magical ability is something that comes with a certain amount of natural potential, but can be trained into something greater.

It may come from their origin of being made from the dark side of humanity, but Baothians are close in appearance to demons. Skin tone can range anywhere from a ruddy red and purple and pink colors to char black or bone white. They also have inhuman eyes, with much larger irises and pupils so that sclera can hardly be seen, and some having only orbs of color for eyes. Boathians, like demons, have horns and they can be shaped like antlers (deer- and antelope-styles) or like traditional horns (ram, bull, water buffalo…) or can be nubs. A few Boathians also have tails or cloven feet, but are in the major minority. The following quality is more because of the environment, but could also be seen as demonic, heat below 2000 C° does not really bother them.

Many Boathians have some of disorder based on region however, but the usage of Enhancement Crystals allowed them to get around their problems. Some are essentially mandatory, like numbing the violent tendencies in a community where people are too close and the damages could be very high, but others are more cosmetic or luxurious in nature, such as increasing physical abilities or making oneself more romantic for a partner. Recently though, Enhancement Crystals and their usage have been looked at with more scrutiny after reports of the Vin Ohn Governor was discovered to have used the Crystals to force a woman into being his perfect wife (The Mind Lock procedure was not used as his punishment due to foresight, and the governor was actually chosen for execution for such blatant violation of a person’s rights). Going off of this, the application of Enhancement Crystals is a permanent procedure for any but the most minor Enhancements.

Strangely unlike humans, Baothians have not had true superpowers form in their population. The usage of magic could easily be called a superpower of course, but it is not out of the ordinary among them, so to call it a power would not be accurate. This may in fact be because of their reliance on magic and alchemy, which caused physical adversity to be low enough that it fails to truly trigger anything wondrous from happening."

I need your help. I'm trying to experience the most I can out of my 20s, but I'm struggling.

My life up to this point has been irritatingly standard and relatively boring for a guy in his 20s. I spend a majority of my time doing schoolwork for my work-intensive major- Computer Science- and the little free time that I have is me dicking around not doing anything productive just because I need the mental break. I have no internship this summer so I'm taking classes (more schoolwork, yay) and applying to boring IT jobs in the area that are the best I can do to benefit my resume. I find I can't even start putting my time in the summer towards something productive I find interesting- it all has to do with coursework or my future. I feel as though my entire existence at the moment is for benefitting my future, and if I stop to enjoy myself I immediately fall behind. I even planned to find work abroad in Spain this summer, but unfortunately I found out I couldn't because then, for complicated reasons, I wouldn't be able to declare my major on time. 

Given all this, I've been trying to make my time here interesting by improving my social life, but every time I feel like I've accomplished something, I immediately regret feeling so. I continuously join new organizations to become part of new friend groups, but after a while I always end up disillusioned with the group after I realize the people in the group don't really care about me or value me as much as other members. This is generally because I'm kind of introverted and am not as loud/outgoing in big groups as are the people who catch everyone's attention. For this reason, I end up hating hanging out with certain groups and just hop to new ones, where the same thing happens. 

It's similar with girls. I feel like since I'm in my prime now is the best time for me to meet and date girls, but I have such trouble finding someone I like, and every time I do, I end up losing the girl to one of my friends who is more outgoing and sociable than I am (since I usually meet girls in my ""friend groups""). I've had my heart broken like this more times than I can count, and it makes me feel worse than anything else.

I want to travel, explore, learn about myself, make friends, meet girls, have fun, and everything else. But every time I try it just hinders a different part of my life or I get shut down because of the way I am. How do I improve myself? 

**Also, apologies if this is all over the place. I have trouble expressing myself through one text post without making it too long, so if you have clarifying questions I will answer. Thank you if you're reading this far- I'm just a bit down at the moment.

Will I even do well?,throwaway-016,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ksoh7/failed_out_of_cs_and_schoolended_up_doing/,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I had a rough history with school.

Did okay with my first year of CS...second year, things started to go wrong. Classes, of course, got harder, all the people I considered friends left to different parts of the country due to different reasons, significant other dumped me, I started to hate my school.

But past those circumstances, it was really hard for me to do well in school, and past a certain point, classes just became really difficult for me. The material seemed to fly over my head, and I just...lost motivation to keep trying.

Ended up failing out of school...programmed a lot of projects in my spare time and got several offers from start-ups (I was too scared to apply to any ""well-known"" companies). The startup I joined started to go under, so I jumped ship, interviewed again, ended up getting a programming internship at a relatively well-known company. Did well in that, enjoyed my work, contributed a lot, didn't get fired on the job. After that ended, I still needed rent money, so I started interviewing again, received a few offers. Began a software engineering job at another relatively well-known company that I still work for today.

(before anyone raises any ethical concerns, background checks are mandatory of course and I'd get into serious trouble for lying, so these companies knew my situation before hiring me)

Thing is, people at this company are pretty amazing and so is the work we're doing. It almost makes me feel unworthy, but I'm still employed after a while so I guess I must be doing something right?

But as of late, I've been inspired. I really do want to learn more about this craft I'm doing. I'm done rationalizing things away as ""I don't really like academic CS"" or ""school was never really my thing"" to try to make myself feel better.

But I'm scared, honestly. I'm scared of going back to school. I'm scared of failing again. I'm scared that maybe the whole ""academic CS isn't really my thing"" excuse is really true and maybe I'm not fit to be in this field (scary because I'm not really that great at many other things).

Is it too late to go back to school? Is it actually not realistic for me to do well in CS in school anymore? Should I just cop out and study something else and choose a different field?

Hi everyone! Since the start of my weight loss journey (~2 months ago) I have been lurking around /r/loseit and basically inhaling every single post. I’ve wanted to write this post for a while now, but I wanted to wait until I lost at least 10 kg and feel confident about my abilities to continue losing before posting. I have now lost 11 kg, so I’ve decided to come out of my lurking hole to write my first ever post on Reddit!

*Warning: this post is going to be ridiculously long, but I wanted to share my story and some tips I’ve found useful over the past 2 months.* I’m writing this both for myself to get some thoughts out of my head (I don’t easily share my feelings with people IRL) and for people starting out. Hopefully I can help/inspire someone similar to me! I’ll divide this into my background, what I’ve been doing so far (this part will include my tips) and my plans for the future.

###Background                    
So, I am a 22-year-old female (student). Growing up, I was always an average weight (although I wasn’t happy with my body at the time), not obese, not overweight. However, somewhere during my teen years (15/16ish?), I gained some weight, bringing me up to 82 kg (overweight). When I was around 17/18, I lost 10 kg together with my mom at an acupuncturist (don’t believe in that at ALL, but we had weekly weigh-ins and she gave us a meal-plan, which obviously ended up leading to a calorie deficit). This got me back to 72 kg. Looking back, I think I looked pretty damn good at that weight (unfortunately, I didn’t think so at the time), so that’s why I’ve set that as my initial goal weight. 

Fast forward a few months, two things happened. I met a guy, and I moved out of my parent’s house to go to university. Obviously, this led to some bad decisions regarding food. I don’t know the exact timeframe (I used to avoid stepping on a scale), but somewhere in the following 2/3 years I gained a lot of weight (the highest number I’ve seen was 110 kg). This led to some half-assed attempts to lose weight, and I think (based on my sporadic scale moments) that I have been kind of maintaining my weight between 105-110 kg for the past year. However, I never got serious about it, and, even though I really wanted to lose weight, it never happened.

So what happened that made me actually start this time? Well, it’s not the best reason IMO. On March 14, 2016, my boyfriend of almost 4 years suddenly dumped me (via whatsapp, seriously?!). This was completely unexpected, and it broke my heart. The next few days I felt physically sick, leading to me barely eating anything. Then, it happened: **the click!** I basically thought: why not continue now?  I had this revelation that I had been basically spending the last 4 years caring more for him than for myself, so it was time to start taking care of myself and finally doing something about my weight. Since then, I have been steadily losing weight and I am happy to say that I plan continuing for a while! :) My life at the moment might not be perfect, but at least I am taking control over this part of my life, which also makes me feel better in general.


###What I’ve been doing so far + my tips           
My approach so far has been pretty straightforward and simple: CICO at a calorie goal of 1200 (~1000 cal deficit) using MFP, no exercise (yet) apart from very irregular walking. So, below you can find some more concrete things that I have found useful so far.

1\. **Drinking.**       
First and foremost, I’d like to talk about drinking/going out while losing weight. There are quite some posts asking about this, and the answers are generally: not drinking while going out, not going out, drinking lower-calorie drinks instead of beer, drinking less/staying within TDEE/maintenance. I would like to offer a different perspective. While these are all valid approaches that may work for some, they don’t work for me. Firstly, being a student often means drinking with your fellow students. Secondly, being freshly single and a hermit most of the time due to my research internship, I really don’t want to abstain myself from these social drinking occasions. Thirdly, **and most importantly**, I know that I need to create habits that will be sustainable during maintenance. I know that I will still be going out after I reached my goal weight, and I know that I will not be restricting what I drink and how much I drink. Thus, my weight loss plan includes drinking occasions in which I drink whatever I please and however much I please.       

Does this work? Yes, it can work. As an example, the past month has included 4 drinking occasions (one of which was a day long festival), and I still managed to lose more than 3 kg (which I’m a little surprised by, I thought it would be around 2). *Side note: I do aim to have less drinking nights than this (every other week or so), but most of these were pre-planned occasions that I could not pass up on*. So what is the key to this approach? **Only let those drinking days be your off-days**. You will have to be diligent about your calorie deficit all the time. This might not work if you have issues controlling your food intake, but if you’re like me and it’s pretty easy to stick with your deficit on normal days then it’s definitely doable. Obviously, how well this will work also depends on how big your deficit is: if you only have a 500 calorie deficit it’s more difficult to still lose weight while occasionally drinking, but if you reduce the number of occasions it should still work. For me, since my deficit is a bit less than 1000, an evening in which I go 1000 calories over maintenance only leads to me losing 2 days of progress (the day itself + the next).            

Of course, it *will* slow your progress, but you *can* still lose while occasionally drinking. For me, the key is that – as many others on this sub have said – it is a marathon, not a sprint. In addition, I really want to set myself up for maintenance, and I know that maintenance will include drinking days after which I will have to eat at a deficit for a few days to make up for it. Of course I would like to lose weight faster, but fast is not always the best road. I might lose 1 or 2 kgs less per month, but I will get there while still enjoying myself. Obviously, this is my personal approach and this might not work for a lot of people, but it’s all about finding your own path to success! (: In my opinion, every approach is valid, as long as it works for *you*.


2\.  **Failure vs Victories.**              
Everyone is going to have bad days. This can be overeating, drinking too much (as you may have guessed, this applies to me), bingeing, going out for dinner or whatever. What I really want to stress here is that these bad days should **not be considered a failure**. They are not. They are part of life and everyone has them. They are going to happen during maintenance as well. The importance of these bad days lies in the way you handle them: every time you get back on the horse after a failure (no matter if it takes you a day, a week, a month or more) should be considered **victories**. Every time you move forward from a bad day, you are creating habit and building discipline that will last you a lifetime. Every time you get back on the horse, you are growing stronger and are becoming better at dealing with bad days. Every time this happens is a learning moment, and you will become less likely to fall into a spiral of bad days.

3\. **Mini-goals**         
This has been said before, but if you’ve got a big amount to lose, it is essential to have minigoals to help keeping you on track. In my case, saying I have 36 kg to lose in total sounds pretty daunting, but saying I will first lose 5 kg sounds quite doable. In addition, I have another strategy in which I don’t think in amounts of kg, but in percentages. For instance, I have now lost 11 kgs, and still have to lose 25 kgs. This still makes it sound like a mountain to climb. Instead I say: I have almost lost 1/3 of my goal (which will be at 12 kg), I only have to do this 2 more times to reach it! This sounds pretty doable right? In 7 kgs, I will be halfway, so then I’ll only have to do what I did one more time! Thus, I would advise you to keep track of percentages as well.

4\. **Goal Dates**       
Related to the last point, I really like to give myself mini-goal dates, because I feel like it keeps me on track. If you like this as well, I would advise you to make these goals achievable (not too easy, but definitely doable), so you will have a high change of actually hitting the goals (given that you mostly stick to your plan). I always give myself some leeway to account for bad day. For instance, say I aim to lose 1 kg per week. This means that I *could* lose 10 kg in 10 weeks. Instead of using this as my goal date, I always give myself 2/3 weeks extra. The same goes if you have “reverse goals” wanting to lose x amount by a certain date (e.g. a wedding, holiday). Make the amount a bit less than what is realistically achievable. If you do really well, you will reach your goal early (which is an awesome feeling!) and otherwise you can probably reach it by your goal date. Important: always remember that no matter how much you lose in a certain period of time, every kg/lbs you lose is a victory!


5\. **Deficit goals**    
Instead of having a hard goal (e.g. 1200 calories a day), give yourself a range (e.g. 1100-1300 a day). In addition, if you use an app such as MFP, set the calorie goal a bit higher than your actual goal. This way, you will feel less bad if you go over your goal by a bit (but are still in a deficit). You do not have to exactly reach your target everyday (this is nearly impossible anyways), but seeing the MFP numbers in the red might be discouraging. The average intake is what counts, and giving yourself a bit of leeway (both up and down) can help you stay on track and might also prevent you from becoming obsessive and perhaps eating under your goal consistently (which can be really appealing but this should not be the aim). 


6\. **TDEE**     
Finally, it might be useful to calculate your TDEE at increments of 5 kg going down beforehand and putting them somewhere (e.g. in a weightloss spreadsheet). This will remind you of the fact that your TDEE will lower a bit with every kg you lose, making it less likely that you end up eating at a lower deficit or maintenance by accident. 


###Going forward             
So what are my plans going forward? First of all, I am (obviously) planning on continuing what I have been doing so far. My ultimate goal would be to reach 72 kg by my 23rd birthday, which is on February 21st. Based on my calculations, this should definitely be possible, but I will be happy with every kg I lose between now and then, and I am prepared to continue losing after that date. 


In addition, I am planning on starting to incorporate exercise during the summer holidays. I’d like to try and start running using C25K, even though I have no stamina at all and have always hated running. I would also like to start weight training, in order to preserve as much lean body mass as possible and maybe have some newbie gains as well. Hopefully, this would also help reduce the loose skin I might get. Finally, I plan to become a more active member in this awesome community and hopefully help some people (just like all your posts and comments have helped me)!

Thanks for reading and stay awesome!

4ku4xg,4,2016-05-24,"Update to ""My internship wants me unpaid, 3 days/week for 9 hours.""",phototropism,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/4ku4xg/update_to_my_internship_wants_me_unpaid_3/,"OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/4jy1sf/my_internship_wants_me_unpaid_3_daysweek_for_9/


So I took into account everything everyone said, and decided to go with the advice to give the internship a try. I figured I could cut my losses at last resort, especially since the majority opinion was to dip asap.


When I first got here Monday, I arrived ten minutes early. The office lights were dimmed, so I just waited for the recruiter I was supposed to meet. The president eventually came in around 8:33 (office hours began at 8:30). I told him I was here to meet John*, the recruiter; he asked me if John was coming in. I said John called saying he was running late, to which the president frowned: “It shouldn’t be that hard to come in at 8:30. I have to send out an email.”


John got in the office at 9. Before that, the other intern (a master’s student) gave me two packets of expectations for interns (I don’t know how much detail I can go into because I signed a nondisclosure). John told me he’s not in the office much; he said the accountant wasn’t in today, so I’d be working for him. All of a sudden, the work rolled in: editing resumes. Editing powerpoints. Recreating their training manual. None of the work was difficult in any way, nor did I really learn anything; I had done similar things last summer, but that was a paid gig.


They have a fair labor wages poster on the wall in their kitchen.


At the end of the day, John gave me more work around 5:30—when their office supposedly closes. I was kind of miffed that he was giving me work at the end of the day, but I finished it anyway. I wasn’t sure if it was to be done tomorrow or not, but he asked for it when I was leaving, so I guess it was to be done right away?


Not a single person left until 5:50 at the earliest—and that was just the other intern and the secretary. Before I left, John told me that work for me would ramp up, as they haven’t really done much consistent work on their social media presence. He also asked me when I would be leaving, to which I answered mid-July—I figured I’d at least stick it out ‘til I got a chance with the accountant, and didn’t want to seem noncommittal right away.


Today, I met the accountant I’m to be working with. He didn’t seem to have any idea that I was coming or even here to help him. I told him that John told me I was to be working with him, so he gave me some work to do.


I’ve just spent my morning logging, scanning, and organizing by date receipts from the past year and a half and filling out his personal expense and reimbursement reports.


The other intern asked me to help pick up items from stores for the firm; another staff member just handed me a proposal to look over according to a checklist. I really was looking forward to an accounting internship where I could ask questions and learn more about the profession, but I feel like I’m just being thrown whatever work they don’t want to do. 


My dad told me to lower my expectations; my mom told me to do my best. I don’t know if all this work would be normal for a paid accounting internship, but I’ve been doing a lot of mind-numbing work for absolutely no personal reward whatsoever. There’s been no learning; I’ve worked in an office several times before, and I’m an experienced editor. 


~~I could keep sticking it out and see if I eventually learn something, but I really just want to figure out how to quit asap. I have to give two week’s notice before leaving according to whatever the fuck I signed, so I’m trying to figure out a way to politely tell them I’m legally allowed to go whenever.~~ Edit: Figured out a valid excuse to quit asap; I'll be gone by the end of this week.


So **tl;dr** &amp; lesson learned: don't pick up an unpaid internship with a small, unknown government contracting agency. Unless it's the company of your dreams or a guaranteed valuable experience, it's not worth it.


Thanks everyone for your advice; I learned a lot about labor laws and standards for technical internships, and I'm definitely going to keep all of it in mind when applying for future gigs.

We just reached 5000 subs on /r/CFL! I think when I took the position of Mod we were in the low 3000's.

This has been a personal goal of mine for quite some time now and I'm happy we were able to accomplish it before the 2016 Season kicked off!

We've built such a great little community that has been able to accomplish some great things over the past year. Some highlights that come to mind is having over 100,000 users here at one time for the Grey Cup, Dome Thunder, sticking up for the CFL interns and being asked by the league for help with their new API.

I love this place. Love coming here every day interacting with all of you and talking about this great league! With all the excitement going into the 2016 season there's only going to be bigger and better things coming!

Here's to 5000 more subs. 

I'm sure /u/-Rattata-'s Mom has a ""special"" present for all of us for this milestone.

I've had experience at both positions for the second XV, but I need to better myself in terms of strength, size, and fitness.

Part 1.,bluexblackx,depressed,https://www.reddit.com/r/depressed/comments/4kuv26/the_story_of_my_depression_part_1/,"When I was a sophomore in college I had a roommate named (something like) Garry Borman III. I don't know how we met. Some mutual friends in the dorms, probably. This was my first apartment on my own. He was an African-American kid, short and chatty, struggling to pass his classes. He was rich and a little spoiled, and came to school with a new-ish BMW. I am white, tall and quiet, and everything academic came easy to me. I didn't get much in the way of money, but over the summer had saved up enough to buy a motorcycle, a Suzuki 380. Harry's father was an orthopedic surgeon, and over the summer Garry had worked in his father's medical office. He stole a prescription pad and forged his father's signature and acquired a bag of amphetamines. Not a little bag. A bag the size of a cantaloupe tied with a zip tie that stretched like a big water balloon when you held it up. Black and white gel caps, filled with tiny white ball bearings that he showed my how to crush up and snort. I'd read all of Hunter S Thompson and all of the Beats and tried cocaine once and smoked a lot of pot in the dorm, even taken mushrooms once but this was the first time I had ever tried speed. I liked it. 

After Garry would go to bed, I would get out the bag and crush out a few lines. His car keys were always lying around the living room somewhere. His car was fun to drive. I had never driven a fast car before. My parents had Hondas and Toyotas. I drove it up into the hills, where the roads were windy and steep, through the fog and above the fog, sometimes through the tunnel into the suburban towns on the other side of the hills and then back. I'd get lost. No GPS, not even a map. Just keep driving until something looks familiar. Drive faster and faster and get nowhere faster. 

I'd stop at a lookout with a view, do a few more lines and think about what it would be like to put a shotgun in my mouth and pull the trigger, because that's what the fat ugly shy girl I almost had sex with and then laughed at to everyone did.  

I told my friends I would have sex with her and make a tape of it. I said I'd do it in the commons room behind a curtain. I don't know why I said these things. In the end I made out with her in her room, on her bed and got her clothes off and then stopped and told her I had to leave. I was scared. 

I never talked to her again after that. One day at the very end of the semester she walked into my room with a bucket of water and dumped it on my bed and walked away. We laughed at her. Crazy. And then she disappeared, never took her finals. Her roommate asked me if I ever really liked her. I didn't know.  And then the next year we heard that she had killed herself. With a gun. 

Today I don't remember her name, but I remember the expression on her face when she walked into my room and poured the water on my bed. The ends of her mouth turned down. Some hair on her upper lip. A flat nose. Red eyes. 

I went to see a psychologist at the the school. Probably just a grad student, I realize now. I told her about my drives and how I thought about putting a shotgun in my mouth and pulling the trigger. I didn't really want to kill myself, no, I just wanted to know what it was like. 

I couldn't have said this then but I think now it was that I wanted to know what it was like to feel that much. You know, I don't really feel very much. I'm anhedonic by nature, and made even more so by nurture. I was pretty sure she killed herself because of me. (Sure, sure. I don't know that's true. I don't know what else was going on in her life. In fact, I don't even know if its true. For all I know she dropped out of school and re-enrolled somewhere else and lived happily ever after.) But in my mind she killed her self because she had felt something and then lost it. I had made her feel something and then I took it away from her.

The eyes of the student psychologist went wide when I told her about the shotgun. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about killing myself, but that part never came out right. I think you should see someone with more experience, she said, and gave me a small piece of paper with a name and number. 

I went home, poured the white powder ball bearings out of one of Garry's black and white capsules onto the coffee table, crushed them up with my student ID card and snorted them through a rolled-up dollar bill.  

I didn't go to the other doctor. I didn't see another shrink until about 15 years later. By then was too late. By then I had done the same thing dozens of times: I made someone feel something. I made it seem like I was feeling something too. Something like love. But eventually the truth always came out. I feel nothing. I feel fear and anger and regret, but only for myself, not for anyone else. Especially not love. I didn't even know what that was. I was pretending to feel all those other things because it seem like what you were supposed to do.  

Yesterday I googled Garry for the first time ever. He's a lawyer. One of the sites where he's listed warns ""Extreme Caution! This lawyer has been disciplined by a state licensing authority."" He has a son, Garry IV, who worked as an intern in his father's law office and is in college now. Garry II retired from his practice not long ago.  

I wish I could remember the name of the girl who threw water on my bed. I wish I could find her. Maybe its not true. Maybe she was shaken and even a little fucked up for a while, but made it through and now is living a normal life, and maybe hates me a little, or maybe doesn't even remember any of that, but is alive. 

If you are alive, or if something like this happened to you. I'm sorry. As much as I can feel, I feel sorry. I'm so so sorry.

4kv0d6,3,2016-05-24,I [21 F] minorly embarrassed myself with my friend [20 M] and now I can't stop over-analyzing it,idahonoudahoe,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4kv0d6/i_21_f_minorly_embarrassed_myself_with_my_friend/,"WARNING: this is a very minor problem and I *know* I'm thinking about it too much, so don't judge my craziness. 

So I have a friend named Jeff. Jeff and I are very close, however, our friendship is platonic and that's all it's ever been. We communicate often, though, we text each other almost every day and we have this thing where if we aren't together and we're drinking we always drunk call the other. I don't know how it started but it's funny and we've been doing it for years. 

Anyway, the other day I drunk called Jeff and we had our usual 10 minute or so conversation to catch up (I'm currently living on the opposite coast for a summer internship). Afterwards, he texted me saying he misses hanging out with me. I meant to text him back saying ""miss you too"" and then the emoji with little jazz hands, but I accidentally typed the heart eyes emoji without even realizing it. He never texted me back, and that was almost a week ago. 

I didn't even know I had mistyped until today when I looked back at our messages because it had seemed like a while since we had talked. In my mind, I feel like maybe he thinks I was flirting with him and it scared him off from talking to me. It's been so long since the text I don't know if I should address it now. 

Ideally, I'd like to just gauge his reaction in person, but I'm not going to see him until three more weeks when we and our friends are going on a cross-country road trip, and I'll probably go insane thinking about it until then without at least running the situation by you all.

Like, what if he's just been super busy, I text him to address the typo and he hadn't even thought about it at all. That would make me look like a crazy person. 

So, reddit, what is your opinion on this situation? I've been thinking about it all day and have no clue where to go from here! 


   
**tl;dr**: Accidentally texted friend a flirty emoji. He never responded. Now I can't stop over-analyzing the situation. Help."

For reference, I just finished my sophomore year of college.  I've written out a list of pros and cons and I was hoping you guys could help me make a decision.

Pros:

* I will have enough money saved up for a decent rig
* Since the summer is just beginning I will have a couple months to really enjoy it before I need to get back to the grind of school
* I will be living in a single my junior year and probably my senior year as well so I won't need to worry about possible damages
* I am a computer science major and, while my macbook has easily handled everything I've needed it to so far, having a more powerful computer at my disposal wouldn't be a bad idea

Cons:

* While I will have the money to spend on it, it will still consume a massive chunk of my summer internship stipend
* My academic schedule is pretty rigorous compared to many other schools and on top of that I'm on the football team so I worry that I won't have the time to enjoy it enough to warrant the amount of money I'll be spending on it
* I don't want to become too distracted and fall behind in school

- 3.2 GPA ( but last few semesters have been mostly As with a few Bs, making up for awful first year )
- I have my associates now, but I've only taken two intro engineering courses and nothing that was focused on Computer Hardware Engineering, I got my basics completely out of the way
- I'm transferring from a community college to a university this Fall
- I've worked my entire college career during this, I was part of a pretty small computer club at community college, and I have volunteer work under my belt.

I feel that my GPA and the fact that I haven't taken any real engineering courses really hinder my progress. Should I just wait until my Junior year to apply? Should I just go for the gold and apply anyways or not waste my time? I know companies don't expect much from interns, but I would love to avoid being the person who has no idea what they're talking about since I haven't had ANY actual classes yet. My only concern is that my window will be so small to get an internship between my junior summer and my senior summer, I'm not entirely sure how hard it is to get an internship in the first place.

Me and another guy at the company plugged in my laptop into the PLC, we also needed a router to control it so we connected that as well.    
The entire company had also had trouble with the internet connection for a few days.  
Had someone from the IT-department come into my office today asking if I had plugged in anything ""funny"".  
""Just this router""  
Turns out the router wanted to control a little more than just the PLC, it took control of the entire network, making sure that nobody could access it, making them unable to remote-control customers PLC's, getting access to important project-files on the server etc etc.  "

I grew up extremely poor with no real father and a mother who, although had her moments of genuine care for us, seemed to care more about her next fix than her children. During this time I used video games as a sort of escapism where no matter what was going on in the world if I could play a game I could be the hero in control of my destiny. In this way I was able to protect my mind from the horrors of reality and sink into blissful ignorance (as long as our mother didn't hock the 5 to 10 year old systems for a quick buck).
When I grew into adulthood I got a simple job to support myself and there is where I would have stayed if not for my beautiful future wife. I met her and my life had purpose. She was my universe. Before I met her I would fantasize about going to another world and leaving everything behind, but now, no matter how good the new world would be, I would never leave her side.
Before we even got married she was pushing me to be a better person, encouraging me to get a GED and enroll in college. Once we got married we moved to a little apartment and I started taking college classes.
I did really well at first, but money was tight and we were forced to move around and lean on family since I was only working part time while going to college as she worked her butt off to help support us.
We got pregnant and had the most beautiful baby girl I've ever seen about two months before I graduated with an Associates degree.
Needing to support my family I took on a full time position where i had been working all while looking for a job in my industry. Nothing really happened for two years until i got a response for a paid internship. Desperate to get into the field I took the job as my wife took on two jobs to help pay the bills while I focused on starting my career.
For a whole year I worked for very little pay while my wife slaved away trying to make things work. My escapism kicked in while at home and I became the heroes of digital universes while my real life started to crack at the base.
My employer seemed to be impressed with the work I did for them as I learned completely new concepts very rapidly and finally offered me a position about 2 months ago. A large pay increase came with the job and I felt that perhaps finally we were out of the woods, but just as Orpheus did with Eurydice I too looked back to see my beloved wife pulled from me almost as soon as I learned she was pregnant again.
During our financial troubles while I was trying my best to be criminally negligent of the situation my wife did some stupid things to try and keep us afloat. I found this out as my first two paychecks vanished from the bank account and we went further and further negative. It all culminated on a knock on the door two nights ago with police handcuffing and taking my wife away for check fraud.
I whole heartedly believe that this was entirely my fault as I am the one who put the strain on this family to begin with. With no money and no ability to help my wife I am getting closer to the realization that there is only one way to help.

These are the facts:
I am terrible at my job. I really love it and it's the best job I've ever had, but I suck at it.
The only good thing for my wife about being with me has been the birth of my daughter and future child.
My wife can get a large sum of money to help with legal fees and to set her up to live a good life if I were to die.
Its been sheer luck and force of will, mostly hers, that I've even made it this far in life considering my background.

My conclusion is that to give my wife and my children a good life I must die. Don't get me wrong I absolutely want to see my children grow into being magnificent human beings and I would kill to see my daughter walk down the aisle with someone she loves and live a happy fulfilled life, but I don't see any other alternatives.
I write this now because I just really needed to. I need to express what I'm feeling. This is NOT a guarantee that I'm going to do anything it's just my line of thinking right now.
The biggest thing holding me back is that I don't want my children to grow up without a father even though they would have a very loving family to support them."
4kvbk6,2,2016-05-24,Please help me evaluate my potential to be hired as well as give me advice on how to proceed towards my goal,Convexus,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4kvbk6/please_help_me_evaluate_my_potential_to_be_hired/,"Hello there, so I'll start by showing you guys the positions I am aiming for:

[Security analyst](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/careers/posting.html?id=160002L)

[Linux service engineer](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/careers/posting.html?id=15000LU)

[Windows service engineer](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/careers/posting.html?id=16000DW)

I love games, so I really want to work for Blizzard. I’m also interested in relocating to California, so that’s a second plus!

Anyway, I changed a lot throughout college, but the one thing that remained consistent was my interest in computers. I will graduate in August with a bachelor's degree in multidisciplinary studies which consists of physics, philosophy and technological systems management. This major is only sort of related to the positions I am aiming for, however I think that my critical thinking and problem solving skills would be useful to this company. As for the management portion of my major, I have plenty of experience in leading projects and groups. Specifically, I was president of my school’s Physics Club for two years and I am currently an officer/moderator in an online research project related to brain-computer interfaces. In my resume, I mention how I revitalized and grew the club into the successful organization that it is today.

Since 2011, I have participated in three computer repair internships. In total, I have a little over a year’s worth of professional experience. I have been repairing computers in my own free time for about five years now and I think I am very good at it. I’ve had no unhappy customers in all these years!

I recently earned my A+ certification and I would like to earn a few more related to the positions I am applying for. I told one of my internship employers that I earned my A+ (since they said they could possibly hire me when I earned it) and they told me to give them a call in August when I graduate. This place is one of the best on Long Island because they are extremely knowledgeable and do honest work. They fix mostly Windows and Mac computers, provide web-design services and install networks for customers. I’d really like to get involved in learning about networking.

This summer, I hope to become fluent in Python by learning the language and using it to program a few hundred applications. I will also be learning about vector graphics and web design this summer at my school’s tech lab. Finally, I want to enhance my Chinese language skill.

Python is a recommended talent in the job description and I know how I would go about learning that, but I am confused about how to learn other things that they ask for.

I don’t know how to work with Microsoft IIS, Puppet, Chef, or Octopus. I don’t have an in-depth understanding of “Active Directory in a multi-site domain”, nor do I feel confident in my enterprise networking skills. I also do not have experience with AWS. I feel like for everything else, I would be a great choice for the job and the work environment at Blizzard. However, the BS in computer science recommended talent is a bit daunting, but at least I have experience and a slightly related degree! Plus, if I’m really good with Python and some other languages, then I don’t really see how I wouldn’t be valuable to the company.

So, in conclusion, how would I go about gaining practical and theoretical knowledge of the aforementioned subjects and in what timeframe would it be reasonable to learn them in? A year? Two years? 

Please let me know what else I should be focusing on to achieve my goal! Thanks!

I had to take some time off for military training which meant dropping spring semester, and education classes aren't really available summer since I need to intern, so I was out of school February until this August. 

In the mean time I got an awesome job in an early learning center.  They do such good things and I feel like if I get a good reference here it would help when I'm looking for k-12 work. They pay 9.50 to start,  11.00 after I finish some training. 

My husband has been saying I should finish college in August, which means graduating in May and hopefully making more money.  

I worry that's too soon, that getting at least a year here will be better experience before jumping into k-12.

Any advice?"

Microsoft being an extremely well known company in the bis, I feel like it's odd that right now they are so dependent of the insiders users and their feedback about the development releases.     
(talking about PC's now) - I don't remember this happened in the past. They always managed to improve their OS's flaws despite the critics and judgment from the public.  

With Windows phone 10, they kinda lost their self-esteem, and that translates to the general public as a company that would be lost without their faithful users.  

As far as I remember they have tons of money, so what is happening? Was WP10 assigned to a team of interns currently programming like try and error, until they are satisfied?

I have two questions about the feasibility of that plan.

1) I see a lot of internship postings say, ""Must be currently enrolled in a full time degree program"" or something similar, what does this mean? If I take a year off, I'm technically still ""enrolled"", even if I'm not taking any classes, but how do they quantify ""full time""?

2) Related to the above, if I wanted to intern in the US for the summer, the requirements for a J1 state that I must be, ""Currently enrolled full-time and actively pursuing studies at a ministerially-recognized degree"". Does that mean I would be ineligible if I were interning in the Spring? Would I be eligible if I studied during the Spring, even though I wouldn't have a full time course load during the entire academic year (Fall/Spring), but still technically enrolled?

350 hours of non medical volunteering.

Do I have a chance at all to get into MD or DO at this point?

**INTRODUCTION**

My name is Andrew, 28 year old professional from New York. I am 6'5, 220 pounds, blonde hair, blue eyes, with a strong build and broad, muscular shoulders. My hard outer appearance is contrasted sharply and juxtaposed by my sweet tender inside and penchant for kindness.

I share a deep affinity for story-telling and writing in general and my past prompts and posts have usually tried to demand a higher level of grammar, imagination, detail and literacy in the responses as I feel that's the best way to keep a story alive and fresh and prevent it from becoming stale or having either side decide they may as well just watch some porn.

I've been posting on DPP for a long time and today I am in the mood for something a bit more vanilla as I hope to engage a more diverse population of those individuals who frequent this lovely sub-reddit. I've been seeing some especially great prompts recently and want to make sure I'm not alienating anyone by requesting the same prompts/kinks.

**PROMPTS**

I've narrowed down my prompt ideas into separate categories, each with their own plot lines and twists and can incorporate other ideas as well and are all up for discussion!

**(1)NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR**

I've just moved in to town from the high powered life of New York City as an attorney working in Manhattan. I've grown tired of the constant hustle and am looking for a more small-town feel. I've gotten a job at the local law firm, a boutique operation specializing in real estate closings and is more in line with the slower pace I hope to find. You have been living in the small town of Paradise Springs your whole life and are intrigued at the new neighbor that you have. We spark a conversation and begin a slow and gentle courtship.

**(2)THE CO-WORKERS**

Similar premise to the above prompt, only we have been holding on to a work friendship for nearly three years now. Always amiable to one another, we never really felt any kind of emotional spark together, just a simple friendship between two people who understand each other. Perhaps one of us goes through a particularly harrowing time (i.e. a breakup, death in the family, etc.) and relies significantly on the other for support, where a new tenderness seems to blossom.

**(3)THE ANNIVERSARY**

This one would center around a pre-existing romantic relationship and be premised upon a one year anniversary, perhaps even six months or something of the like to mark a very special time in a budding new love affair.
Long-time lurker here and have finally decided to put my ""hat in the ring"" so to speak and try my hand at roleplaying and seeing if I can get any quality responses and to return the favor!



**(4)OFFICE AFFAIR**

The office affair with some kind of added twist. You could be my boss, peer, secretary or intern but we are both married and over time the sexy innuedos and flirting get taken further and further as we both realize we don't get what we want at home. But there's more to you than meets the eye. You decide what it is! 

**(5)THE ELEVATOR**

The woman in the elevator. Weeks have gone by and at least twice a week I ride the elevator up with you. It's the best 60 seconds of my day. My god you're gorgeous and you always give a crooked smile when I get on. And that little hair flip as you tell me to ""Have a nice day!"" when I get off the elevator knowing I've been checking you out. But one day the elevator is overly crowded and we are pushed against each other and I just can't stop myself from getting hard and you feel it against your ass...

**(6)INCEST**

Mom/sister drama queen. You're always the damsel in distress and every time you come to me over something petty and annoying but I know you rely on me quite heavily and I'm always there for you. But this time it's serious. You're going to have to hide out with me in my apartment for who knows how long. And that sexual tension that's been there since I was 12... surfaces and I have to try and deal with you getting a little too close when my mind is else where. 

I've written much longer prompts before that are more specific and if you wanted to check those out by all means please do. I really want to find a long term roleplay partner but I understand we have to be able to connect for that to happen. 

**KINKS**

My favorite kinks are: 

* Vanilla/Romance
* Anal
* Facials
* Blowjobs
* Cuddling
* Kissing

PM me and let me know what you'd like to try and if there is anything you would like to change or add to any of the prompts. I really enjoy having my partner have equal say in the set up and role of characters! 

I can't wait to talk to you soon"

Found out I cant continue doing Accounting at my main school but I can go to an offsite campus thats about 30 minutes away, smaller than my community college, really bad gym, way less social, I'd have to pay the same tuition rate, and not really any choice for professors who all seem bad at teaching from their reviews but I'd get the same degree as people from my main campus, I could graduate by Spring 2018 easily, and I can go use the resources at my main campus.

My other option is transfer to another university, at least 45 minutes away, tuition is about +- $1000 less, already paid the nonrefundable enrollment fee, great social life, they have a way better gym, but I'd graduate by Fall 2018 if I cant handle 5 classes a semester since I would need 20 more classes here, 17 left at the other option, and they don't have as good of a reputation which everyone keeps reminding me of. Its not a bad school, just not as good as where I currently am.

I have not had any internships so I was prepared to find one for next summer, or even winter, so I could have at least one before I graduate. I'm a single guy so the social aspect is pretty important to me but I'm not sure if I'm being stupid by thinking about that instead of the degree. I hated community college because of how small it was and I'm basically paying for the reputation my degree would get me, not much else in terms of the college experience.

Anyone mind giving me any advice?"
4kw1b3,1,2016-05-24,Technical Sales Engineer internship?,Britito,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4kw1b3/technical_sales_engineer_internship/,"Hi all.

I'm a CS student in the UK, having just finished an industry year at a software company in the CAD/CAM business. Since the placement finished just as summer is beginning, I've been applying to various summer internships. I ended up accepting a ""Technical Sales Engineer Intern"" position at Cisco. It pays well (for the UK) and comes with awesome and paid accommodation in London.

They told us the sort of thing we'll be doing during the interview days, basically providing a technical perspective to the pure sales teams and talking to the customer companies' engineers to work out the technical side of things. While the ad described some scripting and such as part of the job, it is nonetheless mostly people-based.

Since I've already got a years worth of experience at a software company under my belt, I figured this would massively help the soft-skills side of my CV, since CS students have a reputation for lacking in this area, and Cisco being as well-known as it is can't help.

So, cscareeradvice, how do you think I can capitalise on this? Was it a good idea to take in the first place? Anyone else worked in a similar position? Hell, anyone else worked in Cisco's UK offices?"

How should I answer this question if I haven't done a full project with either of these, but I have used them before? I have learned Python by myself using Raspberry Pi, wrote a script or two when I was trying to make it as a home server. I have also worked with Django framework in a previous work term, but not on a full project (it was adding features, maintaining, fixing bugs, adding tests etc. to the company's web app), and a group project in a class for a real client. And few small things using JavaScript here and there. 

I'm currently learning AngularJS on my own as a side project to build a website for myself which will show off any projects I work on and skills, and also will be a blog style website for anything else I'm interested in like, backpacking, photography, any other DIY maybe. But this is not going to be completed until later, so is it worth it to mention this? Even though, they are asking for a project that I have done (completed and impressive)? I don't want to leave it empty, but at the same time I'm not sure if answering it by mentioning my previous work experience is a good answer too. 

Any recommendations on this?

4kwlzj,4,2016-05-24,"Mathematics - Computer Science, an analysis of the major",kenny544,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/4kwlzj/mathematics_computer_science_an_analysis_of_the/,"I've researched a lot about this major, which is the major I applied to and got accepted in, but there seems to be a lot of uncertainties about it.

I'm going to make an analysis of all the research I've done and then decide if I'm going to take this major at UCSD, or take Computer Science degree on other universities that offered it to me.

The problem with all the threads about this major is usually ridden with people with contradicting opinions, and are not helpful for students looking into this major.

So first of all by looking at both links to compare the requirements of each major
http://www.cse.ucsd.edu/node/239

https://math.ucsd.edu/programs/undergraduate/bs_math_comp_science.php

Clearly, the junior year of both courses is where the differences start to get more noticeable

CS students have GE requirements and General Sciences requirements, while Math - CS students have upper division math requirements

If you're O.K or comfortable with math then there's nothing wrong with Math - CS, for some it might be even better (I personally would prefer Math over, say, General Sciences or GE classes)

On the other hand, CS students have a CS Elective each quarter which gives them a big leverage, makes them better prepared for when leaving the university, plus they have priority in the CS classes...which is in itself a pretty big deal  

So if you're a Math - CS student and you want to focus more on the CS part, starting by your third year you can have (theoretically speaking) all of the math requirements done by the end of your junior year

Math109,170A,103AB,184A can all be done in the same year
Taking math out of the way that leaves about most of the senior year up for CSE classes, and taking many CSE electives as possible

CSE20, CSE30,CSE100,CSE105 can also be completed in your junior year

If being a 5th year senior is an option, then it may be very useful to take more CSE electives and more CSE classes to make you more prepared for the jobs you may face outside the university, but do notice that at this point you're already way beyond what your major is offering and right now you're going on your way to close whatever gap that you might have that your major did not fill. This is all assuming you can actually get in the classes and not be stuck in the waiting list.


Conclusion: Math-CS, by itself, does not fully prepare you for a career in computer science, and does not fully prepare you for a career in mathematics. It seems to be a major aimed at students who want to do Masters in computer science or phD in the area.
While it is definitely possible to head for a career or internship in IT with a Math-CS degree, how ready you will be for this career will rely on your work outside the major, the additional classes that you take that are not requirements for the major, and your work/side projects will prove essential.

But on the other hand, the biggest advantage of this major is how flexible it is with which classes you can take. So it's very much possible to work outside of the major and use this to your advantage. Overall the biggest hindrances would be 1 - Time to graduate, 2 - Priority in non-required CSE classes and 3 - How comfortable you are with math.

Whether employers will care about your degree is Math-CS or just CS will then be irrelevant given that you, not by the merits of your degree, have closed any gap between Math-CS and CS while still retaining a mathematical perspective of the major which may prove useful for problem-solving skills and algorithm implementation.

Any insight over this analysis would be really useful not just for me, but for other students who may come across this thread.

I am leaning over declining UCSD for other offers since I personally do not plan any post-grad work at the moment, but more information is always welcome."

She quit the internship early because of this. During her internship, I was getting a feeling that she may be feeling depressed, but since I didn't know for sure I didn't say anything. Today she told me that this has been the worst experience of her life and it has made her depressed and contemplate suicide (the same as another difficult time in her life, which I knew was difficult (related to schedule, academics and job balancing)), but I didn't know she had contemplated suicide before.

Now every time she says something, I'm worried about how to respond and if I'm saying the right thing (and I'm worried if I say something wrong, it could make it worse). I don't wanna say anything like ""look on the bright side"" or ""it'll get better"" because I don't think saying those things will help. I'm trying to not make our conversations too heavy/serious because I don't want her to stay in her depressed mood, but I'm realizing that that's not working.

We've never had the type of relationship where she confides in me about her personal life/issues because she never has wanted to share details about her life with me. I usually share most of the details about my life with her (but of course not everything). In the past, she has never really listened to me or any of my family members. If she thinks she's right, she won't change her mind. So I just don't know what to do/say because I feel like I know how she'll react. But I have been reacting seriously when she says things that are harmful towards her health (even if I don't think she'll listen to me, whether from just the nature of who she is, or her depression).

I don't think my parents know the extent of how bad it is (especially not the contemplating suicide part). I know for certain they don't know that she has contemplated suicide in the past (I only found out about that today). I feel like she wouldn't be telling me all these personal details if she didn't want help, but I don't know how to respond. I'm thinking she should try to get help, but I don't know how she'll respond to that. But I guess asking her won't hurt. I'll ask her what she thinks about getting help and if she wants help, I can drive her to wherever she needs so she doesn't have to ask my parents (she can't drive alone yet).

If you guys have any advice, or have been through this before, please let me know. Thanks! 
   
tl;dr: Sister told me she's depressed and has contemplated suicide. Parents don't know full extent of how serious this is, and I'm not sure exactly what to do/say. "

I have a Bachelor's in an unrelated field (music) but I've managed to get accepted into three schools that I applied to. Two are Graduate CS programs, but one is a school that offers second Bachelor's degrees. I'm not sure which to take.

My goal is to be the most hire-able, especially by big companies like Google and Microsoft. I don't care what field I go into, I'm just chasing the highest salary at this point in my life (down the road, AI would be fun). I've already got a lot of college loans to pay off and I'm about to accrue even more!

My instinct says go for the second Bachelor's because it will give me a more solid foundation, whereas jumping into a Master's program assumes I know a lot already. The graduate programs are both making me take 5-6 undergraduate courses in CS though to 'catch up', so maybe I should just go for it? 

A big factor in my decision is what will open up the most doors, so I'm curious whether there are more internships available for undergrads or grads... Anyone know? Job experience just seems so important these days.

Lastly, I'm assuming Master's degree holders will earn more straight out of school. But maybe they want to hire Bachelor's degree holders instead because they can pay them less? I don't want to be stuck with a Master's and zero job experience...

I wrote a letter saying that if I get the internship my last day would be June 5 and if I don't, I would be happy to continue working there. Is this something that I should give him, or bad idea? I plan on talking to him about it on Thursday, since he's off tomorrow. 

Any advice would be appreciated."

Right now I'm looking more towards area 2/4 courses, due to their mix of interesting applications and math/physics theory. In second year I've enjoyed most the courses ECE290 and ECE216. Perhaps the amount of math and/or the complexity of the math involved isn't a good determinant as to what courses to choose, but I'd just like to know from upper year students:

Of all the courses you've taken, which ones feature the most abstract/interesting math or physics concepts? Do the respective courses cover their applications, and were they enjoyable to you personally?

I was just wondering if I could get some insight from other individuals who may have been in similar situations.


Long story short: I am totally overwhelmed and not really enjoying what I am doing. I enjoyed my programming assignments in my Intro CS and DataStructs+Algs class, but so far all the programming I've done for my internship is reading through seemingly obfuscated javascript with no comments and bug fixing.

Handling such a large code base (hundreds of .js files and &gt; 100k lines) and dealing with Git on a project like this is fairly annoying. 


Is this what all CS work is like? I thought I wanted to be a software dev, but this isn't exactly that enthralling..."
4kxqne,2,2016-05-24,[Event] Prime Minister weighs his options on Transnistria crisis,HanbaobaoZaiNar,Geosim,https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/4kxqne/event_prime_minister_weighs_his_options_on/,"Cabinet ministers wandered into the hallway in pairs of two or three at a time, discussing in hushed whispers the situation and what they had brought. President Şlefuitoare stood by the office door, counting them as they arrived and gathered.
&gt; Everyone here? Good, let's get this started.

He knocked once at the door.

&gt; Go ahead

Coming through the door, they saw the Prime Minster standing at the window, arms clasped behind his back, staring eastward across the city. He looked much older than the young protester that years before had stood on the steps of this very building, leading the crowd in calls for reform and openness. Much had changed since he had taken office.
&gt;""Are you ready sir?""

&gt;""Yes, go ahead""

He answered with a sigh and strode over to the table where the rest had gathered. Taking his seat, the rest followed suit.

&gt;""Ok, give it to me straight. I need ideas and I need action now. We cannot afford to wait any longer on Transnistria. They've made it abundantly clear that diplomacy alone is not going to start this crisis. It is time to apply pressure where its needed to convince them to not drive this conflict into a full, open war. What are the options and what stands in the way? Natalia?""

The Minister of Foreign Affairs shuffled her collection of papers neatly. She began with the occasional added comment by the Minister of Defense.

&gt; ""Step 1: We close the border with Transnistria or at least restrict access. Anatol and Oleg can cover the internal border and the bridges across the Dneister, but we need to immediately reach out to Ukraine. I know they're overwhelmed and busy with their the war, but we will need to coordinate with them to stop this crisis in both our countries.""

&gt;""What do you suggest?""

&gt; ""An agreement between our two countries. Coordination of any efforts against these separatists in Transnistria and Odessa. Closure and increased security at border checkpoints into and out of Transnistria, freedom of movement by armed forces across the shared border to facilitate any counter-separatist movements We'll need increased border patrols and increased manpower at all checkpoints. We need to work to restrict the flow of any illegal goods, military supplies, or armed separatists across the border into or out of Transnistria. I know the Ukrainian army is elsewhere occupied keeping the Russians from marching across their country and the bulk of the share would fall to us.""

&gt;""We also will need to commit manpower to increased security and closure of the Moldovan-Transnistrian border. All goods, resources, or individuals entering into or exiting from the region would be subject to inspection and refusal of passage may be determined by border security just as at the Ukrainian border. ""

&gt;""What's our situation on the army?""

&gt;""6000 active. We can ready and equip an additional 25000 from the active reserves within a month. More forces would require time, money, and equipment. If we could get support from the EU nations it would greatly help the process.

&gt;""And do we know how many armed separatists are across the River?""

&gt;""Not exactly yet. We know about 13500 separatists are spread across Transnistria and Odessa, and prevent the flow of men and arms between the two regions should be a priority. We also know that the Transnistrian government has apparently pledge support for the separatists, of which their own armed forces number similar to our own active forces. And I need to mention the Soviet 14th is still in position in Transnistria, though I'm sure the Russians will claim neutrality however unlikely that actually is. That's still about 1000 men and the Soviet arms depot added to the mix. 

&gt; ""Damn the Russians, you know they have their fingers in this conflict.""

&gt;""I know but we need to proof before making any formal statement. With the border closed, the trickle of illegal arms will continue to close. And we know they aren't being air supplied since Tiraspol has no airport and we've been screening any supplies landing at Chișinău. If their arms supplies continue to grow we know they're either being supplied directly by the Russians from the Soviet armory or by a more coordinated effort by Russian operatives across the border. Either way we've then got them red-handed""

&gt;""Good, and do we have any idea the support we have from the EU nations?""

&gt;""[Poland](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/4izj4g/conflict_prorussian_separatist_uprising_in_odessa/d33e3ug) has already offered equipment support though their armed forces are committed in Ukraine and Kaliningrad. A number of other nations have started to deploy forces for blockades or to combat other conflicts around the world, but I suggest we reach out to all of the member states for any financial, equipment, logistic, or manpower support they can offer. Money and military equipment is obvious, but they also have experience with special forces, engineer, or intelligence logistic support that we lack. In the last war we also had a limited number of Romanian volunteers assist Moldovan forces and there's a chance that the European states will recognize Russian involvement or even that a crisis at their doorstep could effect all of the continent and assist with troops on the ground again. In particular, we need to try and work closely with Romanian, Polish, German, French, and Italian support. We stand the best chance of quick response and transportation of equipment or support. Sweden is another option as long as the legislation on quitting the CIS gets through Parliament. Where are we on that, I've been out of the loop for a few days""

&gt;""Just passed the vote this morning, I have the paperwork here. Just need the Prime Minister's signature""

&gt;""Ok, so we have border tightening, cooperation with Ukraine, increased troop recruitment, asking EU members for support, and an official exit from the CIS. Anything else that needs my immediate action?

From the back of the room a voice piped up. All eyes turned to the skinny, young man at the back whose voice cracked as he spoke,

&gt;""Well, you could also unfollow the Transnistrian government on Twitter...""

&gt;""What?""

&gt;""On Twitter, the previous Prime Minister followed the Transnistrian government and the account rolled over to you when you took over.""

&gt;""Right, and you are?""

&gt;""The intern.""

&gt;""So nothing else then?""

&gt;""...no""

&gt;""Right, ok. Natalia, take care of reaching out to the Ukrainian government. Let me know when you're ready for me to speak with the Ukrainians. When you're done do the same for the Europeans. Anatol and Oleg, make the necessary arrangements with the army and begin deployment to garrisons near the conflict zone when complete. Do not engage with Transnistria yet. We are not going to start a war without one more chance for peace. And I'll sign the legislation now on our immediate departure from the CIS.""

The intern coughed lightly

&gt;""And fine, intern...""

&gt;""Anatolie""

&gt;""Anatolie, you're now in charge of the Moldovan government twitter account. Go ahead and unfollow the Transnistrians.""

tl;dr Transnistrian border with Moldova and Ukraine tightened and restricted, troops being raised though not going into conflict yet, cooperation offer with Ukraine on counter-efforts, reaching out to EU for all kinds of support, bill signed officially leaving CIS, mad shade thrown around on twitter."
4kxsth,2,2016-05-24,"I'm [24 M] with my ex [24 F] of about 2 years, still trying to sort through the fallout",heyheythrowaway9,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4kxsth/im_24_m_with_my_ex_24_f_of_about_2_years_still/,"Hey Reddit, obvious throwaway account here. I'm told I tend to leave out a lot of details when I tell this story so I apologize in advance. Please let me know if I should elaborate on anything and I'll edit/comment it in later. This is also pretty lengthy; I tried to keep it organized but this is all still very jumbled in my head. Unfortunately, that means the tl;dr isn't so useful.

We met while we were in college (or university, depending on your vernacular). We had common interests and also had quite a few classes together since we were studying the same major. We got along really well but didn't really spend much time together outside of studying or working on homework until our 3rd year at school. We grew closer during that year and decided to make it official around winter break.

Since we were both busy with classes, I wasn't too concerned when we weren't spending much time together. We saw each other about every other day but most of that was just in class. Friday evenings were usually spent at her place (with her roommates as well) and we would go out to eat roughly every weekend.

Not too long after we started dating, we had a week off from school, during which she went home. I heard very little from her that week. Around that time, a mutual friend found out about our relationship and asked me how communicative she was during the long distance break. Apparently this was a serious issue in her last relationship with someone from back home: she didn't talk to him for about 2 weeks and he was furious with her after they got back in touch. At this point, we both shared a pretty large friend group and I heard the same from a few of them. She had this habit of ""disappearing"" during breaks away from school (although the problem in her past relationship was the opposite: she was at school during the breakup). Most of them wrote it off as just the way she was. Again, I wasn't too concerned with any of this at the time.

Fast forward to summer break of that year: we had both accepted 3 month internships at opposite ends of the US. Having experienced the lack of contact during previous breaks from school, I asked her to do her best to keep in touch and we scheduled every Friday night to chat online or otherwise spend time together.

She failed to respond the first week as apparently she was asleep. Since we were both starting new jobs and were adjusting from awful college sleep schedules, I let it go. We chatted briefly the following week and to my memory, we never spent another Friday together for the remainder of that summer. I managed to get a few responses from her about a group project that we (and another friend) were going to work on the following year back at school but the vast majority of my contact attempts simply went ignored. To get an idea of how sporadic our communication was, I can easily count on 1 hand the number of conversations we had during those 3 months. When I would ask her about her lack of response, she would just say ""Sorry, I'm a terrible person,"" or something similar. This should've been a huge red flag at the time but I tried not to pressure her as the issue was clearly a trigger of bad memories from her last breakup.

When the summer ended, we carried on with the relationship more or less where we left off 3 months prior. As that was our last year before graduation, we had a discussion about the future of the relationship and decided that we would try to maintain a LDR since we both still felt very strongly about each other. I stressed as kindly as I could that communication would be doubly important once we went long distance and asked her to be more available, particularly because my last relationship ended poorly after we went long distance. She said that she sometimes got really depressed at home so, again, I didn't push the topic as it was clearly a sore spot for her.

Fast forward another few months to winter break. We had about a month off from school between semesters and planned ahead of time for her to visit me at home a week before our last semester started up. During that month, I think I got maybe 2 texts from her. I was also to pick her up from the airport and only found out about her arrival time less than 24 hours beforehand, despite trying to contact her multiple times more than a week in advance.

I was really upset that week, partially due to some conflict with my parents around that time. In hindsight, I was probably exhausted from the relationship. I felt that the relationship was really one-sided and that I was the only one keeping the ship from sinking.

On the trip back to school, I told her that I didn't feel that she was putting in as much effort as I was. I asked how I should be maintaining contact with her as what I was doing clearly wasn't working. She promptly broke down and cried and I spent the rest of the trip and evening apologizing and trying to reassure her.

I suppose this next part is where the details start to get fuzzy. We spent the rest of the semester in an endless cycle: I would try to talk to her about my feelings, she would get very upset, I would spend an hour or more apologizing, then we would reaffirm that we still loved each other. She would then withdraw even harder from me, eventually restarting the cycle.

As this went on, she grew colder and colder around me. I still spent a lot of Friday nights at her apartment and it often felt like she was intentionally avoiding eye contact with me, let alone engagement of any kind. Her responses to my concern also grew more hostile: she would tell me that I'm never satisfied or that I'm delirious. She also accused me of being insensitive, claiming that I knew she was depressed. That one in particular really caught me off-guard as she only mentioned the depression once (specifically about when she was at home) and I immediately felt really guilty. I think the worst part about this was that she behaved seemingly normally around our friends. ""This is why you love her,"" I would tell myself. ""If she's behaving this way around you, then the problem must be you.""

Graduation came and went and she started a full-time job at the place she interned the previous summer. I started another 3 month internship, intending on returning to school for another year or two to finish up a MS degree. That summer was even worse in terms of communication. Nearly all of my attempts to contact her went ignored (she would later admit to avoiding me during this period) and for the few that weren't, she responded with 1 or 2 word replies. I got really concerned and contacted mutual friends to make sure she was okay and she seemed to be staying in touch with a few of them just fine. It almost felt as if she had cheated on me emotionally.

Finally, we scheduled to have a chat on the phone 4 days after my birthday (which she also ignored) during which she ended the relationship, to say the least. I was in graduate school at the time and between the breakup and school stress, I was not doing well. I frequently had panic attacks and would randomly start crying at the mere mention of her. I also had a lot of trouble sleeping, leading to even more stress as the work piled up. As I mentioned, we shared a lot of common interests and after the breakup, the things that I used to  enjoy doing turned into triggers. That was about 1.5 years ago and I barely managed to squeak out a passing grade.

If nothing else, I suppose I can be really stubborn. My mentality was that I just had to finish this degree and then I could take a break. Then around last November or December I just completely shut down. I'm going to intentionally leave out some details here and say that I seriously contemplated suicide a few times. I dropped everything (classes, work, research, etc.) to recover and found professional help to do so.

After all this, we still share the same group of core friends. Even after breaking up, it feels like she is stealing those friends away from me. I don't feel comfortable talking to a few of them anymore due to their relations with her and I've effectively forced them into situations where they can only invite one of us for any group gathering.

I'm still working on my mental health but it's been a real uphill battle. Last I checked, she's moved on and is doing fine for herself.

How should have I handled things differently? Did I not communicate effectively? 
She often gave me the silent treatment when I wanted to talk; should I have just kept my frustrations bottled up? Things never got violent between us but perhaps I was being emotionally abusive by constantly pestering her about things I knew she didn't want to deal with?
Maybe I really was delirious and was just seeing the negatives due to my own depression. When we broke up, she said she was tired of arguing all the time but I never saw them as arguments. Was I being too needy or unreasonable with what I wanted?
I've been told by multiple people that she's just a really passive person. Maybe I needed to be more patient?

Again, I know I left out some details but I'd appreciate any thoughts or opinions. Of course, this is just from my perspective but that can't be helped. If there are some things that I really should elaborate on, let me know and I'll get back to it later.

tl;dr: Felt neglected in a ~2 year (sometimes long distance) relationship. Broke up ~1.5 years ago and still very confused about how I should've handled it."
4kxtjk,1,2016-05-24,entity of Africa,lakili,Paranormal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/4kxtjk/entity_of_africa/,"I often have strange things happen to me. 

    

This time it was on my recent trip to Tanzania for a midwifery internship. One weekend I was there I went on safari in Ruaha National park. On the safari itself, it was only the guide and I. However, afterwards I was staying at the hilltop lodge in a small hut-like room. It was a peaceful lodge overlooking the Ruaha valley. 

    
one particular night I was there, I fell asleep as usual, but was awakened to the sound of ""clicking"" from heels on a hardwood floor. They were coming towards me. As soon as I opened my eyes I heard a woman say ""How can you sleep here...?"" I turned to look to my right; that's where it came from. I couldn't see much, but I did see a black shadow right next to me on the edge of the bed. The shadow then fell into my stomach/hip area. At least that's what I felt. I felt the shadow go through me and felt the bed compress next to me. 

    

Keep in mind I was alone.I checked the time; of course it's 3:00 am. I was in Africa by myself, there wasn't anyone to talk to about what had just happened. So I thought (stupidly) that I would reach down where there was an indentation in the bed. I don't really know what I was trying to accomplish, but maybe something was there. Nothing.

    

I was pretty scared. I wanted to turn on the lamp I had next to the bed. That didn't happen. All these events happened fairly quickly within 5 minutes. After I felt around, the strangest thing happened and all of the sudden my head was back and my eyes had shut. I knew I was falling asleep. I also know I wasn't purposely trying to go back to sleep.

   

 My body began to go numb in a systematic kind of way. First my head, then my chest, and so on.. I tried to scream because I thought maybe the lodge owners would hear me and be able to help me. I was in sheer panic. I managed to ""whisper"" scream. I hope that makes sense. It is all I could get out. 

    

I screamed three times and realized it wasn't going to work. I gave up and was propelled into a dream, Nightmare rather. The black shadow had possessed me and was in my mind speaking to me. She told me I could do things with my mind when she was there. I found I could open doors and start fires just by thinking about it. It was cool, but really terrifying. 

   

 I had to find a way to get her out. She wanted me to do terrible things and she wanted to consume my soul. I spent a majority of the time trying to figure out what I could do to make this demonic being leave. I Knew I could have an exorcism but I couldn't fine a priest to do it. I pleaded with her, begging for my soul. screaming that my life was of value and there are things I am meant to accomplish. I would be incapable of said things with this demon possessing me, but it wasn't working. She didn't care. My body was her vessel now. 

   

 The end half was an endless search in a santitarium-type hospital; looking for a different vessel. I thought that maybe if I found someone that was brain dead in nature it would be the best *if you could call it that*, idea. I don't know how the dream ended because my alarm went off. It was so realistic and I believe paranormal. It was so real I had to make sure I couldn't still do things with my mind once I woke up. I will never forget this experience. 

I would love to hear if anyone has had a similar experience. "
4ky1qf,0,2016-05-25,To Re-apply or Stay the Course,loomnuggets,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/4ky1qf/to_reapply_or_stay_the_course/,"Hey all--
I'm hoping to get some feedback on a ""problem"" that I've created for myself as I approach matriculation in the coming months.
I applied to medical school in in the fall of 2014, and was accepted to a solid medical school in the Midwest, in the same state where I attended college. As I was submitting my applications, I had just finished an internship at a major pharmaceutical company where I worked on part of their Neglected Diseases initiative, and became interested in and passionate about drug discovery in this context--to the point where I considered pursuing basic research rather than medicine. Around the same time that secondary applications were beginning to be due, I was offered a position at a non profit pharma company in Seattle, and accepted the position. Not knowing where this would head, and feeling unsure about my future, I decided to finish applications at only two schools--my midwestern university, and a long-shot dream school. Several months after arriving in the PNW, I received my acceptance letter, and requested a deferral, which was granted.
After over a year in a lab environment, I can say with relative assuredness that basic lab research is NOT what I want to spend the rest of my life doing. While I find the work fascinating and important, I really do desire the human interactions that will come with being a clinician, although this position has definitely steered my interests towards global health.
The problem is, however, that I never anticipated how much I would fall in love with the Pacific Northwest. In the time been here, I've summited Rainier and Baker, learned alpine climbing and bagged peaks throughout the Cascades, learned to ski, learned to sail, and have generally taken advantage of everything this fantastic region has to offer. I'm in the best shape of my life, and spend as much time as I can getting outside. But love for this region goes deeper, still. In Seattle, there isn't talk about transgender bathroom laws, the legality of same sex marriage, or enforcing drug laws. We talk about polyamory, harm and stigma reduction for sex workers, the benefits of needle exchanges and safe places for drug use, and whether state laws are adequately protecting us from pesticides in our weed. We ride naked through the streets on the Solstice, celebrate the bizarre and unique in everyone, and have elected a socialist to City Council.
I've never been more excited to live somewhere, felt more free and supported to be exactly who am, or felt more at home.
And the thought of returning to the Midwest is making me absolutely nauseous.
So the question is this. Should I attempt to forget the happiness I've found here and return to the Midwest for the next four years, hoping to someday get back to this place, or, should I reject my acceptance, and apply to the University of Washington (and some other schools here on the West Coast).
As a resident of Washington, I'll face 1 in 5 odds at being accepted, and if accepted, I'll be able to do exactly what I want, exactly where I want to. But I stand an 80% chance of holding shit all nothing.
Am I insane for wanting to give this a go? I've heard the ""it doesn't matter where you go to medical school"" lines, the ""you can go back when you're finished"" lines, but they don't resonate, even though I know that they are objectively true. All I know is that I found a place where I think I belong, and am so, so, so reluctant to leave.
A few things about my potential candidacy:
MCAT, a solidly average 31 (12 Bio, 11 Verbal Reasoning, a very disappointing 8 Physics) 3.79 GPA, with double major in Biochemistry and Religion/Philosophy 
Spent about a month volunteering/shadowing at a free urgent care facility near my college, which gave me a lot of exposure to a variety of physicians/expertise/clinical styles 
Interned with a major pharma company's Neglected Disease Initiative, should get a paper out of this, but it remains mired in the legal department 
Worked just about 1.5 years at IDRI in Seattle, in the TB Drug Discovery group, promoted to Senior RA position within a year, should be getting some papers shortly. Definite interest in global health--this would be my application narrative, for sure.

Any/all thoughts appreciated."

&gt;$MyCoworker: Don't plug that in. Did your department have a meeting recently about how flash drives are a security risk?

&gt;$User: Yes but this is mine. There aren't any malwares on it.

&gt;$MyCoworker: We still have to consider it a security risk. Can you not send the file as an attachment in an email?

&gt;$User: No! I told you that I need to move them onto my other computer not email them. Ugh. Why won't you just help me?

4kzzcd,1,2016-05-25,Am I correct to feel this way?,marmarjo,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4kzzcd/am_i_correct_to_feel_this_way/,"So I'll preface this with a bit of my background. I am currently a Graduate Assistant at a Private University. I work closely with the IT department at the University providing IT support and I've been doing this for approximately a year and 4 months. I was also an intern for them during my Undergrad for about a year The only benefit I get from this job is that I provide my services and in return, they allow me to get my master's degree(currently in computer science) and a biweekly stipend. Within a few months of starting, I was roped into planning and creating a documentation wiki system for them and the services that they offer on Campus in which I naively accepted. This was put on hold because we are in the process of changing systems such as our ERP system, our payroll system, etc, etc. These changes have produced a high call volume so I always feel pressured.


I should probably couple the fact that a few months ago, we lost a Full time Help Desk employee and just recently another Graduate assistant got moved to a different Graduate position within the department but I'll explain more a bit later. So I am now doing both of their jobs until they get replaced. I have a team of student interns but they don't have nearly enough permissions to do everything that I need help with. 


Here's where it gets interesting. I was passed up the opportunity of the Full Time Help Desk position(I get pay on top of school) because of various reasons, the biggest two are that they couldn't read my intentions(basically kiss butt) and the time frame(they think I'm going to quit as soon as I'm done with school but this got brought up only once). Aside from this, the other Graduate Assistant got hired in a position I was promised I would get once it opened. Could be because of(and I quote her coworkers) her boobs(her boss has a thing for her) or because, as the second most experienced person at my department, my boss would not want to lose me. Before all of this, I passed over the opportunity for a better job at a different organization because I did not want to put my boss in a situation where he had no people.


The thing that I feel like is a slap to my face is that I will have to train the person that got the other Graduate Assistant Help Desk  position and the full time one that I was passed for. 


My boss just recently and casually stated to me that we should really meet to get this wiki rolling. I am really at a loss on what to do. I think this wiki is a great idea, but it requires a lot of work and coding. The wiki will have to be maintained by someone that knows PHP, HTML, Javascript and I do not foresee anyone with these skills applying for this job nor any job at the University in the future so I have a feeling that the wiki will stop with me. I also do not want to do this as I feel like I have been burned badly and I have enough completing my duties as is but I told them I would do it. It would be one thing my efforts were appreciated but it doesn't seem like anyone cares(the VP doesn't even call me by name). I really don't know what to do or how to go about this or even if I am allowed to feel this way. I plan on graduating in December but I don't know how much longer I can hold up or if I am up to completing my request. "

I don't know where to start from to actually prepare for interviews and skills needed for, at least an internship. In fact, I do not know what I want to do as there are many branches in computer science. And my coding skills are just bare minimum at this point.


I currently have/know:

* Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: Practical Programming for Total Beginners

* Cracking the Coding Interview: 189 Programming Questions and Solutions

* freeCodecamp

* A bunch of courses on coursera, edx, etc.

* HackerRank


Where should I begin from? Is it important for me to know the algorithms than actually know how to code, or should I learn a language enough so that I can at least make something? Where's the starting point?



&gt; Now this is just a bit of rant (the previous was the main point you don't have to read this).. But I seem to be discouraged by difficult problems - sometimes I take a long time to solve one problem, then it reminded me how I would do in an actual workplace. What if I take this much time at a workplace?  What if I don't perform well? Sorry, had to get it out somewhere."

4l096w,1,2016-05-25,About to quit my job for another after only 1 month... But current job really needs me so it's AWKWARD CITY.,_il_mostro_,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4l096w/about_to_quit_my_job_for_another_after_only_1/,"This is stressing me out. I just graduated from grad school. A month ago I started a part time job, but I was also working part time at my internship. My internship just offered me a job, which I accepted. I would be a FOOL not to. It's 55k with benefits and federal so, duh. 

anyway my current job has legit NO IDEA this is coming. They want to hire me full time and go on and on about how I'm such an asset blah blah. They even bought be presents for my graduation and threw me a party.... I feel bad. 

I guess the main issue is however, they have an audit coming up EXACTLY what I was hired to do and my bosses are going to be gone during a conference at the time. I could hypothetically leave before and screw them over but my industry is pretty small and I don't want to burn bridges already. I like the person who would be stuck doing it to and I don't want to do that to him. 

I'm not sure really what the point of this is. But I'm sooooo nervous for some reason. I think I'm just going to email them. Hopefully they are just happy I am willing to stay and help them out. 

Anyone else quit after like 1 month? Any advice or stories? "

**Introduction**
=
[Robert Geller](http://imgur.com/a/KOG3D) is a German born American designer based in New York City. He graduated from [Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) in 2001]( http://i.imgur.com/6YDC83I.jpg) and interned at Marc Jacobs during the summer of his senior year. There he met his Ana Beatriz Lerario, the assistant designer and his future wife. There he also met [Alexandre Plokhov] http://i.imgur.com/O4JHIkb.jpg) which led them to working together at the cult label [Cloak](http://i.imgur.com/ByjiwZA.jpg) most notably for the highly regarded [Cloak AW04]( http://nymag.com/fashion/fashionshows/2004/fall/main/newyork/menrunway/cloak/).  It’s been debated his role in the collection but most speculate it was Plokhov's tailoring along with Geller’s styling that made the collection work. Geller left shortly after in 2004 and Cloak dissolved in 2007. 

In 2006, Robert Geller launched a short-lived womenswear brand called Herald which put him back on the spotlight and helped fund his own line. In 2007 he launched his namesake collection for AW07. He has designed a collection every season since then. In 2009 he received the CFDA Best New Menswear Designer Award and in 2011 received the CFDA Swarovski Award for Menswear. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Design**

*Thematics*
=
When responded to the comparison of his work to a polaroid Geller said, “There's something about Polaroids that's kind of precious, especially today in the day of digital or disposable. I want to have those qualities in my clothes. It's not an accurate depiction of reality; it's more like seeing the world through a romantic, kind-of-blurry view. I have a lot of that in my collection.""

Each of his collections draws from a certain period of time and place. European influences are frequently drawn from, especially Germany and Italy which Geller has memories and ideas of their romanticism. He envisions how that era would have looked if he were to add his own twist to it but still make it extremely wearable and accessible today. For this he is one of Styleforum’s favorite designers with a loyal fanbase with [their own dedicated thread]( http://www.styleforum.net/t/280974/romantic-europe-meets-nyc-the-robert-geller-thread). 

*Progression*
=
The last decade, since the brand’s inception, has seen tremendous growth of Geller’s eponymous line. Earlier collections definitely had elements of the gothic leaning Cloak. However from those initial collections and with each subsequent collection has emerged Geller’s own vision, something that he has referred to as, “the modern man”, an individual that is, “masculine, yet sensitive”. From that idea, a summary of his label’s aesthetic was derived as “Romantic European elegance mixed with hard-edged New York toughness.” 

*Styling*
=
Geller pieces are often quite versatile and easily wearable. He plays with his own interpretation of menswear, sportswear, some may even say ‘European streetwear’. That being said generally all his pieces are routed in a degree of accessibility, meaning there is an ease or flexibility to wearing them. Geller has stated that he wants his items, “to be something that you can put on and you feel cool and you feel like you're wearing something of quality.  You feel like you're wearing something that somebody has thought about.  But you don't want to feel like people are staring at you because you're trying so hard.” Whether that is a bomber, a blazer, a pair of jeans it’s all supposed to be something you can just throw on. 

[Here is a small album of mostly Styleforum posters’ styling]( http://imgur.com/a/uUgXq) 

Note: In the past Geller runway styling has been criticized as [overly layered](http://i.imgur.com/OheGHrj.jpg) with jackets on top of jackets and neoprene knits and mesh tanks layered underneath however that usually translates off the runway to just a [tank top layered under a sweater](http://i.imgur.com/rGQHXDv.jpg?1).  

*Collection Signatures*
=
Even with a wide span of inspirations the brand carries over certain pieces that are essentially well known staples with varying iterations. These include, but not limited to, [dip dye sweaters]( http://i.imgur.com/ZqAzC5e.jpg), [Richard jacket/cardigan]( http://i.imgur.com/BTuIhnt.jpg), [zip blazer]( http://i.imgur.com/pP0Dabd.jpg), and [bombers]( http://i.imgur.com/211RQkz.jpg). 

If you haven't noticed, most of his garments have people's names (ie Richard blazer, Oskar sunglasses, Conrad hat, etc). The only verified name source are the Dominik jackets and trousers named after the intern (Dominik Halas) that designed them. However most people theorize that some of the names come from the runway models who wore the pieces or from where the inspiration was derived. 

His signature ""logo"" is often displayed as a stitched on bar on his [shirting]( http://i.imgur.com/b2B2MHH.jpg)  but his normal tag appears on the [inside]( http://i.imgur.com/KS1yHjD.png) of every clothing. The bar logo was partially inspired by Donald Judd. 

His mainline clothing is generally made in Japan.

*Collaborations and alternate lines*
=
Since AW09 Geller has collaborated Common Projects to produce the footwear for each of his collections.  Together they have produced multiple iterations of combat boots and Chelsea boots, as well as double monk strap shoes, zip up oxfords, suede slip-on sneakers, and hiking sneakers. 

In SS15 he collaborated with Garrett Leight to produce sunglasses with a khaki gradient frame with mirrored lenses sun clip. Geller has teased a continued collaboration with Garrett Leight for SS17. 

For SS16 he collaborated with Japanese sandal brand Suicoke to produce a navy, neoprene technical sandal. 

Since SS10 Robert Geller Seconds has been his diffusion label that produces his interpretations of classic athletic wear such as basics including tees, tanks, sweats, and hoodies. 

RG Denim is the latest venture which consists of made-in-US denim. The denim is produced by 3 Japanese brothers in LA and the products include denim jackets, skinny jeans (RG 1), slim jeans (RG 2), and straight leg jeans (RG 3). 


*Inspiration*
=
Most of his collections may be viewed [here]( http://www.vogue.com/?s=robert+geller) 

AW07 - Jean-Paul Belmondo in the 1960s

SS08 - 1970s skate culture in Venice, California, and the Z-boys in particular; the work of German artist Joseph Beuys; James Dean and other rebels. Geller has said this was “a total departure” and “ three collections” and admitted to be “probably the most off collection.”  

AW08 - The work of an early 19th-century Prussian naturalist (hence the well-known Prussian coat)

SS09 - Gypsies and Eastern European tough-guy ideals of masculinity

FW09 - Menswear in Vienna at the turn of the 20th century, a place and period Geller calls one of the most elegant in menswear

SS10 - Germans in the late 1950s vacationing in the North Sea. Geller wanted to ""lift moods."" German artist Michael Sowa was one inspiration, as was ""the power of color to influence emotion.""

FW10 - Geller wanted to ""to marry upscale, uptown luxury with an indie rocker vibe,"" and called it ""a nice mix of the downtown guy playing with the elements of old school suiting."" He said it was ""a tribute to the beauty of mixing wardrobe elements that don’t always seem to fit.""

SS11 - Germany's rebellious youth culture in the late 60s (the ""wide awake youth""), in particular the German Student Movement of 1968. Regarding the colors in the collection, he wanted to ""take them apart."" He doesn't like primary colors, but within red he loves the ""bordeauxs and pinks, and mixing them together is sort of beautiful.""

FW11 - Italian filmmaker Luchino Visconti's ""German Trilogy""—The Damned (1969), Death in Venice (1971), and Ludwig (1973)

SS12 - Geller said his inspiration was ""a new direction of silhouettes for men."" You can hear him talk about his ideas [here](http://blindbarber.tumblr.com/post/9087165750/the-perfect-cut-with-robert-geller)

FW12 - Classic English menswear with youthful and energetic influences from the early '80s post-punk scene.

SS13 - Inspired by the photography of Sarah Moon, which included gritty beaches and sepia toned landscapes.

FW13 - Movies in Berlin during the 1920's 

SS14 - Moscow in the 1980's mixed with western overtones. 

FW14 - David Bowie and his works, specifically The Man Who Fell to Earth. 

SS15 – For this season instead of a time and a place Geller took inspiration from “a brushstroke” showing off the representation of brushstrokes and playing color in muted shades. 

FW15 – The Nadi brothers, Italian fencers who won gold at the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp, and the origins of modern sportswear. 

SS16 – Geller spoke of his, “great memories of childhood vacations on the North Sea,"" with the collection featuring muted, dusty tones, Tyvek fabrics, rope accessories, and prints reminiscent of, “the look of light reflecting off water.” 

FW16 – The collection mirrored the children’s book, *The Grey Gentlemen*, as it transitioned from noir black and white thought to ecru shades finally finishing with bold bordeux and mustard.

4l0yal,1,2016-05-25,Mediocrity,Islandkid679,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4l0yal/mediocrity/,"Tl;dr: A decline from great to 'meh'.

5 years.  5 years at this ""prestigious"" university doing a lauded combination of degrees.  5 years starting somewhat by easing a couple of top grades in to barely passing papers despite putting 100% effort.  In fact, it takes a 100% just to make sure I don't fail. 

Why did this happen?  How did I become a shadow of what I used to be capable of?  I used to be able to pull last minute A+ material overnight and now I rewrite opinions or portfolios more than twice and get a C for my effort.  

I have an outgoing friend who's pretty, witty and intelligent.  She comes back from a trip overseas partying with her friends to a test that I had been preparing notes for the past fortnight.  Luckily I had a spare copy of them and gave her one.

She gets an A+.  I get a B.

I don't resent the fact that she's smarter than me because I've been outclassed by smart people everyday and accepted that there are more gifted people out there.  I resent the fact that I have to put in that much more work compared to others and get half of the reward out of it.  Spending nights at the computers compiling work while I could have gone out having fun.  I know that actually might be the same thing as resenting her.  I can't tell, or maybe I'm lying to myself.

I used to be able to compete with the best of them.  Now I can barely see the trail they've left behind.

The kicker is my parents have paid for my time here at Uni.  In full. Did I mention that I am an international student? Tuition and accommodation.  Without holding me in obligation or expecting anything back.  I can't begin to say how its kept me sleepless or stressed some days and nights trying my best to repay them for their sacrifice.  There is a number to it and it makes me want to cry sometimes.  I have a part time job and have scored some internships that I've tried to put together in order to compensate for a lack of academic excellence in the hopes that it will land me a decent job.  But still.  If ever the day comes where I don't actually pass, I would get on my knees and beg for their forgiveness for investing their time and love on a useless excuse like me.

I had a sweet internship with a bank here.  Put in the work and the time to make connections.  It got snarky with some other interns but hey, I won't play that game.  Even though I could drop kick you through the posts.  Short bastard.  Made a good friend to whom we started a bank wide project.  I started it, she completed it.   We rotated so I had to pass it on. She got offered a part time placement over the final year.  I didn't.  Our HR liaison told us that graduate roles were not on offer for that department, despite being given the internship.  Thanks for telling us midway though, not that I had hopes or anything.

Both of the ladies I mentioned above are actually some of the closest friends that I've ever made.  One helped me through a breakup and I almost got romantically involved with her.  She's hot, on top of every other amazing thing about her.

Admittedly,  I could have spent less time doing extracurriculars and spent more time on studies.  But hey! The careers adviser in first year said that people who do extra stuff have a better chance at landing a good job! The 'holistic' experience, so to speak.  You should stfu to be honest.  Whatever you might say, the substance speaks volumes, and by substance I mean grades.

But I'm done.  I don't want to do this conjoint ""oooh conjoint, how special"" degree anymore.  I don't want to struggle another year and with every shit mark I get, be reminded of the fact that I'm letting my parents investment in me go to waste.  Be reminded that I can no longer keep up with my high achieving mate, among others, whose going to get an award for topping her class and a name on the wall of achievers at our faculty.  Shes brilliant, she really is.

My story probably pales in comparison to my other friends, who lost loved ones, had family problems or even the same advantages that I've had.

But, like I said, I'm done.  If I decide to go isolate and seclude myself after I graduate (god willing),  it's not because I don't love you or don't want to be your friend anymore.  Just let me brood and reflect and escape for a bit and ponder the 'what if' question for a while, that in a different world, Mum and Dad, you wouldn't have to worry about the future of the family as much because I have it handled, or that you, Pia, I could see myself being smart enough to go out with you let alone be your rival and friend.  To all my family and friends, it isn't you, it's me.

There's a lot more that I could have said in this post but I think this demonstrates how I feel sufficiently.

Mediocrity.  It isn't a phase, it's a state of existence.

Edit: words.

4l0zie,1,2016-05-25,Does it look bad to ask for a lowpaid/unpaid super short summer internship?,throwawaaayayaya,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4l0zie/does_it_look_bad_to_ask_for_a_lowpaidunpaid_super/,"I just finished my second year of a CS undergrad education at a relatively strong school. For this summer, I had accepted an 8 week internship in a non CS field to try something else. I met someone who cofounded a startup and mentioned offhand that his company would be hiring summer interns in time for my next summer. I have around a month or so of free break outside of my non-tech internship, and want to ask if I could work on a project as a low/no cost intern for the sake of getting experience, and because I think it would help me better understand if I want to go into software engineering. 

Not really sure if this is proper etiquette though, because I don't know it would just be impossible to work on anything remotely helpful for them in the span of a month. Upperclassmen at my school who had big 4 internships told me that the material I've finished is enough to get me through the typical coding interview, so I think I would be qualified in that sense, but I know I'd be asking for something unusual and don't know if it would be negatively received? And if it would be alright to ask, would I be better off asking to get paid a low wage, or offer to work for free?"
4l123j,1,2016-05-25,Venting About Work,deadly_toxin,Needafriend,https://www.reddit.com/r/Needafriend/comments/4l123j/venting_about_work/,"This is going to be a super long rant. I apologize in advance but this has been an ongoing thing for the past three months, and I just want to get it all off my chest.

I should probably start off with a bit of background here. First, I (25f) work in a government office for a rural community. As in, I manage the office on my own (doing everything from the accounts payable, accounts receivable, taxation, tax enforcement, bylaw enforcement, drafting of bylaws, advising elected officials on legal matters, etc. etc.). In order to get certified to do my job, a person needs at minimum 1,800 hours work experience under someone who is certified to train, as well as a certain amount of schooling. 

The situation regarding demand for people in my occupation is a strange one. On one hand, we are in extreme high demand. There are not enough qualified Admins to work at all the Rural Municipalities in the province, BUT, because we are not unionized, and because we work for elected officials (which is a nice way of saying average joe off the street who doesn't have a clue about labor laws) job security is always a concern. In addition, since municipalities (or some places call them townships) cover large areas of land and cover the entire province, most of the available openings are hours away from eachother, and are out in the boonies. The jobs close to cities are always filled. For that reason, and because there is only ever room for one Administrator at an RM, there is little to no insentive to hire an intern to train, pay a full time wage, just for them to go somewhere else. And, of course, there is always the concern of getting replaced with your trainee, who's salary would be substantially less than yours. So getting training can be extremely difficult.

I have been working in the field for five years. Finally, six months ago, a position opened up that was close to the city I've been trying to move to for the entire period I've been working. I promptly applied, and easily got the position. This particular office at the time had a full time assistant, who had been scheduled to retire one month after I started. Three months ago, we decided to hire an assistant. This is where the problem started.

Because I was a lot younger than my retired predacessor, and because I was in the process of converting over hand-written ledgers and books to the computer, we decided I would only need a part time, two days a week, assistant. A girl (35f) who worked at the post office next door frequently came in for our shared coffee breaks, and she told me she was very interested in the position. At the time, she was only doing relief work next door, and was supposed to take over for the full-time lady when she retired this year. She told me she didn't want to work full-time, because she was a stay at home mom, and something casual would fit her lifestyle much better. It was because of this that I decided to suggest her as a candidate to my Council. They were amicable to her, and as such she was promptly hired, without any actual interview process or formal application. Before she started working, she told me that her days she would be available to work would vary depending on her husbands work schedule. I agreed that she could set her own schedule, provided she did not go over the allowed 14 hours a week and that she let me know at minimum two weeks in advance which days she could work. She did this for the first two months without much difficulty. In addition, she was hired at $20.00 per hour, with a pension plan and disability benefits. She worked for two weeks (under me for a total of four days) before I left for a vacation to China for two weeks. Her duties were the most basic, monkey could do your job, tasks I could possibly give her. Make receipts for people when they pay their bills, put the receipts away, and take messages on the phone for me to deal with when I come back. That was it.

When I returned, she told me she had done a lot of thinking, and had decided that this career was the one for her. (Which insulted me completely, as she had only four days working with me and had/still has no freaking clue as to what my job actually is). As such, she went ahead to my bosses (council) during my absence and told them she would like to get trained under me. She did this without talking to me about it. Now, training is a huge undertaking. You literally have a useless person working under you full time for an entire year, after which you sign off on whether or not they can do the job. It's not something I've ever been interested in doing, and at my age, I have no reason to think about training a predesessor to take my place. Particularly in this case, as the girl is ten years older than me. In addition to that, she is married and has five kids. Which means she is not willing to move anywhere to get a job. The only job around here, by the way, is mine. Lastly, and unknown to her, I had recently found out I was expecting a baby. I let her know I wasn't very interested in training someone at this point in time, and that I wasn't qualified to do so anyway. I also let her know that I considered it disrespectful for her to have gone above my head, as I am considered her supervisor/manager, to my bosses about something that would directly impact my employment and job. I did this of course in the most professional way possible, and told her she wasn't in trouble, but rather I just wanted her to understand my feelings about what she did. Her response was that she could talk to council at any time she wanted.

After that, we had a council meeting, to which she handed out her little pamphlets on grants the RM could receive if they chose to train her. 

This did not sit well with me. My council has meetings once per month. So at the following meeting, I informed them that I was not interested in providing mentorship over anyone, and that I would appreciate it if I was no longer pressured over doing so. They agreed that they could not force me to train, and as such, decided to let my assistant know that she would not be getting training. In between this time, I let my employers know about my pregnancy, and I let them know I would be going on maternity leave in September. 

The next day my assistant came into the office, and told me that since the RM was not going to train her, she wanted to know her avenues for potentially getting trained. Because originally all she wanted was to start training in a few years, I told her that when she was ready to start looking, I would of course help her. It was at this point in time that she started changing her schedule every time she came in to work. In May, she had eight shifts scheduled. She changed the schedule a total of twelve times. At this point I was having a difficult time figuring out when she was supposed to be working, and ended up scheduling my own work around my assistants schedule.

Two weeks after that, she announced to me that she wanted to do my Maternity leave, and had found a qualified Admin who would come in to help her one day a month. (This is freaking ridiculous by the way, and there is no way that would ever be approved through our certification organization, but whatever.) When untrained people work in these types of offices, it always ends in disaster. Especially because the girl has no idea what she would be getting into in the first place. She was still struggling with the few duties that had been given to her on top of it all. So I told her straight up that I felt she wasn't ready to have such an undertaking. Sometimes people get approved to run an office when they haven't quite gotten their certification. But that situation is for people who have had three to five years of full time experience as an assistant, not someone who is basically starting at zero experience wise. I hoped that she wouldn't be stupid enough to persue it further.

THEN I went to a convention, and my collegues from the area informed me that she had been calling around looking for training. She had told them all a sob story about how I was refusing to train her, and wasn't allowing her to take her courses to get qualified. I am not sure how one goes about preventing someone from taking correspondence courses, but apparently I was doing it. I also spoke to the lady who supposedly offered to train her, and was informed that she had in fact refused her. What she had actually said was that she only had time for one day a month, and that was not nearly enough, so the answer was no. AND after I return to work, she breezes into the office on her day off to let me know she casually dropped the suggestion of her taking my mat leave to by bosses.

This was the last fricking straw for me. So... I called my boss up and told her I didn't want her in the office anymore. I talked to him about all that had been going on, etc. etc. Then, before the meeting this month, I see that she changed her schedule again without telling me, so that she would be in the office on the day of the meeting. Presumabely to try and weasel her way in to my maternity leave. So I called her and told her she was not to change her schedule any more, and that I would set her days of work from now on.

When I came into the meeting yesterday, I discovered she had used her key to get into the office, printed a letter of resignation, and left it on top of my meeting file. She refused to work out her remaining two weeks, and had her husband bring in her keys. I am not upset by this, after all, I was going to ask for her to be fired anyway. But, I'm a little surprised by her actions. After all, I have not once allowed my irritation with her actions effect our work relationship, and I never once hinted to her that I no longer wanted her in the office. 

It seems like an overreaction to me... was I out of line? I do feel that she was after my job, one hundred percent. I think it was her hope to get my maternity leave and for me not to return. "
4l170o,3,2016-05-25,F4M - Celebrity wins hot vacation,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4l170o/f4m_celebrity_wins_hot_vacation/,"""By ""raffle"", I won a trip to special vacation resort. This resort is unique because it’s ONLY for couples and no one seems to know much about it, as people who won tickets have to sign nondisclosure agreements. But the rumor is that it’s really great, and most importantly one of the most exclusive in the world. I really want to do that trip, but have nobody to go with, so I ""catch"" you and drag you into it so I can go.

In that resort, a lot of activities are organised for couples. We quickly discover that some are mild, and some aren't at all. Romantic dinners, massage lessons with other couples or just the two of us, sexy cooking lessons, but also more kinky ones. Moreover, some employees can give dares to couples every time they see them, from kiss and grope each other right here (“here” being anywhere from an empty corridor public places)or skinny dipping to have sex in that place without getting caught (or make sure you do get caught by somebody). Each couple can choose anytime between 3 categories and activities and dare at the beginning of the day, but won’t know any details until they start. You can be an employee or a fan, or some rich friend and you have to act like your bf. At the beginning You'd probably kind of shy/nervous because of all of this, hanging out and pretending to be with THAT celeb's boyfriend. On my side I'm having a blast, enjoying myself and keeping us from all the things you'd love to try.

And from here, the scenario can go differen ways depending on what you want to do, your kinks &amp; limits… So let’s discuss it

Do youstart to enjoy yourselfself and we both start to take part is more and more daring activities? Do you figure out that you can take advantage of the situation, start to get more and more touchy every time you can? Trying to get us into the hottest activities, and if I refuse to play along threaten to expose us as a fake couple? Or maybe you start to even blackmail me after getting some serious leverage, and get me to do everything you want.

LOTS of possibilities, with either a young celeb and an older employee, assistant, agent... Or an older one with the new intern or some fan she randomly picked, I'm open to suggestions !

Celebrities : Candice Patton (The Flash) - Natalie Dormer, Emilia Clarke, Sophie Turner (GoT) - Lauren Cohan (TWD) - Willa Holland (Arrow) - Chloë Grace Moretz (Kick Ass) - Evangeline Lilly (Lost) - Emma Watson, Scarlett Johansson (Never heard of them ? Seriously?) - Lucy Liu (Kill Bill) - Cobie Smulders (HIMYM) - Penélope Cruz (Vanilla Sky) - Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba (Sin City) - Olga Kurylenko (Quantum of Solace) - Blake Lively (Green Lantern) - Kate Beckinsale (Underworld) - McKayla Maroney (Gymnast) - Natalie Alyn Lind (Gotham) - Alexis Ren (Model)- Your suggestion?

My work schedule was set so I worked from 9am to 5 pm, but I would only spend an hour or so doing actual work and blowing the rest of the day on YouTube/reddit/looking up computer science stuff/etc. Two weeks into it I asked if there was anything else I could do, but they said they had literally nothing else for me which led me to believe they weren't really prepared to host an intern. 

I have another internship planned this year as well but now I hope that I don't find myself doing the same thing. In the event that I do, what are some things that I can do to kill time? What ate dome things you do when you find yourself with tons of free time?


If anyone is wondering, the internship I have this year is set so that I work hands on with the ATMs around the city learning how to program them as well as manage their networks and servers. Sounds fun, and I definitely think this is good experience towards a computer science career. "

Graduated May 2015, have been working in a large marketing and data firm since July 1015 as a Business Systems Analyst in a role focusing on email marketing.  Have experience working with multiple teams at once and managing off shore resources and communicating directly with clients that consist of large organizations.  I have no preference over size of companies (anything from a startup to a large firm) but am looking for a position involving digital marketing or data analysis related to marketing.  I am flexible and can work in a finance related position as well as I have school and work experience in finance.  

**Longer Version**

 Being in Boston all my life, I'm looking to live out in San Francisco, having family and friends already located there. While rent is a bit higher, cost of living is comparable to my current situation living right in the city.  I went to a top local business school for college and then took a job here as well.  My undergraduate was in Finance and Economics with minors in Computer Science and Law.  

All throughout school I've worked while studying and have had 6 different internships with an average duration of about 3-4 months each.  Several have been in Marketing, several in Finance related positions, but I learned much from all of them.  None were the type of internships where I would get coffee for others or only file away papers (not that there is anything wrong with those kind of internships - there's learning to be done everywhere).
I'm looking for a job in San Francisco comparable to my current one, involved with Marketing and/or Data.  On the other hand, I'm also willing to take on a position outside my current role, maybe in Finance or even in IT if available.  If you have a position available or are more interested, please PM me. 

Thanks!

4l1lwu,0,2016-05-25,F4M - Celebrity wins hot vacation,[deleted],AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/4l1lwu/f4m_celebrity_wins_hot_vacation/,"""By ""raffle"", I won a trip to special vacation resort. This resort is unique because it’s ONLY for couples and no one seems to know much about it, as people who won tickets have to sign nondisclosure agreements. But the rumor is that it’s really great, and most importantly one of the most exclusive in the world. I really want to do that trip, but have nobody to go with, so I ""catch"" you and drag you into it so I can go.

In that resort, a lot of activities are organised for couples. We quickly discover that some are mild, and some aren't at all. Romantic dinners, massage lessons with other couples or just the two of us, sexy cooking lessons, but also more kinky ones. Moreover, some employees can give dares to couples every time they see them, from kiss and grope each other right here (“here” being anywhere from an empty corridor public places)or skinny dipping to have sex in that place without getting caught (or make sure you do get caught by somebody). Each couple can choose anytime between 3 categories and activities and dare at the beginning of the day, but won’t know any details until they start. You can be an employee or a fan, or some rich friend and you have to act like your bf. At the beginning You'd probably kind of shy/nervous because of all of this, hanging out and pretending to be with THAT celeb's boyfriend. On my side I'm having a blast, enjoying myself and keeping us from all the things you'd love to try.

And from here, the scenario can go differen ways depending on what you want to do, your kinks &amp; limits… So let’s discuss it

Do youstart to enjoy yourselfself and we both start to take part is more and more daring activities? Do you figure out that you can take advantage of the situation, start to get more and more touchy every time you can? Trying to get us into the hottest activities, and if I refuse to play along threaten to expose us as a fake couple? Or maybe you start to even blackmail me after getting some serious leverage, and get me to do everything you want.

LOTS of possibilities, with either a young celeb and an older employee, assistant, agent... Or an older one with the new intern or some fan she randomly picked, I'm open to suggestions !

If you're in high school, that stuff will be realllllly helpful in college.  If you're in college it will be really helpful getting a leg up on jobs, etc, just ALWAYS back up your stuff asap!  You never know what will be important in the future.

EDIT:  For college, a lot of people have previous internship information, doctoral research, email addresses from the people they've network with only on their email accounts, I'm NOT saying an essay will get you a job, jesus.  Why is there backlash to saying have a backup?

EDIT 2:  Holy bahjeez this thread blew up!  It's really sad to read the stories of lost data. (u/E4R)  There's a lot of suggestions, so I made a list of some of the highest voted: 

- Some schools will delete your accounts, some won't but the general consensus is that still using your school email after graduation looks pretty tacky.  Also, check with your IT departments what your school's policies are.  Thanks to u/taschnewitz for some great suggestions there!  You can buy domains to look more professional if you're into that, pretty sure you can buy domains from Google Apps for Work with Drive space or just pay for an email client like pawnmail. 
- If you have a Google account, you can use google takeout to export your stuff to a zip (but it also looks like it won't export your shared files and will take awhile depending on the size of your stuff) or pay for gradgopher to move your mail and drive to another google account quickly.  thanks u/ichifeet
- For mail, it looks like you can do POP forwarding if you haven't already set up automatic forwarding and may be in your best interest to set up forwarding now if you're just starting out.  thanks u/Son_Of_A_Plumber
- If you are signing up to websites/apps, make sure you're signing in with a personal account.  Managing those accounts with a student email that's deleted will be a pain.  Thanks u/Toysoldier34
- Student discounts with your email are dope if you still have it.
- looks like there are a lot of suggestions, but no consensus, decide what's best for you, but make sure you have your stuff safe (and it's probably safer in a personal cloud than locally on you hard drive.)
- and thanks u/Gangrel13 for backing me up!

4l1v1q,0,2016-05-25,"[Taxes] I somehow owe almost $600 in state taxes for 2014, but I only earned 17K that year. Help please!",taxeshowdotheywork,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4l1v1q/taxes_i_somehow_owe_almost_600_in_state_taxes_for/,"This year was the first that I did my taxes by myself. Before that, my grandpa handled the whole family's taxes. This post is about taxes for the year 2014, when I was a college student. I had a couple of internships and a part-time job at a mall store. I earned a little over 17K. 

I graduated early in December 2014, then withdrew about $15K from my college savings account (which is managed by an investment firm) to pay off my student loans so I could graduate debt-free. That was my Christmas present to myself. The college fund was recently transferred over to my name when I turned 21. The money would have been used on the fourth year of college, but I worked hard so I could get out of there early and save some money.

Come March 2015, my grandpa sent me the materials for my federal and state taxes. According to that, I should have received a $275 refund from the feds, and I owed about $120 to the state of North Carolina. I wrote a check and mailed everything off. I double-checked with my bank and the check to NC cleared.

I didn't hear anything about it until about two months ago when my mom (who lives in Texas) got a collections letter from the NC IRS claiming that I owed them almost $600 from 2014. I immediately called them to see what was going on. Someone there told me that I needed to get my federal tax transcript and send it to them, so I made that request online and waited.

Well, it turns out that the federal IRS never received my 2014 tax return. I don't know if it got lost in the mail (does that still happen?) but nobody ever told me that it didn't go through. I'm absent-minded and bad about money so I didn't notice when the refund never came. I know that's awful and I need to be better about that. 

I called up my grandpa and got all the paperwork for 2014 that he had prepared, and sent copies of both my federal and state taxes to the federal IRS mailing address in Kansas City with a cover letter explaining the situation and apologizing. I asked specifically for someone to contact me to make sure everything was settled. That was three weeks ago, and I haven't heard anything from them. I know that's par for the course, but I need that information now. I've tried calling the IRS but I can't get a human being on the line despite waiting for 60-90 minutes several times.

Today I got a letter that said I have 30 days to pay the $600 to the NC IRS or it would be sent to collections and probably destroy my credit score, if it hasn't already. I don't know what to do. I could pay it, but I would be dipping into my (meager) savings and I don't think I actually owe this money. What should be my next step?"

4l2043,7,2016-05-25,Getting frustrated with sister/MOH,jennywren15,weddingplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/4l2043/getting_frustrated_with_sistermoh/,"Okay so I need to vent a little, and maybe a reminder that none of this matters as much as it does in my head.

My younger sister (21) is my MOH. She goes to college out of state, and is spending most of the summer in a city near her school where she has an internship. I don't know that that's important, just background. Anyway, I'm feeling like she has been pretty unsupportive, and lately it's really starting to get to me.

She went with me to pick out my dress, which I thought would be a fun sister bonding event. It was fine, and she really liked the dress I picked, but wasn't super into it. Okay, whatever, I can see how watching someone else try on dresses isn't the most exciting, I just figured since she really likes watching ""Say Yes to the Dress"" she might enjoy it a little more. She had taken a picture of my dress when I was choosing it to send to my mom. Apparently, one of her friends (who we are inviting to the wedding) asked about the dress, and my sister sent her the picture, which she then showed to her boyfriend (also invited). I had no idea this happened until the boyfriend, who I know in another context as well, randomly mentioned he saw my dress and liked it. I was kinda pissed that she was sending out pictures of my dress to her friend, who is known for being indiscrete, but we talked about it and I let it go. She just didn't think I would care if people saw my dress (I don't quite know why this didn't occur to her, but I certainly don't always think through everything I do, so I get it), trusted her friend not to show people, etc. So we moved on.

I have three bridesmaids including my sister, the other two are my FSIL and my close friend. My sister is significantly heavier than either FSIL or my friend, who are both super slender, although my friend will be about 6 months pregnant. I know this made her feel self-conscious, so I've been really aware of trying to make sure she's comfortable in her dress etc. I had initially been thinking short dresses but started thinking about long, and I asked her how she felt about that. She told me that she likes either, and then started saying that she thought long might look better. (Side note, she basically thinks I have absolutely no taste for decorating or fashion, and she often feels like there is a certain aesthetic that is the only correct thing, so in retrospect I think she decided to answer this as my personal design coach and not a person in the bridal party...) So I ended up going with long.

Then, right before I was going to ask the girls to order dresses, she told me she didn't think the color would look good on her and she would rather a darker shade. I didn't want everyone in that shade,but I wanted to accommodate her preferences, so I ended up deciding to go back to an idea I had scrapped early on and give everyone their own color so that she could have her preferred color. I also asked everyone to wear nude flats for their shoes, since that's simple and that way I wouldn't be short compared to my friend and FSIL, which I usually am.

During this whole process, I've noticed that she never seems even happy about the wedding. She wasn't excited when we got engaged (which I wrote off since she was out of the country for a semester at the time so I couldn't really see her reaction in person) and has seemed kind of sullen when we talk about it. But it's my wedding, not her's, just because it's a big deal to me doesn't mean anyone has to care. I've always held that as long as she's there in the dress by my side on the day, I'm not expecting more. Although I didn't really expect her to be quite so joyless about it, I was sort of imagining doing some things together and having fun with it.

Anyway, today I was talking with my mom and she let slip that my sister wasn't happy with the dresses. I knew she was frustrated because my plan was to let them all order dresses to try on before they picked, but the service was down on the site I wanted to use until too late for comfort. I totally get not wanting to order a dress sight unseen, that's always kinda scary. But my mom told me she had talked to her friends and they had all decided that my sister would look better in a short dress, so she was upset that I had said they had to be long. Unless they decided this in the last couple of weeks, she could have told me she was more comfortable in a short dress and I would have changed it! Hell, she was the one who helped talk me in to long dresses in the first place! 

Then my mom mentioned that she was somehow upset that I'm getting married this summer. I'm not sure (and I don't think my mom knows either) quite why this upsets her, but I do understand that other people's weddings can bring up a lot of feelings. Still, when I've been to weddings that have brought up negative feelings for me, I was still really freaking happy for the couple! And if this is so hard for her, she could have said no to being my MOH...

And then, the most recent thing, apparently she has (unbeknownst to me) invited a friend of hers who I've never met to the wedding. We both have large families, so FH and I decided early on that we would make sure and invite the SOs of anyone in relationships, but not give +1s to single people. However, to make sure that our sisters had people to be with, we invited two of my sister's closest friends and their families, and one of his sister's closest friends and her mom. All of those families in question are people who are family friends to some extent, but might not have made the list if we weren't specifically trying to have our sisters' friend there and comfortable. But no, my sister has now invited some girl I don't know without even bothering to check with me. When I asked her about this, since she literally had not told me about this, she told me that she wanted ""someone to hang out with at the wedding"". Which I get, I truly do, only we already invited some of her closest friends, and literally all of our relatives... And honestly I might have even said yes, but I'm really shocked and hurt that she would invite someone without even asking me.

Weddit, am I being unreasonable or a bridezilla here? I mean at this point I think I'm even going to let her have her friend come, because I don't want to cause drama, even though our guest list is already about twice as big as I wanted... I really feel like I was trying to be really aware of her needs in this process, and she's shown no enthusiasm at all and sort of walked all over me. I'm honestly starting to regret having her as my MOH. I don't know that there's anything to do at this point, but rambling here helps anyway!"
4l21jl,5,2016-05-25,[24/M] Confused with ex and new girl :/,FiboGold,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4l21jl/24m_confused_with_ex_and_new_girl/,"Okay, let's see where I start. I have always lived in Italy, my whole life. I had a girlfriend, I had been dating her for 4 years. Then I got an opportunity to go study abroad and get a master's degree (1 year) in the US (I am italian). Unemployment rates among young people are so high, and good jobs are not often found when you graduate, so I decided thee best thing was to study in the US. I talked to my girlfriend and we were sure we could get through this, even if I stayed in the US for a bit longer to do an internship or something like that. The plan was always to return after 1-2 years max
We had never had any major problems, we did fight from time to time, but in a way every couple does, without hard feelings. I really thought she was the one, and I am pretty sure she thought so too. 

But being an ocean apart was tough. She had some personal problems, and I could notsupport her as good as I would have liked to. It was easier for me, because I got to experience so many new things, but for her, it was the same daily routines that reminded her of me, so she was having a really bad time. 

I have always been able to understand peoples feelings easily, but now I realize I could not grasp what she was feeling at the time, she really felt miserable. I tried to pretend everything was like before, when I lived 50 km away from her instead of 5000. That was a mistake, and our conversations were frustrating. We saw each other for christmas and spent a lot of time together. As soon as we were together things were amazing, but things were going to go back to sucking and a couple days before I had to fly back to the US we broke up. It was being too hard, and she was feeling really miserable. She could not focus on her studies. We made the decission together, although we were not convinced about it.

The following months I understood how she had been feeling before. Empty, torn apart.We still messaged each other often, but we tried to do it less and less. The begining was very hard for both of us, because we really saw each other as the ones, so we said ""Okay, we broke up, because it sucks to be apart, but who knows, we were really good together maybe in a year or 2 things change, when I come back, you never know"".
 I was really depressed, could not focus on anything. I slept with several other girls to try and forget her. That only made things worse. I felt like I was betraying her,and no one could compare to her, and they only reminded me of what I had lost. I don't think it was morally wrong, as I always told the girls I was not looking for a relationship, but still felt awful about it.

After 3 months I started to feel better. This does not mean I do not sometimes cry or feel sad. I was still screwed up, but felt better about it. 
There was a new girl. I had kissed her before, but nothing else had happened. That same day I was going to meet her at a party, was the day my ex girlfriend called me crying, she was in the middle of a nervous breakdown, we talked and talked and I ended up feeling like shit. Later that night I met the new girl and ended up going to her apartment. I had slept with other girls before, but this time I just could not, was feeling terrible, so I just told her about my situation, that I needed some time alone and that I could not do it. She was really understanding and sweet.
I decided I did not want to sleep with any other girls, because that only made things worse. But this girl, she wanted to meet me, she asked me out a couple times, we had dinner twice, and the last time she invited me to her appartment. I declined. She did not pressure me at all.

After seeing her a couple times when going out, I finally invited her to my apartment and we did have sex. Since then we have been seing each other for some time (2 months).  I did tell her at the beginning I was not looking for a serious relationship, but we do have fun together, and she is sweet.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tl;dr: I had a girlfriend for 4 years, then I had to move to another country and we ended breaking up. After some time, I met another girl, we  have fun together, but I am still in love with my ex.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, here come the questions, for those brave enough to read through this long post:

1. If the only problem I had with my ex was distance, is it crazy to think we could have another chance in the future? 

2. Even if there is a chance, is it better if I try to convinve myself there is not? I am feeling much better now, but I sometimes feel sad without her, we really understood each other. I feel like I lost half of myself, we just seemed to understand each other very well.

3. Is it crazy that I think she(my ex) is/was the love of my life? I have been with more girls, but I fell in love with her in a matter of days, I haven't felt like that for any other person, not as intense. Maybe this will go away, of course, I cannot know that, but I feel like she is too important for me to ever forget her

4. After seing the new girl on and off for a couple of months, should I tell her how I feel about everything? Any advice on how to handle it? I do not want to hurt her, but it is just how I feel for now :(

If you really read everything, please feel free to give your opinion on ANYTHING, you can be brutally honest, I may need that. And if you did, thank you very much, I really apreciate it"

---

I had the obvious crisis any civilized person might; for days, I agonized over whether to warn my boss that she was about to be brutally assaulted by my partners in crime. Despite numerous rationalizations, excuses, and mental playbacks of the death of Well-dressed Prick, some part of me knew something would happen this time, too. Somehow or another, she would end up dead if the attack went through. It was a premonition I couldn't shake, and I downed coffee after coffee while debating what to do.

At one time, I had liked and respected her. She'd been incredibly convincing. She was a single mom with five kids, and we'd had a drink after my first office Christmas party. In that late private hour, we'd talked like normal people, she'd told me about her struggles and stress, and I'd believed her. That conversation remained with me as an internal excuse for her behavior for the next several years.

There were constant requests for unpaid overtime, extra work, or favors. I did all of these with a sense of pride, for what man could refuse a woman in such need? It felt like we were a secret team, like I had a responsibility greater than those my coworkers held. Of course, I felt a little weird when a new intern quit because of *all the extra unpaid work.* I hadn't seen any of that, and I wondered: was she asking him for favors, too? Had it somehow been kept secret from me?

My confusion turned to bitter fury when I decided to leave at nine at night instead of staying until my extra work was done. I didn't go home—I visited a few bars she had mentioned over the years. At the fifth and final one, I found her.

I sat in my car and watched through the windows of the place. It was a high class establishment, and she stood laughing with a few girlfriends, a dainty drink in hand. Her dress was form-fitting and fantastic—this was not at all the tired and stressed single mom I'd been sold. It might have been crossing the line, but I knew her address from mail at work, and I drove by her place while she was out. The lights were on and someone was home.

I knocked.

The door swung open a minute later to reveal a haggard thirty-something man and a cluster of screaming and boisterous children. ""Can I help you?""

""Oh, I'm sorry,"" I told him. ""I was looking for Lying Bitch. She told me to bring her some documents for tomorrow's presentation.""

""She's not here,"" he replied with a sigh. ""She's at work until late again.""

I could have told him then, but I didn't think it was my place at the time. Instead I made polite small talk until the truth came out: these were his kids. He had been a single father of five after their mother had died, and Lying Bitch was a supposed *stable and hard-working new wife* that I later noted had come around right after a large life insurance settlement.

Once I knew, her lies unraveled daily. After every single claim she made, I dug a little deeper, and I found that she did literally no work in any area of her life. Her dynasty was an invisible pyramid of secret overtime and personal favors; each man was separated from the others to ensure nobody would ever put two and two together. Her home life was nonexistent; she drank, partied, and went home with strangers under the guise of working late hours to support her new family.

And she utterly despised me once I slowly stopped accepting her requests. Rumors began circulating about me at the office, a promotion passed me over, and I kept ending up in the worst projects. She never said a single word to me directly, and the old me with the wool over his eyes would have just chalked it up to bad luck, but I knew. This woman was a demon of lies that sucked the life out of everyone around her.

But did she deserve to die?

I sat at my desk drinking coffee and going over and over her supposed crimes. Nothing she'd done was illegal in the strictest sense, and I could certainly destroy her life simply by shedding light on her pyramid of lies, but there were consequences to consider. First, that she had no real skills other than manipulation. If her life was torn to shreds, how would she support herself? Would she go through the long and arduous process of self-discovery and learning to stand on her own two feet, or would she just spin a new web? Second, she could likely take me down with her. There would be no hiding my identity if I approached multiple people and clued them in. I might even come off as a strange stalker.

As the days wore on and Tom and Jake observed her and began putting together a plan, I felt the decision slowly being made for me. If I was to spare her this fate, I needed to choose. The day of the planned assault, a direct conversation felt in order.

I entered her office with a binder casually in hand. ""Hey Lying Bitch, mind if we talk?""

""Sure,"" she said with a smile that I knew to be fake, but which was otherwise perfect. ""Sit.""

I sat.

She leaned slightly forward. ""What's up?""

Approaching what was really on my mind in a roundabout way, I said, ""I noticed I've been sort of stagnating where I'm at. My performance reviews have been very good, so I've been wondering if there's anything else I can do to get back on top.""

Sighing, she leaned back against her chair. ""I didn't want to say anything, but you haven't exactly been a team player lately. People are starting to talk about it.""

Suppressing an inner rush of anger, I put on a politely confused face. ""Really? What's the problem? I've done everything officially asked of me.""

""Ah, a real workplace is a bit more than official,"" she explained. ""Official projects are just the minimum to get by. To really be part of the team, you have to take on more than just the minimum.""

I faked my best understanding nod. ""I *was* doing that my first few years here.""

""You were,"" she responded, leaning forward again. ""What changed?""

I couldn't help it. ""When I was working unpaid overtime one night, I went home to get something, and I saw your car at a bar. You were in there drinking.""

To her credit, her face didn't twitch a bit. ""What I do in my personal time is none of your business. I hope that's all you did, or I'll have no qualms about informing HR that you're harassing me.""

""Harassing you?"" My anger mixed with amusement. She was an expert predator in the ecosystem in which she had evolved, but I had a secret advantage. Real violence cut through bullshit red tape and pathetic reputation games. ""Not at all, Lying Bitch. I just happen to know what really goes on here. I've run into other guys doing unpaid overtime—which is against company policy by the way—and I even ran into your husband at the grocery store. Many things you say don't add up.""

Her mask finally fell away, and I saw pure evil there. She stood, came around her desk, and stood above me with flared eyes. ""Fine, dispense with the games. What do you want for your silence? Money? A promotion? Sex?""

I stared up in disgust. ""Seriously?"" I stood very slowly and moved toward her door, though my instincts told me leaving without making a deal was an extremely dangerous idea. The kind of person Lying Bitch truly was seemed to run on amoral manipulation and exchanges. She was rather attractive, but something about *that* option felt objectively wrong. A promotion would have been nice, but that would have just put me deeper under her thumb. ""Money.""

She lifted slightly, relieved in her own special way that I was playing ball. ""How much?""

What number seemed reasonable? ""Ten thousand dollars.""

She didn't flinch. Had my number been perfect, or should I have asked for more? Reaching down, she picked up the phone, and I watched as she faked perfect distress for her husband about a sudden financial need. I could hear his confused hurt and despair on the other side of the phone, but he did agree, and she hung up with a smile. ""You'll have your money tomorrow. I expect you'll keep your mouth shut.""

""I will,"" I said quietly, my decision made.

It was my turn to go to the bar. Inviting out a few colleagues from work, we sat, drank, and commiserated over the endless hours working with little reward under Lying Bitch. None outright revealed what she was doing to each of them; I marveled at how well our culture had trained us to be polite and loyal to the point of self-enslavement. These were decent men; good men. They deserved to be free and treated with respect.

Fancying myself their secret liberator—for, in many ways, I was—I soared high on the power of life and death. I was hilarious, compassionate, and the center of attention. I was no longer beat down, frustrated, and stressed, and they could sense it. Determined to make my positivity infectious, I grew ever more boisterous and over-the-top, and we ended the night by invading a karaoke bar and having the best office outing of all time.

We slunk back into work the next morning exhausted and haggard, for not one of us had gone home. We'd greeted the sunrise at a diner, ate waffles and pancakes, and headed into the office as a caravan of still-drunk fools intent on facing the music together.

But the music never came, and neither did Lying Bitch.

Around noon—after we'd had ample time to up coffee and down painkillers—the regional VP arrived with a grief counselor in tow. It seemed that Lying Bitch had accidentally driven herself over the corner of a nearby bridge on the way home; the VP did not mention that she had been drinking at a bar. It was a tragic accident, the company would make sure to take care of her family, and, most importantly, we all had the day off.

I drifted home and lay on the couch as the hours blurred together. Part of me was triumphant and grinning unseen, but part of me was horrified that I'd been right: the planned beating had instead ended in death a second time. I wasn't going to meet with Tom and Jake for another three weeks, but I knew I would be demanding the full story of what happened from them. How did roughing someone up turn into driving them off a bridge?

At the time, I still felt guilt. That gnawing chill compelled me to return to her husband's house, and I stood at the door and offered my condolences. He gravely accepted them, but he also seemed relieved and rested. Behind him, I saw a nanny taking care of the kids, and I understood: either the company benefits or a second life insurance payout had rescued this family from the hole their embezzling new mother figure had dug underneath them.

Free of guilt, I took my leave. Death had not been a tragedy for anyone in that woman's life. Violence had spiked in out of the wilds of human experience with surgical aim and removed a tumor that had grown on the suffocating structure of rules and customs we'd collectively built in a vain attempt to keep out the dangers of nature. Rather than protection, we had built only a framework for imprisonment and parasites.

There was something bigger in what Tom, Jake, and I were doing. I had to think on it.

The weeks rolled by as I dealt with the intense stress and let it flow out of me.

I was given her old job. After that grand night out, the guys universally threw their support behind me to replace her, and the regional VP couldn't give a shit either way. I was in—and I found it strange that twice death had been rewarded with immediately increased status. This structure we lived in was cold and impersonal to the extreme.

Without the need for the staff to secretly and constantly overwork, our office productivity and morale rose significantly. *Actually doing my job* made it easier for my men to do theirs—what a concept! By the time my meeting with Tom and Jake approached, I had nothing but contempt for the memory of Lying Bitch.

But I still wanted to know what happened.

Beers in hand, we sat at the back of a new hole-in-the-wall bar and Tom explained. ""Well, we caught her outside and alone as planned, but she managed to rip off both our ski masks. Once she saw our faces, we knew we were in trouble, and she was a vicious biter. One thing led to another, and she got knocked out pretty hard. Jake said we had to get rid of her since she'd seen our faces, and we came up with the plan to drive her off the bridge. We didn't want to do it—it just got out of hand.""

It made sense, at least in our already-twisted perspectives. Jake simply nodded along to this explanation, his expression neutral. I watched his face as Tom spoke, but not a single reaction was evident. At that point, I was beginning to suspect something darker—but I was still enamored of our new strength.

It was also our turn to assault Jake's boss. The quiet and calm threat in our companion's eyes brooked no argument. It was up to Tom and I to make it happen, and I honestly thought I would have the chance to make this third attack *not* end in murder.

I also honestly thought it would be the last.

1. I understand GPA is a big thing anywhere. And that's being fixed currently and will be above a 3.0 by next autumn. 

2. I also know companies like clubs. So I already am in one right now and will do the design team this fall. 


Ok. Now that were aquatinted. I'm from Ohio. However, due to preferences would want to work at the west coast (but am going to apply for internships and later jobs nation wide). I'm a freshman going into Sophomore year and want to cement an internship there (or anywhere for the matter) for next summer. But I don't know how these things work. So here are my questions.


1. I know that some engineering fields require the PE exam for some jobs. How does that work for Mechanical and does it differ by state? 

2. Are certain companies ok with hiring interns from different states? If they do what happens to housing? 

3. Which companies are best for these types of interns? (Any thing around the west -specifically the Seattle area- or just in general is cool). 

4. Any tips in general about co-ops/ internships you might like to add. 


*I think I did a good job fixing the mess that was the other thread. Thanks the /u/dusttheking who still replied advice to it anyway. And /u/BadChicken47 for telling me it doesn't make sense. For it did in my head and I would have just went with it.*"

She covered it up with a rock so no one would fall into it. She and my brother didn't think it was necessary to tell me or my father, so today while mowing the lawn, we came upon it.

The hole itself is about eight inches in diameter at the surface and a foot and a half in diameter at the final depth. It's a foot to a foot and a half deep. The hole is about forty to fifty feet away from the creek that runs around our property. My dad's insurance company doesn't care about it since it's still small after seven months.

What I thought we should do is just plug up the hole with concrete and then come back to it in a couple months in case the weight of the concrete compresses the voids left in the soil, then fill it up with some more concrete.

My dad thinks we should just fill it up with soil and then create an artificial grading with a dense grass surface, so the the groundwater travels over this new surface down to the creek, rather than going through the ground and causing more erosion.

His other (more expensive) idea is to dig up the hole or use colored water to figure where it's draining. Then he wants to plug the drain up with concrete and fill the hole with dirt.

Are any of these ideas a good solution or is there something else that we should do? I'm starting my internship in a week and a half, so he'd like to get this fixed by then."

I'm not sure how much you all care for stories, but you're gonna get one if you keep reading.  If you just want to see my potential build and don't care for the story, just skip to the end. 

So I'll start by admitting that I am a console owner, hardcore Xbox 360 mostly.  I do not however believe that I am, nor ever have been, a peasant.  I've always known that PCs are superior, it was just the knowledge, price, and social barrier that prevented me from going PC.  Price barrier because to me, $400-500 all at once seemed out of my price range, even though it really wasn't.  

Fast forward to today.  I'm now a 19 year old out of his first year of college and I even scored an internship.  I'm studying electrical engineering and I've been thinking for a while of building my own PC.  

Something I've always prided myself on is buying smartly and long-term.  So, with the help of a very techy friend and a near blank check (lets call him Gabe) I cobbled together the parts list for a super gaming PC for under $2,000

Now I see the majority of you rolling your eyes and some of you even screaming at your monitors.  Let me explain my price range.  

Here's how I see it:  I could piece together a mid-range gaming PC for $400-500 or even a pretty good one for ~$700, but I feel like such a device would only be good for ultra (graphics that is) gaming for a few years, maybe 3 or so.  My philosophy is since I have a job and can easily foot the bill, I can bite the bullet now and shell out a good chunk of cash and get an ultra system that will hold its power into the foreseeable future, my thought is at least 5-6+ years.  After that, the computer could still easily hold its own as a powerful home PC that I could use as a general desktop or even serve for my house, if the need arises.  

At the same time however, I'm very scared to spend so much money at once on a new project.  I've owned a Surface 3 for a year now and I really like PC gaming and I've been a PC gamer casually for about as long as I've been a console gamer.

-------------------------------------------------------------

tl;dr: I'm confused how to get into the graphically impressive high end of PC gaming and I think my build may be too expensive, even for an ultra-high end gaming computer

I worked largely alone, as it was a project they reserved for mostly student interns. After my internship ended, I really wasn’t sure what to expect going into the job market as I had very little experience in the IT industry. I had two offers around the same time – a software dev role working on a web application and a QA position. After thinking about it for a really long time, I chose the QA position because I was told that it would be mostly writing automation scripts and building testing frameworks. Also, I really liked the team and the environment.  
Several weeks later, it honestly looks like at least 75% of my job will consist of manual black box testing. 
I’m not whining about doing grunt work. The problem is that I feel like my skills are going to deteriorate if I’m constantly doing nothing but clicking buttons and sending emails. I eventually want to be a good software engineer, architect, startup founder, etc.  
I do take part of the blame for being in this predicament, since I should have known what a QA role entails. That being said, I was under the impression I’d be doing a lot more programming. 
I’m debating between toughing it out for a year so at least I have some experience to put down on my resume, versus looking for a new job ASAP. Obviously, I’m aware of how difficult it’s going to be to explain why I'm leaving my first software role but it’s not impossible and I have the luxury of time since I’m still employed. 

**Reasons to leave:** 

* I don’t waste a year doing something I don’t enjoy as much. I could actually be programming and building my skills. This, to me, is super important. 

* I don’t get “pigeonholed” into QA roles for the rest of my career. If I leave in a few years, I might be back at square one as a junior dev

**Reasons to stay for about a year:** 

* Leaving first software job after a couple of months looks terrible. I’m going to feel like I’ve failed. 

* I’ve only been here for a few weeks, and who knows, it might get better. I might have more time to actually write automation code. 

* I actually have something to put on my resume instead, well, nothing.

Mainly my best friend J. So we decided to go on a road trip the weekend after our last day of school. She recently got a car and so did I for my 18th birthday. It was a little old but I'd take whatever I can get. 

We decided to take seperate cars because, we both just got it and were pretty excited to drive. It was stupid I know but I really love being on the wheel and so does she so we figured we just take seperate cars. Looking back, I wish we just stayed in one car. 

So we start driving, I'm following J obviously because she had the gps. We were going out into the country to look for barns and stuff. We were really into horse back riding. I don't even know where were exactly going. All I know is she knows the way and I'm just following behind her. I'm just talking to her on the phone on my lap. 

It was getting dark, probably about 9:30pm. She said the gps is fucking up and it's not working. Like it's not showing her the roads and stuff anymore. I figured the gps hasn't been updated, that's what happens to my dad when we go on trips. The gps doesn't get updated so it doesnt know the certain roads or some shit, so we get lost a lot. (or maybe no signal?) That's exactly what's happening right now. 

We get on a sort of isolated road, kind of like a dirt road with trees and shit to the right and left of it. I don't know how we got from the highway to the forest. Now were actually lost. 

""Okay seriously you're not allowed to plan trips anymore look at where we are"" 

I say through the phone and she says sorry and to just keep following her. 

""This gps is dumb nothing is showing wheres the roads""

Ugh. We keep driving and we joke about the whole situation. It's actually nice driving through this area, it's quiet and were literally the only people here. We talk over the phone, its about 10 now and still no highway or anything. I notice my gas is on empty, fuck.

""Do you still have gas because mine is empty now."" I tell her on the phone, seriously this is annoying now wtf.

""That's your fault you didn't get gas before we left""

Well she didn't tell me it was going to take us hours and that we were gonna get lost. She tells me to get off and get in her car and we'll just get mine towed. I get out my car and she starts driving away. Seriously. 

""Bitch stop playing its scary out here.""

I say over the phone. She laughs and she gets out the car. She's fairly far away from me but close enough to where I can still see her. She has always been a jokester but this is not the time to play around. 

""Come on hurry!""

I start walking towards her and flash my middle finger. Seriously she plays too much. 

""Run you're taking too long.""

""No you the one who decided to drive away so you gonna have to wait I'm tired""

I say to her and I walk slower to mess with her. I'm still talking to her on the phone and also yelling out my words. We laugh and talk as I'm walking up to her and she suddenly gets quiet and froze. 

I ask her what's wrong and shit, and she just stares at me. This is getting kinda creepy now. 

""Seriously what's wrong what are you looking at?""

I say on the phone and she is just silent. Then I hear footsteps behind me, I was just about to turn around when J says to me on the phone

""Dont turn around, dont fucking turn around just keep walking. Walk normally.""

That's when I realize she wasn't looking at me, she was lookig just behind me. Somebody was following me. And the hairs on my body stood up. J tells me to keep talking and act like nothing's happening so I try my best to be all loud and shit and laughing and all that. 

""Haha yeah haha you so funny""

We basically pretend like we didn't notice whoever was following me. I'm still listening to whoever was behind me and all of a sudden I hear knives being rubbed together. You know like how chefs do when they have two knives they slice it together kinda sharpening it. (sorry I'm not good at describing things) 

We continue acting through the situation and J tells me on the phone:

""Just to let you know, there are four people behind you, about 5 steps behind with big ass knives. Two guys and two girls. I'm going to open the passenger side of the car and I will get in the car and watch on the rear view mirror. When I say go, run okay. Don't look behind you just run.""

I'm having goosebumps at this point. literally shaking with fear. I try my best to sound cheerful and all, I'm close to the car anyway. J gets in the car and opens the passenger side. I walk a little faster and I hear the steps behind me become faster too. 

I'm not the smartest cookie but I think it's safe to say that these psycho's behind me already knows that I know they're behind me. J starts counting...

""1,2, ready okay run. 3!""

I RAAAAAN. I DIDNT EVEN SCREAM OR SAY ANYTHING I JUST RAN AS FAST AS I CAN ALL I CAN THINJ ABOUT IS JUMP IN THAT FUCKING CAR AND GET THE FUUUCK OUT OF THERE. THE MURDERERS BEHIND ME (yes murderers what else can they be) RUN AFTER ME TOO AND THEY SCREAM A HIGH OITCHED SCREAM I SWEAR THEY SOUND LIKE FUCKING BATS. I MAKE IT TO THE CAR I JUMP INTO THE SEAT AND SLAM MY FACE INTO J's SHOULDER AND SHE HITS THE GAS. I look back and I see one of the four hopelessly throw the knife on the ground. 

We were both crying at this point. I thanked her for everything, if she let me turn the fuck around I'd be dead right now. She truly is the best friend ever. We drive to the gas station we see and told the guard at the store what just happened and he said he'll handle it. 

That shit is the scariest thing that has ever happened to me ever! Wtf. 

Thank you J for not leaving me! 
(seriously though she could've got in the car and bolted out of there but instead she saved me. true friend.) 
(my car got towed the following day. the cops said they never saw anyone but did see several foot prints on the side of the road that's muddy. my car has a big scratch on the side of it.)"
4l3nq9,1,2016-05-26,Double major or graduate a year early?,genekellypunk,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4l3nq9/double_major_or_graduate_a_year_early/,"I've been looking for some advice online for this, but I'd really like some advice that directly applies to my situation.  

I will be a sophomore this upcoming fall.  Right now, I am majoring in Philosophy and minoring in Democracy and Justice Studies (sort of like PoliSci).  My initial plan was to graduate in three years, move onto law school, and after that, grad school.  Right now, I'm split between two career paths: lawyer (prosecutor) or professor (philosophy).  

The other major I'm looking at is Creative Writing.  Hear me out.  I already have 2 out of the 12 required courses under my belt.  I'm looking at the rest of the courses, and I can seriously see myself enjoying each of them and succeeding in them.  I also figure that because I need extra classes to fulfill the 120 credit graduation requirement, why not just go for another major that would also help me in my many future years of schooling?  It would also be nice to stay an extra year and make more memories and experiences with my friends or maybe studying abroad; professionally, jobs and internships that could give me recommendations.  And of course I love and am pretty talented at reading and writing (otherwise I probably shouldn't be majoring in Philosophy in the first place lol).    

Please note that money is not necessarily a problem if the extra year really helps me and my chances at law/grad school, but it would obviously be nice to save a year's tuition/housing :) 

So should I graduate early in Philosophy or graduate in four years in Philosophy and Creative Writing?

Thank you for any helpful advice and comments!   "
4l3odr,2,2016-05-26,Is it an irrational fear or actual incompetence that hinders me?,ecamouse37,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4l3odr/is_it_an_irrational_fear_or_actual_incompetence/,"I have a poor self-image and part of me questions whether or not this is because, deep down, I know I am actually that pathetic. My low self-esteem is not just the result of physical insecurities but intellectual ones too, and it is really starting to take its toll.

I graduated college last May (English degree), and I haven't found work. Part of this is because I married a month after graduation and moved near my husband's military base. We only had the one car between us, so of course he had to take that to work, making my only option staying home. I did find an unpaid writing position to occupy my time, but that's all I've done.

Now, he is deployed, and the plan is that I can use the car and find work. The problem is that I am terrified. I finished college earlier than I expected and never did an internship as a result. . .(though let's be real, I avoided doing an internship at all costs because I was terrified of rejection or worse: failure on the job). I am not sure how I thought that fear would suddenly disappear when I graduated and had to go out in ""the real world.""

Before, I had excuses as to why I couldn't work, but now those excuses are gone; now being unemployed is all on me, and I can't stand the thought of being judged.

I already feel the pressures. I hate when my in-laws ask to talk, because I know what they are going to ask, ""What are you up to these days?"" ""Are you still writing those comic reviews?"" Eventually they are going to think I have no ambition, and that isn't the case... I have it, I just don't think I have the skill to achieve my dreams. 

Yeah, I have my bachelor's degree, but I don't think it means shit. I feel like a cheater. I don't think I deserve to call myself a college grad. I didn't do badly in college on paper. My GPA says I ""earned"" a 3.6. That's average. Nothing special. And sure, for some reason my professors gave me a few compliments on my writing, but I honestly feel like they are fucking liars. I have been trying to pick writing samples from my college papers, and they are all trash. I can't believe that my professors didn't fail me. Why the fuck did they say I could do this? Why did they mislead me into thinking I could write well when I all I see is generic ideas and terrible grammar? How could I ever explain that to my family? My friends? I've always put up this front that I am strong. Confident. But that couldn't be further from the truth.

My husband knows this... My self-esteem issues are no secret to him, but he doesn't know how to help me. He doesn't understand me, and sometimes opening up to him makes things worse. He makes me feel crazy and stupid for feeling so down about myself. I know he doesn't mean to, but it makes expressing myself impossible.

I still have one crutch: where we live. It's a small town that doesn't have many job options, especially those in the publishing industry, which is what I'd like to have. So, part of me is relieved because there's another excuse. I can't put myself out there because there aren't any local opportunities. I can continue to hide and not be rejected for being too dumb and inexperienced.

There is one position I found locally (literally just before posting this) that could be a stepping stone in the right direction. . . but as soon as I saw it my stomach dropped. I was both happy and scared shitless. How could I not apply? What excuse could I possible use? I have a car. It's local. It's in right field. Yeah, I don't have a year of experience, but at least they aren't asking for three plus like some of these other non-local job ads. 

I am going to make myself try . . . but even if I manage to write a decent cover letter, finish my resume, and find okay writing samples, there is the interview. And how the fuck am I supposed to sell myself to them when I don't believe in what I'm selling?

The last time I did something out of my comfort zone it all crashed down around me. It was when I just started college. I wanted to leave retail and move up in the world. I thought I could be a bank teller. I apparently had a convincing resume. I did the phone interview, and then I was interviewed by three hiring managers and beat out the twelve other candidates. And of course once I got the job, my insecurities got the best of me. I felt young. Inexperienced. Like I didn't belong. I couldn't remember everything I needed to. I could do the stupid tests for training, easily. But it was like my experience with school. Know it for the test and poof. It disappears and then you're a jackass again.

I'd come home crying to my husband (then boyfriend). I couldn't take being in an environment that challenged me and my shortcomings, so after three months of emotional torture, I put in my two weeks and went back to the same retail job. Where I felt safe. 

Sometimes, I wish I had never tried for that banking job. It killed any confidence I had. It has also made me wondered if I peaked in high school and if I can never amount to anything other than sales associate (because, yes, I turned down promotions there too because I feared the responsibility and failure).

I always think I am inadequate. I don't consider myself knowledgeable in any subject, not even the one I studied for four years. When will this shit stop? When will I feel ready for anything? I always feel that I have to prep for whatever it is I want to do. Even going to yoga makes me freak out and think that I have to practice in private before I dare try anything in public. 

I am so tired of being scared. How do people mange shit like this? What does it feel like to believe in yourself? When will I?

I'm beginning to study for my GRE's so I can take it this Septemeber. I'm currently a computer engineering major with internship (networking) and research experience. I'll be graduating this upcoming Dec 2016. I want to apply to apply to Cornell's MS Systems Engineering (Online) program as well as Columbia's CVN program for their Industrial Engineering (System's Engineering Concentration) degree. 

I've submitted a post already in /r/GRE about studying for the GRE, but my main questions center around my chances for acceptance. I'll have a 3.38 before entering this Fall Semester, but I'm confident after a course retake, I'll be at a 3.48 when I'm done with next semester. 

However, if I apply to Cornell or Columbia in the Fall, I'll be submitting my application with a 3.38. Columbia has rolling admissions so should I wait until after my semester finishes and my hopefully increased GPA?

I know my first concern should be doing well on the GRE and although its intimidating right now, I'm going to put the time and effort in studying and doing well. Both these programs would be amazing for me as I do attend a public state university.

So my questions are:

1. Should I wait to apply after my GPA increase
2. What are my chances to getting into these programs if I submit my application with the lower GPA. 
3. Any GRE tips? Resources you recommend?

Any feedback or insight is greatly appreciated. I'm grateful there's a Reddit community for these types of things. As I mentioned in a previous post on r/GRE, many of my friends aren't going to grad school so I don't have many people to ask for advice. "
4l3vwe,3,2016-05-26,What IS the difference between a co-op program like Mac's or an internship? (engineering),Cgrrp,McMaster,https://www.reddit.com/r/McMaster/comments/4l3vwe/what_is_the_difference_between_a_coop_program/,"I know this sounds like something I could easily google but I keep getting so many conflicting or contradicting answers from different sources.

Is it just easier to get a placement at a school with a co-op program as opposed to figuring it all out yourself to get an internship? This was the original idea I was getting but then I hear people say it's difficult to get a summer co-op placement and some people have to do a year long co-op placement. At this point I wonder what advantage it gives you over a school without a co-op program where you can just get an internship yourself. At Queen's, the only other school I'm still considering at this point, I've heard that it is not that hard to get an internship for the QUIP program (the 12-16 month internship after 2nd or 3rd year) due to the fact that not many of the students choose to do it. The disadvantage would be that you graduate a whole year later but then you might have to do that at Mac anyways?

I hear it's hard to get a summer internship (at a school without co-op) which is what most people want, but then I hear from some people that it's also hard to get a summer co-op placement at Mac.

Since I'm already posting this, feel free to throw in any other opinions on Mac vs. Queens for somebody who's interested in EE and having some last minute confusion about which school to go to. "
4l3w5m,74,2016-05-26,Old printer versus flash drive.,Rockeye_,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4l3w5m/old_printer_versus_flash_drive/,"First post. I signed up to Reddit to post this because it's the first TFTS-worthy story I've experienced since I found this sub. 

In our office there's this one somewhat old and cheap multi-function printer that is clearly not sufficient for the jobs we use it for. This one poor intern has to stand over it methodically laying down page after page of what look to me like scribbles and doodles and waiting 15-20 seconds for each page to scan whenever $Manager wants one of his sets of handwritten meeting notes digitized. He always has his phone out during this 'workflow' so maybe not 'poor intern' though.

Luckily I don't get bothered about printers very often. But when the intern's ""workflow"" suddenly failed, I was the closest thing to pass for tech support available. Here we go.

&gt; $Boss: ""$Rockeye, help $Intern with the printer. It's acting up again.""    
&gt; $Intern: ""It was working yesterday, I'm doing it the same way. Don't know what's wrong.""    
&gt; $Me: $Okay, well, what's the error code?    
&gt; $Intern: ""Kay, lemme do it again."" *Plugs in flash drive. Hits scan. Printer beeps irately.* ""[Some error code].""

I find the manual, luckily available on the internet, look through and the ever so descriptive cause listed for the code is 'Bad USB device.' Simple enough.

&gt; $Me: ""That error code means the flash drive is bad, according to the manual.""    
&gt; $Intern: ""What, that's impossible, I've been using this flash drive for months and it's never given me trouble. It's still working on the computers too.""    
&gt; $Me: ""Well, let's try it on my laptop...""

Troubleshooting ensues. The flash drive works with all manner of things it's supposed to work on. The USB pins aren't bent out of shape nor corroded at all as far as I can tell. I try using a different flash drive in the printer and BEEP! Same error code.

At this point I'm thinking the printer might have finally developed another irreversible 'idiosyncrasy,' and finally one that will convince $Boss to toss it. But I know he'll be sore if I don't try a little harder. So I check for driver updates (none), try a few more borrowed flash drives (which all give the same error), do some online research that doesn't turn up anything.

I make the report to $Boss that we're just going to have to deal with it and he gets in a huff about how he needs those meeting notes darn it. I propose a new printer. He tells me to find one that has good reviews and X and Y features and order it by end of day, get expedited shipping, the company will pay me back. (I got that in writing, learned from the best.)

I do some more research, wanting to make the most of the opportunity, but I also had a sort of morbid curiosity about the old one, so I kept looking at that too. I eventually found that flash drive file systems sometimes disagree with certain older printers now that they're not necessarily all using the same file system as a decade ago.

I call $Intern and ask if he happened to click a button labelled 'format' when using that drive.

&gt; $Intern: ""Uh, no, it's brand new.""    
&gt; $Me: ""Wait, I thought you said you've been using it for months and you've never had any trouble?""    
&gt; $Intern: ""No, this one's new, the 8 gig one wasn't enough for all the files $Boss wants on here anymore.""

This flash drive has a shiny '16GB' label. I give him a look but I know he won't take the lesson that 'bought yesterday' is not 'had it for months' so I don't bother saying it.

&gt; $Me: ""Well, let me reformat it, see if that's the problem.""    
&gt; $Intern: ""What?! Isn't reformatting, like, wiping it clean?""    
&gt; $Me: ""Yeah, but I'll back everything up first, don't worry.""

So I do some other work while waiting for nine point something gigs of $Boss's ever-growing archive of miscellany to copy over, then reformat the USB drive to exFAT.

It doesn't work. So I revert the flash drive to factory settings and start copying all the junk back onto it. I order the new printer. I get the company check for it as promised. I got the task of setting it up including SMTP etc, which took maybe half an hour, and giving tutorials for basic tasks to everyone, which didn't.

$Intern comes up to me a few days later rather confused, saying the old flash drive *still works* on the old printer. I check the formatting... Factory default already. I'm about to give up and put it out of my head forever, when I notice the shiny red '8GB'...

I ask around the office for another eight gig flash drive to borrow, find one, and lo and behold *that* works with the old printer too.

I'm still confused for a while longer but eventually realize that the 8GB drive was formatted in FAT32, not exFAT, ~~since eight gigs is the maximum size allowed by FAT32~~ maybe because it was older, or some other arbitrary manufacturer decision. And the old printer was choking because it refused to recognize the exFAT format. 

I never did figure out the strange faint horizontal lines that only appeared on documents printed between 3:30 and 3:45 or so, though.


TL;DR ""Bad USB drive"" is just too big for an old printer to handle.

Edited no less than ~~four~~ ~~eight~~ eleven times for formatting, spelling, misplaced words, grammar."

All the interns were assigned to a different mentor and I got put with a guy from the IT department since it was my major. He was probably the most depressed mentor in the company and would constantly whine about the lack of windows and red tape (totally justified but he's been there 15 years). 

After about three weeks of working together I noticed that he referred to cupcakes as ""muffins"" for like the third time. I was feeling a little loose (as much as you can in a company that requires a 7 year background check) because it was casual Friday. In a desperate attempt to take a break from his depression and IT architecture planning I blurted out, ""Can Canadians distinguish between muffins and cupcakes?!"" His reaction was pretty neutral and it's hard to read the emotions of really analytical people in general.

Come Monday morning he sets up a meeting for 9am. Our first surprise topic of discussion: do I have a problem with people of other nationalities. 

Needless to say our working relationship was awkward after that. After my ten weeks I did not receive a letter of recommendation despite being a reliable employee and embracing the corporate culture.  

Just to clarify: I'm not some racist, nationalist who makes fun of friendly neighboring countries that more or less have the same culture. 

Edit for further clarification: I never confirmed with 100% certainty it was a cultural thing. I asked my neighbors who were from Canada shortly after this event. The husband answered very ecstatically, ""yes! my mother does the same thing."" Of course this is anecdotal evidence and does not prove my theory. I kinda rolled the dice and was hoping the good reddit community would confirm my previous theory.  "

So here is my situation. I do not have the funds to buy a laptop now but have been thinking about getting a credit card to buy one when I arrive and then after my first paycheck I can just pay the whole thing off. I would also like to start building some credit as I transition into full fledged adulthood. Is this a good idea? I have read the sidebar about credit cards but am still very nervous about making a leap like this. I have no idea what credit card I should choose and am a little lost about where to start. I really do need a laptop and will definitely have the funds within a month of purchasing the laptop. And if you have the time could I get pointed in the direction of a decent credit card or at least how to get started searching for one?

Thank you very much ahead of time. My parents are not active in my life and I am very much on my own so I have minimal knowledge about credit and how to get started. Thanks again!"

Perhaps a bit of an unusual request, but I'm working on my internship project. As a part of it, I need to demo my project in the form of a 2-minute video.

The video is done, except for the voice-over. I tried it myself, but I quickly found out my English is too bad/hard to understand for some people. That's why I'm looking for someone with a clear English or American voice that everyone can understand.

The script is around 20-25 lines long and is a summary of my project. It's a 'voice of god' style of voice over, and it does not need to be synced perfectly, making it quite an easy task I think.

I can provide the script, video and my own recording so you know exactly how I'd like it to be.

Is there anyone (preferably male, with a calm, clear voice) who could help me out here and quickly record this for me? It does not need to be perfect - if you could record it a few times quickly I'm sure I'll be edit a good take out of it. I think it'll cost you like 20 minutes.

What should I do to keep pace with the CS industry?",HuyTranQ,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4l4hg8/hi_reddit_developers_im_burning_out_fast_in_cs/,"Don't get me wrong, I still really love CS and want to be coding every day. Every thing is still smooth (I have GPA of 3.85 / 4 and next week, I'm going to be a Google intern in London, UK).

However, I'm burning out, especially, in the university part.

I'm a senior student of a university (well-known in my country but unknown to the rest of the world). There are some big problems with courses here. I don't like them anymore:

1. Teachers only attend classes to do their jobs and talk all day that nobody would listen to him/her. They don't care about the quality of their lectures. They just google some presentation slides and change the names of the lecturers and turn them into their own. They don't nurture their English communication neither so the accent is so awful that I can barely understand (English is not our mother tongue language). Furthermore, the final exam can include a section of 40% but that section is taught by nearly up to 10% duration of the course with a fast pace. 

2. (Nearly) Everybody cheats. I'll say again: Most of the students cheat in the exams. They can go to the toilet and use their smartphones to search and then go back. Some subjects allow laptop (but not communication) but in the end, they use Google Docs to list all answers for everyone during the exams. 

I'm exhausted due to lack of motivation and competition in courses at university. I may have failed 2 courses from the last semester due to this problem. My GPA may be down fast at this point. However, I just stop caring about fairness and GPA. All I care about is that I'm 21, I'm still young, I need to learn more, I need to do fast. I cannot burn out at this stage.

What should I do? A side project that helps me learning new things? A new part-time job to involve as much as I can in the software industry? Learning a course on coursera, udemy, edx? What to do to forget about those things in university and keep moving forward?"

I will probably need another year to finish my degree, though I have only a few classes left to take, with only one or two required to be CS. 

But holy shit, has the course load been punishing. I also have a knack for biting off more than I can chew, and it's gotten me into academic trouble once already. Lately I've gotten so upset with failure that I just give up and spiral into a depression. I let my stress and anxiety get the better of me this semester, and may have put my standing in the major at jeopardy. I feel like if I can't get a handle on my anxiety I'm not going to be able to get through another year. 

So I want to take a break from school, for a year or forever, and find work instead. Of course, my gpa is low, I have had no internships, and I have never been super connected to my professors or my peers (cause I suck so bad, haha). About the only thing I have going for me are personal and class projects. 

I realize there isn't much separating my situation from typical ""low gpa, no internships, halp"" posts (and I've read them, they're super helpful), except for that fact my graduation feels drawn out and indefinite. I sometimes worry I will not ever finish my degree, and wonder if I can start a career without one. 

What are my options? What are the employment prospects for someone who almost but didn't quite get a BS? Have these four years been a waste? I've learned a lot, I love CS, but maybe taking it at this institution was at a level too high for me to really keep up with. "

I share a deep affinity for story-telling and writing in general and my past prompts and posts have usually tried to demand a higher level of grammar, imagination, detail and literacy in the responses as I feel that's the best way to keep a story alive and fresh and prevent it from becoming stale or having either side decide they may as well just watch some porn.

I've been posting on DPP for a long time and today I am in the mood for something a bit more vanilla as I hope to engage a more diverse population of those individuals who frequent this lovely sub-reddit. I've been seeing some especially great prompts recently and want to make sure I'm not alienating anyone by requesting the same prompts/kinks.

**PROMPTS**

I've narrowed down my prompt ideas into separate categories, each with their own plot lines and twists and can incorporate other ideas as well and are all up for discussion!

**(1)NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR**

I've just moved in to town from the high powered life of New York City as an attorney working in Manhattan. I've grown tired of the constant hustle and am looking for a more small-town feel. I've gotten a job at the local law firm, a boutique operation specializing in real estate closings and is more in line with the slower pace I hope to find. You have been living in the small town of Paradise Springs your whole life and are intrigued at the new neighbor that you have. We spark a conversation and begin a slow and gentle courtship.

**(2)THE CO-WORKERS**

Similar premise to the above prompt, only we have been holding on to a work friendship for nearly three years now. Always amiable to one another, we never really felt any kind of emotional spark together, just a simple friendship between two people who understand each other. Perhaps one of us goes through a particularly harrowing time (i.e. a breakup, death in the family, etc.) and relies significantly on the other for support, where a new tenderness seems to blossom.

**(3)THE ANNIVERSARY**

This one would center around a pre-existing romantic relationship and be premised upon a one year anniversary, perhaps even six months or something of the like to mark a very special time in a budding new love affair.
Long-time lurker here and have finally decided to put my ""hat in the ring"" so to speak and try my hand at roleplaying and seeing if I can get any quality responses and to return the favor!



**(4)OFFICE AFFAIR**

The office affair with some kind of added twist. You could be my boss, peer, secretary or intern but we are both married and over time the sexy innuedos and flirting get taken further and further as we both realize we don't get what we want at home. But there's more to you than meets the eye. You decide what it is! 

**(5)THE ELEVATOR**

The woman in the elevator. Weeks have gone by and at least twice a week I ride the elevator up with you. It's the best 60 seconds of my day. My god you're gorgeous and you always give a crooked smile when I get on. And that little hair flip as you tell me to ""Have a nice day!"" when I get off the elevator knowing I've been checking you out. But one day the elevator is overly crowded and we are pushed against each other and I just can't stop myself from getting hard and you feel it against your ass...

**(6)INCEST**

Mom/sister drama queen. You're always the damsel in distress and every time you come to me over something petty and annoying but I know you rely on me quite heavily and I'm always there for you. But this time it's serious. You're going to have to hide out with me in my apartment for who knows how long. And that sexual tension that's been there since I was 12... surfaces and I have to try and deal with you getting a little too close when my mind is else where. 

I've written much longer prompts before that are more specific and if you wanted to check those out by all means please do. I really want to find a long term roleplay partner but I understand we have to be able to connect for that to happen. 

**KINKS**

My favorite kinks are: 

* Vanilla/Romance
* Anal
* Facials
* Blowjobs
* Cuddling
* Kissing

PM me and let me know what you'd like to try and if there is anything you would like to change or add to any of the prompts. I really enjoy having my partner have equal say in the set up and role of characters! 

I can't wait to talk to you soon"

4l53ww,2,2016-05-26,Does it hurt to apply to multiple positions for company internships?,nattokun,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/4l53ww/does_it_hurt_to_apply_to_multiple_positions_for/,"Last year, I attempted to apply to multiple companies like Riot, Blizzard, Gearbox, etc, and didn't get in any. Right now I am preparing to improve my resume and programming profile. The big question I have is does it hurt if I apply to multiple positions for game companies? For example, I applied for a TON of positions in Riot Games: Software engineer, Quality Assurance, Social and ESports, and general intern. Does this hurt my credentials when applying or do companies really not look at that?"
4l5usf,3,2016-05-26,Getting Back What I Forgot,theOmnipotentKiller,theOmnipotentJournal,https://www.reddit.com/r/theOmnipotentJournal/comments/4l5usf/getting_back_what_i_forgot/,"The most invaluable skill a person can possibly have in their skill set is being able to deep focused work for long periods of time.

A year ago I had taken this skill for granted and abused it with reckless abandon. I would set crazy goals for myself. 'Study for 12 hours today' 'Finish this long exercise in an hour' My friends would scoff at me when I proclaimed these to be my goals. Next day I would return after a session of deep work session and would laugh at their faces of disbelief.

Believe me those were the times. I would do inhumane amount of work without breaking a sweat. At the time it seemed so effortless half the time I thought that my friends were kidding about this. However, now I realize that wasn't the truth. This is a rare skill which I have seen only two other people among the hundreds in my institute.

Now you must be thinking, 'Well that's great. You must have used it well!' You would be only half right if you thought that. I used this exquisite ability to ace tests and, to an extent, even getting an IOAA medal. After (I think) 'over-using' this ability, I found myself getting easily addicted to any sort of pleasure. It is to my shame that I say that I would watch anime for 10-12 hours a day on a daily basis for 2-3 months. (This was before IOAA)

The glamour of movies, anime and books lies in the feeling of satisfaction you get from dedicating your entire focus/attention to it. According to me, all they do is simulate deep work. Yes. Using that two hours of cutting attention to submerge you in their devices to give you pleasure. Even the worst of movies are still pleasurable. Same case for anime and books. This largely because your brain rewards itself for 'working so hard'.

It is so easy to let your attention go stray. One moment you are reading a book, then the next you are checking your mail. You are walking down a road thinking about what you just ate for lunch. Human attention's expanse is formidable. In one moment, I can hold at least 3-4 thoughts. Right now, I am listening to Guns-n-Roses, thinking about my past, writing this post and imagining walking down a road thinking of chicken. Amazing!

Now imagine concentrating all of this in one direction. You can produce a gem! Blacksmiths, artists, musicians, any form of art/skill use this weapon to create heavenly treasures. That power is with all of us. But what we need is a channel which is sufficiently strong to hold all that power in one place.

The early 2016 debacle (as I will call it now) is a byproduct of me losing sight of this skill. The Internet. Damn you. A powerful and invaluable tool. Initially I used it for consuming vast amounts of knowledge but somewhere down the line it started latching onto my attention. Internet is a crack in the armor of deep work. I am not blaming the entire Internet for it. Anime, Reddit, Email were the main perpetrators of my destruction. The college admission process nearly obliterated my ability to focus because of constant email refreshing. The Slot Machine phenomena as mentioned in the article I previously posted.

However, towards the end I started cutting them off. After IOAA, I completely cutoff IOAA. At the start of the March, my use of Reddit became inconsiderable. Email remained the problem. A new distraction popped up in the midst of this cleansing- Online Articles. My thirst for knowledge became my undoing. Almost Ironic. I started spending hours every day reading articles related to a multitude of topics. I learnt a lot. My perspective has become much better. However, it came at a cost.

The question for me now is- was it worth it? The answer is Yes it was.

My parents will most certainly differ on this view. Yet, I find my new compass in life is a huge contribution towards my future. Those few months broke away my point of view from my mind to my body to my family to my city to my state to my country to my continent to the Earth to Humanity. At each step of that ladder I have learnt to reinterpret the significance of events and knowledge. The feeling of being a fleeting human passing through space-time has put value into my existence. Because I know in what direction I have to move.

That in itself is powerful. One argument that stands is I could have learnt to do this later. How long can a man stay ignorant? In my case, one of the few things I detest the most is ignorance. Knowing but not accepting is the biggest crime for myself.

Yet I committed that crime. Yes, I did on multiple occasions in the past. All that time watching anime, studying for exams, there was a certain amount of ignorance floating in my mind. For which, I have paid a great price. My self-confidence, my parent's faith in me, my mental stability have paid that price. I am weirdly happy that this happened. In those moments in past, when I briefly confronted my ignorance I told myself in the mirror, ""I hope you pay for this in the future."" Well Past Me you can be happy now that these negative hopes of yours have been realized.

These past few months when I look at the mirror, the man who stands there is the Omnipotent Killer. He is not me. He is from the future. Albeit a few nanoseconds in the future. All actions I take. But wait, who is this I? It's me, his mind. Sitting in my humble abode at the throne of the body, every decision I make affects the man standing and smiling at me from across the mirror. It is my duty to keep his smile alive. His self-discipline, self-confidence, faith in self all stem from me. He is a human I have to service.
Haha the ubiquitous love for everything. The idea seems like it has come right out of a fairy tale. Yet I find myself being pulled closer and closer to it day by day. The pleasure of giving your love to someone or something is liberating. So love everything! It sounds so nice on paper. This idea had knocked on my doors 2 months ago when Tina, the danish author, told me of how much she loves her laptop, her TV, her carpet, her table, her house, her daughter. I thought she was joking, but now I am seeing sense. An idea just doesn't disseminate into your mind in a go. It has to be persistent. It has to knock your doors every day. As hard as it can. Until you hear its sound and let it in. For me this persistent knocking was brought on by SS, and some authors I follow. This is something I learnt from my Stanford interviewer. When I had asked him how had Stanford changed him, he said spending years in that environment led to him to start thinking in that way. The power of that sentence dawns on me now.

The idea for this post sparked in my mind last night. My father offered me an opportunity to intern at a prominent company. After being dumbfounded for a moment, I protested that I have no knowledge or skills that can help that company. Then my father says that I will be preparing a Balance Sheet for that company. Having no background in Accountancy, I felt that it was a huge task being handed to me. So seconds later, I open up MIT's Introduction to Accountancy online course and start studying. 9 pm turned to 10 pm and soon it was 1 am, I perfectly understood what is a Balance Sheet. Not only that I also learned that accountancy has tons of fancy terms for simple things. I am no God, I completed only the about a month of work in those 4 hours. However, deep work had finally found me after an eternity.
The exhilaration of learning something completely new at super speeds is like no other. Pushing myself to my limit, I harnessed my advanced reading speed, typing speed, ability to understand and memorization techniques. That was a complete session of deep work for my mind. At the end I realized, just because I willed it I could enter a deep work session. That's a scarily powerful ability. So I set it to use again today. After finishing the beginner course in SQL in an hour, I started writing this post. I haven't switched the tab a single time. Haven't looked away from the screen for more than a second. That is deep work. No distraction. External or Mental.

This power had gone into dormancy because of my ignorance. But never again. I have learnt my lesson."
4l5z0g,6,2016-05-26,"Sharing my story about my recent breakup with a narc and being stalked by his ex-- really long, sorry!",betrayedandlost12345,NarcissisticAbuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/4l5z0g/sharing_my_story_about_my_recent_breakup_with_a/,"I was with my ex for a little over a year and a half. When we first met I thought I had finally met my perfect match. We had all this crazy stuff in common—big stuff and small things. He told me within a month that he loved me and that he would marry me when the time was right. I thought he was my soul mate and that it was going so fast because truly what we shared was special. Of course, about a month in I also realized he had an unhappy ex-gf. She lived halfway across the country and he was maintaining a friendship with her. When she called me at work and hung up, I asked him to stop talking to her. He said he would but he didn’t block her so I’d see that she was emailing and sending FB messages and even birthday cards and love letters. 

After dating for about five months he was going to move in to my place for a month before going out of town for a summer internship. He had a “job interview” and when he came back he dumped me saying that he was afraid he loved me too much and that it would cause him to give up some of his professional goals. I begged him not to do it and we got back together. Of course I later found out that the “job interview” was his ex flying him out to  her city so he could drive her to our town where she had found a job and was taking over the sublet on his apartment so he could move in with me. When he dumped me and I kicked him out he went to stay with her. And while we were deciding to get back together and I was making him wait a little while to move back in, he was staying with her. I assume he was having sex with both of us during that time.

Over the summer, I moved into a new house which we had signed a lease for together. That very week when we were hanging pictures and selecting curtains together, I started getting calls and text messages on my cell phone. She must have gotten it by searching his phone when they were sleeping together. It was his ex saying he was cheating on me. I assumed she was lying to try to push me away from him because she was jealous. He reinforced that. He told her to knock it off and for a while it worked.

Then we celebrated our one-year anniversary. It was the week of Thanksgiving and he spent it with my family. He took advantage of a Black Friday promotion and got a new cell phone and we added him to our family plan so he could save money. We went out for a fancy dinner for the anniversary. He was sentimental and insisted on saving the anniversary card from the restaurant. That night I got a voicemail and text messages. Ex-gf called to say she knew he was with me and my family for Thanksgiving and that I was going to his family for Christmas. She said I was ugly, stupid, boring, and he was only with me for sex. That he didn’t love me and never would. 

He went with me to the police to report her for harassment. We talked to the police separately. He told me that a restraining order was unnecessary and it would probably go away. She was just an entitled spoiled brat he said. She was just very controlling and used to check his phone and complain about what he wore. We decided not to change my phone number. The police didn’t seem to take it very seriously but apparently they called her and told her to knock it off. In the meantime, for the first time he tells me that this has happened to him in three past relationships (where an ex stalks the new gf) and so he has it on good authority that leaving it alone is best. At the time I thought it was probably immaturity and a quirk in his culture, and I didn’t see it as a red flag. I loved him so much that I thought of course he’s hard to let go of, I’d be upset too. 

I found a listing for ex-gf online that listed his previous address as her address. The first time I asked him about it he said she had used it as a mailing address at one point. Then I asked him who took over his sublet. A guy from grad school he said. I asked again and it was “some Chinese guy”. I asked if he could show me messages to prove it and he said he could. I didn’t ask to see them because I wanted to be a good partner.

After Christmas is when he started withdrawing. The person who used to cry if I was upset began ignoring me. He used to text me all the time, but now he’d go an entire day without checking in. He was just busy as a grad student, it’s just a phase he said. I need to be more understanding and independent. I’m being dramatic and making small things into big things. He makes so many sacrifices for me like going to a movie when he wouldn’t otherwise go. Isn’t this enough? This is how he demonstrates his love. And of course he doesn’t comfort me when I’m upset, since obviously it didn’t work in the past he is trying a new strategy. And it doesn’t inspire love in him anyway when I’m upset.

I start going to therapy because I think I have trust issues. I can’t get over his ex-gf and that he dumped me that time. I want to be a good partner and I am being too needy. I’m jealous about him teaching Zumba because I’m convinced he’s ignoring me and flirting with other women. I agonize in my journal about whether he’s making me happy or not and why am I upset all the time.

Then I see the email from ex-gf to him asking about his love language, saying how much she loves and misses him. And worse I see that he has responded. I confront him about it and he says it was a dumb error, he was just curious about the quiz. He quickly shows me his other email accounts and there are messages from her but at first glance they appear innocuous. 

The next day I decide to do a deeper search of his email while he is off teaching Zumba. That’s when I find the plane ticket she bought him. See the selfies she sent him and the message about how she needed to stop sleeping with him but that of course he wasn’t over her because he was still sleeping with her even though she was fat. That she hates me so much she wants to delete the smile off of my face. I see the email confirming that she did indeed take a class with him that he insisted she never showed up for. I see novel-length emails about how much she loves him and how I’m an “old b*tch” who’s not good enough for him. 

I was devastated. I shouted and cried and cursed. He came with me to a therapy appointment. My therapist said that it is possible to work through infidelity so I don’t have to rush to make a decision. I go home to visit my parents and clear my head. He’ll do anything to make it up to me he said, so I send him an article about what cheaters need to do to rebuild trust. That’s when he says it has just occurred to him that he never viewed us as being in a committed relationship. That he thought we were in a dating relationship. Despite living together, shared accounts, two international vacations, my being authorized on his credit card, and him being on my family cell phone plan. Despite long discussions about marriage and where we’d move after he finished grad school. He says he wants to decide once and for all if he can commit to me. A few days later he’s decided what he wants. He wants to move out and live separately but still date. I tell him that is less commitment and not more. He says he thinks we need to break up then. 

He goes with me to one last therapy appointment. He doesn’t cry and his facial expression never changes while I howl in agony and call him a monster. It turns out I’m the fourth person he’s done this to. Women just fall in love with him so easily he says. He regrets that I’m hurting but he doesn’t cry because negative emotions are a waste of time. He doesn’t know if he loved me. He thinks he did, but then he transitioned into not seeing a future together and he never told me. On the other hand, if he did love me he probably wouldn’t have done this he said. He’s confused and doesn’t know. He thinks he’ll miss me but he’s not sure if he’ll regret breaking up with me. He guesses his personality problems are worse than he thought. 

Within 48 hours he is out of our house, not a trace of his existence left. My parents immediately kicked him off the phone plan so he lost his phone number and I no longer have it memorized. A blessing. We exchange some messages over Facebook about finances and a shared dental appointment. For a week I send him agonized messages about how he broke my heart, about how he and his ex are horrible people and deserve a lifetime of pain. Then I finally block him on social media. 

Three weeks after that I get a message from his ex telling me to tell him to be home in 10 minutes. I finally file a restraining order and change my phone number. She retaliates by calling the police who came and pounded on my door at 5am to do a welfare check on my ex who I haven’t seen or spoken to in weeks. I feel detached from my life. I keep thinking it’s a bad dream and wishing I’d wake up. Because on top of losing my relationship, the “love of my life”, I’m being stalked by a crazy person, and now I have to truly know that evil people are real and that it’s not always easy to see. That you can be the best partner you can be, that you can be a good, honest person, and people will casually hurt you. Bad things happen to good people and good things happen to bad people. It feels like there is no justice in this world.

#Powers, Abilities, and Equipment

**Proposed Tier:** 3  

**Powers:** 

 1: matter certification
2: Repairing herself
3: resisting dissolving

then we would need modification time modifiers (and base modification times) for

1: durability
2: magic
3: specifically protection magic
4: sentience
5: biologicals
6: energy flowing through it

I think it should be done with a ""percentage"" system representing her power, with %100 normally available and another %100 after that if she is evaporating off her body mass

I think normal candification odification of something non-durable enough that a normal human could break it or rip it apart should be %1 for 1 cubic foot for 1 second, durability would be a multiplier basically based on what average tier would be able to break it with their bare hands (for example, some super material only a T4 could break with their bare hands, that's 4x energy and time), magical items would be 2x, protection magic 5x, sentience would be 4x, biologicalness would be 3x, having

energy flowing through it would be 2x. these are additive, not multiplicative with each other, so, for example, a magic human (magic, sentient, biological, has energy flowing through it) would be 11x (2+4+3+2), or 11% of her energy over 11 seconds for every cubic foot she candied. Repairing her body should be a straight percentage out of how much is destroyed in a way that it's no longer ""candy"" or is reduced to something below a certain size (so, if she is solid and you snap her, she can't reclaim the dust). So, if you melt off 10% of her body mass, it would take 10% of her energy to repair it. Candy makes this cheaper and quicker, having enough candy in the area to repair it makes it cost 1/10 the energy to ""absorb"" that candy, raw sugar is much weaker, only 1/2ing the energy cost. Resisting dissolving should be based on what is dissolving her, just water should be practically passive, acid or something should be 1-2% per second, acid strong enough to burn a human on contact closer to 3-5% per second. Now, as for how long it take to regain energy, I think to regain her full energy (%200) over a 24 hour period sounds fine

**Resources /Equipment:**  Candy. Loads of candy. Oh, and her smartphone.

**Miscellaneous Skills:** Good pole dancer and very flexable

**Strength:** 

**Movement:**  

**Defence:**

**Perception/Awareness:**

**Fighting Ability:**

**Danger:**  

**Weaknesses:** Being melt-able and super flammable, dissolving easily if she doesn't use powers to keep herself together in some fluids, small children,  etc"

I'm not too keen on sales, but I'm realistic with my situation and wouldn't mind it as long as there is some coding to do. 

I was wondering, what's the best way to put off the offer until I hear back from the other interviews? I'd obviously rather have a paying job, but if that doesn't work out I want to be able to have this internship."

I would only have to take 1 course (Programming Languages) during my fall internship to still graduate on time. It is really important to me that I intern at this company, but I would really like to graduate on time.

I go to a small private college, so they do not offer an online Programming Languages course. Does anyone have experience with taking an online CS course at a different university?

Me and my brother are both long-time warhammer enthusiasts from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, I am 16 years old and he is 12. In christmas 2014 our father, who passed away in december due to an AVC (I think the english translation is stroke, a vein in his brain ruptured and he died from hemorrhage on his way to the hospital) gifted us both with the Warhammer: Dawn of War game, which cost us 35 reais at the time, it is our only original Dawn of War game unfortunately and we didn't have much time to play with him as he was almost never home. I don't know if he liked Warhammer but he always saw me and my brother playing and talking about the series and often engaged in our conversations, we spent most time last year playing Dawn of War against each other and using mods like Firestorm over Kaurava which added a lot of units and replayability to the game.

Unfortunately my brother's PC broke earlier this month and we can't play at home anymore, so we installed the game in a nearby lan house (its a place where you pay to use the computers) but it is a bit expensive and we can't play as much as we wish we could. We live alone with our stepmother, who is unemployed, and I have to pay all the family expenses with my 450R$ (115 dollars) a month salary as an internship in a youth apprentice (jovem aprendiz) program in the Banco do Brasil - Bank of Brazil -, our country is in an economic crisis which makes things even worse, and living in Rio, a lot of money that should go to things like public schools and social projects are going to the olympics and ""tourist places""...

I'm not a reddit user, I'm accessing this from school, as my english teacher recommended it to me as a way to develop my english skills but I would like to ask you guys for help, me and my brother Gabriel are really excited to play this new Warhammer game but unfortunately at Brazil it costs almost 200 reais, which is half of my family's earnings... I've been saving some money and had almost 120 reais in my bank account, but the government ceased providing us with my mother's diabetes insipidus (it's a rare type of diabetes) and I had to pay for this month's medication, which cost me 110 reais, and here I am back with almost no money to spend

This really depresses me because me and my brother work (he asks for money at semaphores) and study the entire day, and come home and can't have any fun times again because his computer is broke, it's too dangerous to go out at night and we can only afford to go to the LAN house once a week... I would like to ask someone in reddit if you guys could gift us this game as we are really really excited to play it (I have total war: rome 1 in my PC and it is great!!! planning on asking the LAN house's owner to buy rome 2 so we can test it too), and I promise I'll repay as soon as I get a better paying job or get to save some money again.

I'm sorry for this long post, this is really a bit of a venting, I feel that gaming provides me and my brother with some fun times and it makes us feel great, even though I am really depressed about everything that is happening in my family lately and I feel so overwhelmed... Sorry about my bad english, I am still finishing my english course at school and using google tradutor to help me with some words. I'm sorry if this is against the rules, I checked and found nothing about it. Thank you!!!!!"

4l6mb6,2,2016-05-26,Second Degree in Canada: BCS at UBC or BA at UofT?,uoftvsubc,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4l6mb6/second_degree_in_canada_bcs_at_ubc_or_ba_at_uoft/,"I've just graduated with a BSc in Life Science from the University of Toronto, but I'm planning on getting a second degree in CS. My goal is to eventually work as a software engineer in the US at a medium-to-large tech company. 

I have two options available to me:

1.  **BA at the University of Toronto**. UofT won't let me do another BSc, so if I stay I have to do a BA. I can still take CS and graduate with a BA, I just have to complete what amounts to a minor in an Arts field (probably going to be economics). I would still be take all the same courses as a regular CS graduate.
2. **BCS at the University of British Columbia**. This one is a dedicated second degree program, rather than a fresh degree. I'd only have to take a few courses outside of CS/math/stats.

My main concerns are as follows:

1.  **Living at home vs away**. I'm from Toronto, I currently live at home with family. If I stay at UofT, I'd continue to live at home. I kind of long to leave home and move out... but I also realize how convenient I have it here. Food, laundry, rent - everything is taken care of for me right now. It wouldn't be exciting, but focusing on school and side projects would be so much easier were I to stay at home. Not to mention, Vancouver is very far from Toronto, and flights are expensive. I wouldn't be able to visit home very frequently.
2. **The BA instead of a BSc**. I've read all the threads on this and the consensus seems to be that it either doesn't matter or it matters very little. I'd like to think it doesn't matter for me since I already have a BSc and I'd be taking the same courses as a BSc student anyways. But I'm not keen on having to take a bunch of arts courses, enough to get an arts minor. I'm also a little concerned about how it will look to future employers if I have a bunch of arts courses on my transcript.
3. **Familiarity**. I've been at UofT for five years, I've become really familiar with how the university works. From all the administrative stuff like course management, registration, fee payment, exams etc. to more mundane things like where all the building are. Plus, all my friends and my (limited) connections are here. Leaving feels like giving up home-field advantage.
4. **Adventure**. I've been at UofT for *five years*. I've lived in Toronto all my life. And I haven't been able to travel all that much. I'd like a change of scenery, and Vancouver sounds wonderful. I've also never lived on my own, and I think I'd like to finally have that experience.
5. **Co-op**. UBC seems to have a better co-op office than UofT. Their co-op program arranges 4-month internships in the US and Canada. At UofT, we have this strange 12-16 month internship program. Internships tend to be from local or Canadian companies, as I don't think US companies will hire interns for that long. Summer internships in the US are self-arranged.
6. **Course credit**. I've taken a bunch of CS/math/stats courses at UofT during my first degree, to the point where I'm 2 courses away from finishing second-year CS. If I stay at UofT, these will all still count towards my second degree and in the fall I'd be taking 2nd and 3rd year CS courses. If I go to UBC, I think I'd get exemptions for some courses, but I'd still be starting at around a 1st/2nd year level.

There's probably more, but that's enough for now. 

Surprisingly, money is not a factor as they will end up costing the same amount (tuition at UBC is less than half of the tuition at UofT). Neither is time - with co-op, both will take around 3 years. The prestige and reputation of each University also seems to be fairly equal, both are the best in Canada after Waterloo. UofT tends to rank higher, but UBC is always second, and those rankings typically don't reflect the quality of the undergraduate program anyways.

I'd appreciate any thoughts or input, especially from CS graduates of either university working in the US. I should be glad to have two options like this, but I'm feeling more overwhelmed than happy. Writing this out has been a great exercise to get my thoughts in order."

I'm a summer intern at a state agency and my duty is to produce a catalogue of contaminated properties in several counties in my state. I am creating this catalogue in ArcGIS Desktop, but the end product needs to be published on ArcGIS Online. As a college student, I am accustomed to working in ArcGIS desktop with shapefiles in my classes. So far, I am working with shapefiles for the state counties (polygons) and shapefiles of the various types of contamination (points). I have noticed that many types of data that are available from ArcGIS Online (as well as other data websites) are in layer format, not shapefile (such as state hydrological data). Is it fine to work with feature layer files instead of shapefiles? I have looked this up and I'm not finding a clear answer about the difference. My second question is about the interaction between ArcGIS Desktop and ArcGIS Online. How should I transition my final product from the desktop setting to the online setting? I know that ArcGIS Online uses base maps, but my project so far has been based on the geographies I downloaded from the Census Bureau (TIGER/Line).

I realize that my questions are probably rudimentary. I'm still learning the basics of GIS. Thank you for any help."

4l7dun,3,2016-05-26,Impostor Syndrome and Taking Pride in Your Work!,Mithrien,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/4l7dun/impostor_syndrome_and_taking_pride_in_your_work/,"I'm a female in academia, in a field with a very low female-to-male ratio. I know that there are a few subreddits out there for females in science, but given that this subreddit has higher traffic, I think that this needs to be said here: A LOT of females, particularly in male dominated fields, suffer from something called [impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). 


A [paper](http://www.eigenfactor.org/gender/self-citation/SelfCitation.pdf) currently in press describes that men cite their own papers over 56% more frequently than their female counterparts do. Each additional paper self-citation on average leads to an additional three citations over five years. Citations count for future scholarly careers, and given the increase of females representation in science, this gender gap is a bit unsettling, primarily because it is a recent trend (since the 60s-70s). Several of the given reasons for this gap (from this paper) include that women consistently evaluate their performance more critically, despite equivalent performance. Self-promoting can also lead to a backlash from both other men AND WOMEN. And, that self-promotion decreases female likability. 


I don't have any answers for how to improve on self-promotion and self-evaluation, or how to shake impostor syndrome. Anecdotally, I've run into female professors at Ivy league universities who don't feel as though they belong there, while doing groundbreaking work. One of the smartest females that I knew in undergrad, currently working in high energy physics at a top university, was told that if she got a certain award, it would probably only be because of her gender. Another (child-free) girl that I work with, when looking at grad programs, was explicitly told by a male faculty member that he would never take her on because she would probably decide to make babies instead of doing research.  I've consistently wondered if I didn't somehow get straight A's and top of the line internships because I had smart friends to help me, or someone messed up on reading my resume and giving me an interview. **Sexism in the workplace, whether it be external or internal, is not a myth**. 


Here's my message: If you don't believe you deserve to be where you are right now, if you are successful and still have doubts about yourself, you are not alone. And if you're achieving something, you more than likely deserve to be achieving it of **your own merit**. Show some pride for your accomplishments!

Using data composing of a quantity of stress vectors (I currently have strain rates/vectors for an area), I am going to use them to find the vector for which they all average out to be a best fit, which will then be interpreted as the calculated regional stress vector field? 

From what I've read, I need to start with a set of equations...would this set be the equations that describe the line vectors for each strain rate?

4l7qc2,3,2016-05-26,"More clarity on ""making ads/copy/have a book"" (another ""I want to break in"")",MargotsThrowaway,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/4l7qc2/more_clarity_on_making_adscopyhave_a_book_another/,"Hi,

Firstly, before anyone throws pots and pans at me, I *did* read a great many of the ""how to get in"" threads. I read the mega-thread in the sidebar. I even went outside of reddit and read those articles. I honestly have been doing homework. I'm not writing this out of laziness, I would just appreciate some clarity on all the (great) advice I've read.

I have no book. I've made no ads. I have no experience in the field. And my two degrees are in creative writing and comparative literature. I recently dropped out of an MFA program but that's the sort of thing I'll keep off my resume. I also have no contacts or networking opportunities. In college, all of my professors were writers or theorists. I've been swimming in fiction and other sorts of creative writing for the past five years and have nothing to show an agency, (unless they want short stories or poems).

But, I'm relatively young, I have no mortgage or family. I'm not exclusively seeking my own office, just an internship that could help pay for my shitty studio in a pre-gentrified part of LA. So I guess that leads me to the three questions I still have after reading all of the ""how to get in"" threads.

1. When those threads stress the importance of books and portfolios full of copy, is that only for more advanced positions, or is it necessary to have them even when applying for internships?

2. I simply cannot afford to go back to school. I might be able to afford a portfolio school here in LA. However, beyond that, when I read ""make a book"" is that piece of advice as simple as it sounds? If I simply start creating ads in photoshop and printing them out at kinkos, or writing copy for radio spots, etc, is that acceptable? Because, I simply know from the writing world that any sort of portfolio should only include published works. So when you speak of books, is that what you mean? I'm a little confused about how I can sell ads without working at an agency? Then again, I imagine that if I'm being interviewed for a position and show them a book of ads I made on my own that I haven't sold, and that hasn't been made in any company or school, they might laugh me out of the room because that might not be kosher in some sort of way.

3. Because I spent all of college applying for arsty jobs, my resume is somewhat...artsy. No, it's not a Lisa Frank shitshow. But it is styled. It has a background color, and all the text is framed in the center in different sizes that make it look like an isolated pillar in the middle of the page. It's clean, and aesthetically pleasing, but nonetheless, it's artsy in a pretentious art gallery snob sort-of-way. I'm not really sure how these agencies look at themselves and worry that it might be too much because they view their field as more professional than artistic? Should I just make a boring standard cookie-cutter resume of the sort an accountant or paralegal would have? Or will my current *styled* resume be taken well?

Clarification on those questions will greatly help. Thank you in advance, and thank you all for using this subreddit. Reading all the posts (not just ""how to break in"") has been very insightful. I'm not just a jaded artist that haphazardly chose advertising. It has been something in the back of my mind for years. I've given it a lot of thought, especially lately, and I'm finally ready to commit myself fully to it and give it an honest shot. I understand that it's a painful amount of work for little pay, and it will be exhausting, but I truly want that. In fact, about 3 years ago I applied for a college internship at a firm here in LA called Chiat Day, and I actually made it to the next round! But then the HR person became frustrated because I was crashing some classes and didn't have a set schedule so I was eliminated. My point is, this is truly what I want, I'm ready to do *a lot* of work, I just need some help knowing where to direct my energies. Thanks again."

Full tuition grant for 1st year, assurances that I'll have a good shot at TA in second year which would pay for tuition + living costs.  Places well in tech, good job capture and internship rates, some interesting companies to work for.  Really cool curriculum and ranked the best ROI for MBAs by US News again.  They have been super engaging and have done a really great job getting my loyalty.

**Offer #2: (Due 06/01/2016) Washington University in St Louis - Olin (#21)**

$40k total off cost, after this I would end up about $146k in debt based on expected costs from their website (so likely larger).  I love the idea of St. Louis as its getting some startup attention/silicon prarie feel.  Just really pricey.  Job placement in tech seems similar to Wisc-Mad

**Offer #3: (Due 06/16/2016) - Vanderbilt (#22 tie)**

Offered me $30k total, puts it similar in cost to Olin as St Louis is way cheaper than Nashville from what I can see.  I'm from the south so Vandy is a household name.  Great tech placement, great specialization in corp responsibility/sustainability.  Would still be in around $140k debt after all said and done.  They offered to increase (basically double) my offer if I retake the GMAT and get a 730 or better. 


I'm really leaning towards Wisc.  They have been super cool, the program sounds great, Badgers are insanely loyal/jazzed about their school (I have several colleagues that did their undergrad there).  The reduced risk with what appears to be no real loss of job placement possibility is definitely enticing considering how little debt I might end up with.

All opinions are welcome."

The notion of the self-made man is a myth.

For years, I thought that if I worked hard enough I would succeed. In college, I thought that if I didn’t click with someone, it was OK to stop talking to them. I thought that if someone doubted me, it was OK to burn the bridge. I thought that if I was owed a favor, it was OK to cash in and then check out of the relationship.

After all, I was going to succeed…. no matter what.

If you think your intelligence, determination, or iron resolve will make you succeed, I empathize with you. If you believe you can make it on your own, I feel sorry for you…. because you’re taking the stairs to the penthouse when there is an elevator just behind the double doors.

Long before Dale Carnegie wrote How to Win Friends and Influence People, long before Keith Ferrazzi and Tahl Raz transformed the networking landscape with Never Eat Alone, people were leveraging relationships to get ahead.

Robert Kiyosaki once said, “If you want to go somewhere, it’s best to find someone who has already been there.”

In any field, your success largely depends on your ability to build and maintain relationships. In this article I am going to teach you how to do both. But first, let me paint a picture.

Two students are graduating college,

Student A is really smart, gifted with incredible resources, and great at making friends. However, he is also very entitled. He thinks that the world is his oyster, and because he believes he can build new relationships whenever he wants, he doesn’t bother to maintain them.

Student B is of average intelligence, doesn’t have nearly as many resources as Student A, but is just as good at making friends. The key difference between the two is that Student B, unlike Student A, would rather sever a limb than sever a connection. As a result, Student B has become a master at maintaining relationships.

Who has more resources in post grad life? Who has an easier time finding a job?

Student B.

I know this because I was Student A, and one of my best friends, James, was Student B. James was an expert at staying on good terms with people. Growing up my friends and I would make fun of him for messing with someone one day and the next day being their best friend. We laughed when he would get in scuffle with some poor kid, and then the next day stick up for them. We harassed him for never wanting to burn a bridge.

Little did I know, it was one of his greatest strengths. His ability to look for the good in everyone, to maintain relationships no matter the circumstance was an invaluable trait. You are only as strong as your network.

Many times, we see relationships as expendable. If there isn’t that instant connection, it is time to move on. It is in moments like these that we can learn from my childhood friend, James.

The aptitude for maintaining relationships is just as important as the propensity for building them.

Over the last year, I learned this by going from a state of having no mentors, zero friends with similar interests and goals, to connecting with some of the most successful people in my field and linking up with likeminded colleagues all around me.

So without further ado, let’s dive into how to become a networking guru.

Building Relationships:

The first step to building relationships is to have the willingness to reach out. It is safe to assume, that the people that you most likely wish to network and connect with have already built their own solid network. Needless to say, they aren’t going to be coming to you, so you have to reach out and connect with them. You can do that through a networking event, an email, or even a phone call, but you already know that.

What you may not know is that in order to infiltrate the network of a well-established figure within your field, you have to show up with something to offer. Growing up, one thing my older cousin would continuously stress was that you should, “always bring something to the table.”

Now it’s easy to assume that there isn’t much that you can offer to someone who is already more successful and connected than you, however, that couldn’t be further from the truth. If you are struggling to identify what you could bring to the table of someone who already has more than you, I recommend you watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B7u7zF2qmo). In it, I chat with Dougie Forlano, “The Millionaire Mentee,” revealing how he built a vast network of high profile mentors out of nothing, simply by bringing value to everyone he met.

Often the best way to go about connecting to a well established figure, is finding “an in.” Ask family, friends, friends of friends, if they know anyone who might have relationship with the person you are seeking to connect or network with. It is always better to get introduced by someone than to come out of nowhere with a random proposal/introduction.

If you do find someone who knows the person you are seeking to connect or network with, when you contact them, make sure to put that person’s name in the subject of your email or at the beginning of any message that you send them. At the end, be sure to mention what you are bringing to the table. It better be more than your good looks or hard work.

One thing to remember when you are reaching out to new people is to not be afraid to be persistent. Sometimes you won’t reach your person of interest on the first go-around. If that is the case, don’t hesitate to contact them again. Sometimes emails get lost, phone calls get ignored, or people get caught up in something and forget to respond. As long as you’re coming from a place where you are offering value, your person of interest should welcome a conversation. Not to mention, successful people usually respect persistence, because it’s a characteristic they most likely have also channeled throughout previous ventures.

If they still don’t respond, don’t sweat it. Move on and don’t hold any bad blood. There is always the opportunity that you can connect down the road. However, that opportunity won’t be there if you get “too persistent.”

If you want to connect with someone on your level, which I recommend you do before you even reach for mentors, I would suggest the principle of going first. In hypnosis, going first means putting yourself in the shoes of someone experiencing an emotion or incident before you articulate it. Here I use the term to suggest you first become interested in another person, before you expect them to become interested in you. Interest breeds interest.

In my own life, I found that I often connect with people best when I am in scenario where I need to make friends. For example, when I go on a vacation, or when I first went to college, I noticed I would build relationships much more quickly. The reason why is because when you enter a new atmosphere things are unstable. The need to build a network for the purpose of familiarity and security inspires interest. You begin to emotionally invest in other people and cultivate a desire to understand how their personal qualities, goals, and desires align with your own.

When you become interested in another person, they become interested in you. By showing genuine interest, you offer others something we all value: a feeling of significance.

By connecting with people who share your interests and goals, you expedite your ability to achieve those goals. As Jim Rohn says, “You are the average of the 5 people you spend time around the most.”

Human beings are like sponges. We absorb the quality of everything from the foods we eat to the company we keep. Surround yourself with people who want accomplish what you do, and you will learn from each other’s successes and failures. Sooner or later, you will all be closer to your goals by working together than you would be separately. Create a mastermind group if you must.

One bonus tip I would offer is to adapt. Don’t treat everyone the same, and don’t behave in the same way with everyone you meet. Endless research shows that your ability to connect with other people depends on your ability to relate to them. If you are speaking with someone who uses very proper language and mannerisms, make sure you follow that etiquette. Conversely, if you are speaking with someone who swears and speaks much more casually, feel free to do that as well.

There are loads of unconscious techniques you can use to better connect with other people. If you are interested in exploring these techniques further, I recommend you watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kpl_MEoWLg) on the three psychological tips that help you connect with anyone.

Now that you have learned how to build relationships, it is time to learn how to maintain them. This is much easier because many of the principles essential to maintaining relationships have been previously expressed above. However, there are some key things you need to pick up

Maintaining Relationships:

Relationship maintenance is an art form.

Contrary to popular belief, it is not simply a matter of checking in on people now and again. In fact, persistent contact in a relationship can get annoying if it isn’t going anywhere. If you hound people with messages out of fear of losing a connection you might actually make people feel like you are using them. The last thing you want is for them to feel like you are just maintaining the relationship so you can cash in a favor when you need it.

Instead, it is best to communicate only when there is something worthwhile to say. This can be anything from recommending a book or a movie, to saying congratulations on an achievement, or to getting feedback on idea. As long as you show the person that you value their time and have something meaningful to share or discuss, the relationship will only grow stronger.

Ultimately, relationship maintenance is founded on one principle: reciprocity.

If you give, you shall receive. Oddly enough, this principle has been around since the dawn of time. It is found in countless religious texts, pieces of self-help literature, and entrepreneurship manifestos. However, it is probably one of the techniques least often employed by business enthusiasts. Many of us have a tendency to mark tit for tat. We fear being the first one to lend a helping hand, because what if the recipient doesn’t return the favor? Instead of worrying about the return, do as Keith Ferrazzi says, “lead with generosity.”

In Never Eat Alone (which is an essential read BTW), Ferrazzi likens relationship maintenance to a muscle. Unlike many are led to believe, a relationship and its resources are not finite, “like a pie that can only be cut into so many pieces.” Instead, they grow stronger the more you interact and exchange ideas and services. The more you nurture the relationship with your own contributions the more you can harvest from it. The more you harvest from it, the more space there is for new resources to grow.

One way you can consistently nurture a relationship is by connecting people with others who might share their ideas or philosophies. Remember earlier I said that you share the characteristics of the five people you spend time around the most? (Well, Jim Rohn said it first) Well, if you connect people with others who share parallels, you might help them polish their approach and expedite their progress.

Even if you connect someone to another person below them, for instance by recommending a young kid for an internship, you are actually doing more good than harm. People want to be surrounded by likeminded people, from tenderfoot interns to potential business partners. If you can help them to do that, your relationship is only going to get stronger. Keeping that in mind, it’s always best to ensure the other person, again, brings something valuable to the table.

There is nothing more satisfying than having a huge network of people whose backs you have scratched. Not everyone will scratch your back in return, but many will. The more you offer to others, the more resources you will have. Eventually, you might realize, as many do, that you actually enjoy helping others just for the sake of it.

If you are independent entrepreneur, a corporate employee, or undergraduate student it is essential you master the art of relationship building and maintenance. When you learn to cultivate strong relationships, you can then leverage this network of connections to find jobs, embark on new business ventures, find resourceful associates, produce new customer bases and audiences, develop partnerships, and/or make spectacular deals.

No matter your field, a robust interpersonal network is the key to optimizing your personal and professional enterprise. You know what you need to do. Now it’s time to step off the stairs, and hop on the elevator.

I’ll see you at the top.

I'll give you time to read it, as the rest of this is out of context and I want to welcome a potential Adventure Theorist with their own words.

While I don't think Betty will try to *become* the Ice Elemental, there are many things of note:

- Virtual Betty Tells IK, ""before I go, there's something I have to tell you..."" and then chooses not to. This also irked me. But if you follow my posts, you know that I believe IK/the wearer of the Ice Crown to be the true embodiment of Denial (ever since Evergreen's Gunter wished, at it's simplest, to *be someone else more powerful than he is*), and therefore is the best way to handle him (even in *Elemental*, Patience tells IK ""[an acolyte] is more of an intern"" before seeing him get really sad, changing her mind to ""Oh, yeah, I mean a boyfriend, *totally*..."" and getting him to do her bidding without question. If IK is given a ""game"" or fun activity, he's easily tricked, time and time again).

- We remember the Floating Ice Head from Graybles 1000+, right? [What was missing?](http://i.imgur.com/XonozFy.jpg)

Given AScully707 's account, I'm inclined to predict the following: 

- Betty was going to tell Simon that she could in fact save him but chose not to because if she had, she would have actually been telling Ice King and it would altered the course of events (he operates so heavily on Denial)

- that this solution would have dire consequences, including the fact that Avatar Betty is the best version of her he's going to get and an [evil might swallow the earth for 400+ years](http://66.media.tumblr.com/21c8af398d75e32080014d76168a8514/tumblr_inline_npc62ntmmh1qzjzhu_540.gif)...Unless the crown [became unstable in some way](http://i.imgur.com/XonozFy.jpg)...Like technically having a digital host with quantum understanding of the Universe...

I think the other Princesses will become overnight masters of their elements (you'll notice that SP and FP have *always* had some weird emotional reaction that spat out Slime or Flame at the perfect moment to save the day when adventuring with Finn - or make it horribly worse - and now they have Patience to help them master their talent...), but PB learning to let go of reason is gonna be ~~going dentist~~ pulling teeth on this one.

4l7xxv,4,2016-05-26,I [26M] want to end my relationship with my girlfriend [28F] of 4 years,PSYCH4HIRE,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4l7xxv/i_26m_want_to_end_my_relationship_with_my/,"Mandatory throwaway (my gf know my username)

My gf and I met 4 years ago online, I wasn't really looking for a serious relationship because the last one was pretty toxic, and it was ok for her as well her profile said she was leaving the town for a job. 


We clicked instantly, we had a great chemistry and she was so ... sweet, sane and stable. She proposed we had an official relationship even though it was long-distance. I wasn't ready for that but we really had something special that I didn't want to miss.


And I was right. (We had some fights though) but everything else was fine until she returned in town. That was great a first but our differences started to show especially concerning sex, intimacy and libido.


Don't get me wrong, the sex was great! But I always had a high libido and her not so much. I like talking, fooling around basically arousing and getting aroused with my gf (verbally/texts...), I am open about my fantasies, trying new things and improving the experience. She tried, but it's not really her thing either…


I got really self-conscious at first (maybe it was pathological to want so much sex) I thought I would be able to get to her level with time... it didn't work.


So I tried to get her on my level. She got reaaaaaally self-conscious, to the point of being so anxious she started sobbing and crying about not being a ""good-enough gf""... Seeing her suffering like that was the worst. That issue became a taboo in our relationship. I wasn’t really a forbidden topic but that was awkward: I was trying as hard as could not to show my frustration and her constantly asking if the sex was “ok” the frequency “enough” like a consumer reviewing…


Honestly, it wasn't that difficult. She's a great person and we get along so well that I thought the whole time that it was good enough, she definitely worth it. We support and trust each other’s, we share dreams, opinions and even some hobbies. 


She had to move again for work and it was okay because we could blame the sex issue on the long distance...Then she struggled for 2 years to get a job, had a depression. On my side, I was finishing college (med school) and I had some rough times also (I am a perfectionist and my grades weren’t good enough for me. Seeing that maybe I wasn’t THAT good was really hard and really put a dent in my confidence). She was here for me, and I for her.


Somehow, that relationship became so strong that it was for me like a badge of approval for society. We couldn’t fail. Yeah, sex was an issue but with some time, after she finds a job, when we get our apartment, when I lose some weight… Yeah with all those things everything will be fine!


I had so much hope for the future… Then reality hit me: after having kids, after be married, couples have less intimacy and ours was already low… Call it cowardice if you must but that's when I started to procrastinate, to postpone our joint projects whatsoever. Waiting for what? I cannot answer clearly… Magical change maybe.


Well, my gf left last November for a year-long trip abroad (adding value to her resume/practicing English). We had nothing to fear, we’re such a strong couple! I still think this was a great idea, I was the first to support her project and I still do.


For me it was perfect. Since it’s my first year as an intern we don’t have much time apart from work, and it is recommended to start in small hospitals, far from downtown, in rural cities.


  I am a lonely person, an introvert and enjoy quietness, but I got bored and lonely so bored that I started lifting first twice a week to a daily basis. I lost 12 kg since November and got really fit. Cool huh?! I was so happy! Surely My gf is going to love that! Maybe she’ll want me more! 


  She liked it! And we’re supposed to see each other in Indonesia. I got carried away: “Baby! Look at those abs! And since it’s been like 7 months we’re going to fuck night and day…” she wasn’t that enthusiast and reminded me our differences.


  Actually, she was just telling me that being fit and traveling isn’t going to change that and even if it does it won’t be permanent! This is true. 


I was deluding myself into changing something that doesn’t need to be changed: we’re normal, sane and complete. I need to accept it or get what I want elsewhere without pressuring her into becoming someone she isn’t.


Needless to say, I was kinda depressed to realize that. But bear with me, there’s more!


  I met a girl (another intern) older than me (28). A pretty girl, a stubborn and talkative one… I really don’t know what happened; I was kind of avoiding her actually: she gave me her number 3 times and I “lost” it twice.


  Every time I was like “Oops! Too bad … maybe it didn't mean to happen!” But after talking with her for a while it became pretty clear we had a strong connection. Since she had a bf and me having a gf we could be platonic friends, right?


Well, no… If I was avoiding her at first, we began to talk on daily basis via texts and I was longing for them. After a while she told me she left her bf (4 years). Since it was the topic, we talked about our respective relationships.

 I had no idea she wasn’t happy and she had no idea beforehand about my issues and somehow our stories were so similar it was funny… Our conversations got flirty over time (I am not proud of that) I asked her if we could stop talking because what I was feeling was not friendly anymore and that I needed to focus on my gf.



 She agreed, and revealed that it was the same for her… It’s been 4 weeks since and I’m still wondering if I want to breakup with my gf because of this emotional affair or not.


TL;DR: 

-	ex was toxic but sex was great

-	actual gf is my soulmate but we don’t have matching libidos but we decide to work things out anyway

-	 I know things won’t change but I’m too coward/comfortable to breakup 

-	Had an emotional affair/ended it. Now more than ever I want to breakup


Tell me Reddit. I am an asshole who was just waiting for an opportunity to find greener grass?

4l81qy,10,2016-05-26,I'm a young mom and I need help.,acschuster,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/4l81qy/im_a_young_mom_and_i_need_help/,"I became a mom when I was 18 and my sons father was in the picture so I've taken on the load by myself. I'm 21 now and live by myself in a house that I rent from my uncle. 

I'm not sure if it's being alone or being stressed but I've lost all motivation and I'm super depressed and need help finding hope that thing will be okay. I'm working towards my bachelors degree and do school all year and through the entire summer to make sure I can graduate on time. This summer I'm also working two jobs, one where I clean houses which is physical labor. I also have an internship that I have to squeeze 18 hours into my schedule for. My day starts at 7, and doesn't end until about 4 when I pick up my son. Then I come home, make dinner for myself and my son, clean up the house, give him a bath, put him to bed, and then catch up on chores such as cleaning my OWN house, doing laundry, washing dishes, doing the yard, etc. 

I don't have time to see friends anymore. I don't have time to relax. I don't have money to go shopping for things that I need, and the stress is weighing on me. I've been prescribed anti depressants but I need to increase the dose and I dong even have time to go to a doctor. My family has to pick up and babysit my son for me every day while I work/intern so I can't ask them to babysit anymore, and by the time I get home everything's already closed. 

At this point, I feel like I'll never be myself again. I've turned into a zombie, all I do is work and I'm so worried it'll never get better, because as soon as I graduate I'll be searching for a full time job to bring in more money. 

I do have a boyfriend but we haven't been dating long and he doesn't live with me. 

I get a few hours with my son between work and bedtime but I'm just so worn down that I can't enjoy it, I just find myself counting down until bedtime so I can go to sleep as well. I'm usually in bed by 9 and asleep by 10. 


What do I do?! I'm so exhausted and worn down and I'm only 21. I feel like I'm too young to be this burnt out already, I haven't even done anything in life! I found myself telling my boyfriend that I was done with life and giving up. 

As a side note, I love my son more than anything in the world and he's the best child I could ever ask for, he's done nothing wrong to make me feel like this. In fact, he helps me get through the day and I look forward to coming home and seeing his face everyday, however I just can't help the sinking feeling in the back of my head that at only 21 years old my life has been reduced to work. 

I don't mean to sound whiny but I don't know where to turn, any suggestions for things I can do to help feel better?

4l8a4v,1,2016-05-26,"Non-clinical volunteering, shadowing and ECs",thislovecamebacktome,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/4l8a4v/nonclinical_volunteering_shadowing_and_ecs/,"I come from a country where shadowing doctors is not an option for non-medical students unless you are in junior college (Singapore). So far at the hospitals I volunteer at, I have not heard of any students besides junior college students and actual medical students who are allowed to shadow doctors. No such options are available at clinics either. I have tried applying and am currently waiting to hear if they can allow me to tag along on their junior college work attachment program.

But at the end of 2013, I was selected to participate in a work shadowing program organized by my junior college at one of the local hospitals. My concern is that this was before undergraduate. If it's of any relevance, it was a 5 day program (only under special circumstances would they give you two weeks, and the 5-day program is very rare as it is) and I managed to shadow 6 specialties for a total of 50 hours or so. Would this be allowed to count in my application when I apply, or would I have to try to obtain some form of shadowing again?

On a similar note, I have done a few hundred hours worth of non-clinical volunteering in my secondary school and junior college days before entering undergraduate. If my memory didn't fail me, it's about 200+ cumulated over 6 years. Currently I'm focusing on gaining clinical volunteering experience in undergrad since I have exclusively done non-clinical before deciding I wanted to apply for postgrad med school. Would I be able to count this in my application, too? Or would I have to include non-clinical as part of my current ongoing volunteer schedule as well?

One last thing: how important are ECs? My school doesn't offer a co-curricular activity that I'm interested in so currently my ECs are basically volunteering...which kinda looks bad. But from what I gathered on SDN, it doesn't seem to be very important for some schools, yet it's a general rule of thumb to have some besides volunteering. I major in accounting and my degree doesn't offer honours (i.e. nothing related to research) so I don't think I can get any research experience in. I'm also not sure how willing are university professors to allow a student in a non-related major to tag along on their research as an intern or something...

Sorry for the long questions. I don't have a pre-med advisor at my school so I'm quite unclear on this!"
4l8dr3,1,2016-05-26,Downward spiral while studying abroad,dragonlean,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4l8dr3/downward_spiral_while_studying_abroad/,"(Sorry in advance for the length of this post - I just started writing and didn't quite realise how much I needed to vent.) 25F, currently about midway through a one-semester exchange programme at a pretty well-respected university in Tokyo. I've been getting treated on and off for depression/anxiety since 2009, and in that time my mental health has fluctuated between periods of well managed smooth sailing and periods where I've spent a few weeks in the psych ward due to being at risk for suicide. When I'm travelling okay I'm a pretty decent student who loves being around people - made great grades in my degree back home in a fairly competitive programme, did well enough and juggled enough impressive extra-curriculars to get into my first preference for exchange at a pretty competitive university. I've always struggled with my mental health throughout of course, and will be graduating from undergrad much later than expected in Australia as a result. This is a pretty big point of shame for me - I think I tend to externally present as someone who has their shit together and is relatively intelligent and capable, so when I talk about uni with new people (or people already in my life, for that matter) and they express surprise that I'm still in undergrad at my age, it invariably makes me feel a pretty heavy dose of shame and tends to trigger my anxiety (slight perfectionist). 


This is something that's weighing heavily on my mind at the moment while I'm studying abroad. Under the guidance of a psychiatrist, I changed my medication back in November as my grandfather unfortunately passed away last September and it basically tore my mental health to shreds in the middle of a busy semester - I hit rock bottom in November and ended up being admitted to hospital for a couple of weeks due to being severely at risk for suicide/self harm. This was done shortly before I embarked on a competitive internship programme in the United Arab Emirates in January. Despite my issues and recent instability, I thrived throughout that experience, and returned home in February feeling very optimistic and excited about my upcoming study abroad in Japan.


Things were fine when I first arrived - I was social, engaged, excited to meet new people and see new things. I even travelled okay during the first month or so of classes - did fairly well on quizzes etc. This was despite my anxiety regarding the course content - I'm exclusively taking Japanese language units whilst I'm here. I've had major concerns about being able to keep up with the work and also re: communicating, as I'm quite shy about my spoken Japanese abilities and tend to experience pretty hefty stage fright. I've also never been in a position where I've had my timetable consist entirely of foreign language units before - at home, I would be taking three units in my main major and one unit in Japanese. My attendance was a little spotty but I was very mindful of adhering to the uni's attendance policies. In the last couple of weeks, however, my mental health has gone to complete shit. I'm self-medicating with the cheap alcohol here, I'm lucky if I get four hours of sleep a night, I'm oscillating between states of awful depression that leave me so numb that I can barely dress myself or shower or keep my room clean, let alone get on top of homework, and anxiety over how bad I've let things get. In the last week I've missed two quizzes, and this morning I couldn't find the will to drag myself to a midterm exam worth 20% of my grade. 


It's been so long since my mental health dwindled to the point where I missed an exam. I feel lost and confused and constantly overwhelmed - I'm just sitting here in my dorm room with the curtains pulled and all I can keep thinking is that I've made a horrible fucking mistake in deciding to undertake study abroad. It's not the location - Tokyo is a wonderful place, and at the beginning (and even now when I manage to find the will to leave the house) I adored being here, going out, seeing things and immersing myself. I just keep dwelling on how stupid and useless and ungrateful I am - that I've worked so hard to put myself in this amazing position and all for nothing, of course, because I should've known I wouldn't be able to handle it and would ultimately just end up pissing it all away. Part of me wants to run home - the other part of me feels legitimately physically nauseated at the sheer shame of doing that, and wonders why I don't just kill myself because it's been almost ten years of this shit and I constantly find myself in this position, time and time again, and I'm honestly convinced that this will just keep ruining my life no matter how hard I work to overcome it, no matter what I achieve. After years of uncertainty, I finally had myself on a stable path to graduation, and now, whether I drop out and run or just fail out of this semester by sticking around, I'm certain I've fucked that up as well, and everyone's just going to regard me as even more useless than before. I'm just so exhausted and self-loathing and numb at the moment. I legitimately don't know what to do. 


TL;DR: studying abroad in Tokyo, found myself in a major depressive episode, missing classes/exams and only exacerbating the problem, feel like my only options are to cut and run home and wallow in the shame of being completely fucking useless or to just fucking end it. "

I pretty much just image computers put them back in a box and get them ready to ship. I am basically working full time hours during the summer and I am the go to person if there are no full time employees working. 

Currently I am going to be a junior in college majoring in Computer Science. I am going to be looking for internships/jobs for next summer and I would like to stay at this company because it is close to home and also the only IT/CS place in/near my hometown. 

I am making this post because I need some advice on asking if I should talk to my boss in my ""department"" at the end of the summer if they would offer me an internship and do something more technical at my job than what I am doing now. Currently they don't offer internships that I know of.  Another reason is that they are constantly hiring IT people throughout the company and I want to be part of the team eventually. 

How would you go about asking them to try open an internship for me next summer? 

Side Question: How much programming is there in IT because its something that I would still like to do in my career?"

This is a bit long so bear with me. Im with a girl now but she isnt my Girlfriend but we love eachother and we are exclusive. IT all started when I met her through a friend at his college. They kinda had a thing going on a FWB sorta deal I guess. Well she was hot so I started talking to her knowing that she wasnt ""with my friend"" oh she also had a boyfriend back home. So anyway talking turned to flirting flirting turned to FWB. We kept it secret from my friend to avoid awkwardness but she kinda was stopping with him regardless. So after the first time we were in love and the subsequent times just strengthened it. So shortly after we admitted we loved eachother her BF dumped her. I was there to comfort her etc. This was over Christmas break. So she came back and I needed a place to stay so I moved up there and stayed with her temporarily. So then I found out she was still flirting with my friend and such on messenger and I was like ok this has to stop if you want me I cant do this now that we are in love. She agreed and stopped but stayed his friend after we ssat him down and told him and he cried and confessed his love it was bad but it was done. The tension was there when we were together but he was normal if it was just me and him or him and her and him hanging out. Side note he was my bestfriend for like 7 years. Time passed and I eventually told him and her they couldnt be going to movies and stuff together bc he is in a way an ex. So time passed on and now its summer. Both I and my girlthing agreed to drop him as a friend bc its better for us all. She still hasnt and today I found out she skyped him and played some game with her friends while I was at work. Am i wrong to be upset? Also to clarify why we arent dating we arent bc she isnt ready to move to another but this is basically one but if not using the title helps whatever also she was waiting for me to get a place of my own and a job here which I now have. She is gon on an internship for the summer and when she gets back we can talk about offically dating. So if you made it this far feel free to answer the question and/or leave advice. Feels good to get this out and now in retrospect my life is a damn soap opera."

They are flying me out, paying for my housing, and I am getting a salary to boot. I am SUPER excited to start because it's such an amazing opportunity.

However, I am freaked out because of one clause in the contract. I can't miss more than 2 days. I will be working for 12 weeks. 12*5 working days a week=60 days of work. I will be fired otherwise.

The reason I am so scared about this is because I SUCK with attendance. I always have since elementary school. I may not be absent, but I will probably be late. It has gotten worse in college when I just wake up late and don't go to class at all (bad idea, I know). The excuse can range from feeling sad (sounds stupid but I have been severely depressed at one point, so I try to do ""mental health days"" if I feel like I'm getting too sad), being sick (I'm fragile lol), or just being lazy. I know. It's bad. I don't want to hear about how this is bad of me. Because I know. I am a super hard worker, I am nice, I am sociable, I am knowledgable, I am smart, but I SUCK WITH ATTENDANCE.

The housing I found is 50 minutes away from my workplace via public transportation. I start my days at 8AM. That means I will need to be out of the house by 7AM. I have to do my makeup, get ready, shower, etc. so I will need to wake up by 6AM. This is terrifying me.

I am so scared I am going to FUCK UP because I will miss more than 2 days of work or be late. I'm honestly about to cry thinking about it. I also suck at falling asleep so I'm always up until like 3am.

I know this all sounds so stupid so please don't make me feel even more stupid. Also, please don't comment on how terrible this writing is or my grammar or anything. I'm just really :( so please no negative comments.

4l9hqd,1,2016-05-27,Almost fell into the cycle again.. BUT NOT TODAY.,ZigZagFlows,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4l9hqd/almost_fell_into_the_cycle_again_but_not_today/,"I'm not gonna lie.. I'm still feeling lonely as fuck. I still feel a hollowness or void inside of me that I'm sure most,if not all, of you can relate to. And I know that this lingering feeling of hopelessness will continually haunt me for a very long time. But just 2 days ago, I had the greatest realization; that I need to continue on with my life, and grow as a person. 

I'm 20 years old and still in high school because I've almost never shown up for the past 2 years due to the immense feeling of anxiety and isolation I feel there. That, and leaving bed takes up nearly all my mental willpower to do so. The only people I've really been talking to for the past few months (since March) have been my best friend who I met over the internet, and my intern counselor from school. These two people are the main reason why I'm typing this out right now at my desk instead of lying in bed, in a dark room, and emptily staring at the glow from my alarm clock. I had met and started talking to my internet friend since March and since then, we've become close to one another. It wasn't until about a month ago that I told her that I considered my best friend, and she said she felt the same way as well. I then became overly attached to my best friend and suffocated her constantly with endless messages of doubts about our friendship, and and me not deserving to be her best friend (something I've ALWAYS dreamt of being to somebody). Doubts that I really had no reason for having. It would have been extremely easy for her to just abandon our friendship since we only really know each other through the internet. But she didn't. Instead, just last week, she said she wanted a break from talking for a little while, and that it would be good for the both of us. After she told me that, I felt completely lost. Hopeless. Defeated by life. My only friend, the one person that ever considered me her best friend, didn't want to talk to me because I had driven her to that point of nearly giving up on me. It wasn't until 2 days ago that I realized what she meant by ""good for the both of us"". She wanted me to grow as a person, instead of constantly clinging on to her for any form of happiness. That was when I decided I NEEDED to change, and turn my life around. I started going back to school on Wednesday, and plan on doing so regularly until my trimester ends. The only times I really only went to school the past few months have been to meet with my intern counselor, which was about once or twice a week, for one period only each time. And even then, I still missed about half of the meetings I set up with her because of my unwillingness to leave my bed. But she was never angry or disappointed in me for blowing her off, in the slightest. She understood what I'm going through. The last time I saw her was a few weeks ago, even though I set up meetings with her every week through email, and of course.. didn't show. Her last day of internship at my school was Tuesday..The day of my realization, but not the day I started going back to school. She had even told me through email that her last day would be Tuesday, but I completely forgot about it because I was busy moping around about my friend not wanting to talk to me. It wasn't until the middle of my school day on Wednesday that I realized she had already left. One of the two people in my life who had helped me through this dark and seemingly endless struggle for the past few months..had left. And I didn't even get to say good bye and thank you in person. I was devastated. I felt terrible. I wanted to immediately leave school and retreat to my bed again... But I didn't. I NEEDED to push through and get through the school day because I have a new resolve I need to carry out. At the end of my school day, her supervisor found me when I was about to leave, and gave me a small yellow envelope. On the front of the envelope, it says ""~Write your own future~"", and came with a pencil taped to it as well. Inside,is a card that says ""Never say never"" with a picture of a blonde dude riding a turtle on it. And inside the card she wrote : 

Dear Wilson,
A cheesy cliche just for you! But it's so true. I know that the state you've been in has been immensely exhausting, but I'm proud that you have continued to try and push yourself to get through day by day. Try your best not to be hard on yourself as far as motivation to change goes. Your future will be more beautiful than you could imagine, just continue giving it a shot. Don't be shy or resistant to asking for help. You hold all the power within you, but it doesn't hurt to get a little bit of guidance. You have so much to offer, Wilson. You're so bright. You are a deep thinker and can hold extensive, engaging conversations. You will and can make people happy and form close relationships. Thank you for trusting me with your inner most thoughts and feelings. Most of all, don't forget that your life and who you are have so much value. I will be thinking of you, and if you ever need, just send over an e-mail. 
Sincerely, Rachel

After reading the words she had written to me, I knew for a FACT that I'm going to change in the following months, and turn my life around. Later that night, I had a brief call with my friend saying I was sorry for being overly attached and suffocating her, and thanked her from the bottom of my heart for not giving up on me when I gave her every reason and chance to. Today, even though I was exhausted mentally and physically from going to school yesterday, I still managed to get out of bed and go back..albeit 2 hours late. And even though I progressively got more and more exhausted through out the day, I still managed to pull through it with a (mostly) positive outlook on everything. I even joined an after school LARPING club, even though I knew it would bring extreme anxiety to me since it's a somewhat big group...buuuut, like I said, I'm planning on making changes in my life, and I NEED to get out of my comfort zone in order to do so. When I got home, I lied in bed for an hour or so, fell asleep, and then woke up. That's when the immense feeling of loneliness and hopelessness began to wrap itself around me again. I told my friend I still wanted to continue our ""break"" until I get a grasp on life again, and become readjusted to it. My family's never home, and when they are, everyone always retreats to their  rooms and that's that.I have no one to talk to. I'm by myself again. I lied in bed for a while staring at my alarm clock, slowly watching the minute numbers get bigger and bigger.I  had fallen into the ""cycle"" again, only after two days of kicking life's ass. But then I heard a voice in my head tell me to get up. ""Pick yourself up"" it said. I then slowly began to repeat that to myself. ""Pick yourself up.Pick yourself up.Pick yourself up. Pick...yourself...up. Pick. Yourself. UP."" I pushed myself off my bed,walked over to my desk, and BAM. Turned on my laptop, got on Reddit, and started writing this. And holy shit, does it feel good. I know it's only day three of this ""progress"" I'm planning on making in my life, and that it could all crumble apart at any time in the near future...But even if it's only been three days, I'm still extremely proud of myself for being able to making positive steps in life again, and...I just wanted to just share that with anyone who wants read this overly lengthy, self absorbed post about my past few days. And to those of you who managed to read through all this...whatever this is, thank you for taking the time to do so"

They want to interview and hire immediately. Problem is, I've never used PHP before. Any tips?

I'm familiar with / used in school C, C++, JavaScript, Scala, Python, but have never looked at PHP. They have seen my resume, which I list these languages (and did not mention PHP), and they seemingly liked my introductory e-mail (they asked for it instead of a cover letter), where I mentioned school and my previous degree (accounting - this is a startup that is making web based software for companies to work with the legal and business side of looking for funding. They're moving in house after using previously 3rd party contractors, so they're also looking to hire full time positions, so I'm worried they may see me as needing more training than they might be able to provide). 

I feel confident that I can explain to them that with my school work (I just finished my JR year of a B.S. in comp sci) I understand programming, and learning a new language isn't a major stumbling block, but any tips in case they ask me a technical question? I'm posting this at night right before bed, and are planning on trying to cram for about 3 hours before the interview. I'm thinking about bringing up the website I helped build in a team recently during a hackathon, and on my personal skills. But if they ask anything about the language I might be hosed. I know it's server side instead of local like JavaScript, but other than that I haven't had a whole lot to look over. I plan on getting a good night's sleep so I can be focused, then looking over what I can in the morning.

For someone who has lived alone for 13 years, this is a big deal. I was a full time grad student doing a paid summer internship, plus working 40 hours/week at one job and about 12 hours/week at another. If that wouldn't have made me busy enough, every time I came home for a while, both of their cars would be in my driveway. I wouldn't have prior knowledge of my parents visit, nor would I have offered consent. On July 5, I had about 2 hours of sleep thanks to fireworks and hospital (work) chaos and got off work early enough to justify a nap. And there they were...Dad was on a ladder painting the house (a project that in fairness to him, he and I had started together) and Nmom was laying in my bed when I got inside. I didn't get my nap. I was fuming so terribly I couldn't even say anything because it was going to be so rage filled and unreasonable! 

So I have bad connotations with summer after that crap virtually every week last year. 

Well, eDad has already started in about the holiday weekend. That's great that he gets a 3-day weekend to kick off this summer. I don't get this weekend off. In fact, I work in a level one trauma center and between alcohol and explosives added in with the usual gang activity that results in a few patients coming in with bullet holes, I'm expecting to work back to back to back unplanned double shifts. I'm expecting to be tired. I'm expecting not to want to do the bathroom remodel eDad wants to do this weekend. 

I said I don't have this weekend off. He suggested coming over in the late afternoon. Call me unreasonable, but do you want someone to come to your house and start tearing it up and moving around at 330 or 4am, especially while you're trying to get ready for work, because time frame wise, that's pretty much what he was suggesting. I put my foot down and I said no. He countered with the mornings. Again I said no. That I was expecting to be tired and didn't know if I would even be home at a reasonable hour. He persisted. I said I'd rather not. He said there were just a few ""quick"" things he needed to do that would move it along faster. I said I'd really rather not but he insisted again and again until I caved and said he would have to be at my house at 8am and leave the second I went to bed (I usually go to bed around 1030am). 

He agreed to those conditions but I'm going to be pissed when he doesn't get up and comes over at 10 instead of is packing up to leave at that time and then doesn't leave for two hours after I ask him to. I'm already anticipating this because I know how it's going to go down. I know this because history has repeated itself time and time again. 

And he's eDad, but I still blame Nmom. She has completely taught him how to treat me. She has taught him that I am not allowed autonomy and that I should be guilted and made to feel ungrateful because they are ALWAYS only trying to help. 

TL;DR: I blame Nmom for the way eDad pushes and pushes and pushes until I cave my boundaries. He's only following directions and he has to live with her, so I have trouble getting mad at him even though it's his choice not to respect my boundaries, too. "

Recently, I've taken a look at our school's ""top"" senior and junior students' linkedin profiles (TAs, student government execs, etc) . 

And holy moly talk about feeling inferior. They have jaw-dropping extra-curriculars that I know I will NEVER be able to obtain. They are a totally different caliber. They have the drive, initiative, people skills and charisma that I will never have. It seems like they leveraged their ECs to land a few summer internships. Then those internships led to big 4 offers and such.

This made me naturally question my future in accounting. Although my GPA is pretty high, I am an average student at best. I probably don't have a single chance of impressing an employer with my list of ECs or work experience.

Should I even bother pursuing accounting? I was planning to get my CPA later. but I'll probably just land some mediocre junior accountant job after graduation. would becoming a CPA even worth it at that point, when there are peers in big 4 or top-tier public firms who have surpassed me in terms of work experience and employ-ability by light years already?  

I am not looking to become a millionaire. I just want to live an average life with decent income and a secure job.

Not sure where I stand,spondulicker,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ladq2/am_i_rocking_the_boat_too_much_not_sure_where_i/,"I recently came in as an IT intern at a small manufacturing plant. (&lt;75 people). I mainly carrying out routine stuff, learning Excel, pivot tables, backing up emails and fixing crashed computers (Why do all office computers use stone age versions of Windows?!)

However the factory has an IT contractor that sometimes comes in. The office team have issues with data and want to carry out analytics for projections. 

We had a short meeting and I casually asked him could I get login/admin details for the work laptop so I could install Google Chrome/Mozilla and maybe install Visual Studio. In fact  I was told by my mentor to not mention the server or the fact I was backing up emails to the contractor , which I didn't. 

He went on about how they pose vulnerabilities and could ""bring down the server and network"" which made no sense to me. I kinda lost my cool and said why not run all the office computers on Linux with VPN's and a ubikey if he was that paranoid. 

He then proceeded to grill me about why I wanted to know Linux (which I never mentioned) or why code in general (wtf) and asked me why would I need VS or to know Visual Basic. (for spreadsheets obviously?!) 

And I try code a little on my downtime anyways... So he brought me down to the manager and I pretty much received a dressing down and the manager sided with him.

 I'm not mad, the guy is crucial to operations. My mentor even said she was disappointed in me and I need to be a better culture fit ... I'm kinda experiencing cognitive dissonance in which I what I asked wasn't that substantial but everyone acts like I committed a massive crime. Would love advice, fresh grad out of college...

Edit. Final bit, he said I should never write Macros on a Excel sheet as they were too ""dangerous"", like I said I have very little experience is this really the case?
And I have very little experience with Linux or servers"

4lagd7,9,2016-05-27,Look to the Sky.,imitators,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4lagd7/look_to_the_sky/,"Do *you* know what it feels like to be called a [LIAR](https://reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4kiv35/ohio_is_there_a_legal_limit_as_to_how_far_a_prank/)? When NO **ONE BELIEVES** what you're SAYING and find **EVERY** EXCUSE to prove you WRONG?

They tried to lock me away. They called me *crazy*. 

""Mr. Knutson, there's no evidence that suggests anything in your [story](https://reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4klwpd/look_to_the_sky/)  occurred."" 

""It's possible you had a small carbon monoxide leak in your home."" 

""You might have a cognitive brain disfunction. You're going to be put under 48 hour watch while we administer a few tests. Once we have the results you are free to leave, sir."" 

""You're a LIAR.""

I left. Who the fuck do they think they are? Police can't find a trace of blood and *I'm* the one that has to be tested for competence?! No. I don't care about those results. They won't tell me a **thing**. 

But enough about my frustrations with law enforcement! I was kidnapped. I escaped!! I'm alive and well. Apparently I imagined the whole thing, too..

It was shortly after 4 a.m.

The obnoxiously loud sound of ""Too Many Cooks"" pierced the air and awoke me from my much-needed beauty sleep. It was the detective telling me I needed to leave the hotel immediately...that I was going under his direct protection until further notice.

From the details he *was* willing to give me, there was a suspicious person at my house. A neighbor called the police to report it, fearing someone may try to break into my home. The patrolman in the area arrived slightly too late but saw a car driving away from my home that he hadn't seen there earlier in the night. Suspicious, he decided to follow to the car (on what I can only assume was a gut feeling) to its destination -- my hotel. 

The detective, Michael, informed that the person walked straight into the hotel and to a room...suggesting that he had already checked in before I had arrived there. 

This wasn't a prank anymore.

He took me to an old office building in a Cleveland neighborhood called Old Brooklyn. The Cleveland Police Department have rooms there specifically for protection of people in high-profile cases (Jimmy Dimora, Ariel Castro, etc.).

We pulled up to the building as the sunlight just began to penetrate the sky. I would love to tell you this was either some creepy, abandoned building that had an oddly nice office setup inside or a normal, functioning building with a sweet, secret room but this was neither. This was an average looking building that clearly hadn't seen use in years but was still well-maintained. It was odd, but not the weirdest thing I've seen in my life. 

As Michael took me inside he let me know that the room I was going to be in was wired from ceiling to floor, and that every single inch of that room was observable by not-so-hidden hidden cameras. A strange gesture of comfort, I'm sure. He wasn't wrong though. 

If you saw this room you would think you were going to be in the next Saw movie. 

There was a small IKEA desk in the corner of the room, a cot with fresh linens next to it, and a small partition that divided the toilet and sink from the rest of the room. Bare, white walls did a great job to hide the cameras in each corner, too. He wasn't lying about the cameras recording everything. I stared at one the entire time I was using the facilities. 

Michael left, but not before he made made a point to tell me that he would be in the adjacent room the entire day and night monitoring the camera feeds so no one could get in...or out without him knowing.

I hit the toilet and went to sleep. There was nothing I could do to entertain myself there and I wasn't exactly too alert after my wake up call. I almost wish I didn't.

I woke up to a person sitting on the floor next to the head of my cot, gun in hand, but not pointing at me. It was just there, oddly. As soon as the person noticed that I was awake (he...she...it?) sprung up and began pacing the room at an unnaturally high speed. I was concerned the damn person would smack into the wall due to not being able to stop. That wasn't the thing that scared me...no, no no no...it was the speaking. This person was *preaching* to me as if I was in his clergy. Not in a coherent, well-formed speech either. They were the same statements over and over again in varying forms of emphasis and tone:

""Find the Sky before you die!"" 

""Find THE Sky before *you* die!"" 

""PASS the torch, pass the torch pass the tooooooorrrrrrrrrcccchhhhhh."" 

""I Urge you!"" 

""I URGE YOU."" 

""YOUWILLKNOWyouwillknowweallknow""

I had no clue what in the literal fuck this person was going on about and at that point I didn't care. I was terrified. I screamed, I yelled, I shrieked, I made every noise humanly possible to get the attention of Michael. 

He never came.

As this person kept pacing and preaching around the room it became increasingly frantic and appeared to almost be...nervous. The arms began flailing with each emphasis of the words. The person was losing control of itself! This was my chance! With all of the strength in my body I pounced on the person while its back was turned to me as it walked to the wall, slamming it's skull into solid, white brick. Blood splattered everywhere like a water balloon full of paint. 

Silence. There was no final breath, exchange of words, or struggle to move. This was cold, instant death. 

I ran. I didn't care who this person was, what they looked like, or where I was. I killed someone. Ended a life. I needed Michael...who was nowhere to be found. The adjacent room was empty, his car was missing, and so was my stuff that I had left with him. I was fucked. 

I went to the police and, not surprisingly, they arrested me and held me in a cell until the officers they sent to investigate reported back. In the meantime I retold my story to two people who were complete dicks -- a detective and a shrink.

We sat there, across the table from each other, for an eternity. No clocks. No windows. Just fluorescent lights and the smell of sanitizing chemicals. We might have been in there for days for all I knew. Then a young man, an intern, probably, came in to the room an handed the detective a manilla folder. As he and the shrink were looking it over, they kept giving me these...looks. Looks of confusion mixed with sympathy. Then they told me what was in the folder -- the message that would send my soul into my shoes....the officers found nothing in the building I claimed to be held at.

Well, I didn't take that lightly. I demanded to speak with Michael. He was *there* and he could at least validate that I was in the building. Anything to get them to believe me!

Michael came in some minutes after my request and sat down on the other side of the shrink. He told them he was, in fact, the detective overseeing my case. I had a very brief sigh of relief until he muttered his next sentence:

""I've never met you, Mr. Knutson.""

""WHO THE FUCK WAS I IN THE CAR WITH?!"" I roared as I leapt at Michael, meeting with the tickling of a electric jolt throughout my body. Goodnight.

----

When I woke up in the hospital, I was told I needed to be kept under a 48-hour watch while they administered a few tests to verify my mental stability and competence. I complied for the duration of the tests, not for the results. Did you know you can check yourself out of a mental hospital? That's not just a joke or rumor. Either that or Metro Hospital is terrible at security. I don't care.

I'm back home. I'm safe. My puppy is okay, albeit very, very hungry. It's a gorgeous day today, low 80s. The sky is clear and picture perfect. I might take my dog for a long walk.

I don't know what to do about the person I killed. I'm not under arrest. What evidence do they have? If there's no body then there's not a single thing I can be guilty of.

I have been posting a lot to this subreddit recently. I have really been struggling to get Python and MySQL to work together and it seems virtually impossible to get Python 3+ to work with MySQL on a Windows machine.

So feeling defeated I am thinking of trying a new strategy and using SQLite. 

I however cannot figure out if this would be acceptable. I am needing a database for the project I'm working on. It for my internship and basically various tables would store log in information as well as projects and their statuses. This would be internally facing so it wouldn't get more than 10k uses even if everyone logged in at the same time. 

So I'm just curious about security, usage, and ability of SQLite? Will is suffice my needs? Or is this not a good library to use with Python? "

4lb21r,21,2016-05-27,I [25F] have been with my boyfriend [33M] for 2.5 years and have been wanting to leave for 2 of them but I can't bring myself to do it,Dani_Harder,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lb21r/i_25f_have_been_with_my_boyfriend_33m_for_25/,"TL;DR: I am dating an insecure, controlling, divorced man with 2 kids and know that this is not the life I want but I can't leave because I feel trapped by indecision and guilt.

(Please forgive me, this is my first post ever)

I met him 2.5 years ago at work. I had known him before while I was an intern and always thought he was cute but never did anything because he was married. After I graduated and started fulltime, he was in my same office and we started dating almost immediately. (He was still in the process of the divorce).

He really fit the bill at the time because I was at a very huge, scary transition in my life and he was there to comfort and guide me thru the 'adulting' and professional waters.

Like in every relationship, the controlling things started out small and harmless. He would make comments about wondering if I got more dressed up on days I knew I would be in front of mechanics at work, so that I would get attention. One of our first huge fights was because I wore a black bra under a red tank top and you could see the outline of the bra slightly. I thought it wasn't a big deal, he thought that because I didn't care, I obviously wanted that sort of 'attention'. 

He rarely wanted me to stay at my own house and would question me so much about what I was doing when I wasn't with him, that it eventually became more trouble than it was worth to go do something on my own.

He is a very smart man so he knows better than to question me outright, but he'll make little passive agressive  comments about everything he doesn't like to the point that I just give in.

As some background, he got divorced because his wife cheated on him with the 20yo down the street and left him. He will never admit it, but he has been extremely burnt by that. 

We have gone through our ups and downs and I have tried very hard to force myself to be happy in the little box he wants me to live in. I was able to actually break up with him for about 3 months last year but I never stopped speaking to him and never got out from under his influence. 

I have worked very hard to get where I am at in life. I came from a very small, redneck town in Georgia and always dreamed of bigger and better things. I graduated from tech with an engineering degree and traveled to 40 countries for free while I was interning for Delta. Before this relationship, I felt like I had opened my mind go everything, that I could accomplish anything, that I could not live in fear. But instead embrace fear and better myself thru it. I feel like this relationship has sucked all of that life out of me and put me in chains. I feel like I might as well have never left that small, redneck town. 

All of that being said, I want to put it out there that he is not a terrible person. He is very loving and very kind and only wants the best for everyone he loves. But he has NO idea how his insecurities and anxieties and controlling tendencies destroy the people he cares for the most. I have tried opening his eyes to this and only end up making myself look and feel crazy in the process. 

I am afraid to leave at this point. I am afraid I am already too damaged by how I have had to learn to interact with him on his level that I'll never be able to have a healthy relationship. I'm afraid I won't be able to live through to withdrawals from our codependent relationship. I'm afraid of the guilt of leaving him and his children being too much and ultimately going back to him. I don't know how to build up the courage to just admit I don't want to be here. 

We get in knock down drag out fights where I'm laying on the floor in the fetal position screaming because he doesn't get it or he's manipulating me or making me look crazy and he actually says 'honey, you're not happy here, this doesn't work. We need to end this' and I'll actually say no! I'll tell him I am happy and I do want to be there and I'll change. I don't know what's wrong with me.

I need a swift kick in the ass, something to get me over this paralysing fear of leaving. I don't know what to do.

I know I probably left out a lot and this may not make sense, but any advise at all would be greatly appreciated."

At the university I'm at, I was placed in a satellite campus my freshman year and I wasn't given proper advising on mandatory courses and had no range of CSE courses that I could take to advance my major. Because of this and a mixture of my grades not doing so hot, I've completed my third year as still undeclared and have reached a dilemma. 

It seems like the best options are either switch to a new major called Data Analytics or transfer to a different university which doesn't have any gpa requirements for cs and complete the degree.

I've had internships at JP Morgan Chase and this summer I'll be at Amazon working as a SDE intern and I've won hackathons with a lot of outside projects under my belt. So, I want to go into CS for my career. I just don't know where the best place would be to go.
Any advice?

Tldr: Should I choose Data Analytics as my new major or complete the CS degree at a less prestigious undergrad university?"

3 months ago I started my first internship on a cargo vessel and I have been hating every single day of it (except the one where I had to use a chainsaw). So after 2,5 years of this 4 year program I decided to quit. I cannot live at the sea. I value my personal life too much and not to mention I get seasick very easily, while the rest is doing just fine. Also this study is worthless if you want a shore-based job, who would have thought? (sarcasm)

So after some thinking I decided to apply for a bachelor mechanical engineering study, which seems like one of the best choices I can make right now. 

What I am good at and want in a career:

* Analytical thinking
* Logic
* Problem solving
* Calculations

I feel like mechanical engineering can give me these, and there are a lot of career possibilities with this study. 

However I have also been thinking about a programming related study. Programming can also be linked to my strong points, which depends of course in what you specialize aswell. However I have heard plenty about self-taught programmers and freelancers who make a decent buck, so I feel like pursuing a study in that field might not be the best choice.

Furthermore I want to quit my internship, but I am not sure yet whether finishing this will give me dispensation for the internship at that study. 

So here I am... Programming a little every night. Are 3 months of hardcore programming enough to find out whether to pursue that instead?"
4lbnc7,5,2016-05-27,Best Conversation Excerpt: CS and College,theOmnipotentKiller,theOmnipotentJournal,https://www.reddit.com/r/theOmnipotentJournal/comments/4lbnc7/best_conversation_excerpt_cs_and_college/,"M: When you were in college, how much of your focus was on growing as an individual? How much was on studies? What kind of end goal did you have in mind?

DD: To answer your question, it's a balance. Not a great answer, I know. When you talk about growth as an individual - that's the primary purpose of college. To figure out what life is all about and how to go about it. For me, this was very important. Having been raised in a fairly typical Indian household, my parents never really cared much about anything else besides studies but i knew how important it was. 

However, growing as an individual is a loose concept - everyone claims to have grown, but did they? I like to set myself goals but there's no clear goals with individual growth So I Set myself unofficial guidelines. 

1. When you meet new people, try to speak as little about yourself as possible and ask questions so you get to know them. 

2. Make a disciplined effort to socialize with people every day. Put it on your calendar of you have to. Freshman year is key. It's when people are ready to meet anyone and everyone. 

3. Get to know professors. They are cauldrons of knowledge and the smartest people on the planet. Just being in their presence teaches you so much. 

4. Have fun and set aside your predisposed judgements. During college, I've seen dudes making out at a gay party don't of my friends wanted to go to, I've had many wild nights, I did drugs i would've judged myself for doing before. And setting aside your judgements really let's you get to know people you couldn't have known otherwise. 

5. Perfect the art of the cold email. Some people call it networking, but it's actually just getting to know people. With employers and people who work in the industry or important people in general - you need to be able to drop a good cold email without sounding like a typical choot. Meeting these people gives you a lot of perspective. 

6. Obviously, do extracurriculars and side projects, follow general news and stuff you're interested in News. Reading books is a huge time commitment. I read many articles. Quartz and Atlantic and new York times and Hacker News and tech Meme. Follow the right people on Twitter and Facebook. Watch the right TED talks and YouTube lectures. Watch Netflix documentaries. Minimize entertainment television watching as far as possible without going insane.

My philosophy with academics in college has from the get go been - when your ass is on fire, you'll do it. I have usually kept individual growth as first priority, with many exceptions of course. But enough coffee and red bull and you'll work through it. My strict minimum was to get a 3.75. That was my goal. If I saw myself teetering to one edge, I'd buck up and re prioritize. Honestly though, you'll hear it from pretty much everybody- the extra effort from 3.75 to 4.0 or from 8.5 to 9.5 is a lot of time that sometimes isn't worth it.

3.75 was what they call magna cum laude

There's three levels of Latin honors and this was the second

M: What did you think you would look like at the end of college- initially, after first year, second year and what was it like in the end?

DD: Academically, preprecollege I wanted to be a CS major. I knew from class 10 I wanted to go to Cornell. Class 12 mein I wanted to apply for Architecture briefly but quickly realized I was a. doing random things to seem unique b. had no prep to be an architect. I started Cornell as an Engg Physics major. I realized it was impossible to do anything significant in the field without getting a PhD. And that's a 10 year commitment that at 18, I wasn't ready to make. Then I switched to MechE/Aerospace. I thought I could do similar things to engg physics and get a job easily afterwards. Within a week, I realized all the companies I wanted to work for don't hire internationals. When looking at the other things I wanted to do - CS and ORIE piqued my interest. CS because I was good at it in high school and it was really easy to make lots of impact. The decision to go into CS was kind of premised on my doing side projects, not (just) a good job after. I wanted to do things and show ""the world"" and help them even in a little way if possible. ORIE is a vague major. Called ORFE in some places. It's basically misc. engineering. There are three broad substreams - Operations Research - a lot of stats and supply chain stuff. Industrial Engineering - similar to OR. and Financial Engineering - lot of stats but very different application. I was into Financial Engineering because it was very applied mathy and the smartest people in the world in math do quant trading. I wasn't really attracted by the money - but knowing that not-so-hard math could make you money on the market. So I ended up doing CS with an external specialization in FE (also called ORIE).

In the middle, I wanted to double major in Econ/Math but  it wasn't feasible for a bunch of reasons.
But I was lucky that I had researched PhD programs, MBA programs, different career tracks, immigraiton issues, internships and feasibility of majors as a freshman - in retrospect one of the luckiest things to have done.

Many of my friends 5 years later absolutely detest the position they're in. They're doing a job they don't like for decent but not extravagant pay and have 0 fulfillment and nothing to look forward to but the weekend.

And those are the lucky ones - many of them have gone back to India on immigration issues or because they couldn't even get hired. It's hard to get hired!

By the end of freshman year, my goal was to do CS. PhD was an open question. I knew I wanted to do high impact internships and work at biggish company (although I wrestled with big company vs startup vs prop trading all the way till I graduated). I wanted to maintain a GPA but I didn't want to sacrifice depth. So I placed out of all the bullshit requirement classes and went as deep as I could into CS.

Up till sophomore year, I wanted to specialize in Graphics. I realized after taking many a PhD class in it, that it was fascinating but far less so when you figured out how it worked and saw it working because of code your wrote. A career in graphics didn't seem to be that fulfilling and you could only really excel in it if you did a PhD. I still wasn't ready to commit. I shifted my focus. Machine Learning was a good next step because I'd already been doing stats in ORIE, and it seemed applicable. I'd be lying if I said the hype didn't contribute to my choice.

I went fairly deep into plain Software Engineering/ AI and ML by the end of school.
Google's internship made me realize that work life is really cushy but can get boring.
Coursera's internship made me meet a ton of other smart people and realize the value of working at a smaller company.

I ended up going with Facebook full-time. It was a huge deliberation at the end but Facebook paid well and I thought the work was impactful and I learnt a lot. I left Facebook for Google because my Google team is far more impactful although the perks are more diluted at Google than FB. I don't know what I want to do with my future now.

I sometimes regret not joining a startup. The reasons I didn't was because the comp is less and the risk is high. It's a long term commitment if you want to see any rewards, and many people have written about how its not worth the risk/reward ratio unless you're one of the founders.

I sometimes regret not joining a prop shop too. I put a lot of value on social benefit of the work I do, but you always question yourself when you're doing it. Grass always seems greener on the other side. Had I been at a prop shop, sure there's no customer facing product but I rake in huge sums of money, work on incredibly hard problems with incredibly smart people.

But I think regret is necessary. It keeps you on your toes. One major thing I've noticed about humans all the way from high school is they have strange coping mechanisms.

1. When they get it their way, even though their way may not be the right way, they're happy.

2. When they are in a poor situation, they tell themselves it's alright and begin to believe they're in a good situation and defend all the decisions they've made up to that point to convince themselves they're doing well. This is common amongst investment bankers and consultants.

personally, I try to be cognizant of that so I can recognize that other people are doing important and cool things and in many cases more important and cooler things. And I think having the right kind of regret keeps you on your toes about the could-haves.


M: Holy shit.

Thanks a lot for that.

It felt like a crash course in your life from pre-college to today.

Mixed with a lot of wisdom

DD: lolol feel free to prod and ask questions about anything in particular

M: The 'coping mechanism' thing you pointed out is fascinating

I noticed parts of it in myself

But you put quite well together

Oh I will have to re-read this a couple times to get a full picture

Thanks

DD: Oh yeah dude
in high school it's everywhere

People hang out with girls to be cool cause they're not doing well in school

People convince themselves the liberal arts is fascinating because they cant do engineering

People find random activities to excel in to because they couldn't excel in the ones their parents actually wanted them to.

And it's not bad - it's important to cope to be sane. And sometimes this blindness creates awesome talent

but I think it's very important to accept it.

Just to say ""Yeah, I suck at this, and I'm trying X out because maybe I'll be better at X. ""
and people throw the word passion around a lot and whatves

M: What is a prop shop?

DD: proprietary trading

small firms no one except the ones who need to have heard of

because they arent' customer facing

they have usually 100-150 employees but upto 1000 at max.

They are extremely exclusive when hiring for their primary roles - Software and Quant/Trading. 

Sometimes they have different approaches to these roles and combine them

To name a few - Jane Street, Five Rings, Two Sigma, RenTech, Citadel, DE Shaw

Most of the employees are IMO medalists or IOI medalists

most of them are from Harvard/Stanford/MIT

these people dont get in because they are from those places


they may get an interview because they are

and then they have to show off their skills

propshops typically hire mostly PhDs in Stats/Math/Physics/CS

to do most of the work and very little is reserved for undergrads

they only hire from elite schools cause there's maybe 10-20 of these companies totally

many of them are secret and not even googlable

and their hiring requirements are 1-2 people a year, and they're okay not hiring 1-2 if they dont find the right canddiate

Not more than 20-50 (I'd estimate) undergrads go into prop shops post undergrad every year

Tower research is a popular one for India operations

Hudson River Trading is another.

and the attraction is

it varies, but people make from 200-400k starting out

and many can hit, performance depenent, 7 figures 2-3 years out of college

in tech, you can start at max 300

first year

but it remains consistent/goes down a little (because first year comp is mostly sign on)

over the course of time

you have to be really good and maybe have minimum 8-10 years industry to hit 7 figs.

and its rare"

Most of my duties are more IT or straight up assistant work. It's great money for me but I have no idea how to learn more throughout this job and I don't know how to make use of it on my resume. I'm constantly moving through the linux file system we have but that's mostly boiled down to ls, cd, less, vi, and running scripts that are already written. I could hardly put any of that down as ""linux admin"" experience on my resume. I haven't written anywhere near enough Python code to put ""Python experience"" on there either. I could put that stuff on there but I would feel like I might be lying on my resume. What should I put on my resume for this job or how should I spin it?

Reasons why this is actual insanity:

- Still don't have a handle on ""high-needs"" baby #1. I mean, seriously, my last post here was about how much I was struggling
- Had some pretty bad PPD/PPA, started Zoloft
- I'm in the 5th year of a soul-crushing PhD program that is already punishing me for daring to procreate in the first place
- Body is still recovering, I can't even run without pain yet goddammit
- No family around
- Likely moving to a new state in a year when I'd be doing an intense clinical internship and have no flexibility for any maternity leave

It’s been a long time, hasn’t it?  

…Not actually — a  few months at most. In the scope of our lives to come, a small blip in a tumbling ride towards eternity.  

Each day passes with you on my mind. Sometimes a fleeting thought — sometimes a full blown sob.  

You have caused me to hurt so much. My internship, all of my nights out, my entire life has been shrouded in this darkness of losing the most special person I’ve ever met. The agony of loneliness and longing. Seeing cute babies and thinking of you and your dreams of being a mother to interracial children.  

I gave you every bone in my body and every effort I could muster. Do you remember when we lay in that hospital bed in the ER, holding each other as tears rolled down our faces, both accepting a bleak future that sang out of chronic illness and future hopsital visits?  

What mattered is that we chose each other. We chose to see each other through all the pain. I would have been there with you at your side at every turn, every dip in your health, every hospital admission.  

When you stopped choosing me, I lost the best friend I’ll ever have, the most inspiring person I’ve ever met. I can’t blame you for it, but I will always resent that it happened.  

Do you ever listen to “X &amp; Y” and cry for what we’ve lost?  

Do you miss my things sprawled across the floor in your hospital room?  

Perhaps you just miss my friendship or hurt at the thought of never speaking to me again. Maybe you feel like we could still be great friends. That is not a part of the future I could bear to live in.  

Today, tomorrow, and for many days to come, I mourn the loss of our relationship and everything that came with it.  "

This resort is unique because it’s ONLY for couples and no one seems to know much about it, as people who won tickets have to sign nondisclosure agreements. But the rumor is that it’s really great, and most importantly one of the most exclusive in the world. I really want to do that trip, but have nobody to go with, so I ""catch"" you and drag you into it so I can go.

In that resort, a lot of activities are organised for couples. We quickly discover that some are mild, and some aren't at all. Romantic dinners, massage lessons with other couples or just the two of us, sexy cooking lessons, but also more kinky ones. Moreover, some employees can give dares to couples every time they see them, from kiss and grope each other right here (“here” being anywhere from an empty corridor public places)or skinny dipping to have sex in that place without getting caught (or make sure you do get caught by somebody). Each couple can choose anytime between 3 categories and activities and dare at the beginning of the day, but won’t know any details until they start. You can be an employee or a fan, or some rich friend and you have to act like your bf. At the beginning You'd probably kind of shy/nervous because of all of this, hanging out and pretending to be with THAT celeb's boyfriend. On my side I'm having a blast, enjoying myself and keeping us from all the things you'd love to try.

And from here, the scenario can go differen ways depending on what you want to do, your kinks &amp; limits… So let’s discuss it

Do youstart to enjoy yourselfself and we both start to take part is more and more daring activities? Do you figure out that you can take advantage of the situation, start to get more and more touchy every time you can? Trying to get us into the hottest activities, and if I refuse to play along threaten to expose us as a fake couple? Or maybe you start to even blackmail me after getting some serious leverage, and get me to do everything you want.

LOTS of possibilities, with either a young celeb and an older employee, assistant, agent... Or an older one with the new intern or some fan she randomly picked, I'm open to suggestions !

Celebrities : Candice Patton (The Flash) - Natalie Dormer, Emilia Clarke, Sophie Turner (GoT) - Lauren Cohan (TWD) - Willa Holland (Arrow) - Chloë Grace Moretz (Kick Ass) - Evangeline Lilly (Lost) - Emma Watson, Scarlett Johansson (Never heard of them ? Seriously?) - Lucy Liu (Kill Bill) - Cobie Smulders (HIMYM) - Penélope Cruz (Vanilla Sky) - Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba (Sin City) - Olga Kurylenko (Quantum of Solace) - Blake Lively (Green Lantern) - Kate Beckinsale (Underworld) - McKayla Maroney (Gymnast) - Natalie Alyn Lind (Gotham) - Alexis Ren (Model)- Your suggestion?

4lcjae,4,2016-05-27,Great internship- Worth getting A+ for general knowledge or go for something else?,CWA_IT,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4lcjae/great_internship_worth_getting_a_for_general/,"[WARNING: Long post but it would help me out SOOO much please read]


I am currently a sophomore in college (20 y/o) majoring in Computer Information Systems. I have not taken any major classes yet, but this upcoming semester I will be getting into more computer based classes. I am fairly new to the IT field and am very interested and eager to learn more, but do not have anything specific I want to go in to yet. I've done some very basic Beta Testing and Desktop Hardware Support.

I recently landed an awesome IT Intern opportunity with a rapidly growing and successful company because their other intern left to pursue other interests. I am basically the ""inhouse IT guy"" here at the office now and it's a bit overwhelming but I am using this experience to learn a lot and grow in the field. They told me they wanted to hire someone to learn and grow with the company rather than hiring a more experienced person that’s sort of a “know it all already”… that’s not what they wanted. The company is also serviced by a good outsourced IT company that overlooks all our servers/switches and what not, so all the pressure is not on me all the time and I can always ask them questions over the phone and they can remote in and show me how to do things (this is how I Learn A LOT). This opportunity is an excellent way to expose me to a variety of things. I am learning how to use the Active Directory, Server Permissions, managing a Domain, how the phone system works basic to advance troubleshooting, business related IT… A whole bunch of things.

Here is what draws me in so much.. this company is small but VERY successful and we are rapidly growing. We are in a wealthy retirement part of Florida, and being a Wealth Management company, there’s a ton of high roller clients that come in to the office. I meet a ton of great people and it is really teaching me how to act and be a professional in the business world. Learning new things everyday gets me excited to work and eager to do my best and excel in my role. Our office has about 15 people in it and it’s honestly very enjoyable to work with everyone here, it’s like family. What I am trying to get at is I see potential in this company and can see myself sticking around for a while, or at least as long as I can throughout college. I have really impressed them in the short amount of time I’ve been there so far, so much that I am getting my own brand new office in our new space we are moving in to soon. The new space is twice as big as our office now and I get to work with the professional IT team setting up our server room, learning about setting up networks, how the cabling works, setting up work stations, etc. Another amazing opportunity to learn and grow.

My main concern is that I feel as if I don’t know as much as I am supposed to. My job here is very Help Desk role. In most cases to obtain a help desk job you need your CompTia A+ certification, and I feel as if I am missing a lot of that information. DON’T GET ME WRONG, I personally believe I am doing a great job helping people out in the office and everyone is very happy with me, but still feel as if I am sort of missing the nitty gritty tech stuff about computers. Granted, I haven’t really taken any computer related classes which I will probably learn about the general knowledge things on the A+. I don’t know if I am just thinking prematurely or just being hard on myself (I am fairly new to IT but have been using computers my whole life).

I wanted to ask you more experience guys, what would you do in my situation? Would it be beneficial for me to study and obtain the A+ even if I don’t plan on leaving for another “entry-level” job, and just for the information? From what I read, it seems like your A+ is good for entry level than anything beyond that it is kind of pointless. I landed a dream entry level position without the A+ (at least I think) and was wondering what I should do? Should I go for the A+ to learn the basic stuff, or just study that on my own and maybe go for other certifications? My main goal is to get a jump start into something that will help me out in the future. I feel as if the more I know and the more I can prove myself to this company, the higher up (and more pay) I can receive. EVEN IF I leave after all, they would be an absolute amazing reference to have and would help me out finding a new position elsewhere (lets say for example when I graduate). What would be the most beneficial for me right now?

So guys, what do you think?

I met this girl at university and was friends with her for 3 years, we lived together in a group of 20 people for the first year, where we met, and then stayed as distant friends for the next two years. We always had a thing for each other but were to shy to say anything.

In the fourth year we went on full year internships to different cities an hour and £20 away from each other. She invited me for her birthday where I met her family and they seemed to like me, and she came around to visit me in my city 3 times within 2 months after that which was nice. The fourth time we were watching a movie in my flat and asked her if she wanted to be in a relationship, she said 'yes' and that she's wanted it for years.

Since then the relationship has gone very slowly. In the 9 months we have been together, we have met up 6 times and went on a 3 day break to Rome for Valentine's Day.

I've been constantly proposing to meet up for the weekend, or to go for a weekend trip somewhere, but every time she's really sorry but she's visiting a friend or family that weekend.

I like her, but I would like to be in a slightly 'tighter' or 'stronger' relationship now and I'm wondering if it's just not the right person, and if I'm being too lazy/scared to break out of it.

Thoughts? What should I do next?"

While in college, pursuing a degree in Information Systems, I got a job at a now defunct airline. It was basically a paid internship to do all sorts of computer related stuff. They were a small airline based in Colorado Springs, CO, and then later in Denver. They attempted to take over another airline and went bankrupt in 1998.

One day before I left work, my boss gives me several long Ethernet cables and tells me ""Go patch in the new modems into the computer network."" So I head down to the data room.

Now, I think it is important that you know that I had only been in a real data room twice before, and I had never worked in one. For those that don't know, they have raised floors so you can run cables under the floor tiles, lots and lots of racks of computer equipment, tons of AC to keep it all cool, etc.

Anyway, I walk in, find the modem bank, find several modems that have no cables attached. I look at the ones that are wired in, follow the cables, figure out where they are plugged into, and wire up the new modems just like those. Then I replace the floor tiles I pulled up and head home for the day.

The next day I come in to work after class is out and my badge doesn't work. The guard tells me to wait. A minute later my boss and two security guards show up and escort me to the CEO's office. Inside the office, besides the CEO, are the CIO, CFO, my boss and the two bosses above him. They start questioning me.

What did I do yesterday at the end of the day? Did I get the modems working? Did I remove floor tiles? Did I notice anything out of the ordinary? Long story short, I had somehow kicked loose the power cable for the main pyramid server that ran the airline. So for 45 minutes, the airline could do nothing. They couldn't sell tickets, make reservations, board planes, take off, etc. Nothing. I was told I cost the airline somewhere near $200,000. I don't know if that is accurate or not. Eventually someone noticed that the server had no power and plugged it back in.

I didn't lose my job over that. They all had a good laugh, and admonished me to be more careful in the future. I suggested that they find a way to lock the cable down, but they rejected that idea.

4ld0xd,2,2016-05-27,I'm (M19) struggling to leave a possibly unhealthy relationship with my boyfriend (M21) of 9 months because of his anxiety and depression.,MajorJackoff,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ld0xd/im_m19_struggling_to_leave_a_possibly_unhealthy/,"I started dating Ryan on basically the first day of my freshman year of college. I met him on move-in day, just a few days after I attempted to end an incredibly unhealthy relationship with a different ex. Things moved very fast very quickly, and just 2 days after we first met and hung out, we were spending 2 full days together at a music festival. I was hesitant to get back into a committed relationship at first because of the one I had just gotten out of and we didn't become exclusive till about 3 months in. In that time I had hooked up with 2 other guys, one of which he was furious when he found out even though we were not exclusive, but he got over it and now regrets how he acted. 


We've had a lot of amazing times together and it's been a really great experience but as many good times as we've had there have been really difficult patches. He deals with intense depression and anxiety that really control his life and make our relationship pretty difficult. He gets upset so easy over pretty irrational things, and I'm not always the most sensitive person around so I set him off easily. He will get incredibly upset with me if I take too long to respond and he's very mistrusting of me when I go out with friends. He's never gotten along with my friends who I am incredibly attached to (we're basically obsessed with each other) and for a good portion of our relationship I have been torn between these two sides. There have been countless times where I have to spend hours on the phone calming him down and it's so much pressure that I end up taking out on myself. He's an amazing person and I don't blame him for everything by any means but he requires so much love and attention and I find myself drifting away and not being able to give him what he needs.


About 3 weeks ago I caused the worst night of his life. I was out with friends at a party and we decided to drunkenly stumble to McDonalds. Along the way we passed by Ryan's apartment and I decided to pop in and give him a kiss and tell him I'd be right back to crash at his place. We ended spending like an hour at McDonalds, then I went back to campus to walk my friends home, and then I charged my phone a little so that I could call an uber because it was dead, but I accidentally fell asleep. When i woke up it was 5 AM and i had about 30 missed calls. Ryan had gotten so anxious that he had a horrible panic attack wondering where I was and began to roam campus at night trying to find me. He was sobbing, hyperventilating, and was barely coherent when I finally got in contact with him. He later told me it was the worst night of his life and that after that he couldn't look at me the same. At the time I was so incredibly sorry, but in retrospect, and with as long as he stayed upset at me, I started to question intensely how ready he was to be in a relationship and whether he was stable enough for it.


About a week later, the night before we were supposed to drive north to the bay area so I could spend a week with him in his childhood home, he tried to break up with me. We were supposed to spend a week north and then I was going to fly home to the midwest, so I had all my stuff in the entire world at his place up north that his dad had already picked up. Everything depended on me going north with him and if he were to break up with me the day before I was beyond fucked. So I was furious, so upset that he would leave me after everything that I had endured for him. I had never lost my temper so hard, and I threw things around the room (a pillow and a stuffed animal so nothing too crazy). He immediately retracted that decision and we decided to stay together, but at that moment I realized that if it wasn't for all my belongings I would have let him do it - something I'm slightly ashamed of but something that told me a lot. I wish I would have just let him do it.


We spent every second of the day together work about 10 whole days following that and it was pretty much fantastic. School always gave him so much anxiety and with that out of the way things were going better. He got really sick with the flu for a couple days (something that really made him irritable and hard to be around) and he became absolutely and frighteningly livid with me for almost losing our pricey Beyonce tickets - the two most notable instances that made me question our relationship that week - but other than that things were great. Flying back home it was hard to leave him, but after a few days at home by myself I found myself missing him less and less. 


Two days ago he had a breakdown. He's starting a tough internship over the summer, living with his parents, and going to be without me for a while and I'm really his crutch for his mental health. He relies on me for a lot and I always took him to therapy and I won't be there to help him. We almost broke up once because I didn't think we would make it through the summer and wanted to end things over spring break but we stuck through it. So two days ago, he felt like everything around him was falling apart, that he hated his mother, wanted to move out, wanted to cut off ties with all his friends, he hated his body, hated his personality, hated his appearance, hated himself and everything and everyone in his life, and he mentioned suicide several times. He has told me several times that he would never go through with it, but this barrage of negativity was so intense and I kept trying to help him but he just kept taking it out on me. I'm around negativity all day when it comes to him and as much as I love him it is so hard, so i snapped. He told me I should leave him and that I'd be happier alone and I said maybe you're right. I opened a dialogue about ending things because our relationship wasn't healthy and I wasn't good for him, and he had such an intense panic attack over the phone with me that he passed out. I called his mother and she took care of him. I told him we should sleep on things and talk tomorrow. 


The next day I wrote a 3 page letter that I read to him, all about how we are on different levels of love and commitment, that this relationship can be unhealthy, that he needs to work on his mental health alone and not rely on me, that I have some of my own issues that I need to work on alone (I also deal with depression and have come to realize that I don't think I'm meant to be a monogamous person, something I've always struggled with) and that we need to just be friends. There's nothing I want more than to still keep in contact with him and be there for him whenever I can, but he is entirely an all or nothing person and is telling me he will cut off all ties with me if we are over. We talked on the phone yesterday for 2 hours after he heard my letter, and he refused to let me go. He begged and pleaded me, said things would change and get better, but I knew that our issues were things that weren't going to change while we were together. I'm afraid I've already moved on and that he will never accept that. I'm afraid of what he might do to himself if he leaves. I decided we would give it one more day, and this morning I woke up to 3 voicemails, a slew of snapchats, and a million messages, all begging me to stay.


He has been telling me I'm a horrible person for not including him in this decision and that I have broken his heart forever. He says he will never be able to let anyone in again and that he will never recover from this. He says he won't keep someone who would do this to someone they love in his life. I can't help but feel like he's manipulating me, something that I've felt throughout our relationship. Using his mental health against me to trap me. He says he needs to be included in the decision, but if I'm not mistaken, that's not how breakups work??? I told him that I've endured so much for him, sacrificed so much, and been so loving and caring through this whole relationship and that if he really thinks saying goodbye to me forever is rational then so be it. As of now we still haven't officially ended, and he refuses to accept that we might be over. I need to know how to make him see that we shouldn't be together and how to end things without him hating me forever and never speaking to me. I want what's best for him and I'm not sure I'm making the right decision. This is the hardest thing I've ever done in my life and I really need some advice.

 


   
**tl;dr**: Trying to break up with my boyfriend of 9 months, we have had an incredibly rocky relationship because of his depression and anxiety and also my own issues, and he refuses to let me say goodbye and threatens to cut me out of his life forever. How do I end things in a way that he can accept and that will keep us together as friends?"

Computer science is my passion and I was hoping to get an internship related to that, but opportunities seem scarce. How should I go about looking for an internship that's at least kind of related? Are there any possibly easier options I should look into that would still benefit a career in computer science?

I've seen some other posts from highschoolers, but most of the comments are the same. Do personal projects (I have), extracurriculars (I do programming for a robotics a team), or use family or friends to get an in somewhere (not an option). If I absolutely have to get an internship and have the experience to back it, where do I look for places that would accept me?

4ldbvi,6,2016-05-27,Job offer advice,speechpathstudent,slp,https://www.reddit.com/r/slp/comments/4ldbvi/job_offer_advice/,"Hello everyone and thanks in advance.
I just graduated this spring with my master’s in speech pathology. I am interested in working in an acute care hospital and had the opportunity to complete both of my internships at acute care hospitals.  I started my job search at the beginning of March and unfortunately was having a hard time finding employment in an acute care or rehab hospital setting.  I then started applying to companies that contract out to the schools as I was getting desperate about finding a job (overall the SLP market is saturated in my city). The day of my graduation a per diem position did become available at one of the hospitals I completed my internship and I applied.  I listed two of my supervisors from the hospital as my references and one of them emailed me letting me know she had spoken with the therapy manager stating how she was sure I would be great for the position and about her positive experience working with me. I interviewed for the position and hadn’t heard back and was not sure I would be extended an offer. Then this week one of the school-based contract companies made me an offer.  I would have to relocate but the offer is great plus I would be guaranteed 40 hours a week so that I can complete my CFY in 9 months. This was the only offer I had so I was willing to accept it. Then right after receiving this offer, I also ended up getting an offer for the per diem position at the hospital I interned at.  I was so excited when I got the phone call that I immediately said yes when asked if I accepted.  My family is questioning whether I should accept this offer since it is per diem and I don’t have another offer in my city, they think I should take the offer with the contract company (full-time with benefits, guaranteed 40 hours and thus can compete CFY in 9 months). However, I feel that it would be unprofessional to decline an offer I had already verbally accepted.  I would also feel bad because my supervisor took the time to speak positively on my behalf with the therapy manager at the hospital.  I am not sure what to do.

4lde09,48,2016-05-27,Me [19F] living with my abusive brother [22M] at home with submissive parents,seozeo,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lde09/me_19f_living_with_my_abusive_brother_22m_at_home/,"Throwaway account because I have only ever told one person about this

My oldest brother (I'll call him Jeff) moved back home from college about a month ago because he got an internship nearby, and so far, I have been nothing but on edge and miserable. We have never had a 'normal' relationship, at least from my perspective. I feared Jeff from a very young age because he used to physically abuse my twin brother (let's call him Evan) and verbally abuse the both of us, among other things I don't know how to categorize. This, of course, occurred when both of my parents weren't around.

I genuinely thought, as an extremely naive little girl, that Jeff and Evan were playing. I remember Jeff would hold Evan under a blanket, making it difficult to breathe, for minutes on end. Jeff would tell Evan to lie on his back and he would hold Evan's legs in the air and stomp his genitals, pretending he was driving a car. Jeff would take this large bin (I think it was for Lego's), put Evan inside of it, and sit on it so he couldn't get out. Evan, on top of being 3 years younger than him, was also always very small and he was very passive. Again, thinking they were playing, I never felt a reason to tell my parents.

But when Evan and I were in 3rd grade, Jeff (6th grade) got very angry, wrapped his hands around Evan's neck, and shoved him into a wall. I was scared and so for the first time, I told my parents what happened. They didn't believe me. They told me the two were probably boys just being boys and play-fighting and I interpreted it the wrong way. And from then on, my parents never believed me and I quickly gave up trying to tell them. Evan never went to them about it, most likely out of fear. 

Then it came to 4th grade. Up until this point, Jeff never laid hands on me. He did sometimes make me strip down (as well as Evan) in front of him because we 'smelled bad'. He was my older brother and he was in charge when my parents weren't home. It was embarrassing but he was the oldest and we were told we had to listen to him, so we did.

One night in 4th grade, Jeff came into my room. I somehow forgot about this night until fairly recently when I was talking to my boyfriend about my situation with my family. Jeff came in and I woke up when he started touching me. I was scared and I wasn't sure what was happening to me so I kept my eyes and mouth shut. I guess I pretended to sleep through it. He touched up and down under my clothes and stuck his fingers inside of me. Thinking about it now breaks me but also makes me incredibly angry. I should've screamed and had my parents, whose room was right next to mine, come running in, but I didn't.

When he stopped, I waited for a long time to open my eyes. When I did, he was still in my room. He was standing at my doorway and this visual became a recurring nightmare that I never connected to that night until now. The lights were off in my room but the light in the hallway was on so all I saw was a dark figure standing in my doorway. I don't know if he wanted to see if I was awake or if he wanted to make sure I saw him, but I saw him. I never saw his face but it couldn't have been anyone else. He was too short to be my 6'+ dad (and my dad would never do such a thing) and too tall to be little Evan (he wouldn't do it either). I never told my parents about that night, and I still haven't (for reasons I will explain). They never believed me before, so why would they believe me then?

I don't remember much after that. He stopped making us undress after a while but he did continue to beat Evan. Evan sometimes fought back by yelling at him, never physically because he would definitely lose, and that would only make Jeff angrier and more aggressive. The choke against the wall became a classic and I only intervened when that happened. I was scared, but now I wish I would've stood up for my own twin. 

Jeff quickly became more bold and started yelling at our mom, but only when my dad wasn't around. My dad travels for his work and he's home maybe half of any given year, and even when he's home, he spends a lot of time golfing and such. Jeff took advantage of my mom's lack of discipline. She hardly punished us or made us do chores. He would argue with her about anything and she would let him win. This became normal for Jeff to basically take control of the house when dad was gone.

This abruptly stopped when Evan moved out and went to college. For the first time, our home was a peaceful and quiet and safe. Jeff hardly called or came home for a while, which was a blessing. Evan and I grew apart during this time because I switched to a public high school while he continued to go private. He hated Jeff more than I did, but little did I know, Evan started forgiving and forgetting their past as brothers. When Jeff did come home, the two of them got along well. It bothered me but it was Evan's choice to do what he wanted. 

But I started having breakdowns whenever Jeff came home. I would sit in my room and cry when Jeff was around. I had anxiety attacks and emotional breakdowns in the private school, which caused me to switch out, but it continued in the public school. I just assumed I just could not handle the stress of school. My grades tanked and I decided to take time away from academics, which is why I'm living at home now. 

Sorry for all that background. I'm not entirely sure what is important to share so I put it all out there.

Fast forwarding to now, I live at home because I just started attending community college. My plan is to transfer to a university within the next 2 years and move in with my long distance boyfriend, who is the only one that knows of my childhood and my current situation. But I'm not sure I can handle this for 2 more years, especially since it looks like Jeff is moving back in during that time.

Jeff, although he only came home for short breaks and some holidays and such, has always tormented me about my choice to stay away from school. After he moved on from bullying Evan, he started verbally attacking me every chance he got. He called me stupid, worthless, ugly, every name he could think of. His pet name for me might as well be 'bitch'. Now that he's moved back in, I get to hear it every single day. 

I'm not very strong emotionally. Everything and anything makes me cry, and I'm not proud of it. Every single time he insults me, it hurts. After all these years, I shouldn't care what he has to say because he's not my brother. No real brother would ever do any of these things to their own sister. But I even take words of strangers to heart. I have never cried in front of him because I don't want him to think I'm weak, but I often go back to my room and just cry.

I relied on the rest of my family for at least a little bit of emotional support, but just this month, I don't think I have even the slightest bit from any one of them.

Jeff, Evan and I went out to lunch about two weeks ago. It wasn't my choice as I hated spending more time than I had to with Jeff, but Evan was picking me up after class and Jeff tagged along. During the drive, Evan and I were talking about the private high school and about the staff we liked and disliked. Jeff interrupts and says, ""You know, you're not likable. You shouldn't talk. You're a complete bitch."" And I sat silently. This wasn't the first time he said something along those lines to me. Not just the bitch part, but the fact that no one likes me and that I'm not sociable.

I admit, I don't have many friends. I've had trouble keeping long-term friends except two: my closest girlfriend and my boyfriend. I am not ashamed of that. I'm extremely shy and I can be really awkward. I'm also really insecure, so having someone like Jeff point out all of my insecurities really gets to me.

But the worst part was that Evan agreed. He laughed and agreed with the guy who beat him his whole childhood. So I sat in the back silently and held my tears back. I never talk back to Jeff because I feel like it's unnecessary conflict and I'm not a confrontational person. I would probably end up crying anyways and that doesn't help any arguments. That day, I gave up on my twin brother. I didn't have him on my side anymore.

Now, regarding my mother and the situation with Jeff, it's just hard. She blames herself for raising him wrong, but she keeps enabling him. She continues to let him talk down to her and then treats it like nothing happened. I do often tell my mom about how Jeff talks to me and how I can't stand him but she always tells me, ""He's your brother. When your father and I are gone, you're only going to have your brothers left."" and ""Forgive him, he's your brother."" I haven't told her about what happened in 4th grade because I truly don't think she'll believe me. But she insists I let Jeff treat me the way he does because we share the same blood. My mom has been saying this since I started complaining about him to her, and I don't think she'll ever change her mind. He's her baby and I don't understand what it's like to be a mother, so I don't blame her. But she will never understand my side of things.

Finally, my father. I love my dad. I've always been daddy's little girl. I used to cry every time he left to travel and cry when he came back because I was so happy. But we grew apart too. When he was gone, we hardly talked because he was busy working and I was busy with school. When he was home, we still didn't spend much time together. Now, I can barely tell the difference if he's home or not. It's sad to think about but that's how our relationship is now. Still, I loved my dad and appreciated all the sacrifices he made for us and how hard of a worker he is. 

I don't know how much my mom told him about the things Jeff says or does. Up until today, I thought Jeff only acted up because my dad wasn't around to set him straight. But this morning, I got up to take out the trash. Walking through the kitchen, my dad asked me for water. I went and grabbed a water bottle and when I took it over to him, I opened it for him out of habit of doing it for my mom when she hurt her wrist. Jeff was walking by and, right in front of my dad, said, ""Why didn't you get him a new one, you bitch?"" He assumed I gave my dad one that was already open (not excusing him calling me a bitch, but that's probably what he saw).

I stood there for a moment because he never talked to me like that in front of my dad. My dad was more or less an emotional shield from him. So I told him I just got him a new one and opened it for him. Jeff walked away without apologizing or saying anything. My dad also didn't say anything. He sat there and kept eating his breakfast. After a minute or two of me staring blankly at him, my dad tried to change the subject. He didn't even try to address the fact that his son called his own daughter a bitch in front of his face.

My dad is a gentle giant. Not shy necessarily, but calm and quiet, but he knows how and when to put his foot down. He doesn't tolerate swearing or rudeness. I've only seen him get mad maybe four times in my life, and in those moments, he had every reason to, and he is terrifying when mad. He is the only one that has disciplined my brother for how he acts. But I guess this morning was fine for him.

I feel alone. I never thought I could be so lonely when living with my whole family. These are the people that are supposed to love me unconditionally and support me, but I don't think any one of them is on my side. I'm not asking that my parents disown my brother or anything drastic, just a little bit of emotional help. 

My boyfriend is all I really have right now, but he's a couple states away. I love him to death and he worries for me and suggested I move in with him, but I can't even if I wanted to. I don't want to be a burden to him because that's all I would be if I just got up and left. I need to get through community college because I truly do want to transfer to a university one day and finish my education. I feel behind enough as it is after taking a year off and I don't think I'll be able to continue going to school if I don't have my dad's financial support.

I really just don't know what to do. I can't stand to live with him, but I've never confronted him and I'm scared to. I don't have my twin or either of my parents to back me. 

I thought I could suck it up and go through at least a year and a half of him until I move out into a university so I can get away from him without ever confronting him, but after this morning, I don't think I can. Not by myself.

I'm sorry for how lengthy this was. Thank you for reading.

**tl;dr**: My emotionally and physically abusive older brother moved back home and I have to live with him for at least 1.5 years until I can transfer to an out-of-state university. One way or another, my entire family seems to be on his side and I really don't know if I can live like this for much longer. Is there anything I can do? "

I am in a dilemma right now.  I found that after countless interviews and failing them all it is probably best that I go back to school. I already have a Masters in CS after receiving a bachelors degree in social science (don't want to say the major). I don't have a job anymore and am not sure what else I can do. I figure I should look into another career, but I already switched careers and invested too much time in CS for me to just up and quit. So I want to continue down this path, plus I love it still. I just suck at interviewing. I do in fact get phone interviews, but recently the phone interviews seem to be getting harder (at least for the Big 4 type of companies) and I sometimes struggle to do the easier phone screen or onsite interviews for medium or small companies.  Still I received 0 offers. I thought by going back to school it would give me more time to learn about CS and give me yet another chance at finding an internship (cannot do it now since I am out of school a few years) and plus I feel like companies love hiring interns/new grads. Is it a bad idea to go back to school? It is hard to say if I need the education or not, but seeing as I am not hireable maybe I am answering my own question here..."

To start with some background, me and her met freshman year of college.  This was my first relationship, she had been in a serious one before me where her heart was broken because her ex got “bored of her” and a couple little ones.  She friendzoned me at first, pretty damn hard.  Like really hard. If you saw us anywhere you would have thought we were dating.  Somehow someway I got us to the point where we were friends with benefits the last couple months of freshman year. Yes I got out of the friendzone somehow.  It was a mutual agreement that nothing would come out of it, and we would stop once summer came.  I wanted to enjoy my college years I didn’t want to be tied down.  Then one of the last days, she asked if we were really gonna be done, because she didn’t want to be.  That got me thinking hard, and I realized I wouldn’t be ruining my college years if I was with her.  She was my best friend and I was having the best times of my life with her. So I went with it and we were officially dating early june that summer.  Fast forward to now, it is almost our two year anniversary, I still can’t believe that.  Anyway, we broke up last summer because she felt I stopped trying.  That only lasted a day or two and we were back together and we have been having a great time up until this semester.  That was our only previous time breaking up.  Now it was junior year, classes were starting to get real hard, we both got full time internship positions 40 hours a week, and both participated in extra curricular activities.  It was real hard to balance everything on top of the relationship, and I know I’m to blame for that.  I can’t use that as an excuse, I was just not used to all the stress and pressure.  I was still relatively new to the whole relationship thing and took my first big step in the real world.  We hadn’t been on a real date just us too since Valentine’s day.  This was a big problem.  We always spent time together doing everything and anything.  This semester made that really hard.  We both didn’t get back until at the earliest 6 every day, and then we had class or practice or a game or something.  We barely had sex too this semester.  I know sex isn’t the only thing that matters, but when we were both as stressed as we were, we needed it and we simply couldn’t do it, especially being young and having sex all the time previously.  My roommate had an internship as well, so we pretty much had the same schedule.  So when she was in the room so was he.  Whenever we were together we were either cuddling watching tv, which is great, but when we did so much before that, just doing that made us feel bored.  Weekends we would do homework during the day then we would drink with our friends and go to sleep after.  I know a relationship isn’t going to remain healthy if we aren’t spending quality time together or even having sex.   Not that it wasn’t quality time when we would cuddle, sleep, drink together, but we didn’t do anything like we used to. The semester was a big change for us and I couldn’t handle it.  I was looking forward to the summer because it was gonna get so much easier, and go back to the old ways.  But that’s where the problem starts because we brokeup just before the summer.

We broke up about a month ago now after we fought in a night club.  It was a little fight like always we have never really had a crazy big fight, just little ones and we always got past them, but for some reason this one exploded to the point where we weren’t talking that night.  It was a stupid drunk fight that I wish never happened.  We were leaving in separate cars and I tried to kiss her at the end of the night and she wouldn’t kiss me, so I stormed out and left.  She texted me when she got back home saying something along the line of “I got back safe if you even care.” Where I replied “of course I care” and we went back and forth where I eventually said “I know we are fighting but I still love you with all my heart and I always will.” To which she replied “No you don’t.”  The pushed me over the edge.  I lived by never letting her go to sleep upset, but I was so shocked when she said that.  I went to sleep and didn’t text her at all the next day.  See whenever we get into a little fight and get into those phases where we don’t text for a couple hours and I always had to be the one to break the silence, then we would talk, and we’d be fine.  I didn’t want to be the one who broke the silence this time, I wanted her to show she cared.  That next day I was going to the casino/clubs for my friends 21st birthday.  I sat outside in my car right before I left hoping she would text me, and she did luckily.  And that led to her being upset that I was gonna leave and not say goodbye.  Which yea that is completely my fault I just really wanted her to contact me first and show she cared, and it appeared she wanted the same from me.  She came outside and we talked for a couple minutes then I had to go because as I said I needed to leave for my friends birthday, they were already waiting on me, but I knew it didn’t feel good.  I asked her to kiss me before I left and she was just so upset and stressed, that kiss is all I can think about right now, it just felt so different and not right.  I wish I stayed and never left, I wish I didn’t leave her upset like that.  When I got to the hotel I was texting her saying I was sorry for what I did and how I didn’t mean to hurt her.  She said it just really really hurt her that I was going to leave without saying bye to her.  I know it was a really dick move I know, but I just wanted her to reach out to me first.

When I got back the next day we talked that night, and that’s when she said she couldn’t do it anymore.  I told her I could fix it, I told her it was gonna get easier in the summer, and all she kept saying was she can’t.  She was tired of the fighting, as was I , but I really feel like we could get past this.  We talked almost every night about us after that one, pretty much just me saying I can fix it give me the chance too, its gonna be easier in the summer.  But she wouldn’t budge. 

The second time we talked she did budge.  It was such a good conversation.  It wasn’t  just me begging her to take me back. It was me saying what I was gonna do different, and even her saying what she would do different.  All the past time it was just me, but this time she was actually inputting her thoughts how we can make it work.  She asked if I wanted to lay down and of course I said yes. We were just laying there cuddling and talking and she initiated a hookup, literally blatantly asked to.  So I did because she wanted to.  So after all the tears and going back and forth we hooked up, and I felt so relieved because she initiated it, she wanted to do that.  So I felt like we were fine, not great like we were, but it was a step in the right direction.  We hooked up, talked and acted like we used to and then I left so she could go to sleep.  Then next day I went to see with a big smile on my face and she drops “ I can’t do this” on me.  Never has my heart sunk more than it did in that moment.  I thought we were fine at that point.  She wanted to hookup with me, she wanted to fix it too, not just me, and now all of a sudden she can’t again.

We talked almost every day about this I couldn’t just let her go.  It was VERY frustrating for the both of us.  Every conversation ended up with me crying saying I can fix it give me a chance and her saying you can’t I don’t see you in my future, my hearts not there anymore.

This is where I don’t understand and just can’t let her go.  We’re young, we haven’t dated a lifetime, but she always dropped hints at the future, where she wants her wedding, houses, kids, cars, everything like that.  I don’t understand how she can feel that way after one drunken fight at a night club. 
We have had great talks about this, but then some end up with her getting so bitchy saying I don’t want to date you, I’m not going to give you a chance, stuff like that.
We slept together everynight that school year, fall and spring semester.  We didn’t go on many dates or have sex much spring semester, but she woke up in my arms every morning.  She was in love with for so long, and then it just disappears? It doesn’t make sense.

I’ve told her I don’t know how many times don’t lose this over a stupid fight at Rho, and she says its not just that, things built up.  But she never told me anything that bothered her. She randomly brought up things that upset her, which we’ve talked about forever ago, which we moved on from , so why is that effecting us now.  For example, I was not close with my family at all and she hated that.  She wanted the person she married to have a close family just like hers.  So I worked my ass off on that, we are closer than ever and she saw that change, but now she says she shouldn’t have to tell me to fix that? Yea I know they are my family, but you are in a relationship with me, are you not supposed to tell me when something bothers you, so I can fix it? I can’t just know everything and fix every little thing.  Same thing with my confidence, she wants someone who is confident, and I’m the first to admit I’m not, but I’ve worked my ass off on that too.  She brings up little things in our conversations that upset her, things I did that she has forgiven me for, but she says she never forgets them.  Yea you don’t forgive to forget, shes done some things where I’ve forgiven her but I’ve never forgotten, but I don’t think about them ever.  And I feel like she hasn’t thought about any of these things shes brought up before our fight, like its all just coming up now for some reason, its in our past, why is it affecting us now.  I don’t get it.

We told each other how much we loved each other, how much we were in love with each other, how grateful we were for each other, every single day up until this fight happened.  That’s why it doesn’t make sense.  If this has been “building up” why were we sleeping together every night with me thinking we were perfect?  That’s something I’ve been saying we just need to communicate better, and she even said that the night we hooked up and thought we fine.
After the semester ended, we talked one last night,  and I did not want that night to end because we still weren’t back together and I didn’t want us to be apart in this situation.  We got food brought it back to her room, we ate, I helped her pack her room then her car, and then I had to leave it was late cause she had to move out early.  

So we were both home now and we pretty much every day we were talking about this, mostly me saying I can fix it let me fix it, send all these long messages.  Then it got to a point where she said she can’t keep talking about this its stressing her out too much.  She wanted “space” but said we can still talk just not about us until her vacation, where she didn’t want to talk at all because she wanted to relax and gain some perspective. (Just got back yesterday).  Space is never good in my eyes, but I wanted to respect her wish.  I told her I wouldn’t text her unless she reached out to me, because she said all those long messages non-stop were just pushing her away more and more.  I didn’t want to risk doing that so I tried my hardest not to.  Two days went by from that moment, and then she texted me, just some random thing about school.  I was doing fine, I wasn’t texting her, and then she had to text me after two damn days.  This led into us talking, just normal conversations, not about us. But it eventually led to the usual begging for a chance and it just kept going no where.  This happened up until the day before her 10 day vacation, where I did not contact her once, which was very hard for me.  I texted her last night on her flight home to have a safe flight and then we talked a little when she got home, and today but its still the same.  

She said she doesn’t want to give me a chance because what’s the point if her heart isn’t in it.  Her heart isn’t in it right now, right now.  I slacked this semester I wasn’t the real me, I fucked up a couple times.  She says her feelings won’t change.  They changed freshman year when I was just her friend, they changed the one time we broke up, and then had an amazing year.
I am head over heels for this girl, this has been the most difficult time in my life.  I can’t eat, sleep, do work, anything without thinking of her.  I wake up, think of her.  Think of her all day at work.  Then I think of her until I go to sleep.
We have the same friend group.  Next year I’m not gonna be able to be in the same room as her, not being able to kiss her and pinch her butt, hug her, play with her hair like I always did.  I can’t handle that.  Everyday these stupid thoughts of her with another guy just play through my head non-stop  and it destroys me.

I know part of her still sees me in her future and I feel like she’s afraid to accept that for some reason.  
She’s gone from no to maybe to no to I don’t know to yes to no to maybe to no.  I know she isn’t 100% on this decision.
And yea I want to be back with her tomorrow that would be great, but I don’t want to be with her if she doesn’t want to be with me, I don’t want to marry someone that doesn’t want to marry me, I don’t want to have kids with someone who doesn’t want to have kids with me.  But she did want all of that and more.  Yea feelings change I understand that, but all of this, all so sudden? It can’t be the end, we were so perfect up until this who ordeal.  I’m not asking her to get back with me and pretend everything is fine and dandy, I want to take it slow and build it back up to where we were, where we were just so happy together, I want to show her the real me again, and then I want to be back with her.  I had so much planned for this summer, so many things she would have loved.

I just want things to go back to how they were.  I’m sorry if this is sloppy, I kept going back in and adding things in random places.

She initiated a hookup with me, she doesn't seem positive no matter how much she says she is, deep down I know she is still in love with me.  Also forgot to mention she doesn't want to lose me, she wants to stay friends with me, but I can't do that to myself, that's why I am fighting so hard.  I am either going to be with her or remove her from my life completely, and there's only one of those i want.

I always treated her like a princess and told her every day how much I loved her.  I slacked this last semester but I just want to make it up, I know I can

Please just give me some advice on how to get her back.  I don’t want to move on.  I can’t right now. 

TLDR
Girlfriend and I got into a drunken fight at a night club, led to us breaking up.  Constant talking about us, she initiates hookup with me, she doesn't see me in her future, keeps changing her mind, I went NC for 10 days while she was on vacation per her request, I am still in the same boat after those 10 days.  just want her back.

I've spent the last year or so attending a very small art school I was very unhappy with. While I was there I wrote and read more scripts. Unfortunately the screenwriting program at my school had few students and none of them had the same level of motivation that I have and saw writing as an easy way to get a career in the film industry. All in all a pretty toxic environment for a young screenwriter, which is why I decided to leave. Anyways, since my rejection I have been trying to find a way out so I don't end up as a total failure. My uncle is a very successful screenwriter (oddly enough, the screenwriting teacher at my school was a huge fan of his.) in Hollywood and I was wondering how I would go about squeezing an internship or anything really from him. Have any of you gotten work from relatives in the past? How should I go about doing this? "

I just graduated college with a Civil Engineering degree this month, but I have been trying to figure out what I want to do as a career. I could have been a Marine Officer right now, but I realized after training last summer that none of the jobs really interested me.

I started to look for engineering internships and I quickly secured an internship after I was offered the position during January. An Alumni worked at the office and he basically got me the position. Well during that time, I took classes outside of my major and started to volunteer at hospitals and talked to different people of different professions. I realized that I wanted to become a doctor and I will be going back to school in the Fall to take my pre med classes.

Well the internship lasts until mid-August and is a Monday-Friday 8-5 job. I need to get hours to shadow doctors. I have found an Alumni that is willing to let me shadow him, but he doesn't work on weekends of course. 

Do you guys think it is unreasonable to explain my situation to my boss and ask to leave one day out of the week after 12 so I can go shadow the doctor?

If not, what should I do at this point?"

4ldxj0,6,2016-05-27,Can no longer live in the same city as my NMom,PastyJournalist,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4ldxj0/can_no_longer_live_in_the_same_city_as_my_nmom/,"So, my mom is close to 80. Still in good health, but an absolute drain on me, emotionally, and esteem-wise. Today, I ended up taking an entire day off from my job (where vacation days are a cherished asset) to decorate graves. For nearly 3 hours, I either heard how I was in the wrong lane (it was an Interstate), or the typical self-pitying things that an nmom would vent about (""I wrote the book about stomach pain"" and ""Well, now everyone will be able to go to a football game this year except me"" - when I told her I'd take her, she said ""well, you know I can't want up those steps, it'd kill me""). When I dropped off her, she nearly tripped over her dog, and she yelled loud enough for the neighbors to hear. It just was the final blow of many today. 

I know my psychiatrist and counselor say 'you can't run away from your problems' - but I was a changed person when I was able to even get away for 3 months for an internship. The only problem is that I'm in a tech industry that's extremely competitive, and I can't just up and leave and wait for a few months for employment to come my way - I have to secure a job first. 

I hate to say I'm envious of a few of my friends, but I would be lying if I said i wasn't envious - how some of my friends are able to make the geographic move so easily. As for me, I keep applying. And I know each application, you have to convince them that you're moving because this job is the perfect fit, not that you're trying to escape. But each job rejection (I'm guessing there are about 60-80 applicants in-city that I'm competing against) - only deals another blow to my self-esteem. 

But, I'm waving the white flag. She moved up here to be closer to me and my sister. But now, I'm at an absolute breaking point. 

Side note - I live cross-town - and she dog sits my dog while I'm at work. One moment, she want my dog around to keep her dog company, and she said it's good for her dog. The next moment, I'm hearing how she's trapped in her house because of ""the dogs"" and how she does so much for everyone else, and no one else does anything for her. 

Sub-note, I also mow her yard at least once a week, but usually twice during growing seasons, and pick up her brother, who lives in an assisted care center, and drive him to her place every Saturday, despite me having two jobs - one full-time, one as a freelance writer.

4led6c,7,2016-05-28,Trouble with jobs,yavvy,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/4led6c/trouble_with_jobs/,"I'm worried that I'm not mentally healthy enough to keep working. I've been at my first job as a software developer for one year now, and its been so tough. Delusions aside, I had to hide the periods where I'd be at my desk and could not code, I felt that I had to finish worrying about an imagined life threatening situation and that often took 30 minutes.

I also had extreme tiredness from clozaril until I got off it and stayed with only Latuda. I was almost fired because I could not stay awake in meetings.

Then I had a couple of months of increasing body paralysis, I was on crutches to help getting around until it was so bad I couldn't get to work, the last day of it my boyfriend had to help bend my knees so I could sit down or even get over the 1 inch threshold between rooms. My psychiatrist told me it was conversion disorder, the next day I was back at work moving freely.

And then it happened again with foot pain, and I had another miraculous recovery.

Now, as of today it's been 1 week of extreme stress, paranoia, and suicidal thoughts. I don't know what to do... but if I just keep going at work I'm going to end up in the hospital or worse.

I had to stop the computer science PhD program I was in because of mental health, I left with a master's. Even my first summer job at a store and my college internship were so hard to get through every say.

Can I really not do everything I have in mind for myself succeeding?

I loved it there and put a lot of work in, so they offered me a part-time position as a developer while I go to college. 

By the time I graduate I will have 2.5-3 years experience (albeit part-time) as a developer and only one internship (at the same company). 

I am afraid this will make me too experienced for graduate programs and too young for junior positions when I graduate. Are these years true, or is my work experience only a good thing? Should I consider pursuing internships at larger/more prestigious companies?"

4leve0,3,2016-05-28,Considering a Career Change into Teaching,lizzie_90,teaching,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/4leve0/considering_a_career_change_into_teaching/,"Hello Fellow Reddit Teachers! To make my long story short I'm 26 and I graduated from college in 2013 worked hard to get my B.S. in Business with a focus in Marketing (first out of my parents to graduate with a college degree). Coming out of college I got into event and wedding planning for a couple years. After that job I tried doing a marketing job for a year and I absolutely hated it. Now I'm back in the wedding and events world but one thing has been coming across my mind a lot that I used to want to do and its teaching. For the longest time I wanted to be an elementary school teacher. I did a couple reports in middle school on teaching and took some classes at my high school in child development and ROP Careers with Children. I even took a class where I interned in a couple of elementary classrooms which I definitely enjoyed. While I was completing my gen ed units considering teaching the things that turned me away were 1. How teachers have to deal with difficult parents who don't take accountability for their children if they legitimately are behind in school 2. Couple people I know family wise turned me away from it because they said teachers don't make enough money and 3. How some teachers don't have the support from their administration. As a result I ended up deciding on majoring in Marketing which I figured was a great all around degree but in reality I feel like I just chose it for practicality and not that I actually enjoyed it (at the time I wanted to major in it). Being in the field I'm in now don't get me wrong I do enjoy it and its a good challenge although can be really dreadfully stressful at times as there are days when I think about how my life would be different if I was an elementary school teacher. Overall I love kids and doing my elementary internship was something I enjoyed greatly. Being there for kids is something I am passionate about and was when I originaly pursued the classes that I took when I originally wanted to be a teacher. I guess you could say I'm in that quarter life crisis mode where I'm second guessing what I'm currently doing because sometimes I feel like it's not as meaningful or fulfilling like a career in teaching would. Lately I've been researching on some teaching credential programs and I've been bouncing back and forth whether this is something I should pursue since I've already gone to school and have a career started in the event industry. At this point its stayed with me for a while so I've RSVP'd to an information seminar at one of the universities on learning about their teaching credential program and possibly a Masters in Education.Any comments or advice would be much appreciated. 

Thanks for reading! :)"
4lf1cw,6,2016-05-28,"My [22M, white] girlfriend's [25F, indian] parents are refusing to even meet me, how to go about this?",whiteboyfriend22,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lf1cw/my_22m_white_girlfriends_25f_indian_parents_are/,"I'm 22, white, and I have been with this Indian girl for almost 10 months. About 3 months ago she told them about our relationship and as expected her parents did not take it well. According to what my girlfriend said, her mother becomes very emotional (read: cries) whenever the subject of our relationship (she described it to them as ""we were getting pretty serious"") is brought on and her father is not as vocal but ""seems like he doesn't support it either"". Her family have had many fights and, especially given that they are Indian, this has been understandably very hard for her.

I feel we could ease things a little if I could meet her parents and get to talk with them. The problem is, they have refused to even meet me. And I am trying to find a way for her to convince them to meet me. At the moment she is strongly leaning towards giving up and probably getting an arranged marriage, since her parents are putting a lot of pressure because of her ""old"" age, and I do not feel like I have a lot of time.

One of the issues is the fact that I am younger than her. But I am only months away from completing a computer science degree (she just finished engineering) and given my strong internship background I have good chances of getting close to a 6-figure salary. In fact I have liven by myself for many years and am already covering over 90% of my living expenses through the salaries I've earned in the past (parents still present and helping when needed but I am trying to avoid putting unnecessary financial pressure on them). Stating this because I believe it could be a good argument to help her convince her parents who probably want a guy with good finances and a good career.

What else? Oh yeah, plot twist: we have been in a long distance relationship all this time. For a good while I would visit her every two weeks. We travelled around on a few weekends and spent quite a lot of quality time together, even with the distance. Then, for the past few months, I have been studying abroad in another country and will see her in just a few weeks. I haven't seen her since she told her parents and had all these fights and just can't wait to get back and have a good real-life talk with her.

Right now she thinks that her parents will never let her be with me and that even if she married me they would never be happy and because of that she could never be happy herself (which I understand too). However I do believe that her parents would eventually support us and that we are not that far away from a change of things. She has relatively ""liberal"" Indian parents in the sense that they always pretty much let her live her life how she wants. She can come home late at night, travel with friends, go out for drinks. They never punished her in any way for ""being serious"" with me nor have they tried to track or control her more after she told them. They only seem to have concerns when it comes to marriage. I am pretty sure that it's simply because they love her and want her to be happy, and I think that if I can show them she can be happy with me they will accept me much more easily.

Finally, yes we are considering getting married, and it would likely happen in about a year, and I understand that many of you will think that I might be a bit young for marriage, but this is something that I knew was going to be an issue early in the relationship and we have been talking about it for a while. I do not mind getting married at 23 as long as I can see that the person is a good match. I would have the option of moving in her city in a few months to have a better idea of how things would be in a ""daily"" (not long distance) relationship. Besides, most people from where I come from get married or have gotten married around these ages, except that it's the guy who's usually the oldest.
   
**tl;dr**: Me=white, girlfriend=Indian, her parents don't even want to meet me, trying to help her convince them to meet me, she is about to give up and break up, what to do?"

4lf4kc,26,2016-05-28,Live Math Rock in Tokyo,shinvu,JapanTravel,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/4lf4kc/live_math_rock_in_tokyo/,"Hi there people!

I'm a 21 year old male from India, in Tokyo for an internship. I'll be here till mid-July. 

For an Indian engineering student like myself, getting an internship in Japan is a big deal - mostly because of the copious amounts of anime we watch. In my case though, I made the transition from watching Japanese anime to listening to Japanese music about a year ago. Since then, I've been listening to Japanese math/post/instrumental rock, and I'm hoping to find some live gigs where I can enjoy this kind of music.

I listen to the major bands like toe (by far my favorite) and Low Pass, but basically I'll enjoy anything that has a similar sound. I also like the sound of People in The Box (though I don't understand a word they sing) - a band that has stayed with me from my days of anime-binging. I also enjoy a good dose of post rock (like Mogwai, who are touring Japan right now). I hope that gives a good idea of my musical tastes. 

Does anyone know about live shows that will feature this kind of music? I searched similar threads in this sub-reddit, but all of them seemed to focus on metal. I'm especially interested in (melodic) math rock, but I'm open to indie/instrumental/post rock as well; just not metal or hard-core. Also, I would prefer an event which focuses on the music, though I know that 'live houses' in Tokyo usually mean there will be alcohol too.

Adding a few videos to further clarify the kind of thing I'm looking for:

I have seen the sunrise the last ten days in row and not because I wake up early and go for a jog before driving downtown to work at my internship but because it’s hard to fall asleep at an appropriate time when you have an abundance of adderall and psilocybin laying around the apartment and even if you run out it’s cool because the dude with the addy lives right downstairs and the dude with the shrooms is just across the street.  

Our illustrious higher education system would be unable to function in any kind of recognizable manner if recreational drug abuse was not an integral and convenient part of the machine…  

You dig?   

I think the day I truly began Using the Internet was on a summer’s day going into seventh grade in July of 2008. Maybe it was 2007. I'm pretty sure George Bush was still president.  

A friend of mine who was also my neighbor introduced me to a game on Facebook called Mob Wars where you more or less make a dozen or so clicks every several hours wreaking havoc across the digital criminal underworld… going to war with various gangs. People you know, people you don’t. Completing missions and buying items and accumulating real estate property. Clicking, mostly.  

But only for a handful of minutes every day.  

The way the game worked was you would have a certain amount of Stamina, and each action you take within the game uses up Stamina. It takes a few hours to regain your Stamina Points, so you are only able to play the game for a few minutes a couple of times per day. The remaining and minutes of the day fill themselves with countless hours of scrolling through newsfeeds over and over and over and not really learning or reading or taking anything in just kind of Looking and Waiting and Watching…  

The same Embarrassing Grandma who comments on all her granddaughter’s posts and for a month-long period she accidently got Caps Lock stuck on and all of her posts became filled with intense vigor and excitement and profound love and CAN’T WAIT TO SEE YOU AND YOUR BROTHER IN SEPTEMBER MICKY IS ALREADY HEATING UP THE GRILL and all of that posted on the granddaughter’s status about how much she will miss the seniors who are graduating this year and the other eleven comments on the status were varying degrees of Love You Lots and Me Too… which after a while becomes too sentimental and emotional and it makes Granny’s post all the more welcome. The granddaughter and her friends laugh about the next day in school before class starts.  

Someone even took a screenshot.  

The same angry politico sharing and clicking and reposting videos and articles and photos and more… Hell bent on getting *someone* to listen only to find that the only people who are willing to listen to you already agree and shared the same article just minutes before and You Are So Right and the text that you posted along with the video is the only chance to make it into the spotlight because all of your alienated peers would never actually click the link to the article so you have to try and get their attention quick you gotta make a real BANG and so you write ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?! How Can These People Be Doing This?! Don’t You Even Care?!  

Click to see what happens next.  

The same girl who got pregnant when she was fifteen and dropped out of highschool and it makes upper-middle class suburban white teenagers giggle and laugh because That’s So Trashy and in their fervor of maniacal cackling they build an identity and a bond with one another because That’s Not Us and at the table in the lunchroom they swap stories about posts they saw where Trish Had A Kid and Takes Pictures With Black Guys.  

They called her Trashy Trish because both words start with the same consonant sound.  

The remaining Faces and Profiles which were within my field of vision were very inconsequential and generally scrolled past and ignored not because of any personal distaste for them but because in terms of killing time until my Mob Wars Stamina is recharged and I can go and click and rob a jewelry store, all those other Faces are just Advertisements...  

Didn’t you know nobody likes watching Commercials.  

This is how I was introduced to the Internet. Not just flash games and Charlie Bit My Finger kind of internet but the *real* internet, where everyone is yelling and crying and waiting in vain…  

I wonder if snorting adderall would have cut down the amount of time it took for my Stamina to Recharge. After all, I wasn’t one of those hyper twitchy problem kids who were prescribed amphetamines to take daily so as to Calm Them Down and Help Them Focus. I didn’t learn about *that* until I was thrown into the winds of Higher Education…

It's a giant group of people going through the exact same thing, sharing advice, wisdom, encouragement, and just sympathizing with one another. 

I [20,M] have recently been broken up with, and then replaced by someone new about a week or two later, and I have felt heartache like I never thought existed. It sucks being so hurt and feeling like the other person can just move on and find someone new so soon, but you know what? I am better than this. I am stronger than this. And I'll get through it. Maybe not today or tomorrow, or even a few months from now, but sometime. The hardest part for me is when good memories come to my head- and you think, what happened? Why didn't it work? Things were so good, the kisses and the feelings and the long talks and the love and now, now everything is completely opposite and they are NEVER going back to where they were. She's gone. Already with someone else. The day I saw it I unfollowed on all social media (then I read on here that's actually what you're supposed to do from the start) I just miss the good times we had and all those sweet memories. But she wasn't the one- there were 5,000,000,000,000 reasons why we weren't compatible and I won't even start to list them. My goodness she wasn't the one for me. It wasn't right at all. So there's nothing to be upset over, the breakup was a good thing. But I still feel the heartache. It's sad but hey, I'll get over it.  For now I will continue to drink my morning coffee on this fine Saturday and type away. Tonight I'm going to the local ice rink to play in a pick up hockey game. Hockey is my favorite. I have an actual game this coming Wednesday. 

I've started to really work on improving myself. I've been reading up on r/malehairadvice and r/malefashionadvice, been trying to improve my wardrobe and style. I have been going to the gym and working out lots lately, I wanna look GOOD. I went to the barbershop yesterday and got a sick new haircut. I got a good paid summer internship that has to do with my college major, and it starts soon. Life is good. I don't need any stupid feelings of post breakup sadness ruining life. 

Thank you everyone for all the advice that I've been reading up on. I feel like a breakup expert after having browsed this sub so much lately but I am so thankful that it exists. I love that when I'm feeling down I can come on here and see that so many other people are dealing with the EXACT SAME THING and for some reason, that is an immediate medicine to me. And I just wanted to say, that this subreddit rocks. 

Thanks for listening everyone. Please stay strong. This isn't my first break up ever and I've survived it in the past, I will recover this time, and SO WILL YOU. WE all will. 

Much love,

&gt; Ein unbekannter Mann war in die Tagungshalle auf dem Messegel&amp;auml;nde der Stadt gest&amp;uuml;rmt, war bis zur ersten Reihe vorgedrungen und hatte der Linken-Fraktionsvorsitzenden Sahra Wagenknecht eine Schokoladentorte ins Gesicht geworfen.

&gt; Begr&amp;uuml;ndet wurde die Attacke in einer Art Bekennerschreiben, in der eine &amp;quot;Antifaschistische Initiative &amp;#039;Torten f&amp;uuml;r Menschenfeinde&amp;#039;&amp;quot; Wagenknecht vorwarf, wie die AfD &amp;quot;Den &amp;#039;Volkszorn&amp;#039; in politische Forderungen zu &amp;uuml;bersetzen&amp;quot;.

&gt; Der T&amp;auml;ter nahm auch Bezug auf eine &amp;auml;hnliche Aktion gegen die AfD-Bundesvize Beatrix von Storch, die auf einer Sitzung der Bundesprogrammkommission im Februar selbsternannte linken Aktivisten mit einer Torte angegriffen hatten.

&gt; Riexinger ergriff nach der Redepause sofort Partei f&amp;uuml;r Wagenknecht.

&gt; Der Vorfall erinnert an eine &amp;auml;hnliche Attacke 1999 mit einem Farbbeutel auf den damaligen Au&amp;szlig;enminister Joschka Fischer, als die Gr&amp;uuml;nen auf dem Parteitag in Bielefeld &amp;uuml;ber den intern stark umstrittenen Einsatz der Bundeswehr im Kosovo abstimmen wollten.

I just graduated with bachelors in computer science. I currently have an offer from Amazon as a Software Dev engineer. However I've been working as an intern at IBM Research Labs for the past 6 months and I'm scheduled to give a round of interviews the coming week in order to be converted to a full time software engineer. These however are just a formality and my team is pretty confident of me clearing these.


I've published one paper at a tier 1 conference and therefore have decent experience working for a research project. 

I also interned at Amazon for 6 months in my 6th Semester and therefore have experience of how work at amazon would be.

Both research and Amazon fascinated me equally and choosing one over the other will completely change my options and opportunities in the future

I just recently got rejected by Google after the on site interviews otherwise that would ve been my first preference.

Looking for some kind of insight from people who went from research into a product/services company or the other way round?

I broke up with my GF a few weeks ago. She almost stopped talking to me when I went in internship, in favour of her group of friends, gave me some dodgy explanations to why she couldn't ever see me after school for a month and half, and made me suffer since I couldn't understand why she was doing this.


After a month and a half I clicked, and I exploded. I said I was sick of that shit, and I was pretty violent in my words. You could say I was an ass.

And I feel completely terrible about it. We dated for 1 year and 2months or so, and I just feel like shit for breaking up with her like that. The angriness is fading and regret is settling in. 

Not of breaking up, even though I loved her, because I know it's for the best, but because of the way I did it.

But I feel that if I appologize it will be seen as crawling back to her, and a sign of weakness.

TL;DR Broke up with my GF like an ass, feel like shit, wondering if I should appologize."

In the long term, I wan't to go to college, because it's needed to move up, and I'm aware of the bubbles in the tech industry.


Homelife is bad, and my mom's getting ready to kick me out when I'm 18. With my current job I could live on my own with a roommate, but it would be extremely rough. If I drop out, I could work more.

4lguc2,12,2016-05-28,Me [27 M] failed to launch from my family,helpmegetout1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lguc2/me_27_m_failed_to_launch_from_my_family/,"Grew up in a middle class family, but constantly smothered by my mother, never given a chance for independence, and dad was never around, so no male influence growing up. 

Even when in university, she would bring me boxes and boxes of food, I tried to refuse, but it basically made me complacent to never need to shop, and by not having debt, and crippling social anxiety, I hardly went out for anything except classes.

So, I snapped at graduation, having both internships fall through and no social connections, I just left, everything, to go live in Asia for a while, and teach English. Worst decision of my life, I was completely unprepared to deal with a job so remotely different from my technical background, not to mention the culture shock. I did grow a bit, and realized all my flaws, and how much I missed during uni. My work during Asia allowed me to basically break even, so it was only time lost.

I've since then come back, crashed at their place, unable to find a path or direction, longing to go again, because I dont have any support in any form back here. I'm currently over an hour away from the nearest city, and not mentally equipt to handle cold weather depression, a big reason why I'd go again to a warmer climate, but know I wont really be able to support myself.

So, my family is also incredibly toxic, in being back here, my sister and dad have constantly put me and my ideas down, I'm getting to the point of giving up on everything.

No real relevant work experience, somehow success is measured as being able to land and work up in a 'career' job, not make money from passions. I probably look like an entitled lazy idiot, but depression, anxiety, and ADD are killer mix.
   
**tl;dr**: failed to launch, what now?"
4lh080,5,2016-05-28,How can I avoid alpha widowing my LTR?,sterlingmartinMut,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/4lh080/how_can_i_avoid_alpha_widowing_my_ltr/,"I've been dating this girl for almost two years. We started as seniors in high school and went long-distance for our first year of college. However, I got an internship a few hours away from our hometown for the summer that I'm leaving for on Monday. Between me visiting home and her coming to visit me, we'll see each other maybe once every 2 or 3 weeks (much better than the once a month we had during college).

You can call me naive, but I'd call her a unicorn. She has a strong family, is very smart (full merit scholarship to a top college in the US), beautiful, a virgin before I met her, and has pretty much all of the feminine qualities I'd want in an RP relationship. 

I like her a lot, but I worry that continuing a long distance relationship will be counter-productive for our careers as we start getting older and have more responsibilities. We're both taking a significant course load next semester, and I'm also working as a TA. It'll be tough to find a weekend to go visit each other like we've done in past semesters.

I'm worried that breaking up with her will alpha widow her and destroy her emotionally. She's infatuated with me (I'm her first everything), and frequently cries when things aren't looking good for our relationship. 

Now, you may say that the red pill thing to do would be to just break up with her and move on, but I don't want to do that to her. I want to give her the best opportunity possible to move on and have a happy life. 

Does anyone have any advice or experience for this type of situation?"

Here's my unsolicited, managerial advice rant.",CouthDecay,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4lh54e/hey_grads_i_graduated_11_years_ago_im_old_now/,"(I was an Army Officer (Captain) for eight years. I have now been in the Environmental Management industry for three years. I have a Master's Degree in Environmental Management and am a Certified Hazardous Materials Manager.)

If you've just graduated and haven't squared away an entry-level grad job with whatever logical career progression applies to your major, then you've messed up. If you're going home to work for Mommy and Daddy then this doesn't really apply to you.

If you're starting your Junior year of your Bachelor's you're going to need to get with your college advisors to start looking for career placement. They should be able to direct you where to go. **Raise your GPA**. It is so stupidly important, you have no idea. If you're in your Senior year and have it good to go, then good for you. If you don't, then get on that ish right now. Also, raise your GPA some more. If it applies, do an internship. Make contacts. Keep those contacts.

If you want to go straight to Grad School, then cool. Keep in mind that you are incurring extra debt and not getting any workforce experience. If you are able to work on your Master's while starting your job, it's usually a better option as your company will typically pay for school and you're getting contacts and experience at the same time. You've heard it before, but **the most important aspect of employment is who you know and what they think of you.**

So, you secured an entry-level position with your stellar GPA, dress shirt, Toyota Corolla, and robotic interview responses. Good job. First thing's first:

1) **Shut the f#$% up.** No one cares what you think or what you think you know. I'm not telling you this as someone that hates snot-nosed millennials. I'm technically a millennial myself. I'm telling you this for your own good. Unless someone asks your opinion, don't say a damn thing for about a year. And even if you are asked, be as simple with your response as possible and don't dare start your response off with, ""Based on my experience at..."" You have no experience. **You know nothing**, Millennial Snow.

2) **Learn everything you didn't learn at school.** It will be a lot. The chances are high that you'll be put on some sort of junior management track. Go talk to the grumpy curmudgeon who's swung a hammer in that industry for thirty years. Trust me, he/she wants to be heard. Find out the mundane #$% about your industry. Memorize these things. As long as you don't sharp-shoot people in some sort of ego trip, you will get a lot of respect very quickly from the veterans in your field if you learn the things that have defined their careers.

3) **As a manager, BE GOOD TO PEOPLE.** If you know you have to make a decision that is going to piss some people off, make that decision and be up front with everyone. **ALWAYS COMMUNICATE.** You will never, ever, ever be able to make everyone happy. If you're up front about bad news, people will respect you more for it and you'll be less likely to be given all the blame for whatever goes down. Also, there will always be some people with a consistently antagonistic attitude toward leadership. That's just something you're going to have to deal with. Instead of being spiteful of those people, try developing a relationship with them. Meet them on common ground. Ask them to train YOU in something. Listen to them. Be proactive and never reactive.

4) **Never completely trust anyone.** This is hugely important when people's livelihoods are on the line. When it comes down to you or them and saving their own ass (AND MONEY / LIVELIHOOD), chances are you're going to be f---ed. Do not put yourself in a situation that you can be compromised. Don't be a 100% by the book a$$#%&amp;, but also don't do anything illegal or sketchy where you put your trust in the hands of someone you basically barely know.

5) **Continue your professional education.** Get your boss's resume and use it as guidance for your future, or if you don't like him/her, find a different mentor and follow their lead. Get your Master's Degree before 30 and start working on professional certifications as soon as you can. Professional certifications are a necessary evil. They open so many doors and so many callbacks for interviews.

6) **Be upfront but not disrespectful with your boss.** If he or she is neglecting a responsibility that is affecting the team, call them out on it. Close the door, be direct, and be ready to defend yourself against someone who may be rather irrational. A good supervisor will respect your ability to provide constructive criticism in a confrontational manner. A good supervisor also recognizes that a confrontation is not the same thing as an argument. You will have good and bad supervisors. Keep your ear to the ground and make calculated decisions with your future.

7) **If you have problems with confidence, you're going to have problems with everything you do**, especially if it involves people. Assess yourself and do what you need to do to fix it.

8) **Be adaptive, resilient, and comfortable with change.** Be what your company needs you to be but not at the cost of your financial security or career progression. There's a balance to being an asset vs being abused. Many positions within a field are closely related but vastly different in practice. Be able to adapt to these. Also, 2008 showed us that shit can go wrong very quickly. Have a back up plan. **START SAVING YOUR MONEY IMMEDIATELY. LIVE BELOW YOUR MEANS.** You are likely going to live until you are 90 years old. You really don't want to have to work past 60. You better save your money in the event of the next recession in addition to being able to retire comfortably.

Everyone is going to get old and die. So, plan for it starting now.

4lhh7v,10,2016-05-28,"I could really use some advice, recently graduated and have been failing miserably. Not sure what to do now.",CS_Throwaway23,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4lhh7v/i_could_really_use_some_advice_recently_graduated/,"Hi, I created a throwaway account for anonymous reasons. I recently graduated in July with a Bachelors in CS in 2015 and was able to land an internship that was Helpdesk over summer 2015 for a decent company. I absolutely hated that job however, I had never been so miserable in my life. I strongly disliked my coworkers (for reasons which I won't get into) but I faked a smile all the way through the internship until it ended on decently good terms. It was such a degrading experience that it put me off to working helpdesk entirely (and almost all IT work in its entirety).

After all that ended, it took a serious toll on me and I fell into really bad depression and anxiety where I couldn't leave the house without feeling like having a panic attack. I lost complete contact with everyone I knew except for my girlfriend. I'm feeling a bit better now after getting prescribed medication for it though. 

I've been working crappy temp jobs in the mean time but have been out of work for about 3 months now and I'm starting to feel like I wasted my time getting a CS Degree. I've always loved being on Computers and learning about them, but I have never enjoyed Programming at all. I completed my classes with very average grades (C's, B's, occasional A's) and felt so relieved to be done working on a programming assignment.

I had an interview for an ASP.NET/C# job in a very busy city in Texas recently, and after they asked me to create something to display my skills that took me about a week to finish, I presented it to him. I've never been so embarrassed in my life. He told me it looked thrown together and asked me questions relating to the lines of code and all the terms that each and everything represents, but I just couldn't remember or flat out didn't know. His advice for me was to buy a huge C# book and write about 50 programs and then get back to him... After that experience, I knew that programming definitely wasn't something I would ever consider doing for a career.

I had another interview for a simple security job the other day, and it went pretty well but they told me it was a job for the long term and I got the impression they felt like I was going to leave them right away after another opportunity presented itself because of my education. Classic ""we'll keep in touch"" AKA you didn't get the job.

So now I'm here not sure what the hell to do. I suck at interacting with the public but I'm okay with talking with co-workers. I'm in a lot of debt with no job and I'm about to have to work fast food or something in order to simply survive. I'm overqualified for basic jobs but not good enough for a decent job is what it feels like. Any advice would be appreciated, maybe alternative career paths regarding IT that don't do very much interacting with the public but also doesn't require programming? I'm not sure if that even exists.

Another sidenote-- I've always lived in smaller cities, so traveling to a really busy city in Texas almost had me have a panic attack. I just can't handle the commute like that at all... SO MUCH traffic"

4lhlqd,1,2016-05-28,Auto Insurance -- Need advice!,yensterrr,carinsurance,https://www.reddit.com/r/carinsurance/comments/4lhlqd/auto_insurance_need_advice/,"Hey /r/carinsurance

I posted this in /r/insurance already so sorry if you've seen this post already. 

I need some advice. I'm a 21 year old senior in college who's going to be working an internship in Illinois this summer. I'm originally from California but will be living in my aunt's house rent-free during my internship for roughly two months. Because my internship is a forty-five minute commute from my aunt's house and because I attend school in Indiana, I am looking to purchase a used car from a dealership.

What I need help with is auto insurance. From talking to my parents and aunt, I can't be under my parent's auto insurance (Farmer's) because they are living in California while I'll be in Illinois and my aunt's insurance agent (State Farm) claims that if I file under her family's auto insurance, her family's auto insurance prices will increase substantially because I am a 21 year old male. My parents are under Farmer's and my aunt is under State Farm. Because of this, my aunt is reluctant of having me purchase a car.

Here are some questions I have:

* Would it be cheapest/best for me to purchase my own auto insurance? My parents said that because I live in my aunt's house rent-free that this might not be possible.
* If I purchase my own auto insurance, what insurance agency would be a good fit for me?

* About how much would my aunt's auto insurance increase if I was added to their family's plan?

Any form of advice or help would be greatly appreciated!"

We're going to move into my apartment, since his bachelor pad was a cheap hole in the wall. Since I have a full-time job and he's still going through school, I'll be paying a larger portion of the rent.

As if this wasn't going to be a big enough transition, he will be gone all summer for an internship. We'll see each other on the occasional weekend, but not nearly as much as the daily contact we've grown used to.

I've never made this step with anyone and while I'm excited, I'm also a bit nervous. What sort of things usually cause problems when moving in together? What would make this transition smoother? What are red flags to watch out for? I don't expect anything to go wrong, I just have a habit of over-planning.

4lhncx,9,2016-05-28,[Rave] My summer internship fell through. I can still manage for the next month.,cidonys,ynab,https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/4lhncx/rave_my_summer_internship_fell_through_i_can/,"I'm an engineering student, 20 years old, still trying to figure out what the hell is going on with life and money.

I started using YNAB in February.  I was doing an internship, had steady income for a few months, and figured it was as good a time as any to save up to pay loans off ^^^^(complicated ^^^situation ^^^- ^^^my ^^^loan ^^^balance ^^^was ^^^too ^^^high ^^^to ^^^pay ^^^off ^^^before ^^^the ^^^end ^^^of ^^^the ^^^semester, ^^^and ^^^I ^^^was ^^^using ^^^up ^^^my ^^^6 ^^^month ^^^grace ^^^period, ^^^so ^^^I'd ^^^rather ^^^save ^^^the ^^^money ^^^up ^^^so ^^^I ^^^don't ^^^get ^^^screwed ^^^over ^^^if ^^^I ^^^don't ^^^have ^^^a ^^^job ^^^once ^^^I ^^^graduate.)

So I've been saving up.  I have a very small emergency fund for general ""OH SHIT, I didn't expect this to be a thing!"" built up.  I'm saving 6 months of student loan payments for when I graduate.  I'm saving 3 months of living expenses for when I graduate.  There are two trips I've been saving for, and I was able to pay moving expenses for the beginning of the summer.  I rolled with the first big punch where an apartment deposit was bigger than I thought.

And then the second punch was thrown.  The internship I had lined up for the summer fell through.  The company went out of business last week - I was going to start on May 31st.  

I'll admit I panicked.  It was terrifying.  How the hell was I going to be able to afford to keep living in *Boston* without a job?  But according to YNAB, I can do it.  My monthly expenses are around $1800, not including rent, which is paid for in full.  I had about $3000 in varying savings budgets that I could pull from without feeling too bad, and more that I could skim from varying categories.  I could probably do this.

---

This morning, I went through my budget, found all of the categories in May that I'd budgeted more than I needed, found all of the categories that had rollover balance that really shouldn't, adjusted the savings categories that I was saving faster than I needed to, and budgeted out all but $20 of June.

I'll admit that I had some help with my tax return, and that I don't have rent to pay.  But even though I haven't been working in a month, I can afford Internet, medicine, electric, groceries, transportation, music lessons, and going out.  Beyond that, I can continue growing my student loans savings my graduation/unemployment buffer, my home maintenance fund for inevitable costs for the house I have, my emergency medical cost fund, saving for college, my deferred income, and buy my mom a birthday gift.

I have a month to find a new internship, and I don't have to touch my emergency fund or unemployment fund.  I can be much less panicked and just be happy that I have interviews, without having to worry about moving home for the summer or being a burden on my roommates.  And I have 227 days of buffering according to the ToolKit, as long as I'm willing to pull from my savings funds.  

It sucks that I don't have a job yet, but I'm absolutely thrilled that I set up my budget 4 months ago so I don't have to be screwed over right now."
4lhp3v,42,2016-05-28,Removing Admin credentials from users - how best to do it?,dr-mindbender,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/4lhp3v/removing_admin_credentials_from_users_how_best_to/,"Hi Everyone:
I'm a low-level Johnny Helpdesk at the organization I just started working for.  One of the things I have been tasked with doing is increasing network security. Part of the problem is that all of the users - all 400 of them - have local admin credentials on their workstations.  There's nothing stopping them from installing whatever they want.  I brought up the idea of restricting admin credentials to the person who allegedly functions as our Network Administrator and he said, ""Why would you want to do that?"" 
""Because users with admin credentials are a primary vector for viruses and ransomware."" 
""We've got an anti-virus, we don't need to worry about that."" 

And that's when I started screaming. 

Just last week, we got hit with ransomware.  Fortunately, the intern and I managed to stop it before it did any serious damage but this just underscores the point that, from a network security standpoint, we are wide open. 

If I can come up with a plan that demonstrates how I am going to accomplish this and how it won't negatively impact the network admin's Candy Crush playing it will go a long way to getting this done and I'll sleep much better. 

I was thinking of doing it through Group Policy.  I have some experience with Group Policy, but it's mostly limited to distributing software and minor changes but never anything of this scale.  If you wanted to do what I'm trying to do, how would you do it? Some of the stuff I looked at online indicates that there are about a billion things that have to be changed but I have to think that there's a simpler way to do it. 

Any help or guidance on this issue would be greatly appreciated."
4lhtur,4,2016-05-28,Flight risk,floridianreader,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/4lhtur/flight_risk/,"hello.  For the Bot, I am in FL, if it matters.

I am a home healthcare social worker (SW).   I left my job at a large hospice chain in one city because of a bad case of homesick-ness and also because my husband got a way better job back in our hometown.  I spoke to hospice management about transferring to the hospice (same company)  in our hometown and while they said that they didn't have a SW position at the moment, they would be glad to have me in the future if and when something opened up. 

So I quit my job and we moved back to our hometown.  I waited and waited for a hospice job to open up.  I did find a part time job working in the home healthcare field, but it's very sporadic.... I get only about 4 or 5 hours per pay period.  I have asked for more hours but haven't really gotten anywhere.  So I have begun looking for other jobs. 

I have checked in with the hospice company that I used to work for, but the very same people at the hospice that I talked to when I was still an employee suddenly forgot that I existed.  I applied to openings, I sent a very nice cover letter reminding them that I was a former employee and knew all their computer systems and other policies and procedures. They told me that suddenly they require 3 or more years experience and a license, even when I told them I worked for the company not even 6 months ago. They won't even give me an interview or the time of day.  

I've gotten other job interviews, and at least one interviewer told me that I was the favorite candidate for the position, but I never got ""THE CALL"" for the job offer.  I have checked and rechecked and had other people look at my resume and cover letter, and it's spotless... no misspelled words, everything is as it should be, no weird stuff about my cat or whatever.

The last job interview I had, the interviewer said that everything looked great but he couldn't help but notice that I was a flight risk. And then it all made sense, that I can't get a job because now I'm a flight risk.  I wasn't prepared for that question, so that pretty much threw the interview. 

This is what my employment history looks like:

nonprofit internship 9 months

hospice internship 9 months

hospice employee 15 months

home healthcare 3 months

So, how long do I have to stay at my current sporadic job before I am no longer considered a flight risk? I know I should address it in future interviews now, but I'm not even getting called for interviews lately. "
4lhu9g,3,2016-05-28,"Me [20 M] with my parents [50 M, F]. My dad got diagnosed with colon cancer last week- am I being selfish?",Selfish_Throwawayy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lhu9g/me_20_m_with_my_parents_50_m_f_my_dad_got/,"To start, I am a 20 year old male majoring in Chemistry at a major university in NC. I live about 3 hours away from my parents, who live in Raleigh. Our family consists of them, me, and my 3 younger siblings (17M, 16F, 12F). I've been home for the most of a month now, helping my mom and family as my dad underwent laparoscopic surgery to have an unidentified mass removed from his colon.

So, as mentioned in the title, my dad got diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer last week. This was the pathology result from the tumor he had removed. The doctors and oncologist have decided he'll need to begin a 6 month treatment regimen of radiation and chemotherapy, beginning in mid-June. 

This is where my dilemma comes into play. I live 3 hours away. I stay in the guest room when I'm home (which my mom insists is ""mine""), which is fine, but in reality I do not live there. I've spent these last 2 months trying to find jobs in my university town, having applied for over 40 at this point (internships and part time jobs). I've had several interviews and I have several more lined up for next week, but nothing has been offered to me yet. I feel that being there will be best for my career, as I graduate next year and I need whatever experience I can get. An internship would grant me industry experience and a handful of references, and a part time job would allow me to spend time doing lab research at school, which is another major part of being a chemistry major. I also like the idea of a part time job there because I could continue to work it throughout the school year. I'm a good student (3.5 GPA, extra-curriculars, you name it), and as more time goes by more interviews have been offered to me. On top of this, all my friends live in that area and none live near my parents. 

Now, I understood the stress the diagnosis would put on my family. My mom had stage 2 breast cancer when I was in high school, resulting in a double mastectomy and hysterectomy. As such I asked my parents multiple times if I would be a bad son for staying at school, to which they responded no. I assumed they were being genuine, and came back to school this past week to research and continue the job hunt. 

However, that blew up in my face this past Tuesday, when my mom texted me ""If you don't find a job this week, I have work I'll pay you to do around the house."" I took that as a generous backup plan, and told her I had several interviews scheduled and that I had already paid for a gym membership.  This pissed her off, and after two days of radio silence from her and my dad, she started a fight with me over text, saying that I was completely putting my own stuff first, I wasn't concerned enough about dad, etc. I told her that I needed her to be more direct with me if she needed me (because I had LITERALLY asked her exactly that and she said no) and that she can't expect me to read her mind as to what she needs. I finished out the week at school and am currently back home, where we are hosting family friends for the holiday. 

Since we're hosting family friends, my mom has been in full-on ""hostess"" mode and hasn't talked to me about the blowout argument we had. She did apologize to me (via text, after I asked her multiple times to call me or talk to me F2F) for being accusatory and said that she knows I can't read her mind. She still hasn't come out and asked me to stay home. 

I feel like she wants me to want to stay home of my own volition but... I don't. I can help around the house for a few weeks, but I cannot in good conscience take money from her all summer while my dad begins chemo and my younger brother starts college. I also haven't been able to find a job near home, since I go back to school in the fall and most employers don't want someone to come and go in 3 months. Some of the jobs I may end up with at school could pay above $10 an hour, which could help propel me through my senior year.

So, Reddit, am I being selfish? Is it immature of me to want my mother to come forth and admit she needs me here during this time, and to not expect me to stay on my own? Is it selfish of me to feel like she has my other 3 siblings, and that I have my own business to attend to? I feel very conflicted, because I don't want to abandon my family, but being at school seems to be the best for my career post college. 
   
**tl;dr**: My dad got diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer last week. My mom seems to expect me to stay home for the summer and help around the house, but hasn't explicitly asked me to and has disregarded my point of view on the matter. Am I selfish for wanting to be at school?"

The 2nd Field Division will then move in a support role rolling up the Nile and into the Nubian Governate. From there they will secure the Southern half of Egypt and the Nubian Governate. The LNA will allow a chance for combatants to surrender and hand over their weapons before engaging them. The Field Divisions will go in with their full supporting armor present as the exact scale and nature of the situation is currently unknown. All violent factions will be engaged. The LNAF will provide support to the LNA along with enforcing a NFZ over Egypt until the violent factions can be put down. Additional troops will be moved in if needed after the initial operation. LNAF will be on alert and ready to scramble in the case of rogue fighters that may stray into Libya, however believes at this time that there is no substantial threat.

4lhz7d,244,2016-05-28,"That time my mom called me a week before my wedding and ""suggested"" I call it off",vicioustradition,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/4lhz7d/that_time_my_mom_called_me_a_week_before_my/,"It's me again. My wife really wanted me to post the time that my mother had an all out temper tantrum on our actual wedding day, but the details are fuzzy, so I will share the lovely story of the time my mother called me and ""suggested"" I call off the wedding.


Gather 'round, kids, and let me set the stage. Myself and my MIL (who is crafty, does not work, and is fit and beautiful, ergo a source of constant comparison from my own mom) worked really, really hard to put together the perfect wedding for my wife and I. Most things were DIY'd, bought from small local businesses, or bought from friends' businesses. 


At the time I was planning the wedding, I was also in grad school full time, attending my internship 2-3 days a week, and working 20-30 hours a week. Mostly myself, but also my MIL, put a lot of blood, sweat, tears, love, and money into this wedding. I should note here that my wedding was a destination wedding for at least half the people there, and the other half had to drive at least 1-2 hours to get there. 


Enter my mom. As discussed in my previous post, my mom has a lot of unresolved homophobia around the fact that I am married to a woman and is a textbook narcissist. This manifested in her being totally uninterested in wedding planning or discussing the wedding....


Until she calls me while I'm on my lunch break at my internship, a week before my wedding. She asks me, in a voice one usually uses with a four year old, if I had ""really thought"" about getting married. I replied that actually I had given the commitment of marriage a lot of thought, thanks very much.


She then returns with, well, when SHE was young, HER first marriage went terribly. Her first husband was abusive, and she moved across the country to be with him. Besides the fact that I am a separate human from her, which is difficult for her to grasp, my mother was a sheltered, religious woman in her late teens/early 20s that had never lived outside of home. At the time of my marriage, I was a mid-20s woman who had traveled extensively and was getting a graduate degree who had been living independently from my parents and across the country from them for years, which I expressed to her.


Her response to that is, but have you *really* thought about what it will be like to be with [wife] for the rest of your life? Considering the fact that I, apparently, will be relegated to a lifetime of taking care of her due to her mental illness. Had I thought about that future?


That made my blood boil. Not only was she questioning my mental fitness to make such a decision as big as marriage, but now she was saying ""Are you SURE you want the lifetime baggage of being crazypants' caretaker??""


I calmly explained to my mother that a chronic mental illness is just like any other chronic illness; you manage it over your lifetime with medical assistance, and you have good days and bad days. Not only had my wife and I discussed this extensively, but I had done a lot of introspection over the two year period of our engagement about our long term compatibility. 


In the middle of explaining all of this to her, a thought popped into my mind ""Why am I justifying my relationship to her?"" So I said just that ""I don't have to justify my relationship or my marriage to you. I'm an adult and this is my decision.""

Her: ""But do you think....maybe...you could postpone the wedding? Maybe until after grad school? Or until after you guys move back?""

Me: ""Mom. We have paid thousands of dollars for the caterer, the venue, the cake, the flowers, the decor, the equipment, etc. Dozens of our friends and family are coming from across the country and have booked flights and hotels. And you want me to cancel the wedding?""

Her: ""...I'm just saying, it would be okay if you wanted to, you know, postpone it. It's okay if you're having second thoughts.""


Needless to say, I nicely told her to fuck off and mind her own business.

**tl;dr: my mom told me to postpone or call off my wedding because she felt that I didn't have the judgement to make such a serious decision, and oh yeah my wife is an unmanageable crazy person.**

4lig1h,1,2016-05-28,Why does most everyone assume the worst out of open relationship?,BaconTender,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4lig1h/why_does_most_everyone_assume_the_worst_out_of/,"Just a warning: This is going to be SUPER long and I apologize in advance. I just need to get this out there so I can feel better and have it not clutter up my mind anymore. 

I'm at my internship for the summer. Basically it's a pack of 12 young ladies working different agricultural concentrations. We're only a week in and we've been talking about a bunch of other things and bonding, I suppose. Anyway, conversation comes up about SOs and all the girls mention my engagement ring. I really hate bringing too much attention to it because I get weird over it because I mostly hear ""Wow, everyone's getting engaged and I'm over here licking my toes"" or some shit (which is really annoying by the way, stop saying that shit in front of us.)

Shortly after, another conversation comes up about who is dating who at the internship and who came in as a couple, etc. So this one long term intern brought his girl friend with him, and they made note about how he's FWB with someone in town and they have threesomes sometimes with her, and he'll screw her on the side. I actually talked to the guy and he said he's in an open relationship, and that's totally cool! So the girls were commenting about it and saying how weird and unnatural/unhealthy it is to be in an open relationship, and I'm just sitting there quiet because I AM in an open relationship. My fiance and I are very open towards sex. To us there is a difference between sex and making love, so we've opened it up to explore. I'm totally ok with this, since as of recently we're apart and I know he has needs. I'm personally too tired at the end of the day to fuck, nor am I interested in literally any one of these guys here, so I'll wait until the summer ends to get back with my man. Regardless, even though we're open, I don't think either of us take advantage of it because we're pretty freakin' happy as we are now, but the option is always out there. 

Anyway, I'm sitting here and these girls are all like ""well if i had a man I'd NEVER do something like Dan (*Fake name for anonymity*) and his girlfriend are doing blah blah blah...."" and I'm just rolling my eyes. I wasn't even going to mention that we're open too, but it hurts because I thought about it and how almost everyone I've told about this thinks that we have something wrong in our relationship.... They don't know us at all. Some of my friends are like ""Whoa, that's awesome!!"" But the others are like ""Wow, what's wrong? Sex bad or something?"" but that isn't the case at all. We have amazing sex, the best I've ever had, but the sex has nothing to do with it. Opening the relationship has made us a stronger couple. We've come to appreciate and trust each other a lot more. We have a very great relationship; I wouldn't marry him if I knew we didn't! I just don't know why most everyone assumes that our relationship is trash, that one of us will leave the other, or something else wrong will happen to us. We wouldn't have opened the relationship if it was broken or unhealthy, of course we would have worked on US first before we did something so ""out there"" like this. I just don't get their way of thinking, so I've mostly come to just not telling anyone. 

But to to me it's hard because if you don't explain the situation the other person automatically thinks you're cheating or something and that isn't the case at all. It's just come to the point to where I actually regret telling a few people because I guess I worry that they'll think less of me if I do tell them. It's hard for some people to understand the reasoning behind why we're open, and it's hard to explain if they don't get it in the first place. 



**TL:DR:** Sick of people telling me my open relationship is shit because it's open. Don't want to tell anyone anymore because of how they'll think of me or our relationship, due to misunderstanding or different morals/beliefs."

After trying out various decks and IDs the time has come to choose my final decks for regionals taking place in a few weeks time. This will be my first regional event after going to a few GNKs and a store tournament, so a little nervous and hoping to hit that top 64 for the alt art (the dream of course being top 8 for a sweet hard-earned playmat). Below I present the current plans for decks and a little info on the gameplans therein...

The overall plan for this is get a ProCo out and spam through the deck for creds and set up a stealth RnD digger. Lots of SMC and Clonechip to get my programs out fast while ProCo helps find the hardware. Maya was chosen as hardware for the ability to put problems like SEA Source etc onto the bottom of the deck. Economy is largely coming out of Armitage and Daily Casts. Primary plan is to run on the first click for a good dig, then use 3 clicks to gain credits / remove tags / install whatever - depending on the credit count, later game can also stretch to running a scoring remote or hq as well. Possible changes for this deck could be Magnum instead of armitage for prolonged credit clicking ability (and any other advice greatly appreciated).


On the Corp side, I'm going to be *that* guy and bring IG.

Essentially this is an adjusted Superfriends deck. The changes from it are House of Knives in place of Chronos Project to get some extra speed on the kill, and 2 more interns (replacing cerebral static) to aid recursion of trashed assets without having to museum and draw them. So far, my biggest issue with IG is working out an asset priority beyond the mumbas and museums, so thoughts there would be great to hear.

4liini,4,2016-05-28,The Surgeon,herd_of_birds,Herd_of_Birds,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herd_of_Birds/comments/4liini/the_surgeon/,"**[WP] When the only surgeon in the world capable of performing a particular medical procedure is afflicted with the very condition that requires their talents their only hope is an untested temporary mind transfer technology to allow them to operate on themselves. But what can go wrong?**

----------

&amp;nbsp;

I’ve been bad, very bad. They handed me medals and showered me with praise. I was in the running for a Nobel prize for god’s sake. They said I was a miracle worker and a genius. I’m only one of those things though.

&amp;nbsp;

Do I sound full of myself? I think I’ve earned that right. Who could dispute my genius? Only a truly brilliant individual could have kept my secret. The legions of media, the top surgical minds, I fooled them all. Only I knew the truth. Creating the procedure had been no simple thing, but concealing its cost had been the true feat of genius.

&amp;nbsp;

I remember the panic when the first reports of neocavernous encephalitis had come to light. I’d just been an intern then. It was barely a medical curiosity after mad cow’s disease a decade earlier. We laughed at the patients who’d seen it on the news and started asking after it. We assured them that the chances they’d been exposed were vanishingly low.

&amp;nbsp;

Over the next few years it became apparent that we’d made a mistake. Within a year we’d realised that this was going to be worse than BSE. Three years after the first cases we were developing an inkling of just how bad it might be. By the time I’d started on the general surgery training program it was apparent that we had an epidemic on our hands.

&amp;nbsp;

I remember those years vividly. Everyone was terrified of this new prion disease that was striking people down left and right with no pattern. Like a bolt from the blue a friend or a loved one started to develop slurred speech and insomnia. From there it was a matter of ten months or so before they were a vegetable with only the dimmest awareness of who they’d once been. The worst thing was that nobody could identify the source, nobody knew what exposure linked all of the many, many victims.

&amp;nbsp;

We were terrified too. Regardless of where it had started we knew that the agent was perfectly capable of breaking through the blood brain barrier. That meant that every time we opened someone up for even the most inconsequential surgery we could be playing Russian roulette with our lives as well as theirs. We started using disposable instruments when it became clear that our autoclaves couldn’t do a thing to the NCE proteins. Our scalpels and forceps would have literally melted before it got hot enough to sterilise them beyond a reasonable doubt.

&amp;nbsp;

Of course, people were scrambling for a cure through all this. Eventually they gave up on a cure and just looked for a way to extend the lucid period of the unfortunate victims. As more and more people fell into early dementia and death rumours started to spread. It was in the water, it was in the air, it was a Chinese bioweapon. All of them were ridiculous. It’s hard to convince people that their ideas are ridiculous when you can’t answer the questions yourself though. And so the panic spread.

&amp;nbsp;

By the time things were getting really bad I’d almost completed my general surgery fellowship and I was desperately maneuvering to get a place on the neurosurgery program. That was a difficult proposition at the best of times, but at least the ever present fear of prions had culled the number of applicants down to a reasonable number. Why risk exposure to NCE every day when you could go after a nice safe academic position or become a dermatologist instead?

&amp;nbsp;

At that point they estimated that almost ten percent of the population had symptomatic NCE and perhaps that many again were ticking time bombs. All we knew at this point was that it was definitely a prion folding disease and that the pathogenic proteins aggregated in three very specific, seemingly unlinked, cortical regions.

&amp;nbsp;

I’ve always been an ambitious person. You don’t make it this far in such a cutthroat field without being willing to cut a few throats yourself. One of my colleagues had been working on her research project into the etiology of NCE for something like three years at that point. I stole her discoveries without shame. That’s not my sin though. You see her efforts had been all very dry, very academic. I wanted to take it a step further and find a way to use her discoveries.

&amp;nbsp;

There’s a joke among physicians that the only thing their surgical counterparts know how to do is cut out the problem and hope for the best. For once they were right, that was exactly what I wanted to try. If the prions clustered so eagerly in those three small cortical regions, then what might happen if we simply took them out?

&amp;nbsp;

It’s amazing what can get past an ethics committee when you’re dealing with terminally ill victims of a seemingly incurable plague. My first subject was a man by the name of Brian Thompson. He was an electrician, a loving father of two and husband to one. That’s what he had been, by the time he’d reached me he was a drooling mess who could tell you he had children but not their names or anything about them. He knew just enough to weep for what he’d lost.

&amp;nbsp;

In my opinion he was too far gone to prove anything about my proposed procedure. When he didn’t die immediately I was given another, slightly less advanced, case to attempt my procedure on. I repeated my novel operation twice more. When a few months passed without any noticeable deterioration in the mental state of patients two and three they finally approved a wider trial.

&amp;nbsp;

It seemed like it worked. I was famous. I’d saved the world – or so they said. But the operation had certain side-effects. The patient’s developed hallucinations and poor impulse control. They were functional people but never the people they’d been before the procedure.

&amp;nbsp;

You might wonder how anyone could hide such glaring after effects. It was quite simple really, the disease did it for me. Everyone blamed the cognitive changes on the disease. Only a careful statistical analysis showed the truth and if anyone else had carried one out they’d decided that the good I was doing outweighed the harm and kept quiet. I wasn’t so sure, but I didn’t want to find out what would happen if people found out that my procedure was essentially robbing them of the last few months with the people they loved in exchange for providing them a lifetime with a stranger in a familiar body.

&amp;nbsp;

I enjoyed the fame and respect that came with being a famous surgeon. I don’t deny that I have an ego. That’s an essential to survive in this field. Despite the carnage around me and despite my secret, I was happy. Then I woke up one day and realised my tongue wasn’t working quite right. That morning, my colleague pointed out what I already knew – that I was slurring my speech. We both knew what that meant.

&amp;nbsp;

Do you think I’d trust anyone else to perform my surgery on me? Of course not. I was the best. The best by a long way. Expecting the others to carry out *my* procedure was like asking an ape to carve the Venus Di Milo. I told them so in far more diplomatic terms, but I did tell them. They accepted my argument that it wasn’t just about self-preservation. I was too valuable to die. Without me, the master of the procedure, who would train them? Who would ensure the quality of our treatment and keep our program going strong?

&amp;nbsp;

Desperate times call for desperate measures. I’d been willing to experiment on others when I’d invented my surgery. Now I proposed experimenting on myself. There was a new technology which would allow me to take up residence in the body of another and they in mine. Temporarily of course. Just long enough for me to carry out the surgery on my own body then swap back.

&amp;nbsp;

One of our young residents volunteered to be my counterpart in the swap. What a heroine. I guess she deserved that title more than I did. Even I’ll confess to that.

&amp;nbsp;

The swap was every bit as strange as I’d imagined it would be. So disorientating. Even after the initial shock it was bizarre to be looking out at the world through the eyes of another. To flex this supple young body as if it were my own. It must have been just as strange for her. We didn’t discuss it much. As soon as we were sure that both of us were alive and well in our respective vessels it was time to go to theatre.

&amp;nbsp;

As I scrubbed my flawless young arms in the prep room I was troubled beyond belief. Only I knew the true nature of the operation, what it did to people. Perhaps it wasn’t as bad as the disease it arrested, but it was a close call. I’d convinced the others that this procedure was necessary so I could keep on operating, but would I even be fit for that afterwards? The side effects of the operation might reduce me to a blabbering idiot. I’d rather die than lose the things that made me what I was. I’d rather spend the rest of my life in exile if I had to.

&amp;nbsp;

I’m an excellent surgeon. I can count the number of fatal errors I’ve made on one hand. That’s not bad for a career as long as mine. Every doctor knows you can’t save everyone though. Sometimes people don’t pull through. There’s a lot that can go wrong in a delicate neurosurgery. *A lot.*"

I'm literally crying right now and feeling hopeless about my future. 

Some facts about me:
I'm 23. I'm majoring in American Studies at a good school with two semesters left. I have a 2.9 gpa. My only work experiences were from fast food jobs 4 years ago. I'm a single mother to a preschooler. 

During the spring and fall semesters, my son is with me but he is with my parents right now because I'm taking a summer class. Because I only have one class, I have a lot of free time which allows me to think about my future. I realize that I'm really really fucked. This is the summer before I graduate and I have basically nothing under my belt. Compared to my peers, I have no relevant work or internship experiences. I have been spending my undergrad years just going to class and taking care of my son. I thought about looking for campus jobs but even those jobs require skills, which I have none of. I wanted to spend this summer being productive and taking advantage of the fact that my parents offered to watch my son while I'm going to school. But after a week of watching movies and lounging around at home when I'm not in class, I feel pathetic and useless. 

Another thing is that I think I have social anxiety. I don't have a single friend in life and even with classmates, I can't get along with them. I feel awkward wherever I am and can't contribute to conversations beyond the introduction. I don't have confidence when I speak because I don't have life experience since I'm so sheltered and because my grades are so bad. I go to a good school where everyone is really smart and are always up to something in terms of internships and projects. I haven't joined any clubs because I can't leave my son at night. 

I'm only feeling this now because this summer is my last chance to do something. Once the fall and spring semesters come, I'll be focused on my classes. Then I'll graduate with nothing but a degree in American Studies. I'll have just that on my resume and no skills. 

I have thought about teaching myself how to code this summer from Khan Academy, but I'm not sure what I'm getting myself into or if it's even the right start. I read some conflicting comments from previous threads about these online tutorials being insufficient, and that's discouraging. 

Basically, I have about 2 months to be productive. Can anyone give me advice about my situation? about coding? about other skills to teach myself?"

Some background, we have been together for 18 months and had a pretty strong relationship going. Our relationship started when I was at a different college in the same state but fairly far away. We managed quite well, with lots of skype calls and visits, and this past year I transferred to her school (I don't need to be lectured on why this may be stupid, there were other reasons but they were irrelevant to this). 


We were doing pretty well up until the last month or so of school. I'm sure I share the blame too, but right now I can't make sense of everything and I could use some input from an objective view or two. Here goes.


My gf was in some classes with a group of people who share a major with her, and 5 or 6 of them were all in 3 or so classes together. Basically, she started hanging out with them. A lot. She would go over to their place to smoke pot (not an issue, i partake as well) and hang out. At this point, we spent pretty much every night together in her dorm because it was closer to campus, and you know, snuggles, but just circumstantially I had spent more time at my place. 


It seemed that for the nights I spent at my place, she would always go smoke with them. Additionally, one Tuesday she spent a huge amount of time making edibles that I thought were for her roomates and mine (we are all very close friends) but instead found out they were for the friends in her class. So it seemed like this stupid group of people was more important than anything else.


 The main thing that keeps me up all night is this one guy in the group who she used to ""joke"" about being super hot. She was in a class with him last semester as well, and every so often she would jokingly bring up how attractive he was, etc. Etc. It didn't really bother me until she started hanging out with him and the other people. My gf and I  had a conversation before the end of classes, and she said something basically along the lines of ""it is just awkward how I said that he is hot and now we are friends."" 


I could handle these casual comments, but the past month, she started texting this guy constantly. It got to the point where if she was texting, I pretty much knew it was him. She offered to show me the texts, but I wanted to trust her so I said no. However, it got to the point where I got too curious, and when she went to the bathroom I looked at her phone- I saw something she texted along the lines of ""we can smoke, but it should be at your place because my roommates are nosy"". I brought it up to her (she said she knew I would look at her phone, and that it didn't bother her, but she said she was basically setting a trap by leaving her phone alone with me) and she said that all her conversations with him are just about smoking and the classes they have together. Just the detail of how she didn't want to smoke in her apartment because of her roommates really freaked me out. I don't have any reason to believe she is lying, and the rest of her texts seemed to agree with what she said, but it keeps me up at night.


Additionally, one of her biggest issues with me is that I am too sensitive- she is probably right, usually I sulk when she says something even remotely mean, but lately she has been using that accusation constantly. Anytime she says something that ends up making me feel bad (ie, your arms are getting flabby) her excuse is that she was just joking. 


The ultimate example of this is the summer. I was either going to be a lifeguard living in my schools town for the summer, or have a super awesome internship about 2 hours away from my hometown. I ended up getting the internship and I was super happy. Unfortunately, all she ever mentioned about it was that I could have been a lifeguard and that I could have been in such good shape. When I brought this up to her, she again said she was just joking, and that the reason she said that is because I didn't tell anybody about the internship (I was not sure at all I would get it). I am about 99% confident she wishes I would have been been a lifeguard, which is fair- she is taking a class the first month of the summer where she would be in the town of our school on the weekends so she could see me, plus some other logistic conveniences. To make things worse, this guy is in her class AND she has no phone use during the weekdays.


Currently, she is at school at a party with this guy and the other people- and I know she always is grinding on other guys when I am not at the party, she told me this without hesitation and although it doesn't make me mad, it doesn't exactly make me comfortable.


Basically, worst case scenario what goes through my head is she drinks, does some pretty intense dancing with him, and decides to take him to her place to seal the deal- and there is no way I would ever find out. I have always trusted her, and never had a real reason not to, and after I read her texts she accused me of not trusting her at all (kind of exaggerated, but fair to a point).


Anyway, this weekend is the first time I've been able to text her in a week, and of course I had to initiate the texting and continue the conversation.. we skyped last night for about 2 hours, and then went to bed. Today was even worse, we texted pretty well until 6ish, and then she didn't reply at all after i wished her a fun night until 1am just saying ""goodnight"". The icing on the cake for this whole thing is that she hasn't said I love you since the conversation we had about her texting (it ended on a positive note, but she was fairly emotional when it happened because she said it felt like an interrogation. We hugged after we talked and that was the last time she told me ily). Even when I texted her or told her, like last night, she would not say it. The worst part is that it makes me feel humiliated and desperate when she has such cold and apathetic responses. 


It has only been a week, but based on her responses and apathy, it is not going to be a good month. All I feel is neglect, embarassment, and a slew of related emotions. I am glad she is having fun, she does deserve it (she works very hard), and I tell her that every chance I get, but it feels like I am just being walked all over. I don't feel like she is cheating, I really don't, but I always treasured how we were best friends and it seems to have imploded so suddenly. And no comms for a week at a time is.. just awful.


Tl:dr; relationship with gf that was going swimmingly seems to have dove into the abyss due to combination of summer schedule, communication, and apathy on her end.


I really appreciate any comments, it's just killing me imagining all the different ways that she could be hurting me (but probably isn't). I do miss her, but lately the feelings of mistrust, sadness, and bitterness have overwhelmed that feeling by a long shot."

**Physical appearance:** Gregory Bradley is rather tall young man.  His hair is his pride and joy, taking the time to turn it into outrageous and memorable styles.  Eye catching is his goal, as the next time someone sees him, they usually forget how they know him.  His clothing style is dark and impressive, long coats and suits being the main parts of his style.  He’s not exactly the strongest, compared to war kids, but he’s done strength training and body conditioning through school.  Weight training doesn’t require people to necessarily know who you are, unlike a lot of clubs.

**Mentality:** He’s of two minds most of the time.  When people notice him, he wishes he could be noticed for his own qualities rather than what people project onto him.  When he’s being ignored, he just wishes that he would have some attention paid to him.  It’s a rather vicious cycle.  Fame is fickle, friends.


**Backstory:** Gregory was born to Pheme and Michael Richards in Chicago, Illinois.  At the time, Michael was an evening news anchor with a wife and two daughters, and had a solid following.  Pheme came to him as a young intern, and the two had a passionate affair.  Of course, such fraternization is frowned upon, and this dalliance cost Michael his job, as well as his wife.  Nine months later, Gregory was delivered to his father in a gilded cradle.  A note attached to the baby furniture simply read.

&gt; Your fortune is dependent on how you treat our son.  The better you care for him, the more my blessings will fall upon you, my dear heart.

And so Michael raised Gregory with a passion. His wife left him shortly after finding out about the affair, so he had split custody of his daughters with her.  With the advances in technology as Gregory grew, Michael found himself with a second chance, the ability to  recover his fame through the internet.  You may recognize him from a daily news series known as Mik’s Minute.  It took off remarkably well, and he’s become something of an internet sensation, dabbling in all fields digital.  He’s booked on lecturing tours and was most recently master of ceremonies at the CCT, Chicago Convention of Technology.  He brought his son and daughters to enjoy the experience, which is where Gregory gets pulled into his new life.  A band of empousai groupies were searching for him, trying to find the tantalizing morsel.

Ironically, when monsters came for Gregory, they actually couldn’t locate him.  A crowded convention hall filled with more than one demigod created bedlam, to say the least.  His scent was everywhere, but he just blended in and no one was able to give the Empousai any information about his appearance.   Luckily, his satyr Glen was smarter than the monsters and managed to get him out of the convention hall before a confrontation proved imminent.  A limo driver, thinking him to be one of the online personalities at the convention, drove them away.  Glen easily got them moving to Camp, which is where we’ll rejoin our hero.

**Powers and drawbacks:**

-**”I know you…”** Gregory often carries many qualities that people find familiar in acquaintances.  Whether good or ill is up to him, but in a neutral setting, it usually turns into a mix of both.  As such, it is difficult to find where his personality begins and his power ends.

-**”The Perks of Being a Wallflower”** The other side of Pheme, Gregory can appear wholly unremarkable and unfamiliar, to the point where even people who have made his close aquaintance have difficulty remembering that they’ve actually met him.  This makes it a challenge for him to build lasting friends, although he does get to constantly make new ones, which is fun.  In a sad way.



**Skills:**

* Running-  Gregory practiced long distance running in school, and wasn’t too terrible at it.  His endurance is pretty darn fantastic for a non-war kid.

* Technical Work-  He learned a lot from his sister Holly regarding technical theater work.  As such, he’s good at wiring lights and sound equipment, as well as costume and makeup design.

* Finding his Light- Gregory knows how to make himself look good, and, when not a wallflower, is quite capable of being a suave, confident young man.  Too bad very few people actually acknowledge it as one of his own qualities.  Shame, really.

***

*The limo pulls up to the border of camp, Glen and Gregory hopping out of the vehicle.  Glen runs to the Big House to let them know of the new arrival, while Gregory walks slowly through camp, running a hand through his hair, trying be himself… Whoever that really is.*

4ljfel,3,2016-05-29,"Been away from this sub for a while, just dropping in to share my story and some love (long post inside)",nematode92,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4ljfel/been_away_from_this_sub_for_a_while_just_dropping/,"Anxiety and depression have been a part of my life for the past 2 years now, ever since I graduated from undergrad and was about to start a Master's program. I began having frequent panic attacks, suicidal thoughts, and thought I was losing my mind. Despite managing that semester academically, emotionally I was all over the place, very unsure of myself. I had consistent digestion issues, in and out of the doctors' office for weeks hoping it was some underlying physical ailment that was my problem, unwilling to concede that mental health was my real issue. I was eating far too little, getting down to 163 pounds. To put that in perspective, I am 5'11"" and a former football player who still regularly works out and hadn't weighed that little since maybe freshmen year of high school, perhaps earlier; I was 195 during my senior year of high school and not at all stocky.

And then after concluding that digestion and heartburn weren't my issues, I rebounded and turned to food as comfort, gaining 30 pounds in two months. I didn't realize how I was using food to comfort me and thought I was doing better, until suddenly right before the end of my first semester I had a complete existential break down, living in non-stop anxiety and fearing for my life for that last week of class. I ended up leaving a couple of days early, telling my professor I had to leave for a family emergency and getting permission to turn a take-home final in late. I was utterly lost, thought life had no purpose, that everyone around me were just blind fools who couldn't see the truth that was so clear to me, that life is bleak and futile and why bother to do anything. I was planning on taking a leave of absence but after a few weeks of stagnating at home I realized I needed to head back to school and keep making some sort of progress with my life. The days leading up to my trip back to school were some of the worst in my life. I was the most depressed I had ever been, the joy had been sapped from my life, and I was beyond terrified about leaving the sanctuary of home with my parents despite knowing it's what I had to do. 

The ride back to school with my father was perhaps the scariest experience of my life. Every second of that drive I was unsure about my decision and a voice in my head was screaming to tell my dad to turn the car back around, a dad who wasn't really privy to just what kind of shape I was in. At hour four of a five hour drive I finally managed to open up to him about how bad of shape I was still in, which ended up making the last hour much easier. I was in better shape than expected upon returning to Pittsburgh, where I also went to undergrad, and was determined to turn things around. I immediately sought out therapy, which also led to meeting with a psychiatrist. I clawed my way through another semester. I got back into going to the gym and lifting weights intensely. I regularly went to therapy and kept a journal to write down some of my worst thoughts to get them out of my head and to put them on paper, where they became a little less harmful. 

That semester wasn't without it's low points and dark patches. I had horrifying nights where I contemplated whether I really wanted to persist. I started taking Celexa and the first two weeks were during a miserable cold spell in February. This was also a really busy time of the semester where I had a lot of work and was being interviewed for summer internship positions. I was an absolute mess, and with each day doubted my decision to begin the medication. But somehow I made it through the semester, and with an adviser now in mind for my thesis the following year. 

The next step in my journey was a summer internship, a requirement of my Master's program, and I was excited at the prospect of getting real world experience and the good it might do me. Instead I hated it, loathed it really. I couldn't imagine spending the rest of my life in a work environment like that, and it led to another meltdown of sorts; what do I do with my life? For a while I had flirted with the idea of getting my Ph.D. in math and attempting a career as a professor in academia (despite a grim job market), but was never ready to commit. This taste of the cubicle life was exactly what I needed, and I refocused all of my efforts in that direction. Throughout I was plagued with more doubts, daily anxiety, bouts of depression and hopelessness, but I stayed the course. I studied for a few months in preparation for the math subject GRE, while also beginning research for my Master's thesis. I applied to several Ph.D. programs around the country with hopes of being accepted somewhere. 

And now, after a busy and taxing year, I am happy to say I have completed my Master's thesis and earned my degree with a 3.93 GPA, and I will begin a Ph.D program this coming fall. I made some new friends and started a band this past year, something I have wanted to do for a while. I also have a lovely girlfriend of 8 months who struggles with anxiety and depression herself and has been an unbelievable support system for me. 

I still have stretches of anxiety and depression and go to therapy weekly. I  am still taking 20mg Celexa daily. Just how much is it helping? Sometimes I wonder, but I certainly I think it has helped at least a little, and if anybody reading this is on the fence about taking medication I would say that you should at least consider it. It can really make a difference. And finally I am still at times totally unsure of my future and terrified at what the future holds. But these days, despite the anxiety that can often suppress it, I am also excited about the future.

I don't know what brought me back here and what made me want to share my story, but it feels good to share it. I hope that someone reading this finds some comfort in my experience. I am living proof that you can fight through anxiety, depression, and periods of crippling uncertainty and make strides toward living the life you want to lead. When this process first began for me, I dreamed of a day where this would all be behind me. Now I have doubts that this will ever all be behind me, as after all, why would it be? And better yet, why does it need to be? I just need to keep working my hardest to live a day at a time and not be paralyzed by thoughts of a cloudy future., as you can always think your future into a cloudy one. My levels of anxiety are still not where I want to be, but so what? They are certainly better, and my quality of life has improved greatly. While there is still progress to be made, living life feels worth it (most of) these days, and there's no reason why that needs to change.

This subreddit was a great help to me during the initial months of fighting my anxiety and depression. Just knowing that others were experiencing what I was experiencing was comforting and reassuring. The people here were so friendly and understanding, and reading people's stories of successes was beautiful. I also very well may have passed on seeking medication without the support of people in this subreddit, and while by no means a cure-all it has definitely helped me live my life. A few people in this community were there for me, and I'm happy to be there for anybody who might be reading this that could use someone to talk to. I hope this story can provide some comfort to even one person out there; that alone will make it worth my having typed it."
4ljfrh,7,2016-05-29,My one and only OK Cupid Date (and request for help at the bottom),BrianLemur,OkCupid,https://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/4ljfrh/my_one_and_only_ok_cupid_date_and_request_for/,"I figured Sunday is for stories, so I would share the only time I have ever been successful on OK Cupid and why it was a beautiful success (and also not). Small amount of background: I'm a 22 year old man who was 21 at the time and attending a major university. I'm not all that attractive. In fact, I'm kind of a fat dude. I rarely get matches, and when I do they generally don't talk to me.


A few months ago, there was a girl who came across my feed who was just perfect--95% match, beautiful woman, lots of similar interests, and by her profile I could tell we would mesh super well. (Side note, she's a black girl, I'm a white dude whose extended family is pretty racist. It doesn't affect this story at all, except that on some level I always hoped that this would blossom into a relationship and send my grandmother to her grave)

I sent her a message basically saying ""you seem awesome, I'd love to get to know you."" Radio silence. Nothing for a week, not even looking at my profile. Whatever. I'm used to rejection. I don't push the issue.

Fast forward a few weeks to the Michigan primary elections. I just had my appendix out and was able to walk easily on my own for an extended period for the first time in a few weeks, so I decided to go for a walk to vote. I was finishing up my music therapy degree at the time, so guitar practice was essential--I brought it with me, intending to vote, then practice outside on campus for a while and take in the nice weather, and then walk home. Yes, I'm a douche. Anyway, here's [Wonderwall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hzrDeceEKc).

When I walked into the precinct, the guy running it immediately approached me. I figured he would ask me to leave my case behind to avoid tampering with machines or whatever, but he just says ""We're bored out of our minds. Care to play us a few tunes?"" I obliged because I'm an attention whore.

A few songs in, I hear this adorable voice yell from the other side of the room (another precinct): ""That sounds beautiful, please come play for us!"" BAM! I'm on it. I walk over and, who else should have been yelling for my attention but the girl from OK Cupid. She didn't recognize me, but I played a few songs and noticed that she couldn't keep her eyes off of me. I finished, voted, and left.

An hour later, I've recounted this tale to my best friend, and she finally says ""Just message her again."" So I do.

""Hey, this is super weird, but I'm about 70% sure that I just sang to you.""

Less than a minute later:

""YOU DID! That was amazing."" (I won't continue with the full message because I don't want this to sound like I'm trying to brag about a woman being interested in me for being OH GOSH SO TALENTED, but... that's exactly what happened. I guess.)

Huh. I rarely get a reply, and when I do it's usually hours later if I'm lucky. At best, someone MIGHT glance at my profile and then move on on a good day. I have obviously hooked this young woman in a good way. After a few hours of chatting, we exchange numbers. The next day, SHE initiates a date with ME (WHAT). She names a coffee shop, we meet up, she's cute as a button, I buy her an Italian soda, we chat for a few hours, and then we part ways. Overall, it was a lovely date and from the way she was talking it was obvious that she had basically studied my profile and figured out the few things she definitely wanted to know about me and stayed engaged, just trying to be as interesting as possible *for me*. A friend of mine showed up half way through (unrelated, meeting someone else there) and told me afterward that the date sounded flawless from what she could tell and that we were obviously into each other. Afterward, we text for a while and she lets on that she's looking for something serious. I was too, so she seems pretty happy about this and we talk about a few more dates.


The sad end of this story is that between catching up from the classes I missed post surgery, preparing for internships and graduation, and working full time, I didn't have any free time to devote to a relationship. I let her know this as soon as I was aware of it and told her that if we ever had another chance that I would love to give it a try with her because she was wonderful. There was no second date.

Basically, what I need is a dating app where I can sing to a girl before she ever sees my dumb ugly face. Does this exist?"

---

Darcy Lewis was all dressed up and had no place to go. Her plans for the evening had rather abruptly changed and she found herself doing something a little impulsive, most certainly dangerous, and one hundred percent likely to get her in trouble by the next day. The brunette had clipped the little plastic badge over her coat so that she wouldn’t be stopped on the way in. With the purpose of a woman who knew exactly what she was doing she walked through the ritzy building to a very monitored, private lift. It was the only elevator in the building that stopped on the level she wanted. Her long black coat covered the dress she wore, but her dark hair was pulled up, her makeup was on point, and she’d been able to snag the last tube of her favorite red lipstick.

*If this is the end of the world, 
Let me die. 
You call me your fallen angel, 
With the devil in your eye.*

Once inside the lift she let out a soft sigh. It was hard to believe what could be accomplished when she put on her bitch face and moved with purpose. The music still played through her ear-buds as she snapped off her ID and swiped it through the subtly hidden card reader. The silver doors shut and she felt the floor ascend towards her destination. There weren’t too many things that made her rethink something once she’d jumped at the idea, but as the door dinged and opened she felt her heart flutter a little at the bizarre decision she had made. The things she did to entertain herself. The things she did to get a rise out of Jane.

*Your body speaks to mine. 
Both wicked and divine. 
In me I feel a flame ignite, 
Cause I was born to love you.*

The song was too loud, which was exactly how she liked to listen to it. Elodie Adams was a new favorite and now that she was S.H.I.E.L.D.’s unpaid intern she was fairly sure they wouldn’t confiscate her iPhone with all her music again. Her heels clicked on the marble floor as she made her way down the hallway that was just as nondescript as the public areas of the building had been.

*I feel it now, 
And you were born to save me from myself. 
I'll pay for what I've done. 
For now the night has just begun-*

The brunette stopped the music by just pulling her headphones out and stowing them and her phone away in her pocket. She’d noticed the camera in the hall, but she’d expected no less so she didn’t make a big deal about walking past it. When Darcy did get to the door she paused. It wasn’t hesitation. It was another bubble of something she was having trouble putting her finger on. Excitement? Mischief? It reminded her of sneaking out on prom night and breaking into the main office so that her and a some fellow AV nerds could take over the PA system and Rick Roll everyone.

Visiting Loki was likely to get her in a lot more trouble than that had; although she was relatively sure it wouldn’t end up with her in handcuffs. Not that it would be the first time. Darcy was just about to knock, ID still in hand, when the door made a quiet beep and the lock clicked out.

“Huh. That’s totally not weird or anything...” The sarcastic words slid from her smirking lips as her eyebrows furled up in mild confusion. This was almost too easy.

Now that the door was open it was like Alice in Wonderland. She found herself stepping through the entryway with more grace than the fictional blonde’s tumble into Underland. “Knock knock?” Her ID went back into her pocket and she waited by the door. From what she could see this place was huge. Maybe S.H.I.E.L.D. though Loki would be appeased with a swanky apartment. She was a born and raised New Yorker and unless Stark decided to adopt her she’d never be able to afford a place like this. “Any Asgardian royalty about or am I talking to myself here?”

After the door was shut she leaned patiently against the wall. The door might have opened for her, and there were certainly times when she took liberties with things like trespassing, but it never occurred to her to do anything more than wait for him to acknowledge her presence before she entered someone’s home.

Especially when it was the home of an extremely dangerous war criminal. But since Thor has distracted Jane and it was still Darcy's birthday she decided she was going to do as she pleased and at the moment it pleased her to go to the one place that would freak everyone, and especially Jane, out enough to pay attention to the little Poli-Sci major who got sucked into a world of science and magic and Norse freaking gods.

---

In this set up Darcy was supposed to be celebrating her birthday with Jane, but Jane was rather wrapped up with Thor (litterally) so Darcy decided to find a little mischief for the evening. Loki is in Midgard to atone in much the same way Thor was first to in the first movie. S.H.I.E.L.D. has mostly been keeping him pent up in a gilded cage rather than have trust that he'll help them. 

**Not interested in age play, toilet play, humiliation, or S&amp;M.** Looking for long a term RP and a fun writing partner. Not for quick relief. Feel free to change the tone of your Loki or the situation. I just wanted to share a potential starting place that I really liked from earlier today. "
4ljnp6,2,2016-05-29,When is an appropriate time to start looking for an internship?,thesquarerootof1,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4ljnp6/when_is_an_appropriate_time_to_start_looking_for/,"I think I am thinking too early about all of this, but I am curious. I am sophomore studying chemical engineering. During the summer time, I work as a server to save up money and then I stop working when I go back to school. I also try to work when it is winter break. Let me tell you, I hate working at a restaurant or being a server.

So looking at my degree plan, I am curious to know when is an appropriate time to start looking for an internship? I feel as a sophomore it is way to early obvious. I am just starting my program. However, do you think I can start landing internships by next summer? Do I have to wait until senior year? I realize that if I want to be successful in landing a job straight out of university, I need to have experience. Should I just doing research in the summer. Is that a good alternative for an internship? When is the best time to start looking for internships?"

Let me just say this boy is absolutely lovely and is without a doubt the nicest boy I've ever met, I've told him that to his face. He's really funny and we've never argued once and we are always laughing when we're together. We have a great, friendly relationship and he is the person I'm closest to at uni.

Here's an issue though, I'm 3rd year and graduating this year, in about a month, and he is only in his 2nd. Next year I am not always going to be around and may even possibly be getting an internship abroad. I have not yet voiced these concerns to him as he is quite stressed about the exams he has coming up and I don't want to make anything worse for him or for him to not do as well as possible, as I said I care about him a lot. This is the main issue about the relationship going forward I'm having, I just don't see it working out next year in my head.

I can't realistically see the relationship working out next year, this is the main issue here, and although he's a great guy I feel his level of investment into the relationship is higher than mine, I do like him of course, but I feel he is 'more in it' than I am. I feel as well, with my own exam stress and knowing that maybe we will be breaking up my feelings towards him are in a different place.

It's a shitty situation, my life's changing and his is staying the same for the most part as he'll be still at uni after this Summer and my entire life will be changing.

I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, I don't necessarily want to break up and it will break his heart, he's told me how much I mean to him several times although we are not dependent on each other. In fact he probably has more friends than me, several close at uni and at home.

I'm just looking for some advice really on what to do, and if it comes to it what would be the best, and kindest way to break up?
TL;DR - have a lovely boyfriend but for logistical reason I just can't see it working out next year. Any advice would be appreciated"

6EQUJ5

100 years ago, almost to the day, the same exact sequence had being recognised by an intern at SETI.

No, not almost to the day. 100 years to the day exactly.

I work alone on a Lunar SETI facility. My 'home' is made out of three interconnected pods: bedroom and leisure pod, wash and pool pod, and the research centre. Looming over the pods somewhere in the darkness is the giant radio telescope. A huge satellite dish listening out for potential alien chatter.

I look again at the characters. 6EQUJ5. The WOW signal. I cross reference the location of origination against the computers estimates. It is without doubt being broadcast from within the Sagittarius cluster.

I am in a way prepared for this. The WOW signal was picked up due to how powerful it was, but it is actually a message being broadcast on the hydrogen line.

Hydrogen is the most common element in the universe, thus possibly used by extraterrestrials to send a strong signal.

It resonates at about 1420.40575177 MHz. I switch the computers decoding matrix. The message is still being broadcast. I now have many lines of unrecognisble words display on the screen infront of me - but they are certainly words. After every 23 words the message seems to repeat.

It is a different language but I believe it can be cracked by the SETI network. I set it to work - every idle computer on Earth begins to try possible keys and translations. It takes only hours for a positive outcome.

I started an internship in insurance underwriting about two weeks ago. I'm a computer science major with little to no background in finance, so forgive me if I say something stupid. 



I still don't have a clear idea about what my department does and what insurance underwriting involves. I did a few google searches, and roughly understand underwriting involves assessing risks of clients, putting a batch of services together for them, and then deciding how much they should pay for it. 



I need to send my resume to a few companies soon for CS related internships. I want to list this summers internship as experience, but I have no confidence that I can speak about it intelligently. I am not trying to learn EXACTLY what my department does. All I really want is something convincing to write on my resume.

Here's what I got so far:



*Really Big Insurance Company, My Underwriting Department*


*Underwriting Internship (5/2016 - present)*


•	Risk assessment of potential clients


•	Reviewing historical data to gauge what coverage clients should have and what clients should pay


•	Regularly working and querying in MS Excel and Access databases





(TL;DR: No experience in underwriting and finance. Help me act like I know what I'm talking about)


Thanks! "
4ll5eo,17,2016-05-29,A day after suicide attempt,schizophrenicman123,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/4ll5eo/a_day_after_suicide_attempt/,"Sorry for the very large post, it is just about my day..nothing special at all. I know suicide is a sensitive topic here, but there was no one I could talk to in real life. I am doing an internship at the moment for a few months so don't even have access to any of my doctors. 

Yesterday, I overdosed by ingesting thirty Zopiclone 7.5 mg pills with some alcohol. I drank three bottles of beer, and had decided not to eat the entire day so that the pills could be easily absorbed into my body. I began to feel drowsy and then I thought about covering my head with a plastic bag and tied it with a shoelace, since the chance of a successful suicide nearly doubles this way. But the oxygen from the hermetic bag began to suffocate me while I was still quite cognizant and the urge to breathe over-powered my mind so that I was forced to remove the bag.

I passed out and when I awoke I was very light headed. There was a bit of vomit around me. A strange sensation of solitude gripped me. I had this feeling that I was a shell of a human being. I thought that at this moment I should have been having some kind of epiphany. That I should have awoken to a new life, one full of meaning. Shed off all the atrocious insinuations that lurked in my mind. But there was only emptiness. 

I got up. I moved quite slowly and deliberately, each step taken with caution. Perhaps it was the remnants of the medication that still lingered in my body. I made myself some coffee and then cleaned up the mess. I thought a bit about the work I should do, and decided to do some writing. I had just finished writing a novel..but upon reading it last week, I found it completely repulsive. A terrible piece of work. So I had started writing a second novel, which unfortunately I think is equally pitiful. 

After two hours of writing, I made myself a second coffee and then decided to take out the trash which had piled up into several bags and was thus beginning to flood a corner of the apartment. When I stepped outside the light seemed a bit too bright. I quickly disposed of the trash and began walking towards the Arno river. I walked alongside the river for a while. There was nothing particular on my mind. Nothing seemed to interest me. The various tourists snapping selfies of themselves annoyed me. Egotistical maniacs. If I heard laughter, I would grind my teeth. Whole groups of people blocked my path at times and this caused me to become more anxious as I tried to pass by them. Eventually, I decided to walk on the street rather than the sidewalk. 

After an hour or so I got myself a panino sandwich since I was quite hungry having not eaten anything for nearly a day. Each bite began to sicken me. I thought maybe the food was stale, but perhaps it was just my own sense of despondence that triggered this impression. After a few bites I could not eat any more and threw away the rest of the panino. I wondered how I should pass the day as quickly as possible, so that it could be over. On Monday, I would once again be caught in the quagmire of having to somehow get through the drudge of the following week. I could return home and watch porn I thought to myself, but decided against it, since I reserve masturbating only for Saturdays.

Instead I thought I should ride the bus for a while and so I took a bus. It drove through the city, stopping here and there. It was crowded at times but luckily I had managed to occupy a single seat at the back, where no one could sit next to me. I began observing the various people and things they were doing. One mother was trying to quiet down her baby who was crying from its stroller. Another man was screaming into his phone. I saw a couple holding on to each others hands sitting side by side. It all seemed useless to me. As if they were living out their meaningless lives and it would never really amount to anything. They would carry on with their banal activities no matter what happened. The bus ride did nothing to stimulate me, but instead agitated me slightly more than I had been before. 

Upon returning I found the apartment just as desolate and lonely as I had left it. Everything seemed to be in order but it was a sad sight to look at. How would it have looked if it had been someone else living here, I thought to myself. Perhaps these barren walls would be echoing with laughter at this moment. Instead they resonated with a dreary symphony that seemed to accentuate a solitary kind of solemness. In the end I sat on my couch and tried to cry  but did not manage to shed any tears.  

TL;DR Woke up, there was no epiphany. No sense of regret or overwhelming feeling to continue on living.

EDIT: Thank you for the encouraging words and sharing your experiences. It means a lot to me."

4lm58s,7,2016-05-29,I'm going to be living in Foster City for the next 12 weeks. What do I do?,gunhorseunlimited,AskSF,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSF/comments/4lm58s/im_going_to_be_living_in_foster_city_for_the_next/,"I'm going to be starting a summer internship with Visa on Wednesday. They've graciously put me up in some corporate housing a little over a mile from the office in Foster City for the 12 weeks I'm here. Since the internship starts on Wednesday, I want to take these next few days to see what fun I can have in the bay area.

I'm wondering what the best options are for transportation - getting around Foster City, getting from Foster City to San Francisco, and getting around San Francisco. Uber is an option (I took my first Uber ride from SFO to my apartment and it was very pleasant), but I'm not sure if that's a cost-effective option.

Additionally, I want to know what I can do in the area for fun! I'm 19 so alcohol isn't really an option unfortunately. I look old for my age especially with my beard but I don't want to risk being carded.

As far as finances go, I have some leeway but it is definitely a factor. I have a little money right now but mostly I'm going to be relying on my credit card. It has a $1000 limit and I plan on paying it off when I get paid next month; since I am being paid very well for this internship, I'll be able to afford racking up a large balance on my credit card this month.

What's your advice, AskSF?"
4lm5ep,1,2016-05-29,Discouraged from several interviews w/o getting internships,AnEffinCookie,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4lm5ep/discouraged_from_several_interviews_wo_getting/,"So here is where I am at. I am feeling really discouraged and under motivated to continue my job search. 



A little background is that I am an EE with a 3.5 overall GPA (my major coursework is like a 3.2). Once I went to university, I was working in semi-related fields throughout my schooling. One thing to note I did not do very much on campus projects or organizations because I was working and trying to get through my classes. (not much support from parents except for housing). One job was retail selling electronic parts, and the other was sort of a technician/engineering job at a very small firm. 

I work at a company now where I am an electronic technician working in maintenance. When anything electronic breaks, or they have questions relating to new devices, I am there to provide solutions. I also have an opportunity there to redesign some of their rectifiers (true Engineering work), however it's a task that i don't know if I can realistically do over a summer.

I did receive a job offer for after my graduation this fall, but it was kinda on the low side as far as pay. I will go there if nothing else, but I still want to try for other places to see if I can get anything better.

The thing is, not to put my previous employers down, but they are not anything like Fortune 500 companies. And I'm getting a little discouraged because no other places made me an offer, and I have applied to many. Places like Boeing, Northrup, Harris, Raytheon, Edison, and many more. Got an interview for some, ignored by the rest.

It is summer now, and I don't have an ""internship"". I really don't know what to do. A lot of my fellow students have gotten jobs or internships at some of the good private companies that I applied to also. I'm left here still in kinda the same jobs as I have always been. Bottom of the barrel, very low benefit jobs/opportunity jobs. And I'm really discouraged. I honestly don't think I'll be able to improve anymore to where other companies will like me.

I am honestly tired of this job search. I feel there is so much ego, greed, and shallowness in the corporate world. I've been told by countless recruiters that ""resume looks good, I'll pass it on"" to hear nothing back. I'm at the point where I won't even let them keep my resume unless they tell me they want to have an interview with me.  

I worked my ass off in college. I didn't screw around. I'm respectable and I work very very hard at my school and jobs. I really don't know what to do anymore. I already use my free time to do more studying and learning. 

What the hell is wrong with me? What am I doing wrong? Do I lack the necessary skills? Do I lack social skills? What? 



Tl;dr: 3.5 GPA EE student rejected from multiple companies for internships. Lost and doesn't know what is wrong with him. "
4lm8gk,14,2016-05-29,"Me [20F] with my best friend [20M] of 2 years, slept with each other for 2 months, felt strongly about each other but he said he didn't want a relationship.

He was in a relationship at that time and we weren't super close but we still did homework together. We made another friend around the same time (20M, lets call him Aurelius) and the three of us made a group chat about school stuff. We kept adding other people to it who we hung out with at some point in the semester but those friendships didn't last but the three of us stuck together. After freshman year, I went back to my home country for the summer (I'm from India) and the guys stayed here in the US for internships. We still had that GroupMe and texted a lot, which was nice. Come sophomore year and Marcus got a co-op so he didn't attend school during the fall. Around October, he started having problems with his then girlfriend of 5 years (high school lovers separated by distance, among other things). Aurelius and I were still at school and we helped Marcus with his problems via that group chat. He eventually ended up breaking up with his girlfriend and he found out she had been seeing someone else while he was away on that co-op. Now, all this time, my relationship with Marcus and Aurelius was completely platonic and that is how it was supposed to be. 


When spring semester started (which was this year, January), Marcus came back and the three of us were closer than ever. Aurelius changed majors and the three of us took all the same classes. I was a semester ahead of them but I still helped them with homework and classes and we used to hang out, drink together, go bowling, all that fun stuff. For spring break, Marcus invited me to go over to his place (just me; I'm not from here so I would've been alone in a college town) and then we decided we'd drive to Aurelius' place after 2-3 days then stay there for a bit. Those 2-3 days at his place were so much fun. I'd met his family once before and they said I was the nicest person ever so it was lovely staying with them again. Thursday night of that week-long spring break, we decided to drive halfway to Aurelius' place, which would mean we could stay at our college town for the night (I didn't want him to drive for too long the next day). We talked a lot while he drove and listened to each other's music (well, he tolerated mine haha) and sort of connected on a different level, I guess? I remember feeling weird and when it struck me that he might be interested in me, I was like, fuck, and didn't let my mind arrive at conclusions. We decided to drink a bit at my apartment because why not? So watching Lion King and drinking whiskey, I thought everything was going alright. Well it was Lion King so obviously I burst into tears when Mufasa... and he hugged me and that was the first time we hugged differently, I guess? He told me he was very attracted to me at that time and I said ""Are you sure?"" and we ended up kissing and getting in bed together (we didn't have sex). All that time I was smiling like an idiot because I couldn't believe that was happening. My best friend and I. We woke up and drove to Aurelius' house without talking about what happened but there was no tension. The last day of spring break when we came back to college, we finally talked. He said he felt a connection and that he'd never had a girl best friend before, so he didn't know if what he was feeling was affection for me as a friend or if it was love. And I told him I wasn't sure either but also that I even though I'd been close to guys all my life, I'd never felt like this before. He also said that he just got out of a 5 year relationship that, he realized now, had no spark and no connection and everything was physical. I understood that he wouldn't want a relationship just yet but I asked him if it was a possibility in the future. Now this is the tricky part. With his co-op and my study abroad programs planned for the next year, we wouldn't see each other after December 2016 for a long time, possibly never. We decided that we wanted to see what this was and that we'd take it to the next level - (best) friends with benefits. I was a virgin, and he knew that, but we finally did it towards the end of March. He was so patient and everything was perfect. Lord of the Rings, pizza, sex. That's how our perfect our weekend was. 


We ended up spending even more time together in the following months - we would cook dinner together and do homework - but we decided not to tell Aurelius about it. So in that group chat of ours, Marcus would still link me up with other guys and poke fun to throw Aurelius off and I'd do the same for him. It got out of hand though and I told him to stop because he was being jealous for no reason. He admitted that he was and it was unhealthy. In April, I remember talking to him and asking him what he thought about us and he said ""Let me be single!"" as a joke, which came off as something against me. He also said he cared about me and my happiness was his happiness.I wanted things to continue the way they were, so I didn't say anything. I was catching feelings hard though. This went on till May, when summer break started and I left for my first study abroad program to Germany. He had already left for his co-op by that time so we were in different states. I texted him the night before I left and asked him what he thought about us and I told him I really, really liked him. He said ""You're confused"" (he said that a lot, hinting that my feelings for him were probably not real and I shouldn't pursue them), and that ""there's so much more out there for you to explore right now"", ""How can you be sure that I'm the one you want when you're going to Germany and there's so many other people to meet in college?"". Then he said he's been feeling the same as I do but he hasn't fully accepted it yet and ""It's just overwhelming right now, we won't even see each other much after the next few semesters"". I told him I didn't want to rush him and I wanted him to be happy, but also that if he found someone else who he felt better connected to in these coming months, I wouldn't want him to avoid it because of what happened between us. He told me the same thing and we left it at that. 


Present day: I'm in Germany, we didn't talk as much as I thought we would. I'm busy with research and he's busy with his work. I found some other people from my university here and one of the guys asked me to get coffee with him. I told Marcus about this and he said ""Go for it! You like tall german men!"" but I was like ha no, its probably nothing. Then on Thursday night, I ended up going out with all those people (including coffee guy) and got drunk. I made out with him and texted Marcus about it the next day. He flipped shit. I told him how it meant nothing and I regret it and he said ""I've lost all trust in you"". Since then he has told me how inconsiderate I am and that it makes him sick in the stomach that ""you're running around in Germany doing whatever with guys"". I told him if he cared enough he should've been upfront about his feelings and that each time I brought up wanting something more, he shot me down, and I still was sorry about what happened. He won't stop telling me that I'm easy and that I let guys walk all over me (even though he's the only one I've slept with; I've drunk made out with other people before but not since spring break). I told him I won't talk to him unless he stops judging my character based on one night and the last thing he said was ""you have no justification for what you did so you're trying to blame it on me"". Reddit, I don't know what to do. I don't want to lose a best friend. I want everything to be okay again.

   
**tl;dr**: Was sleeping with best friend for two months but he didn't want anything more. Best friend and I are in different countries right now and I drunk made out with someone else last week. Best friend says he's done with me now. What are my options? I still care about him. "

A little bit about my situation: I have an internship away from home for the summer, so my plan is to build a pc to help pass the insane amount of free time I have.  I recently purchased an ultra-wide monitor for a decent price, and it just happened to have freesync.  My question is: is freesync worth buying a ""last gen"" amd card? Because I really want a 1070, maybe even 1080.  I know that polaris cards will be revealed soon, but there is little to no chance of me waiting for them to ship to build this pc, as I'm super eager to get it put together.

Anyway take a look at the build, let me know if I can trim any fat/make better purchasing decisions, as well as weigh in on my gpu situation.  Thanks!

Ironically, I applied for a computer engineering internship with a security company, but my language skills got me an internship in marketing (I can speak French and am learning Chinese). I've slowly come to the realization that everything I want to do in life involves mathematics. I find finance fascinating as well as data science and I've been learning more about cryptography. Math is hard and it always has been because I never knew how to study for it, but when I am not taking math classes, I find that I have little challenge in my life. 

I would love to get into a really good grad school if I can kick my own ass into shape (my GPA is a 3.29 right now) and maybe go for a masters in analytics. I am going into my junior year now, so changing majors will mean a lot more work or even an extra semester of school. Here's what my new plan may be:

Majors: Mathematics, French
Minor: Chinese (Maybe also Geology, I'm two classes away from it bc of AP credits)
GPA: 3.29 now, want to get to a 3.6

If I weren't to go to grad school, what could I possibly do as a job? Rather, if I were to delay grad school, what could I do as a job in the meantime? Do you have any consolation for someone in my situation?

4lmoki,2,2016-05-29,39/M/US [TRIGGER] Sharing a poorly written and fractured (WIP) walk down memory lane...,Metasin24,lifeinapost,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeinapost/comments/4lmoki/39mus_trigger_sharing_a_poorly_written_and/,"One of my first recollections of this world was being spanked by my mother and not knowing why my mother was striking me. It wasn't until many years later that I learned the story behind the incident. A distant relative or a friend of the family had taken a painting from the home and left it in our strawberry patches in the backyard, they were planning to steal it later on. I don't remember my age exactly, but I was likely no more than three years old.

My father was a self-made businessman and at one point he had significant money. He was twenty-one years the elder of my mother, in-fact he was slightly older than my mother's mother. He dabbled in many businesses, but was most successful for owning meat markets in the ghettos of New York City. My older siblings tasted the well-to-do lifestyle, at least for part of their childhood; but as for me, things began to unravel shortly after I was born.

My mother was a trophy wife. Uneducated, but pretty and worked in entertainment. As a child she and her twin sister were singers and released an album. As young ladies, my mother and aunt, worked as singers in touring bands. Eventually, they ended up as dancers at the Gas Light Club in New York City. This is where my parents met.

While I can't speak intelligently about every detail, as I have only heard second-hand accounts of events and the sources aren't very objective, the long story short is... My mother convinced my father to move to Los Angeles, shortly after I was born. It wasn't long before my parents separated and my father's unsuccessful business forays into Los Angeles cost him much of his assets. This forced him back to New York City and he took my brothers and sister with him. Being only a small child, my mother kept me in Los Angeles. The age gaps between my siblings and I, is twelve years. I'm 12 years younger than my oldest brother, 9 years younger than my sister and 6 years younger than my older brother. I was around 3 or 4 years old when my parents separated.

In Los Angeles, with my mother, I was mostly left to my own devices or pawned off on to others to watch over me. This will become a theme in my life and the lives of my siblings, a mostly absentee mother. I remember being left alone at home and panicking when I realized as much, eventually my three or four year old brain decided to punch out one of the small glass panels in the front door. I had cut my hand doing so, luckily it was minor. I don't know how long it was until my mother returned home, but rather than comfort her panicked and injured child, I received another spanking for breaking the glass.

Around the same time, my mother took me to the Sherman Oaks Galleria while shopping. She left me alone while she went to try on some clothes. Again, my three or four year old brain made another good decision, so I wandered off and found my way to the escalator. I was playing with my GI Joe action figures on the railing of it, on my way to the top floor. The escalators had an open design, with the right hand side facing the center courtyard of the mall. One of my figures fell over the side and I lunged for it, following right behind as we both plummeted three stories. As luck would have it, I was caught on the bottom floor by a man that simply disappeared into the crowd afterwards. Strange as that may seem in today's world, where if something similar happened, there would be videos and/or interviews of it all over. Not here, the guy simply did what he had to do and wanted no recognition for his actions.

Also around this time, my mother was dating an arabic fellow by the name of Sadic. I remember this keenly because his teenage son molested me, mostly it was just touching and fondling, but it was still one of my major memories as a young child. At the end of the day, I have about a half dozen memories during this time and one of them was being molested.

Some other major memories from my time in Los Angeles; was falling into a swimming pool and almost drowning, staying with my pre-school teacher at her home and hitting the back of my head on something while playing on the couch (resulting in a gash).

I don't not recall exact timelines, but it wasn't very long until my parents partially reconciled and we were all reunited in New York City. My mother rented a big rig moving truck and drove it across the country, towing a car behind it as well. I believe that I was about five when we returned to New York.

Less than a year after being reunited, my father passed away. He suffered a heart attack while arguing with someone over a parking space. I didn't quite understand the gravity of it all until his funeral, when my I saw my cousin crying and I asked him why he was crying. Needless to say, I have little recollection of my father, aside from watching TV with him a couple times. All that I really know of him, was what I’ve been told and that was pretty limited. I never really dwelled on it, so I didn't ask many questions, I was too busy trying to deal with a number of events that a small child shouldn't have to deal with.

My oldest brother used to take me to his D&amp;D games and I was addicted to it. This game gave me a way to escape reality and use my imagination to build whatever story I could conceive. I was only six, but I already wanted to escape reality. I couldn’t get enough of it either, I would read my brother’s D&amp;D books and let my imagination run rampant. So much so, that I began to withdraw from reality, I just wasn’t interested in the same things as most other kids (or people in-general).

Around this same age, I was hit by a car. Being impatient after being in a car, I sprinted off towards our apartment building and in the process, ran right across the middle of the street. Thankfully, I got sent flying rather than being run over. I was pretty much fine, just a little shaken by the experience, but I was bruised/sore for a few days afterwards.

Around the age of seven is when I began to feel great anxiety regarding school. I don't remember which came first, the anxiety or having a teacher yell at me through a megaphone (right next to my ear) to get my attention during lunch. Either way... one day, I just hid in a bush around the corner from my school, rather than going. I was eventually noticed by someone walking down the street and a person from the school came out to get me, but I had hid in that bush for at least a couple hours that morning. Ever since that day, I did everything in my power to try and avoid going to school. I had an irrational fear of school for a long time, to the point of fighting like a cornered animal when they tried to make me go.

I was molested twice more during this time in my life. The first involved a friend of my sister, who had me lick ice cream off of her breasts and vagina while in my apartment's bathroom. The second time was when my eight year older cousin, manipulated me into performing oral sex on him. Unbeknownst at the time, my older brother witnessed it. We were at my aunt's house and my older brother and cousin were about the same age, so they hung out a lot.

My siblings were all dealing with their own demons at this time, they all turned to drug use as a way to cope with their own traumas. They also all rebelled by being hoodlums, engaging in risky and/or dangerous activities. I remember being treated like a form of entertainment by them during this time in my life, like a cool toy that they could manipulate. It wasn't until later on in life that we developed a bond, around the time I was a teenager.

Around 2nd grade, I made friends with a dominican kid and I spent a lot of time at his house, pretty much every day that I could. We used to play GI Joe, D&amp;D and run around his building complex and it’s large backyard area. He had an older brother, older sister and younger sister. This was my first taste of a traditional family experience. My own home life was a fucking mess, it was basically a flop house for all my siblings friends. It was infested with roaches, dirty and chaotic.

We moved into a house around the time I was in the 3rd grade. Not too far away from our apartment though, maybe a 5-10 minute drive. I had to change schools and since I hardly attented, making new friends didn't happen. When I did attend school, I would stop at the local conveince store on my way home and watch people play video games for hours. I didn't have the money to play, but it was my way of escaping, focusing so intently on something that I didn't have to face other problems. Occasionally, I would still see my Dominican friend, but it was infrequent at best and so was my one lone bastion of normalcy. At some point, my older brother took me to see Dawn of the Dead and I had nightmares for what seemed like forever afterwards. I gained weight from being inactive and my traumas began to manifest themselves more often. I began pulling out my hair and eating it. Regretably, I also abused my sister's cat. I smashed it's tail with a mallet, put some sort of adhesive on it's anus and threw it into a hole in the drywall. It stayed there until someone figured out where the meows were coming from. I cannot justify my actions for this and the entire thought process seems alien to me now, but it happened and I'm ashamed of it. We were at this house for probably a year.

I was missing a lot of school by the 3rd grade, but my mother would meet with members of the school and tell them a woeful tale, complete with tears. The tale was of her struggles in life and the loss of my father, both true and heartfelt, so much so that the counselors and administrators had no idea how to react. This unfortunately, usually just meant they turned a blind eye to me, rather than getting me the help I needed.

By the time 4th grade rolled around, we had moved and I was at a new school again. Unlike the last place, we were in an apartment again and there were at least some neighborhood kids that I could hang out with. Unfortunately, being a social outcast meant that only other social outcasts would be attracted to me. So the kids that I did hang out with were bad influences. This new apartment was haunted, a lot of fucked up things used to happen here. Windows would slam shut, our dog would bark at the top of the stairs for no reason, a cat snuck into the basement and I swear to God sounded like it was saying my oldest brother's name. Even a friend of my sister woke up with scratches all over her one day, after they messed around with a ouija board. It was here that I started having dark thoughts and acted out on them.

It was at this location that another memory hits me. After some pressure from the school, my mother was forced to take me, my older brother and sister also came along that day. As we were entering the building, some kid yelled out the window at us ""hey look, it's the rag family"". I wore hand me downs from my siblings, so for the most part, he was correct... but it was still another trauma I had to endure... as an adult, I have a better understanding of things and can more easily rationalize such behavior. I wasn't an adult though, I was a child and couldn't understand why all these bad things were happening to me.

I remember my older brother and I stealing a christmas tree one night too, we all craved normalcy and this action was simply our way of trying to feel normal, even if only for a short time. We did something bad, to make ourselves feel good.

Our downstairs neighbors at this duplex were a young married couple with an infant. The husband was a muscian and so he got along with very well with my older brother. Even though my oldest brother and sister dabbled in music too, it was my older brother who used it as his escape from reality. Unfortunately, the husband was also mentally unstable and used to beat his wife. They used to have horrific fights. The sad part is that we were all used to chaos in our lives that it didn't seem all that different.

Across the street from us was a large apartment complex. There was an old man who lived there and he used to let the neighborhood kids hang out in his place. He would give us freezer pops, drinks and food. He would also watch fetish porn with us around. I remember this being my first experience with porn and not only was it graphic, it was violent. At the time, I didn't know any better, but thinking back now... he was probably a pedophile. He never touched me though and for the most part was very nice.

The following year we moved to a house again and yet another new school. It was here that I got my first taste of athletics. I would play touch football in the schoolyard for hours, almost everyday. I even did a stint of pop warner here, but anxiety made me quit midway through the season. It was a couple years earlier when I first got introduced to the concept of tackle football, right around the time of the Superbowl Shuffling Chicago Bears. That was merely the mental interest though, it wasn't until later that I started to take a physical interest in the sport... probably because I lacked anyone to play with back then.

During our time at this place, we were on a segment of the Geraldo Rivera show. My future sister-in-law worked as an intern for him and my mother, the ever fame chaser that she was, pitched her sob story. The segment was on working single mothers. My mother was working as a limo driver at this time, so the story was mildly interesting.

Another year, another move and another school. We moved into a house, down the street from our former neighbors, the young couple with the baby. It was here that I made friends with a real punk of a kid and started to get into trouble making. We would do things like go into McDonalds and fill little containers with condiments, then go to a roof top of a big building and throw them at people walking by or we'd enter buildings illegally to access their soda machines or get into fights... basically we acted like hoodlums, doing whatever we wanted and could get away with. I followed along apprehensively. Most other times, I would simply play nintendo alone or with my older brother. Otherwise, I would read D&amp;D books and live in my own imagination. We lived across the street from a bowling alley and sometimes I would go there to play video games with quarters that I took from my mother's coin bank. My mother spent a lot of time at the bowling alley as well, she started talking on the payphone with a distant cousin through marriage and formed a relationship with him.

It wasn't long after this that I was whisked away to Washington State. My mother moved in with the guy from the payphone romance. He was an a religious freak and I grew up without any religious influences (let alone any structure or normality). Mike, my mother’s boyfriend, was the joke of this small town. He was very much disliked by most and by association, so was I. Generally I spent my time with Mike’s son Mikey, who was a couple years younger than myself and spoiled rotten. School was difficult here as well, I had the same anxiety, but now I had to deal with even more harassment as well. I was teased, mocked and hardly anyone would talk to me. My home life wasn’t much better, I spent most of my time confined to my room, watching ESPN or playing my Super Nofriendo.

That arrangement lasted for about a year, before my mother was on the move again, this time to Los Angeles. Things weren’t much better here, I didn’t do much except watch TV and play video games. The only good part about this time was that I began building a relationship with my older brother and sister, who both moved out to there around the same time my mother moved us to Washington State.

I haven't mentioned him before, but the nephew of my aun't boyfriend was a big part of my life as well. He recently passed and even though he was more fucked up than any of us, he tried to look out for me a lot of the time. His mother was severely abused by her family, to the point that she was very suicidal for a long time, even trying to kill her son and herself when he was little. Eventually she succeeded in her attempts to kill herself. Mike turned to drugs to cope with it and eventually found crack.

I'm now about fourteen years old and my sister, who started to build a life for herself, offered to raise me with her boyfriend at the time. I was just entering the 8th grade and this was the first time in years that I actually had some sort of structure in my life, unfortunately it didn’t last long. For about a semester, I attended school and started to fit in, even excelling in some areas. Eventually problems arose in my sister’s relationship and she couldn't handle raising me alone, so I returned to my mother.

It was at about this time that I met a pair of kids, who were brothers, at my school. I began spending a lot of time with them and their family. I was trying to escape and I found a place of relative normalcy in which to do so. Thankfully, their parents were OK with it and I had a place to escape, at least for some time. Even with all the trauma I endured, I was a good-hearted kid; respectful and helpful. I was emotionally and socially stunted in development though, whatever I learned was from observation or trial and error. During this time I had people to talk with and contemplate the world with, up until this point, I mostly just swirled over my thoughts internally. I was also first introduced to martial arts through this family, which really appealed to me.

As a side effect, I was introduced to gangs and criminal behavior by someone that I consider a brother, the uncle of these brothers, who was only a couple of years older than us. This family that I found was far from perfect, but they at least cared about me and gave me more structure in my life than my mother ever did. I thankfully didn’t really embrace the gang lifestyle, but I was around it and observed it at close proximity.

At about seventeen years old, my oldest brother and my future sister-in-law in New York, took me in to try and give me an opportunity to better myself. It wasn’t long before I earned my GED and started working. My sister got me a job as a busboy in a restaurant chain she had worked at for years. I wasn’t very good at it though and the old busboy came back, which eventually meant I was let go. A couple weeks later, my older brother got me a job at the fire extinguisher service company that he worked for. I did this for about a year and this was where I found my first mentor. He was an older puerto rician guy who was into Karate for many years. I worked with him in the shop and we spent a lot of time discussing all types of things. Eventually though, I decided to give College a try and moved back to Los Angeles.

During tmy time in New York, I began hanging out with the daughter of my mother's good friend, with whom I kind of grew up with. She was a couple years younger than me, but very beautiful and I had a big crush on her. She wasn’t very interested in me though, I was awkward and not very handsome, but we were besties. She was the first person that I attempted to look out for, I took on kind of a paternal role with her. While attending College in Los Angeles, she and my older brother became an item.

So I moved back to Los Angeles and stayed with my mother for a while. During which time, I began training in mixed martial arts and playing semi-pro football. I knew a guy from my previous stay in LA, through my surrogate family, he was a highly ranked student at a kung fu school that I took a couple classes at. He had recently competed in UFC 2 and was looking to start a team of fighters, I was his first student. I learned a lot from him, both in martials arts and in life, he was my second mentor in life. He had to move away after about 6 months, so that's when my MMA career ended.

At this point, I enrolled in a Junior College. I took German, Theatre, Ancient History, Geology and Weight-training classes. I inquired into playing football as well and was given an off-season work-out program. I got a fulltime job at the Sherman Oaks Galleria, as a shipping clerk. I also moved in with my surrogate family. Sadly, I was unprepared for higher education (well, life in-general). Nor did I have any financial support or anyone to really show me the way. I stumbled hard, I bit-off way more than I could chew. I lasted almost a full semester; but between financial issues, no time to study and work/football commitments; I failed. Something good came from the experience though, I found another mentor in my strength and conditioning coach. While I didn't really speak to him much, I learned a ton by observing him and hanging on everything he said when he spoke.

After my failure in JuCo, I took a good hard look at the Military and ended up joining the Army. My test scores were in the top couple percentile, yet I ignorantly chose Infantry as an MOS... I had in my mind that I would do a couple years and work-out the whole time... with the money for college and the knowledge to physically prepare myself for it, I could then give College and football a real shot.

I fucking loved basic training, never in my life did I feel purpose like that. I broke my wrist in the first week and sucked it up for another 6 weeks before it was even diagnosed. After getting a cast, I stilled tried to do everything everyone else did. When I went back for a recheck and the doctor noticed that my wrist wasn’t healing properly, he put me in a full arm cast and made it impossible for me to disobey his instructions. Well at least I got a whole month off due to it. While in basic training, just like my entire life, I was always seeking someone to look up to... a father figure so to speak. I found one in my Platoon Sargent and I respected the hell out of him, I worked my ass off to make him proud of me and he genuinely seemed to like me. While I was socially and emotionally under developed, I had an innocence about me, I was childlike and curious about things. Being where I am today, I recognize these same traits in young children and it's super endearing, so I get it.

I had changed while in basic training, both physically and psychologically. I went from being an ugly duckling to the swan, it wasn’t just the physical stuff either, my body transformed into a work of art and my pudgy face became chiseled; revealing a far more attractive visage underneath (at least according to Society’s standards of beauty). Upon returning to New York during my 30 days of convalescent leave, I really started to get the attention of girls, of which I had no prior experience with. I even noticed this elsewhere, around post and at clubs, it wasn’t uncommon for girls to show me lots of attention or even cat-call me. In addition to the physical stuff, I was actually happy for once in my life, I wasn’t looking to escape reality because I finally had purpose. This happiness shined through me, people picked up on it and wanted to be around me.

It was a couple months after graduating basic that I got stationed in Texas and received orders to deploy to Bosnia. Right before deployment, I got more leave to go home again. This is when my love life got complicated… while on leave, my aunt tried to set me up with her assistant, she was pretty and sweet. When I first met her though, she didn’t seem interested, but as I was leaving my aunt raced outside and told me she would love to go out with me sometime. Unfortunately, the night before I ran into a friend of my oldest brother whose daughter I expressed interest in a couple years prior, before getting shot down by him. The next day, I get a phone call from his daughter, who he gave my number to. I had spent a lot of time a couple years before thinking of this girl, yet I spent no more than mere minutes in her company, so this very much intrigued me. A lot of the time, I lived vicariously through my imagination, running different scenarios around in my head. As it happened to work out, she was available that night and my aunt’s assistant wasn’t, so I agreed to meet up with her.

The date was amazing, we met at about 6 PM and I dropped her off at her house at around 3 AM, we went all over New York and did a ton of things. We connected on so many levels, I was hooked and so was she. The next morning she called me and wanted to go out again that night, but I told her that I had made plans with my aunt’s assistant prior to her first calling me. This pissed her off something fierce. Being innocent and a strong moral code from the Military, I decided to go out with my aunt’s assistant that night and while she was hooked on me, I was not hooked on her… we went to see H2O and I got lost looking for the theatre, she told me “it’s OK, as long as we’re together”, this made me feel uncomfortable. She was coming on so strong after maybe spending a total of 30 minutes with her.

I wasn’t trying to be a player, I just had no experience with dating and I was trying to follow my ideals… the one thing that I felt extremely passionate about was not propagating the things that I've experienced which hurt. In other words, I wanted to do onto others as I would want done onto me. Therefore, I didn't want to hurt this girl's feelings by cancelling and hoped that she would find me undesireable, especially if I showed no interest in her on the date. I was a perfect gentleman on both dates, I made no advances (I didn’t even know how TBPH), but with my aunt's assistant I didn't show any interest in her (outside of common courtesy).

I called Shannon the next day and explained as much, I had very strong feelings for her after our first date. I apologized profusely and even acknowledged that I should have cancelled it and followed my feelings instead of my honor. We ended up arranging another date and this one was even more amazing than the last, we shared a kiss towards the end and I was walking on clouds.

For whatever reason, Shannon and I didn’t meet up the following night and the other girl (who was friendly with my family) showed up and wanted to hang out. I don’t really remember the exact details here, but that’s about the gist of it. I didn’t want to hurt her feelings, so I was like whatever… I hadn’t shown any signs of interest in this girl, since before the call from Shannon, but this girl was wild about me for whatever reason. To me, the whole encounter was innocent, it was kind of a group thing and I was simply being polite.

Shannon and I ended up going to Six Flags a couple of days later. We were having a great time, laughing and enjoying one another’s company. While standing in line, I started to gently run my hand down her face, while we stared into each other's eyes and a couple of ladies near us commented “oh you guys are in love, that’s so sweet”. I immediately noticed a dramatic shift in Shannon’s demeanor, she stiffened up and started to distance herself from me for a decent amount of time. At the end of the night, while driving home, we went to a gas station and I bought a coffee. We ended up fooling around a bit in the parking lot, but something had changed in her.

For the rest of the weekend, we spent the entire time together, we fooled around more and eventually made love. I was a virgin and madly in love with this girl. So much so that I contemplated going AWOL to be with her. I had never experienced reciprocated love before and it was intoxicating. The closeness and intimacy of it was overwhelming, especially for someone like me, who didn’t even feel loved by his own family.

I returned to Texas and over the next few days before I left for Bosnia, I spoke with Shannon every night. I was a very idealistic person at this time; I believed in things like honor, loyalty and respect. I made a point of asking Shannon just one thing, if for whatever reason, just don’t cheat on me… give me the courtesy of a phone call, letter or something. She was going off to an ivy-league university, as I was going overseas and I had heard all the stories of Jodi from guys in the Army.

Over the next year, while I was in Bosnia, I spent probably five thousand dollars in phone calls to her. I was extremely lonely there and was still high off of love. When I returned, we had planned for her to move in with me for the Summer. I first noticed some signs of trouble while in Bosnia, on the phone. I called one time and her roommate answered, whom seemed troubled when she realized it was me, when Shannon got on the phone… she was very distant and seemed guilty of something, a total 180 from usual conversations.

After she arrived in Texas, we started having problems. She was supposed to find work to help out, but never did. I had a car accident and was basically broke, as a soldier I didn’t make much money and renting off post took most of my pay, so I had to borrow money from my sister to get the car fixed. We broke up a few times and had a couple nasty arguments over the Summer, she played the victim role and turned all my friends against me, to the point that my roommate started carrying his pistol with him (after she left, he realized that she had manipulated him, he then told me about the gun and apologized for judging me unfairly).

During that Summer, while I was training for a week and away, she started to cozy up with a friend of a friend. I realized this when her mom sent her some money and she decided to go out to the club instead of helping me pay bills. She was trying to convince me not to come, but I had a feeling something was up. While at the club with her, my friend and her friend; she started dancing with the guy and he grabbed her ass, which she didn’t remove. I walked over, handed her her stuff and walked out of the place. She followed me, pleading with me and like a love drunk fool I forgave her. Not long after, she returned to school.

Over the next couple of weeks, while speaking to her on the phone, I eventually drudged up the courage to confront her. That’s when she dropped the bomb on me and admitting to cheating at least three times, twice while at school and once with the friend of a friend. At this point I should have ran away, but I was still in love and being an idealist, believed people could change. Unfortunately, what I didn’t realize at the time, was that the damage was already done… I was emotionally wrecked by this. Just when my life had started to come together, I was slammed right back down to reality by more trauma/adversity. After years of withdrawing from the world, I had finally started to embrace it and believe that I had overcome all my childhood challenges, only to have the rug pulled out from under me again.

A year later, I finished my service and returned home. To cope with my emotional pain, I began to withdraw again. Turning back to video games as an escape mechanism and this only lead me down a deeper spiral of darkness. Relationships faded, my zest for life dimmed and I started losing focus on priorities (like work). I was holding onto only one beacon of light in this abyss, Shannon. I was being beaten down by stress and disappointment on all sides, but I hung onto the ideal that people are good inside and with the right influences they could find it.

Things were very rough for the next year. Stressed over money and feeling the walls closing in on me, Shannon had bought me a birthday cake and I snapped at her for wasting money on it. This lead to her going back to school that night and cheating on me yet again. Driving me further down into the darkness. The strange thing is that I was her therapist, when I needed therapy myself… I pushed her to overcome obstacles and to look into her past, helping her understand her own traumas and deal with them. I was her rock, as she genuinely changed and became a stronger/better person. All the while, I was crumbling on the inside.

Over the next four years, I coped with my own problems by becoming emotionless, burying them deeper and deeper. I started to use my ego as a wall, deluding myself and pawning off blame for my own inadequacies. Becoming angry and bitter at the world. I needed to get away and find purpose again, face my demons and create closure for them.

I asked my older brother, who had recently moved to New Hampshire, if I could stay with him and work on myself. Shannon, who had recently began her career, stayed behind in New York. We did the long distance thing for a couple of more years and I had enrolled into a vocational school to learn 3D animation. I was about halfway through the program, when I hit rock-bottom. I was holding the weight for so long that I finally dropped it, depression finally took me over. I just didn’t care about anything or anyone, I stopped going to school for a couple weeks and when I called Shannon looking for some encouragement, she dumped me.

At this point, I wanted to watch the world burn, I hated Shannon and hated the world. I did some things that I’m not proud of and that went against my nature, but I was psychotic at this point and not even a shell of myself. I was fucked up in the head for a good year, contemplating all manner of horrible things to lash out against everyone and everything I could. Why was the world so cruel to me? Why can’t I just be loved instead of hurt constantly? To top it off, she put all the blame on me, using excuses that weren’t even true. I was no angel and there were plenty of valid reasons for her to end it, but instead of citing those, she was citing things that other people did and saying it was me. Look, at times I was manipulative and overbearing, even downright cold and distant. All valid reasons to leave me...

I later learned through a mutual friend that the probable reason of our break-up was due to her fear of leaving her life in New York, where her family ties are... plus her mother was pushing her to leave me as well (who has been divorced and was at the time having troubles in her current marriage). I believe this is why she made up false reasons, to try and hide her real motives out of possible guilt. While she was growing as a person, she still had issues. I don't fault her for it these days, I can understand and relate, but I still think she could've been honest with me... it would have made the transition a lot easier for me, as I wouldn't have been force to examine her claims to see if there was any true to them and hell, I could of at least wrapped my head around ""I don't want to leave NY""; rather than wondering ""what the fuck?"".

I took a break from the animation program, I was with Shannon for 8 years and I couldn’t deal with the pain of the relationship ending… I started feeling the same anxiety that I had felt in primary school come back when I attempted to go to class, there was no way I could have been productive under those conditions. I spoke to the administrators and they allowed me to rejoin the next class a few months later. I eventually finished the program, but this was right around the Great Recession hitting it’s hardest. My older brother began having financial difficulties and finding work in the field was nigh impossible without finding an internship first, which I couldn’t do at the time… I had to find something that was paid, in order to try and help my brother.

All that I could find where I live was a part-time bus driver position, I have no degrees and my Army experience only translated into law enforcement or security work, neither were options at this point though, since both required time and money (of which I didn’t have).

I found a second job a little later, coaching HS football. This was the purpose that I had been missing for so long. I found out that not only do I love working with kids, I’m very good at it. By the time the next season rolled around, after seeing my work with the kids, my athletic director offered me a job working with emotionally and behaviorally disabled students. As well as another coaching position for basketball.

I do not earn much, since I lack a degree and work as a paraeducator, but I make an impact and this fulfills me. I’ve been doing this for 5 years now and it gives me purpose. I get to be that person that I wish I had growing up, since the demographic that I work with comes from a similar upbring of trauma and dysfunction. Unfortunately, I’m probably dying, I’ve been seeing signs of failing health and I figure that I have less than a handful of years left to continue my work. At this point though, I’m content with who I am and what I’ve done in this life, even if it’s a bittersweet proposition to ponder the what ifs and what could have beens. All that remains is letting those I care about know my true feelings.

I’m writing this in the hopes that it touches someone who has lost hope, been beaten down by the world to the point of apathy… you can come back, even if you never live up to the soul-crushing standards of Society, you can be a catalyst for others and make a difference to someone. You can bring a horse to water, but cannot force it to drink… although, if you keep bringing horses to water, you’ll eventually find a thirsty horse."

I am a graduating Grady High School student with extensive hands-on STEM experience through my FIRST Robotics team, G3 Robotics. I am eager to use my current technical knowledge while developing greater skills through a summer job or paid internship program.	

I have developed strong interpersonal skills as a result of over four years of robotics team leadership growth. In my drone team captain role on G3 Robotics, I provide UAV design, build and flight mentorship through our unique middle school student and teacher outreach program, G3 Drones for Good. Through the championing of this community outreach program, I’ve enjoyed demonstrating strong verbal communication skills and professionalism in a variety of settings. As I am also the robot driver for G3 Robotics during our FRC Challenge season, I am used to driving 120 pounds of metal across a playing field in front of thousands of people, which has taught me to remain flexible and responsive in fast-paced situations. Juggling studies and over 20 hours of robotics time each week has helped me grow my time management skills.

I am always eager to seek new responsibilities and learn new skills in the workplace. I am flexible, thoughtful, and enjoy taking initiative to achieve better results for a team. I also enjoy a challenge and am keen to use my skills and experience anywhere an employer might see fit to place me.

4lmv7r,2,2016-05-29,Not sure if even relevant but want to vent...I just want to be independent!,confused-baby-adult,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4lmv7r/not_sure_if_even_relevant_but_want_to_venti_just/,"I'm 19 years old, I moved out 2 years ago for college. Mom tried to move with me and when I told her I would rather she didn't, she guilt tripped me about how lucky I am that she's willing to pay rent (wtf? she wants to move there, ofc she's going to pay rent) and uproot her whole life for me. I told her I never asked and she yelled a lot about how ungrateful and awful I was being and kept looking for a job. Luckily she didn't find one (college towns!) and ended up staying in my hometown.

I loved living by myself. She helped me find a place and got an extra key...And showed up during orientation week, angry that I wasn't at home on a Friday night before courses even started. I was actually meeting people (and yeah, that does involve partying) and I told her I was out. And she was like, ""Yeah I know I'm at your place come home immediately you shouldn't be out right now."" I was angry and we argued and I told her she couldn't come to visit me without advance notice or if she did, she would have to respect that I wasn't going to cancel previous plans for her. She told me, again, that I was an awful kid and how every other parent is respected but her and the usual stuff.

I cut down visits home, she (to her credit) stopped visiting regularly. She called daily and complained that I had nothing new to talk about. We have not been close beyond like, age 9. I have never discussed my life with her and when I tried to in light ways, she would always pressure me. If I felt I wanted to switch courses, she would start listing everything bad about it and tell me how I'm wasting my potential and how I shouldn't have taken that course int the first place. That kind of stuff. I just didn't tell her about boys or drinking. Why open that can of worms.

I went home for the summer and worked 3 jobs and was out of the house daily from 7 AM until about 9-10 PM. We barely interacted. When I went out, I just told her I was going out to food with a brilliant girl and one of the few friends of mine she knew about. This year, I got a boyfriend and mentioned that. I also started coming home more often to visit him. At one point, I was studying for exams. For the record, I have had trouble with self-harm and an admittedly awful self-image (and no diagnosis but 2 mental health professionals telling me that I needed to be evaluated for bipolar asap but I refused so). She never knew. I started crying and opened up to her about feeling lethargic and wanting to drop out of school. She told me I just stressed myself out too much about my marks. Sigh. I tell her about 5 years of struggling and she just tells me I'm stressed about my upcoming exam. You're right, the past 5 years have all been leading up to this exam. 

 This summer, I went back to my hometown again and was excited to get a competitive albeit far from home and low paying job. It's a great opportunity in my field (it's also pretty uncommon to be paid at all at my level and all universities/hospitals are ~1 hr commute away so nothing is close to home). My family criticized everything, from the fact that it took me 3 weeks after coming home to find work last year, to the wages, to the location, to my actual job duties (I do data analysis and code software for my lab. Apparently EVERYONE is in coding nowadays ANYWAY), to my apparent inability to find a better job. I'm out of the house less but still ~730 until 730 so it's rough trying to get sleep, volunteer, study for an upcoming exam AND see my friends. I make time to see my family ~1x a week but they NEVER plan ahead and my mother always expects that I'll drop my pre-existing plans on a whim to go to their plans. I try to oblige 1x weekly as I said but it's rough. We also have a language barrier (immigrant family, I'm the only one who really lost the language so I understand it but have trouble communicating beyond the level that I was when I left our country so it's hard to talk about anything really). They ALWAYS guilt trip me when I go about how I never go to see them and never talk about anything and don't love them which makes it even harder to actually enjoy the interaction and then cut off other pre-planned events to go to some sporadic thing. 

Naturally I can't move out because that would be irresponsible and they would never let me and it would become all about how much I hate them and don't want to be a part of the family enough to spend thousands of dollars. Everything I do isn't good enough because I'm always being compared to some kid on facebook who's better, more loving, more respectful, more caring etc. Half of the kids they compare me to are family friends who I KNOW to drink, do drugs and honestly be involved in way more questionable activities than me so it's extra frustrating. They never look at these kids' actual lives, just what's on FB. Guess what? On FB, I'm perfect too.

Ugh. Sorry for this vent. I'm taking an internship 2 years from now and already getting pressured to look for a job in my hometown so I can be with the family. This is just super frustrating and I mean, not sure if there really is any relevant advice but I just...wanted to vent about how shitty it is to have every choice I made for myself be reframed into being because I don't care about my family and have no love in my heart. I'm a pretty mean person often but like, I'm not a complete villain with no capacity for feelings and it's sort of just at the point where this whole I-don't-love-my-family and I'm-a-shitty-daughter is just engrained into my mind and self-image. Yeah. Anyway. 

Life is rough. "

* Page 220 - Judge scolds Urick for not having a witness ready to go when CG asks for a recess after dumping the discovery tapes on her so late ""I'm trying to get this case concluded within my vacation time and the jurors' vacation time and other scheduling"" 

**Overall Impression:**

This one may have had the worst redaction job yet.

Generally the defense didn't get much traction. CG tried to say Cathy was lying to McGillivary, or McGillivary was lying about what Cathy said regarding when Jay &amp; AS showed up at her apartment. It certainly didn't read like a good line of questioning.

The State was stronger, notwithstanding Jay's direct testimony leaves several question marks. For example:

 1. Jay says AS tells him he'll loan the car to Jay on the 12th. This is contradicted by AS on Serial who seems to come up with the idea in the morning of the 1/13 after giving Stephanie a present.

 2. Jay says he went to Cathy's to wait for AS to be done with track, but the cell pings put him at his house for the calls around 5pm. For this reason it seems much more likely that he collected the shovels at this time, in my opinion.

 3. Jay says AS picks up a shovel off the porch and makes a threat to snitch on Jay for dealing. In my mind this seems contrived, while Jay picking up the shovels while waiting for the post-track call seems much more likely.

 4. Jay says he didn't want to get his grandma in trouble. The grandma story was here, in trial, and it wasn't new from the Intercept interview.

 5. Jay uses the pronoun 'him' in apparent reference to Jen. It seems possible that he is referring to Mark.

 6. Jay says AS gave Stephanie a ride to Jay who had her car, after school. 2 days after 1/13 wasn't a school day - it must have been 1/19 or later.

CG pulled the plug on Jay's cross and Urick didn't have another witness lined up. CG was going to listen to recordings that were provided to her that day apparently, overnight, to prepare for cross examination of Jay.

The judge cracked wise a few times, asking CG to hurry so they'd finish this millennium, and an alternate juror asks if she can help the defense, which I read as a joke.

Let me know if there's anything else that you found interesting or funny, along with a page number. Thanks!

I'm going to be a junior in college this year. I'm 21F, 5'5"", 170lbs. In high school I hovered around 150 felt fat at anything above 155... Ugh what I wouldn't give for that body right now. 

I decided I wanted to lose weight. My ultimate goal is 125. I was going away for three months for an internship so I figured why not, I'll be able to watch my calories like a hawk since I'll be cooking for myself and develop good habits in the process. For the first three weeks I was good. Stayed at 1300 kcal a day. 

Enter my roommate. She is the other intern who started 3 weeks after me. Very sweet and wonderful girl, we're going to get along great. Except for the food thing... She barely weighs 110lbs. She can eat anything she wants because she's one of those people who has had issues gaining weight her whole life. 

She LOVES to cook. She makes me dinner every night that puts me over my kcal limit. She filled the kitchen with ice cream, chips, and other things that are ""totally ours to share!"" 

I don't know how to handle this. Her kindness and hospitality is derailing me! How do I deal with this situation? "
4lnbcb,23,2016-05-29,"Me [23F] with my boyfriend [33M] of 1.5 years, romantic part of the relationship is dead, we're best friends, but I support him financially and can't break it off/fix it",marionberry_pie,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lnbcb/me_23f_with_my_boyfriend_33m_of_15_years_romantic/,"**Background Info:** I met my boyfriend at university where he was finishing his PhD and I was finishing my BSci. We dated for about 6 months, and then I accepted an offer to go to grad school 1,000  miles away and we were both cool with it. I was anticipating us breaking up during my Masters because LDRs are difficult and we had not been together very long. We were also good friends before dating, and  he is friends with nearly all of his ex girlfriends, which led me to believe that we will also remain friends if we broke up.
     Once he got his PhD (~1.5 years ago), he continued to teach about 3 classes per semester at the school, and stretched his pay out so he could get paid over the summer even if he wasn't able to pick up more classes. Last summer, he was not working, I was at an internship a few states away, and he was planning on continuing to teach when the fall semester started. The department hired a new department chair who then cleaned house and got rid of all the adjuncts (including my boyfriend). He was told by another professor that he could get about 2 classes if he really wanted to stay, but he turned it down and decided to move with me across the country. I was planning on moving alone, mind you, and I had already put a deposit on a one-bedroom apartment and was told 2-weeks before moving that he was coming with me. This was a shock, but I love him, we have fun together, he's smart and I was confident he would get a job. He didn't really start applying for jobs until I forced him to this January. So for the last 10 months I've been paying all his bills plus mine off my graduate assistantship salary. He just got  part-time job, and these money issues started some issues with us. He still does not pay his bills, so I asked him for $100/paycheck so it will cover at least a part of his bills and he agreed.

The main issue is that since we moved here, I feel like the bank and he feels like the maid. He cooks and cleans and it's been wonderful for me to not have to worry about these things during the week, but I really need him to get real job and start paying his bills. We don't really kiss or have sex anymore. We have talked about it, tried to improve and will have sex for maybe 4 days or so before stopping completely again. My sex drive is basically gone now, and I think he feels neglected. My main problem here is that I love him, but I don't think our romantic relationship is going anywhere. People in our new city meet us and think one of us is gay, or that we're siblings, or just friends. Our mutual friends in our old city think we're going to get married. The situation is getting tougher because his parents are coming to visit for a week in July, and I don't think I can attempt to explain how I feel until after that visit so I don't mess the whole thing up.

I was hoping that he would get hired this spring for a teaching job that starts in the fall, and then he'd be moving which would solve the problem (kind of?). My boyfriend can't afford to live on his own right now. His friends that would take him in all live in our old city, 1,000 miles away. Our friendship is awesome. We love the same foods, love traveling, love going to any and all music events, festivals, we like gardening (especially anything that grows food!), and so on. He's definitely my best friend and I'm very concerned about losing that, along with the friendships of our mutual friends who are convinced he's going to propose to me when I graduate with my Masters. 

This isn't a bad relationship, and it's an awesome friendship, but I don't know what I should/can do about our problems. I know that he feels we have turned into friends, but I don't know if he has given up to the extent that I have, and he rarely shares his feeling with me when I try to have serious talks with him. When I bring up issues, he tries to fix anything I complain about but does not tell me how he feels or what I could do to help (even after prompting). I have tried to talk to him about this many times but it never goes anywhere. This is also his longest relationship to date, if that matters, so I think he is very invested in it. We also have talked about about the future, which makes this even more difficult. We have talked about our dream jobs, our dream place to live, where we want to retire, if we want kids or not and how many, how we would discipline a child if we had one, what kind of house we want to live in, what types of plants we'd have in our garden, my dream car and how we'd trick it out, and we agree on everything I just mentioned. It would be the ""perfect"" relationship if we were both asexual (and had jobs).


Do I break it off now and continue to live in the same 1-bedroom apartment with him? Do I wait until after his parents visit and leave? Do I wait til he gets a job far away (if that even happens)? Do I wait a year, let him propose and THEN turn him down? Do I try to talk to him again and hope he finally tells me how he feels? Even if we decide the relationship is over, I'll still be supporting him financially for an unknown amount of time. Should we try to work it out again since we're such good friends? If we try to work it out, how do I get him to tell me his real feelings during this conversation? I have had little to no luck in the past.
I'll take any suggestions I can get at this point.



   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend feels like the maid, I feel like the bank and support him financially (for the last 10 months) on my grad assistant salary while he starts looking for jobs in his field. Romantically, our relationship is dead, but we're best friends and enjoy all the same activities. I'm thinking about breaking it off, but we're 1,000 miles away from friends that would be able to take him in if we split up and I don't know what my next move should be since I'll still end up supporting him financially until he gets a job (who knows when that will be)."
4lngkm,2,2016-05-29,[Event] Prime Minister approves the Whipsnake Plan,HanbaobaoZaiNar,Geosim,https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/4lngkm/event_prime_minister_approves_the_whipsnake_plan/,"The Prime Minister sat around a table with his cabinet. He rubbed the bridge of his nose with his fingers, the weight of the last few months and the escalating Transnistrian crisis was heavy on his mind.

&gt;""The Moldovan people didn't elect me to fight a war. They don't want a repeat of 1992. They elected me for reform, for a change. 

&gt;""And that's what you've given them, sir, but this conflict has been thrust on us. We didn't start this and the people understand that. The most recent poll has 78% approving of the government's actions so far on Transnistria.""

&gt;""That doesn't mean they approve of boots on the ground and their sons and daughters dying trying to take some damned strip of land across the river. Damn those Transnistrians. We were finally making progress. We had shook out the cobwebs of corruption. We retooled the economy. We even gained acceptance to the EU. And just as we were finally ready to pull ourselves out of our position as the poor man of Europe they go and light this powderkeg.""

&gt;""You know its not just them though sir. They succumbed to the whispers of Russia in their ear and the money and guns passed into their hands. The government and rebels don't make up a majority of the Transnistrian people. Moldovans, Ukrainians, hell, even some of the Russians [m] ethnic Russians, not the nation, couldn't figure out a way to say it [m] have to realize that. If they just took action, threw out that corrupt shamble of a government, pulled Russia's hands out of their pocket, just made their own decisions instead of immediately looking toward Russia for a decision then we could work together to solve this. Bloodshed is just going to drag this country back from decades of progress.

There was a silence around the table. The Minister of Internal Affairs was right, at least technically. Russians weren't a majority of Transnistria. They weren't even the largest nationality. It was just that the government and armed rebels controlled the power and the decisions. 

&gt;""So how do we strike at the ""government"" and the rebels without turning the more than 2/3 of Transnistria that isn't Russian against us? Who has a plan?""

Natalia, the Minister of Foreign Affairs passed a stack of papers across the table.

&gt;""Anatol and I have been preparing this. We call it the Whipsnake Plan.""

The Prime Minister raised an intrigued eyebrow, but continued thumbing through the packet while Natalia continued explaining.

&gt;""With out newly enrolled soldiers and with any cooperation we can secure from Ukraine or any of the Europeans, we effectively sanction and blockade Transnistria from outside supplies. We focus on military equipment, but all supplies that could be used by the rebels in armed revolt can be easily stopped before entering the region. Fuel, natural gas, metals, food, we can increase the severity the more that is needed. This effectively isolates the rebels from support by Russia or the Odessan rebels. With no shared border, Russia either needs to fly supplies into Chiasnau and go through Moldova, which we would never let happen, or try to smuggle equipment across the Ukrainian border, which we would now more effectively stop with this plan. From there, we can either wait until the rebel's supplies dwindle. Then the Transnistrian people, those that don't approve of Russian rule or who start to feel the pinch of life under sanction can take action against the government and rebels with our support or we can launch direct action against the weakened rebels.""

&gt;""And if the Odessans or the Russians try to support the Transnistrians? They could smuggle supplies or launch a straight out attack on the border?""

&gt;""Russia couldn't logistically reach Transnistria, though the border control will need to be on guard for their agents. The Odessans have enough of their own problems to worry about first though our border forces would be strengthened along the Odessan-Transnistrian frontier just in case anything happens or either party gets desperate.""

&gt;""And how do we know this blockade will hit the government and rebels and not the common people?""

&gt;""... we don't. But it's the only option we have that doesn't involve marching soldiers across the river bridges directly into the Transnistrian's waiting guns.""

The Prime Minister leaned back in his chair, eyes closed, deep in thought. Anatolie the Intern burst into the room, sweating and out of breath!

&gt;""Sir! It's happening! I did it!""

The Prime Minister snapped forward in his chair. Eyes wide open and alert.

&gt;""What's happened!?!""

&gt;""Well I've been trying to push hard to start a trending hashtag about what Moldova's given the music world. You know, show the world that we've given them more than they think. That everyone loves Moldova. Get support and all that. And I did it! #MoldovanMusicMeme and #GoMoldova are trending! All the old stuff is trending all over the internet. Everything from [Numa Numa guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmtzQCSh6xk) to [Epic Sax Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy1B3agGNxw). It's trending globally. The US, Europe, I think even in Australia and Japan! We've got support. At least on Twitter! We're number 2 topic right after some foreign leader's missing cat!""

The table looked silently at Anatolie. The silence was palpable, long, and awkward. Like excruciating long. Think of the most awkward moment you've had and it was at least 5x longer than that. Probably. Finally the Prime Minister broke the silence.

&gt;""I don't know what any of that means but ok. Good job...""

&gt;""It's Anatolie! And thank you sir!""

Anatolie shouted as he hurried out of the door, typing away on his phone.

&gt;""How did he get this job again? Is he related to someone?""

&gt;""No, he won a government contest for the internship. Kid actually gave one of the best speeches I've ever seen on the need to change the world's view of Moldova. Wish I'd known how he planned to do it.""

Nods around the table agreed with the Minister of Youth.

&gt;""I don't know, I see a future for him...but anyway. Where were we? Right. The Whipsnake Plan. If its the only option we have that won't immediately lead to war then its our best option. I approve it in its entirety. Roll it out. Starve out the flame and the fire will die. Then we can start rebuilding this nation.""

[m] tl;dr Moldova enacts a plan to blockade Transnistria and stop the flow of supplies in an effort to starve out the rebels before coming to blows. Also the world loves Moldovan musical memes on twitter."
4lnjtt,4,2016-05-29,"My [19F] ex boyfriend [18M] of 4.5 months, broke up with me after he cheated, I'm still struggling with processing this.",erinmariexxx,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lnjtt/my_19f_ex_boyfriend_18m_of_45_months_broke_up/,"So to fully get across what happened, the whole background needs to be expressed, and it is important for me to stress that there are a lot of things I am not, but I am and always have been an extremely rational and clear headed person.  ** DISCLAIMER ** FAKE NAMES HAVE BEEN USED FOR THE SAKE OF CLARITY

I went off to college 600 miles from home this past August with no relationship experience at all, and at first didn't really seek out a relationship, but partied and just kind of explored my options and enjoyed being single.  Fast forward to Halloween/early November, and I met a guy (we'll call him Jack) through mutual friends and we pretty quickly started dating.  

Throughout the relationship, I kind of had issues with us struggling to really know how to appropriately pace our relationship and like what was and wasn't normal for the early stage that we were in, but we had fairly regular sleepovers, I tried to spend a little time with him every day (which he seemed to be annoyed by) because we lived in the same building, and I would still maintain a lot of independence and go out to parties and clubs without him (that he knew about) because he wasn't as serious about school as I was and I encouraged him to stay in and do his work so that he wasn't failing anything.  I eventually just chalked up our inexperience to be the reason we struggled with boundaries and pacing ourselves.

He generally was a lot more immature than I was, people were constantly questioning his sexuality to me (he said he was straight, but I had my own doubts that I didn't bring up in detail to him at risk of bringing up something he was clearly uncomfortable dealing with himself) and people were very quick to mention to me what an asshole he was because he was very in his own head all the time.  

Basically, no matter what I would say or do or what anyone showed him or told him to prove him wrong in something, it didn't matter to him and he thought he was right.  This was quite a big issue in hindsight, and we would have arguments (I tend to be fairly non-confrontational unless I am arguing for something I have facts and proof to support it and I will not continue an argument for the sake of argument) and he would eventually give up and tell me that I was probably right, but he would never follow through on that.  For example, if I told him I really felt like it was a burden to him that I wanted to at the very least see him to say goodnight for a few minutes if I hadn't seen him all day and he told me that I was probably right, but then still acted that way.  I explained to him that I didn't care whether he thought I was right, because, if I'm arguing with him, I know I'm right and don't need his validation, what I needed was for him to fix the problem.

This was a constant source of tension in our relationship, because I do not like to allow problems to sit and become worse, and would much rather face them when they're small to avoid them sitting.  My ex boyfriend was fully aware of this, but continued to pretend to have listened to me, and then ignoring what I said.

Through my boyfriend, I became close with a lot of the brothers in the fraternity he had planned to rush in the spring semester when freshmen are allowed to rush, but then he didn't have a high enough GPA so that was put off until this coming fall.  I developed relationships with them that were outside of my boyfriend's relationship with them and would hang out with a lot of them separately and I would be invited to brothers only events along with a few other girls who were friends with or girlfriends of brothers that my boyfriend was not invited to.  One of these guys was my boyfriend's best friend (we'll call him Dylan), who was the vice president of the fraternity, and another two (we'll call them Steve and Paul) were close with brothers of the coed professional fraternity I ended up rushing, so we were close as well.

So, come the beginning of the semester, my boyfriend started spending a lot of time with a friend (we'll call him Joe) from his classes that happened to be his best friend, Dylan (who is gay)'s boyfriend.  This would normally not be odd, but he would make an effort to spend at least an hour or so every single day with Joe come late February/early March, yet it was a battle for him to come spend 15 minutes with me or for me to be able to grab dinner or something with him every day.  In my head, I determined that I was being crazy for being bothered by this, and didn't bring it up.  Eventually, it was getting on my nerves so I expressed how I felt and when I asked Jack why he always spent so much time with Joe but didn't seem to want to spend time with me, Jack said Joe was dealing with something he was struggling with, and I just told him that he needed to bring it up with someone else that wasn't Dylan or Jack because clearly this was some serious problem that was burdening everyone else.  I think at this time, I knew in my head what was happening, but I was in denial.

Now, come the beginning of March still, and my parents were coming to pick me up to drive me home for spring break because there were issues with my flight.  Jack had been really weird about his parents because he resented them for being on his case all the time (he needed it, he barely passed high school and it's a mystery to all how he got into such a selective university) and never talked about them and barely talked to them.  I asked if he felt comfortable meeting my parents, even only after 4 months, and told him I didn't expect him to, and he was more than welcome to decline.  He acted very comfortable with it, and met my parents over breakfast, but I did get a weird vibe about the whole thing because it was generally pretty awkward.  I thought nothing of it.

That night, we went to hang out with his Dylan (with whom I had/have become close to as well) and Dylan's boyfriend Joe was going to Cuba and was supposed to call Dylan to say he had landed at his layover in Texas safely.  Joe was texting with Jack the whole time before he called Dylan and Dylan and I were jokingly like ""well I guess we're dating now and they're dating"" and cuddled up on the couch to keep eating snacks and watching TV, and Jack kind of laughed it off and was like ""I'm okay with that"" and which seemed a little strange.

Now, a week later I came back to school from spring break, and Jack and I went shopping for warm weather clothes, and he posted candids of me that I didn't even know he planned on posting, so I figured any doubts I was having were crazy and not based on anything true.  He spent some time every day in my room that week crying but he wouldn't talk to me about whatever was wrong, despite me asking him gently and patiently sitting with him to comfort him and be there for him.  He had never cried in front of me, so I really thought it meant that he was more comfortable with me and trusted me more than ever.

At the end of the week, on Friday (it was my big/little week for my fraternity and I had a pledge retreat on the Saturday that was the next day and big/little reveal on Sunday), after I had gone to a concert that he was bummed about not going to, he had expressed he had something to talk to me about, and I wanted to tell him how I felt frustrated with how he was acting lately with not opening up when something was clearly wrong, so I tried to get him to talk to me on Thursday night, but he insisted on waiting until the morning.

The next morning, Jack came up to my room, walked in, and I motioned for him to sit on the bed with me and he refused, but sat down in a chair across the room from me and said ""I feel like I'm walking to my own execution."" which is definitely not something you say if you have done nothing to deserve someone to be incredibly angry with you.  He told me he was sure I'd probably seen this coming, and he was breaking up with me.  I'm a very very talkative person, and I sat in stunned silence, without moving, crying, screaming, or making a sound for a full 10 minutes, and he would not make eye contact.  

Eventually, he stood up to leave because he had said he wanted this breakup to be quick and overwith, but I told him to sit back down because he was not going to do this without making any attempt to at the very least make me aware of the issues he saw (despite me literally explicitly asking him what I was doing wrong several times in the last week alone) and without me being allowed to say my piece and get an explanation.  He sat back down and still would not look me in the eye and I tried to ask if it was me being emotionally needy, or if there was someone else, or if I just was too much for him, but he kept telling me that he just wasn't ready for a relationship and especially not a serious one, and that I was one more unnecessary stress.  I believe that I was ""unnecessary stress"" because I would discourage him from trying to do everything because my nagging was the only thing that kept him from failing his classes, he slept through a job interview and thought that it was acceptable to leave it at that, and would try to get internships he not only wasn't qualified for, but when he couldn't even keep up with what he already had on his plate.  I had suspicions in my head still about Jack and Joe, but I thought that I was being crazy.

He didn't apologize for meeting my parents when he had been talking with other people about breaking up with me for almost a month, and wouldn't admit that to me, and he never really gave me a satisfactory or logical explanation about anything and eventually I let him leave and I sobbed.  I have never ever cried so hard over a person (only ever over stress that made me physically ill), and I was full body sobbing, and called my roommate (we'll call her Hannah) and 2 best friends (we'll call them Anna and Drew) who were in class and left messages telling them I needed them when they got out of class.

My roommate and best friends came back and when I told them what had just happened they were surprised but mostly just incredibly furious because they had never seen me hurting the way I did then.  Anna and Drew then asked if I had noticed anything strange about the way Jack interacted with Joe (I had never expressed these concerns to those friends) and instantly felt validated in my concerns and realized I was not being irrational or crazy at all.  A few of Jack's now former friends and would-be fraternity brothers (Steve, Paul, and another brother we'll call Connor) reached out to me and expressed how sorry they were for what he did to me, and subtly tried to see if I already knew that Jack had cheated with Joe, which I had kind of deduced at that point.  Those boys were so incredibly sweet and supportive to me, a few that I was close to took me out on platonic dates because they felt I deserved it and several told me nothing but how great they thought I was and how much they had always preferred my company to my boyfriend's and had been surprised he was with someone ""so out of his league"".

At that point, I reached out to Jack (this was a few days later) under the guise of wanting to have a friendly conversation to get some closure because of being dumped out of the blue.  He kept refusing because he would be ""hurt"" if we revisited the conversation like I had asked when he broke up with me.  I eventually enlisted help from someone and cornered him publicly but where we could still talk so that he felt less threatened.  At that point, I told him I had had doubts for a while, but I needed him to straight up tell me if his sexuality had anything at all to do with him breaking up with me, and he reluctantly admitted that it did.  Then, knowing the answer to the question, I asked if there was someone else, and he told me he had a date soon but it was not initiated or even an idea until after we broke up (bullshit, clearly).  I asked if he was sure there was nothing at all going on, even in his head, before we broke up, and he again lied and said no.  I calmly left, him thinking I was at peace.

Another few days later, he reached out to me to talk.  It was fairly clear it was to admit what he did to my face, but I had suspicions that someone had clued him into how crushed and heartbroken I was and had pushed him to do it.  I told him I would meet with him to talk briefly, but I would not meet with him if the only reason that he wanted to talk was because someone else told him to, and not because it was the right thing.  I knew he had admitted to his former best friend Dylan's face what the he had done with Joe, but that was only in hopes of salvaging his basically promised bid to that fraternity, which has since been taken off the table, along with any involvement in Greek life.  He then said he didn't want to talk anymore.

Jack is also still with Joe, and insists that it's true love and he is so crushed because all of his friends and acquaintances and former floormates have abandoned his sorry ass for being such a terrible person.  This is the only thing that keeps me from doing something stupid and petty, because it is satisfaction enough to watch him suffer the consequences and ruining his life all on his own, which makes him feel abandoned and like he has nowhere to turn, because no one will talk to him after they give him a chance to explain himself.

In hindsight, wow he is/was a piece of shit the whole relationship, but only on a small scale at first.  It didn't seem like much, but I was just blinded by being in a relationship, and ignored all of the people complaining about what an ignorant asshole he was.  I've since moved on and I am in a much healthier, happy, and committed relationship.  But now, my new relationship is going on 2 months, and 1 month has been long distance, so I find myself with time to sit and think about all that's happened because I never got true closure or an apology, or at least admission of guilt.  Reddit, how can I cope with this and process this besides the long days of crying and sobbing and a few nights of hard partying to get the situation off of my mind?

   
*** TL;DR *** : My ex boyfriend is a less than human piece of shit that cheated on my with his best friend's boyfriend, and I am still struggling to process this 2.5 months later even though I'm in a new and better relationship.  How can I get through this?"

**Physical appearance:** Gregory Bradley is rather tall young man.  His hair is his pride and joy, taking the time to turn it into outrageous and memorable styles.  Eye catching is his goal, as the next time someone sees him, they usually forget how they know him.  His clothing style is dark and impressive, long coats and suits being the main parts of his style.  He’s not exactly the strongest, compared to war kids, but he’s done strength training and body conditioning through school.  Weight training doesn’t require people to necessarily know who you are, unlike a lot of clubs.

**Mentality:** He’s of two minds most of the time.  When people notice him, he wishes he could be noticed for his own qualities rather than what people project onto him.  When he’s being ignored, he just wishes that he would have some attention paid to him.  It’s a rather vicious cycle.  Fame is fickle, friends.


**Backstory:** Gregory was born to Pheme and Michael Bradley in Chicago, Illinois.  At the time, Michael was an evening news anchor with a wife and two daughters, and had a solid following.  Pheme came to him as a young intern, and the two had a passionate affair.  Of course, such a fraternization is frowned upon, and this dalliance cost Michael his job.  Nine months later, Gregory was delivered to his father in a gilded cradle.  A note attached to the baby furniture simply read.

&gt; Your fortune is dependent on how you treat our son.  The better you care for him, the more my blessings will fall upon you, my dear heart.

And so Michael raised Gregory with a passion. His wife left him shortly after finding out about the affair, so he had split custody of his daughters as well.  With the advances in technology as Gregory grew, Michael found himself with a second chance, the ability to  recover his fame through the internet.  You may recognize him from a daily news series known as Mik’s Minute.  It took off remarkably well, and he’s become something of an internet sensation, dabbling in all fields digital.  He’s booked on lecturing tours and was most recently master of ceremonies at the CCT, Chicago Convention of Technology.  He brought his son and daughters to enjoy the experience, which is where Gregory gets pulled into his new life.  A band of empousai groupies were searching for him, trying to find the tantalizing morsel that proved to be an attractive bite.

Ironically, when monsters came for Gregory, they actually couldn’t locate him.  A crowded convention hall filled with more than one demigod created bedlam, to say the least.  His scent was everywhere, but he just blended in and no one was able to give the Empousai any information about his appearance.   Luckily, his satyr Glen was smarter than the monsters and managed to get him out of the convention hall before a confrontation proved imminent.  A limo driver, thinking him to be one of the vloggers at the convention, drove them away.  Glen easily got them moving to Camp, which is where we’ll rejoin our hero.

**Powers and drawbacks:**

* **I know you...** Gregory often carries many qualities that people find familiar in acquaintances.  Whether good or ill is up to him, but in a neutral setting, it usually turns into a mix of both.  As such, it is difficult to find where his personality begins and his power ends.

* **”The Perks of Being a Wallflower”** The other side of Pheme, Gregory can appear wholly unremarkable and unfamiliar, to the point where even people who have made his close acquaintance have difficulty remembering that they’ve actually met him.  This makes it a challenge for him to build lasting friends, although he does get to constantly make new ones, which is fun.  In a sad way.



**Skills:**

* Running-  Gregory practiced long distance running in school, and wasn’t too terrible at it.  His endurance is pretty darn fantastic for a non-war kid.

* Technical Work-  He learned a lot from his sister Holly regarding technical theater work.  As such, he’s good at wiring lights and sound equipment, as well as costume and makeup design.

* Finding his Light- Gregory knows how to make himself look good, and, when not a wallflower, is quite capable of being a suave, confident young man.  Too bad very few people actually acknowledge it as one of his own qualities.  Shame, really.

* Trumpets!  Gregory, taking after his mother, has a fair hand with horns in general.  He's not as good as an Apollo kid, by any means.  He does alright, though.

***

*The limo pulls up to the border of camp, Glen and Gregory hopping out of the vehicle.  Glen runs to the Big House to let them know of the new arrival, while Gregory walks slowly through camp.  His golden eyes are hidden behind azure contacts, and he's running a hand through his hair, managing to keep his nerves calm for now.  All in all, he's trying to be himself… Whoever that really is.  His power is active currently, making it so those who come across him see qualities from individuals they know.*

-I have no one to hang out with and I spend hours each day alone. It mentally unnerves me and it makes me feel like I can't connect with people anymore. There's people that like me but no one is ever around to hang out, nor does anyone text me normally.
-I just moved out of my apartment today and am living at home. I have two severely disabled siblings and not even a room to myself (I share with my severely autistic brother). I have no room at all to store my possessions outside of a cramped attic or basement (My house had to be raised after it got wrecked during Sandy.) My clothes don't even fit in my room. Neither of my siblings can be left alone. My brother watches youtube videos all day and just stays in his room repeating T.V commercials to himself and my sister is the R Word (I hate when people correct me, I mean it medicinally, they should take a step in my shoes), obese, and cannot talk (She can only squeak). She watches Disney Sing Along songs all day on an Ipad. My mom screams at me and both parents shoot down every idea I've ever had (I can't go abroad because I get depressed or I have no friends nor a girlfriend, I'm r word). My mom would tell me I should get laid and never gives me a moment to breathe. She sends me horrible texts and never leaves me alone when I want to be left alone. My father says nothing. They both laughed at me when I told them I had thoughts of suicide. They're still great parents for providing for me, but my relationship with them is weak and I just want to leave forever.

The worst part is I have no privacy and I can't bring any people over (Be they an intimate or platonic nature). I can't handle my siblings anymore because my parents won't do anything with them. (My feelings on this subject I'd prefer to PM privately.)

-My hair is falling out and I am probably going to be bald. It causes me stress because I can't choose. I have no choice.
-A girl I was going to have dinner with (OKCupid) never responded to confirm out plans for Tuesday. I'm not looking forward to the possible ghosting. I took off of work and it makes me mad that she may have ignored me. (I'm not going to say anything unless she ghosts.)

-I tried to re-connect with someone from my youth. I told her about a party I was throwing for my birthday (nobody came) and got her number in order to get a chance to catch up again. She never responded to my text today just saying I was happy to see her again and she treated me coldly at work.

-I want to teach English in Europe for a year but my parents keep telling me I can't because I need to work a job as an accountant (70 hr weeks...) and get a house (IN THIS MARKET??? IN NJ???) and travel when I'm old. I want to travel now when I still have good health. I want to go back because I love Europe and I don't care about the crisis over there. I'll die happy if something happens.

-I try to talk to my parents about the financial situation of the house and of my siblings future (I'm afraid they will go to the state and I can't afford to take care of them in this economy. I want to live my own life) and I get yelled at by my mother or ignored by my father.

-I just want to burn everything I own, leave my family, school, and everything to start over. I'm tired of not being in control of my life. I'm tired of looking at my brother and sister and wondering how the future is going to be. I'm tired of never having a date in the States (I had a few dates when I went to Europe) and people treating me like shit, women have been terrible to me here. I'm tired of being depressed because I feel I can't control my life. I struggle with thoughts of being old and dying alone. I'm disappointed I can't enjoy the good things that come my way. It breaks my heart when there are people that care about me but I can't be happy knowing that. It's the loneliness that makes me crazy, I just want to have people I could call to hang out with.

Good things:
-People told me happy birthday. I'm not mad that people didn't come, alot of stuff occurred on the other end. I'm just sad.Even though the party was at 9, people still came to take me out. Despite the bar being empty and nobody was around. It sucked, but I appreciated people taking the time out of their evening to see me. Four gave me gifts and it made me feel so bad not having anything to give them. It just hurt that people wrote on my facebook wall five times they couldnt come to my get-to-gether
-Even though I don't have an internship. I work bars and make decent money.
-Even though my parents frustrate me and I admit they fail in other regards. They are there for me constantly. They stress me out (My mom's treatment of me made me anxiety filled) and it hurts that I feel I can't be close to them.
-I'm alive.

I'd prefer to PM further details in private. It goes much deeper than what I wrote. i wrote a text to a friend that is much clearer and detailed. I just don't want to be too graphic online

I'm a triplet, so all the more it hurts to watch my siblings. "

All users suddenly cannot login to our domain, including myself.  All of our remote users over the weekend started getting prompted to re-enter their email passwords through outlook.  No one can remote in either.  I'm able to get into the network via VPN, and I can ping nodes within the network., however I can't even login. ""login attempt failed"", when attempting to login over RDP.  I'm an intern, and my boss just left for a two week cruise, so this one's my rodeo.  Any ideas where to start?  Sounds like it might be an active directory thing.  I'm a bit scared that our whole DC might have been compromised though.

All help is greatly appreciated on this one.

**UPDATE**: It appears as though the box that hosts our DC VM is a dell MD3200i.  Amber light blinking on our enclosure status LED, which indicates the unit is in ""fault state"".  Currently investigating what this entails, but if anyone has any ideas please let me know.

**UPDATE 7:18AM**.  Looks like the fault state indicator on the MD3200i points towards storage array needing some love.  I'll need to connect through MDSM (Modular disk storage manager) to see specific details.  I'm sure it's not details that will lead to good news however.  

**UPDATE 8:32AM** Dell has been called and dispatched.  Wish I could've handled this one solo but admittedly it's out of my league.  Not to keen on all of the storage technologies, but I figured if something failed within our SAS 

unit (the MD3200i) then it's not going to be as easy as a simple restore from BE.  Looks like they've got a new drive coming with an engineer.  Stoked to be learning a bunch here.  Thanks for your help thus far everyone.

**UPDATE 11:40PM**
Turned out the MD3200i had a drive that was showing as failed due to some sort of firmware glitch.  The drive itself was fine.  Had to work with an engineer from Dell and kick off a script that killed and revived the drives that were getting false flagged.  From there had to hop into vSphere and boot the VM's back up.  Holy cow.  Thanks for your help everyone.  That's been my most stressful experience thus far.

4lnxpi,111,2016-05-30,[M]e and Mandy Part 1 [M25/f18],Nick_Adams29,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/4lnxpi/me_and_mandy_part_1_m25f18/,"When a friend of mine recommended an eighteen-year-old girl for one of the two rooms I was subletting, I was skeptical but he assured me she was mature. He told me she had worked with him as an intern during her last semester in high school. I needed the cash so I trusted his judgement sight unseen. How much trouble could a girl who was going to double major in philosophy and political science be.

When she moved in I remember seeing her big head of curly blonde hair and her cute made up face and thinking that she wasn’t the nerdy girl I’d expected. She acted like a prissy little princess, but lacked confidence, so she came off immature and awkward. 

The first night I had some friends over, and she came downstairs all dolled up and looking much better than she had earlier. This was mostly because she wore a low cut top that put her substantial cleavage on display. Of course my friends hung on every word as she claimed to be a brown belt in Taekwondo, a good tennis player, and a sexual dynamo who preferred older guys. She even bragged about the way she’d handled her ex-boyfriends big dick. 

My friends would have been happy to have a one-night-stand with her, but I saw trouble so I made sure to thwart them. She seemed like an emotional mess who’d end up making shit awkward or worse. 

During the ensuing weeks I’d gotten to know her better. She mostly dropped the princess act except for when my friends were around, but while we watched Wimbledon she was talking a lot of shit about her tennis game. I finally agreed to play her in the hope that I’d shut her up. When she came down wearing her fancy tennis whites, and carrying two carbon fibre rackets I figured she might be better than I’d thought. I only had a shitty old aluminum racket.

Once we started playing it seemed apparent that a part of her game plan was to distract me with her big tits, or at least that was what the result of the humid day, clingy shirt, and a bra that wasn’t up to holding her 34d’s. I still won but it was close. 

On the way back to the house she kept saying how I’d gotten lucky and that she’d beat me next time. I appreciated her competitiveness but my tall frame and long arms gave me a huge advantage over her short stacked five-foot-two body.

Once at home we watched more Wimbledon. She was still full of energy and sore about loosing so she challenged me to wrestle. I told her it wasn’t a good idea but she tried to pin me on the day bed that we used as our couch. I was on my back laughing and pushing myself up with my arm before she could count to two. She was determined, so she reached for my arm to push me down. Now I’m spread out with her big boobs pressing against me, and I start to get a boner which I’d hoped she wouldn’t notice, or if she did notice I hoped she’d be cool, but then she starts rubbing up against my hard dick with her thigh and laughing. 

She was being playful but I’m thinking its not cool. So when she relaxed a little, I flipped her over. She looked at my tented shorts and laughed, then grabbed my package. I’m pissed off now but also turned on. I grab her boobs with both hands and she says. “Tit for tat,” and starts laughing harder, but doesn’t let go of me and gives me this smirk like “Is that all you’ve got?” I remember her bragging about her ex’s big dick, so it kinda freaks me out but also makes me want to show her I can handle my business.

I pulled off her shirt and bra then pushed her onto the bed and devoured her bare sweaty breasts while she reached in my shorts. I remember smelling her arousal, and then next thing I know we’re fucking. 

Her big round tits moved with every thrust. I tried to see how much I could get them to move. Soon we worked up a rhythm so that each one was moving in a circular motion.  It was mesmerizing.

I know it was stupid. I should have resisted but those tits were amazing, and she’d been asking for it. Now that were doing it I decided to see what she could handle. I stopped and then gave her a quick short cock stab not all the way in. She grabbed me with her legs again but I pulled back and made her want the dick more. She groaned. “Come on, just fuck me.” I went in slow, then pulled back quick, stopped halfway, then eased back and pulled out so that my head was resting on her engorged cunt. I reached around for her legs, grabbed her ankles, and pulled them up while still resting at her entrance. When she tilted her hips up I rammed in hard and continued to jackhammer the fuck out of her. 

“Ow, ow, ow,” she yelped and said, “not so deep.” I let go of her legs and look down into her big blue eyes and smirked like she’d done earlier. She pouted. I should have pulled out and jizzed all over her big tits, but I slid back in and commenced the rhythmic fucking. She was a pain in the ass but her boobs were amazing. I was mentally banking the image of her jiggling breasts, there was a good chance I’d never see a better pair of juicy overstuffed funbags.  

She tensed up and grabbed the side of the mattress, her face showed a concerned look. I thrust hard and fast, she put her hand on my abs as I came.

When I pulled out I looked down. My cock and thighs were covered in our juices. I said, “I gotta clean up,” and went upstairs thinking I’d fucked up. She was seven  years younger than me, my tenant, and not someone I wanted a relationship with. This would be a disaster."

The last thing I'd do is ask you guys to read my previous posts. However, a lot of them revolve around my struggle to find a job after college.

I finished a four year degree (in five years) last spring. I'm currently doing an internship and applying for jobs on the side. Once the internship is over, I'm going to start taking the job hunt more seriously, not that I haven't been doing so already. 

Long story short, I finished a political science degree and immediately followed it with an internship with a non-profit which works with the local judiciary to help advocate for abused/neglected children. I don't want to necessary remain in this field for my career, but I'd love to work for the government. Public administration, human resources and non-profit work in general interest me.

I'm mainly posting here for some motivation. I'm very motivated and persistent in finding a new job. I work in retail 30 hours a week right now and I have no chance in moving up at my job. Trust me, I've tried. I've interviewed for a few other jobs with little success.

I've been out of college for only a few months and I feel defeated. Determined, but defeated. My girlfriend, who has been out of college for a year, can't find a job either. She told me that the first year out of school is very hard. I'm trying hard to remain optimistic, but every bad interview and rejection letter breaks my heart a little more...

I'm just looking for some success stories, maybe even some advice and motivation. Some words confirming that my five years weren't spent in vain. After all, I've been out of school for a few months. A job isn't going to fall into my lap. I'm doing everything that I should be, basically just waiting for my big break.

I plan on getting a master's degree, but not until I can support myself. Does anyone have anything good to share? "
4lo4x0,8,2016-05-30,"Should I Become An Elementary or Middle/High School Teacher? - Young Male, Hispanic, Urban District",juuansolo,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4lo4x0/should_i_become_an_elementary_or_middlehigh/,"Hello everyone! So I want to become a teacher, well ... I am highly considering becoming a teacher. 

I have been subbing in a large district in Southern California for around 8 months now (so I have first-hand experience in a classroom). They make us choose between K-5 and 6-12th grade. So, I chose K-5 because I heard too many horror stories about working with students in 6-12th grade. 

Now, I have chance to enter a intern program where I can start teaching right away but as I reflect on these last 8 months I am wondering about the differences between each type of school. 

I enjoy teaching elementary school kids because they are nice, funny, and more ""manageable"" than older kids. I feel like teaching elementary school kids would work well with my personality because I am quiet, relaxed and wouldn't want to deal with teenagers who want to rebel. At the same time, I feel like I might not be the type of nurturing person that is required when being an elementary school teacher. I feel that I would be very strict and direct and I don't want to be seen as a ""mean"" teacher. Although, are elementary school teachers always ""mean""?

On the other hand, I feel like teaching middle/high school kids will better because they are more ""mature"" and I would not have to ""baby"" them as much but I am scared about classroom management. 

I have dealt with elementary school kids who have behavior issues but for the most part they were manageable. I am just afraid of dealing with students that don't care and being that one teacher whose class is out of control. 

Any advice or clearing up misconceptions would help! Thanks!"

Help!,titansfan777,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4lox90/recent_bba_in_marketing_gradcannot_find_entry/,"I just graduated from UT San Antonio with a marketing degree with a 4.0 in the major, and a 3.53 overall GPA. I went to another school for 2 years (spring 2010 - spring 2012) before dropping out since I had no clue what I wanted to do, and moving to Texas to start back up at UTSA after a year break. After the year break, I attended UTSA from fall '13 until this past May.

I took classes during my two summers at UTSA to essentially squeeze a 4 year degree into less than 3 years (I was determined to graduate as fast as possible, and they didn't accept many of my transfer credits), so I had no time really for internships because of this.

Now, here I am, after applying to almost one hundred companies and I cannot find a single respectable marketing job (marketing analyst, marketing assistant etc). They all require experience directly in the field of at least 2-3 years, and the only ones that will take me are $10-$12 marketing/sales positions at obscure/door to door marketing companies. I have 5.5 years of customer service/sales experience, but without any internships directly in the field of marketing, I feel like I have royally fucked myself. I look at my school's career center website and the job postings there, but they are all direct marketing door to door stuff, or positions at places like Target/Wal-Mart as a cashier - really.

I have 5 months until my 35k student loans kick in and I am looking for something that will allow me to pay them off over the next few years while still having money left over for all of life's other expenses. After doing some number crunching, I need roughly $40k/year, but I cannot find anything even close to that. 

What can I do? My resume is decent, I send cover letters with every application, and I can't seem to find anything. I am trying not to be discouraged, but the rejections are starting to eat away at me."

4lozi9,2,2016-05-30,[F4A] [Long term RP] Darcy &amp; Loki,SugarToon,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4lozi9/f4a_long_term_rp_darcy_loki/,"I got some really good responses the the Darcy/Loki pairing this was one of the prompts I ended up writing from the responses. I thought I'd try my luck again.

---
---

Darcy Lewis was all dressed up and had no place to go. Her plans for the evening had rather abruptly changed and she found herself doing something a little impulsive, most certainly dangerous, and one hundred percent likely to get her in trouble by the next day. The brunette had clipped the little plastic badge over her coat so that she wouldn’t be stopped on the way in. With the purpose of a woman who knew exactly what she was doing she walked through the ritzy building to a very monitored, private lift. It was the only elevator in the building that stopped on the level she wanted. Her long black coat covered the dress she wore, but her dark hair was pulled up, her makeup was on point, and she’d been able to snag the last tube of her favorite red lipstick.

*If this is the end of the world, 
Let me die. 
You call me your fallen angel, 
With the devil in your eye.*

Once inside the lift she let out a soft sigh. It was hard to believe what could be accomplished when she put on her bitch face and moved with purpose. The music still played through her ear-buds as she snapped off her ID and swiped it through the subtly hidden card reader. The silver doors shut and she felt the floor ascend towards her destination. There weren’t too many things that made her rethink something once she’d jumped at the idea, but as the door dinged and opened she felt her heart flutter a little at the bizarre decision she had made. The things she did to entertain herself. The things she did to get a rise out of Jane.

*Your body speaks to mine. 
Both wicked and divine. 
In me I feel a flame ignite, 
Cause I was born to love you.*

The song was too loud, which was exactly how she liked to listen to it. Elodie Adams was a new favorite and now that she was S.H.I.E.L.D.’s unpaid intern she was fairly sure they wouldn’t confiscate her iPhone with all her music again. Her heels clicked on the marble floor as she made her way down the hallway that was just as nondescript as the public areas of the building had been.

*I feel it now, 
And you were born to save me from myself. 
I'll pay for what I've done. 
For now the night has just begun-*

The brunette stopped the music by just pulling her headphones out and stowing them and her phone away in her pocket. She’d noticed the camera in the hall, but she’d expected no less so she didn’t make a big deal about walking past it. When Darcy did get to the door she paused. It wasn’t hesitation. It was another bubble of something she was having trouble putting her finger on. Excitement? Mischief? It reminded her of sneaking out on prom night and breaking into the main office so that her and a some fellow AV nerds could take over the PA system and Rick Roll everyone.

Visiting Loki was likely to get her in a lot more trouble than that had; although she was relatively sure it wouldn’t end up with her in handcuffs. Not that it would be the first time. Darcy was just about to knock, ID still in hand, when the door made a quiet beep and the lock clicked out.

“Huh. That’s totally not weird or anything...” The sarcastic words slid from her smirking lips as her eyebrows furled up in mild confusion. This was almost too easy.

Now that the door was open it was like Alice in Wonderland. She found herself stepping through the entryway with more grace than the fictional blonde’s tumble into Underland. “Knock knock?” Her ID went back into her pocket and she waited by the door. From what she could see this place was huge. Maybe S.H.I.E.L.D. though Loki would be appeased with a swanky apartment. She was a born and raised New Yorker and unless Stark decided to adopt her she’d never be able to afford a place like this. “Any Asgardian royalty about or am I talking to myself here?”

After the door was shut she leaned patiently against the wall. The door might have opened for her, and there were certainly times when she took liberties with things like trespassing, but it never occurred to her to do anything more than wait for him to acknowledge her presence before she entered someone’s home.

Especially when it was the home of an extremely dangerous war criminal. But since Thor has distracted Jane and it was still Darcy's birthday she decided she was going to do as she pleased and at the moment it pleased her to go to the one place that would freak everyone, and especially Jane, out enough to pay attention to the little Poli-Sci major who got sucked into a world of science and magic and Norse freaking gods.

---
---

In this set up Darcy was supposed to be celebrating her birthday with Jane, but Jane was rather wrapped up with Thor (literally) so Darcy decided to find a little mischief of her own for the evening. Loki is in Midgard to atone in much the same way Thor was first to in the first movie. S.H.I.E.L.D. has mostly been keeping him pent up in a gilded cage rather than have trust that he'll help them.

4lpoaf,4,2016-05-30,Delaying Graduation For Semester Abroad (See Inside),pto904,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4lpoaf/delaying_graduation_for_semester_abroad_see_inside/,"Hi everyone, thanks for taking the time out to read this.

&amp;nbsp;

Just a quick question about taking an exchange semester, and the pros/cons of doing so. I’m on route to graduate with a 4 year CS degree in April 2017. I will have one 8 month Software Dev internship with the largest ERP company under my belt (currently ongoing), and I’ll be starting a part time internship with my university in September as a full stack web developer.

&amp;nbsp;

My question to you guys would be extending my graduation to December 2017 in order to take an exchange semester in the fall from Sept. 2017 - Dec. 2017.

&amp;nbsp;

My plan would be to:

&amp;nbsp;Practice &amp; bust my ass off to get another internship next summer, Big 4 or Unicorn tier

&amp;nbsp;Spend another semester abroad

&amp;nbsp;Hopefully start full time with the company I intern for next summer / Attempt to look for Software Dev jobs in Europe, which is my ultimate goal

&amp;nbsp;

With experience and continous practice, I think I’d be okay to get another internship next summer, I do consider myself highly motivated in that aspect. My overall GPA isn’t so hot as I transferred into CS from another program, but my CS grades are pretty good. I’m thankful enough to have my parents cover my tuition but I’m sure I’ll be covering my the final semester myself. Won’t be too bad though, as I’ll be paying my school’s tuition which covers tuition abroad.  Any thoughts on doing this from you guys/gals out there? 

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks for any help!"

4lpol9,108,2016-05-30,It might take you longer than a few months to get your first job. Let's talk about the success stories here.,RIPdig,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/4lpol9/it_might_take_you_longer_than_a_few_months_to_get/,"First off I just want to say this sub reddit has been an awesome asset. More often than not people here have been really kind and super helpful to me even though I am a complete stranger to them. And I love reading about people’s success stories. But I think it would be beneficial to have a discussion about the impact that some success stories might have on the people of this sub.

When I first started studying coding in  March of 2015 I found that the success stories of people landing dev jobs making 60k+ and only studying for about three to six months to be awesome and super motivating. I made it my personal goal to self-study and land an internship position in 12 months.

Before the 12 month mark it was easy to put in hours and hours of study. Seeing what other people had achieved mainly on this sub was like my jet fuel. I just kept pushing myself to learn more and bigger things. 

But then came the time for me to start applying. So I started attending meet ups, put up my resume on all of the major job sites, looked deeply at the projects that I was most proud, and made a personal website. And things started off well I got a few recruiters who were interested in talking with me and after only a few weeks of looking I had my very first phone interview for an internship at a local company. I was so stoked but also so very nervous.

The day came for the phone interview and the conversation started off great! They started talking about compensation, the duties of the position, what kind of technologies I would be working with, and the next steps in the interview process. But then, something went terribly wrong… I am not sure if they had not thoroughly read my resume before calling me but they seemed disappointed that I was not enrolled in a four year Computer Science degree program, I could hear the change in tone of their voice. So I tried to emphasize my stronger points and asked for the opportunity to be sent the coding challenge (the next step in the interview process) but I was shut down. They kept repeating the same thing “I know this is an entry level position but the learning curve will be too great for you.” What?! After a year of study I am still not ready for even an entry level position?! I felt like I had been punched in the gut. The next few days were super hard for me. I reconsidering everything, I thought about boot camps, an undergraduate CS degree, joining a master’s program, and of course even giving up.

I eventually decided to keep trying but it was not as easy as before to study the entire day. I kept applying to jobs both internships and full time gigs. (Internships often want people who are enrolled in CS degree programs and do not favor bootcamp grads nor self learners) and fulltime gigs even for entry level positions can have crazy requirements, like 2-5 years experience in specific technologies.

Another side note. If you don’t know already the interview process for dev jobs can be very different than other industries they often involve multiple stages (sometimes several) and involve taking timed tests on practical and theoretical CS ideas, math, reasoning, writing code on a white board and more. It can be a long process and even if you make it the final rounds of interviews you can still fail which can make it quite a challenge to perceiver. 

Long story short last week I got a call back from a recent interview for an internship, telling me they were happy to extend an offer. I am still a little bit in shock and I hesitate to even post this without actually signing the contract just in case something falls through. For me it took about 17 months just to get this far. I am not sure how long it will take you so don’t feel discouraged when you see people ending up with jobs after studying for just two months while you have been at it for longer.

TLDR: The coding path could be longer for you than others and many times you might feel like will want to give up. But as with many things the main thing that will determine your success is if you decide to keep going.

If you have any questions I will be happy answer them.

I recently got a summer intern-ship at a local organisation which offers free out of school activities (among many other things) mainly targeted at under-privileged kids. 

Basically, I have a lot of resources as the company is a non-profit funded by the local council as well as having about 60 youth workers on the ground who I can use to help.

I have been given free reign on the marketing, with my objectives being to increase awareness and participation from children-young adults. Whilst specifically trying to show the value of the summer activities they will be running.

I'm still thinking of ways to do this, but right now I am thinking of making the Social Network accounts more friendly for the people actually going to these camps, so I was thinking of going to session and taking photos etc, so the kids can actually see what is happening and they will be more likely to come. I was also thinking about running a targeted Facebook ads campaign at mums in the local area.

Has anyone got any tips, because right now I feel like there is a lot of routes I can go down however I'm not sure whats best.

Any advice is greatly appreciated!!

4lprez,0,2016-05-30,"I[22F] have been seeing this guy[28M] for the last two months &amp; out of the blue, he says he doesn't think he has the time to properly start a relationship with me.",apt22,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lprez/i22f_have_been_seeing_this_guy28m_for_the_last/,"Two months ago, I met this guy on Tinder and shortly after being matched we met up locally. Turns out things clicked very well between us and we had already set up the next date the following week. Since then, he and I have seen each other regularly and more recently it's become weekly due to his hectic work schedule. 

He is quite busy (a new lawyer, so you could imagine); basically works late hours and tends to do work on the weekends. In other words, he is more or less married to his job.  This part has never bothered me, I really admire someone who can commit that much to their work. 

In my mind, we were still testing the waters and getting to know one another. While we have been sleeping together since our second date; there have been no booty calls or anything of that kind. We have real dates; including walks, dinner, etc etc/ 

A few weeks ago, he mentioned to me that he was planning to apply for this internship abroad and if he were to be accepted, he would be leaving at the end of August.  He also mentioned that it was either the internship or he would be moving back home on the East Coast.  In all, regardless of the outcome; he would be leaving at some point relatively soon. 

Prior to him mentioning all of this, I was about to bring up the ""relationship discussion"" however... after the internship/moving information was brought out; I somewhat assumed that the relationship was never going to end up as long term/serious with only 3 months together. However, I got the impression that we both enjoyed seeing one another and it would probably continue casually until it was time to part ways. 

In general, he and I text daily with a small conversation or if something interesting happens. The last week or so; it's been a bit less due to him being away at a conference and then having to use the weekend to catch up on the time away from the office.  Within the last few weeks, he has cancelled often mostly due to a lot of work. I've been understanding about it; and offering to reschedule when I can tell he is swamped. Most times, I do have to confirm plans with him - just so I can arrange my days as well if he is busy. 

Yesterday night (almost midnight) I got a text out of the blue that said *""I feel really bad about this, but I am really swamped with things right now. I don't think I have time to properly start a relationship with you""* 

When I received this text, I was caught a bit blindsided. On one hand; I am confused because: 
* we never established our relationship for future development; I assumed it would remain casual/not serious as he was planning to leave shortly 

* I was developing some attachment, however I knew the relationship was not sustainable long term (see point above) 

* he and I do not move the sun and the moon to see one another; while I understand busy with work - to me, if I really wanted to spend time with someone I could and I would - it's all about time management

* our relationship has become more intimate over time; but again we never clarified what we were doing. 

* while I am not against being in a relationship with him (Ideally, I would have preferred that but he is leaving); I didn't think anything would change if we were to put a label on our relationship.

* what does he mean by ""proper relationship""? did he mean leading to a committed relationship despite him leaving? 


When I received the text, I figured it was best to have this discussion over the phone.  I texted him: *""Okay, would it be alright if we could talk over the phone about this when you have a spare moment. I'm slightly confused""*

I spent the evening thinking over what I want, which I determined is: 

* I genuinely enjoy spending time with him; I enjoy his company and it's a lot of fun. 

* I don't expect him to drop work for me; I've accepted that work is part of who he is, and well it comes with the package of seeing a guy who is career driven and busy. 

* In my mind a relationship means being emotionally vulnerable to someone; which I am have no problem with being with. Opening up to him will come with time but it's something I am willing to work at with him. 

* the only other thing that would really change if we were in a relationship would be exclusivity. 


Would anyone have any insight (if they have been in either positions) and advice on how to proceed? I'm a bit blind-sided, bummed out and confused.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated! 

**tl;dr**: I have been seeing this guy for the last two months (9-10 dates in all); and out of the blue he says he is very swamped with things right now and does not think he has time to properly start a relationship with me. Insight? "

Rasmussen has a BS in Computer Science(fully online) and WGU has the Software Development as well. Will companies put a decent amount of thought in to the type of degree or could you just say you have a software engineering degree from WGU?

I have a placement as a trainee lawyer in a firm in London upon graduation. Now, I know London is a crazy expensive place to live and work, but I'm prepared. I have my own savings from summer jobs and internships, not to mention the salary that I will be getting.

My family is rather wealthy and we own several properties in the London area. My parents have prepared a place for me. It is a large flat in central London that they want me to share with my [30M] brother. I don't mind living with my brother--he's super cool. The flat is in an amazing location, is large and spacious, is close to commuter links and major attractions, etc. It is also close (but not too close) to my childhood home and where they are living.

The problem is, I want to be independent. I've tried explaining to my parents how I want to find my own place and pay my own rent, but they won't hear of it. My father told me that he didn't want me to rent in some sketchy, unsafe area. They both think I'm crazy to even consider refusing their offer. My friends think so too. They tell me how lucky I am that my parents are willing to give me a free place to live after graduation. NOBODY wants to hear my side of things and it's really frustrating.

Even my grandparents think I'm being unreasonable. They make it sound like I'm some ungrateful brat who doesn't want to associate with his family when he's older. But that couldn't be further from the truth.

How do I explain to them my need for independence? How do I let them listen and understand how I feel? I don't want to be rude and just flat-out ignore them and go my own way, because they're still my family and I love them.

TL;DR: Parents (and basically entire family) want me to live with my brother in a place they have prepared for me. People think that I'm being ungrateful and rude for refusing it. How do I convey my feelings effectively?

I think I may have inadvertently screwed up my step 3 (S3) and will have to retake it. Here is my story.

I was originally scheduled to take S3 on 4/18-19. After a month of study I thought I was ready. I show up to the Prometric testing center bright eyed and ready to conquer this test. The staff checks me in and tells me to wait them to call me in. As I am waiting, I am hearing that another person is having difficulty with their exam not working correctly. I think to myself ""wow that really sucks"". Minutes later I find out that it is the NBME software that is malfunctioning, that I and three other people are being affected. There was an orthopedic surgeon there to renew their license, another S3 taker and a student taking their S2CK.

The office manager is on the phone with tech support trying to resolve the issue. After 2-3 hours of waiting, we get the bad news that the problem can't be fixed, that we would have to reschedule. I'm screwed, my eligibility period ends in May, and I had a European vacation planned on 4/29 and I wouldn't be back for a month. I looked online and there was no availability in my area (NYC) for the next month. Sure there might be one or two dates available, but no two dates in the same two week period. 

I am given a Prometric number to call to reschedule and an incidence number. I call and they are unable to reschedule me. Since I was scheduled to take the test that day, they couldn't do anything for me until the next day when my test was voided. I call again later that evening and am told the same thing, but that there was a testing center in Conshohocken, PA with availability that week. I email NBME about my situation and ask for an extension in case I was unsuccessful in rescheduling. 

The next day (4/19) I get up early and call Prometric, and I was so happy that they were able to schedule me for 4/20-4/21 in Conshohocken. I called NBME and asked if my requested extension would interfere with my test, I was told no, that if Prometric was able to schedule me that everything would be fine. I immediately start looking for hotel room and transportation. It's expensive so last minute, but I was able to get a hotel room and a cheap boltbus to Philly. I think this sucks, I’m kind of off my game, won't be in a familiar environment, and had to spend money I didn't really have to take the test, but at least I could get it over with.

I get to the hotel and it's nice, they even have a shuttle to take me to Prometric and pick me up. Day#1 goes well. Maybe I wouldn't score as well as I hoped, but I was confident that I was doing well enough to pass. Day#2 also goes well, multiple choice is not terribly difficult and I thought I got lucky and had a few straightforward cases on the clinical section. 

As I'm waiting for the shuttle, I receive and email from the NBME people about my extension. I glance at it, but don't read too much into it. I took the test; I don't really need an extension anymore. I'm done, I’m finally done.

A few Wednesdays go by, it's 4/18, and some of my friends who took the test around the same time get their scores. I called NBME, they just tell me that sometimes there is a delay and to keep waiting. On 4/25, my scores are still not out. I call NBME again and am told that sometimes it takes 4-6 weeks and to keep waiting.

Today, I'm starting to get pretty anxious about not having my scores yet, because it's Memorial day, probably no scores will be released this week. I go back and look at that email that I was sent from NBME about my extension and my heart drops. I see the line ""Please discard your initial Scheduling Permit because the scheduling number and CIN (Candidate Identification Number) are no longer valid.""

I immediately try calling people, but of course it's Memorial Day and people have the day off. I have been checking the NBME/FSMB website and still have the option to print out my (new) scheduling permit and it doesn't show up as having registered my test. I took my test 4/20-4/21 and receive the new scheduling permit after I leave the Prometric on 4/21. I think may have been invalidated/discarded because of this.

I am freaking out about this. I haven't studied in more than a month and I start intern year in July. I don't have time to study, and it will be difficult to schedule something during my first month in residency even if I could. Thanks for reading.

4lpzj5,12,2016-05-30,I was bullied/abused tremendously growing up and it is affecting me today,bishop556,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4lpzj5/i_was_bulliedabused_tremendously_growing_up_and/,"Hello everyone,

Before you read this, I want to preference that I'm not looking for sympathy. I just want to explain my story.


I was a sheltered kid and I had loving parents, but being sheltered caused me not to be exposed much to kids my age, so I was a little socially awkward. I was put into the gifted program at an early age which was helpful and detrimental as it stunted my social growth.


When I got to middle school, I was a friendly, but quiet kid. I met a student called Patrick and initially we hit if off well. However, he eventually began to bully me for no explainable reason. Now, before someone says I should have stood up for myself, you have to understand I never experienced something like this. So, eventually it wasn't just Patrick that was bullying me, but a multitude of people within the gifted class. I would say I was getting harassed by at least 15-20 students. They would tell me hourly how much a f*gg*t I was, how much of a waste of space I was, how no one wanted to be my friend. Two moments I remember vividly was when I asked a student if he needed help and he told me ""just because I will talk with you doesn't mean I will be your friend"" and when my science teacher joined in on the teasing. She asked, ""why I had to be so gay?"" In retrospect, I can see I was abused by my peers. During that time period, I felt so low that I thought I deserved that treatment. There were countless other instances of similar abuse, but these were two of the most prominent ones.


Now, you might ask where my parents were throughout all this. My dad was a little oblivious to this, and my mom was mourning the loss of her father. I realize now that they weren't there for me when I needed them. I was alone. The only time my parents started getting concerned was when I told my mother that I wanted to kill myself. It was a school dance. I felt so isolated and so alienated from everyone that I had a panic attack and told my mom that.


Throughout high school, I was an alienated kid trying to survive. I had some friends, but I was struggling with depression. I eventually started using drugs, but got out of that before it caused huge harm like it did for my friends. I never was addicted. In the present day, I'm doing better. My life has become much better and I am doing well for myself. I'm a 3.9+ student at my university in physics and have had two internships.


I guess the reason why I am writing this is because I am realizing a lot of my behavior is based on past trauma. All my girlfriends have been damaged in some way. I was always the caretaker in the relationship. I am a very friendly person and you wouldn't be able to tell I had a difficult adolescence, but I have difficulty making long term friends. I always feel that someone is trying to pull some kind of stunt on me. They don't want to be my friend, they want me for some reason. I also never feel proud of myself due to my accomplishments. I am also incredibly hard on myself. However, the most damaging is that I'm scared to approach women. I had experiences where woman brushed me off because of my ""social class"" in school and because of my looks. Now, I am not a bad looking guy at all, but I did look like crap for a little bit. I'm trying to get over that, but it is difficult.


I guess what really brought up these negative feelings was listening to ""Digging in the Dirt"" by Peter Gabriel. That song describes the feelings and consequences of abuse pretty well. I just want to state again, I'm not looking for sympathy, but instead understanding. There are only a handful of people I have told this to.


What really gets me down though is that I could have had a better upbringing if people were kinder to each other. I know I would have been a completely different person, but I wish I had a better upbringing that many of my friends had. 

Thank you."

Just wanted some ideas of whether I should apply this cycle or take another year gap year (I actually graduated from college a few weeks). My biggest concern is that my ECs could be stronger (they are pretty lackluster) and are very research-heavy and I feel like that might hurt me.

College: 4 year state university

Race/Ethnicity: not URM

GPA: 3.98

MCAT: 512

Clinical experience: ~50 hrs shadowing (3 specialities)

Clinical volunteering: ~50 hrs for 3 months in a free urban clinic

Non-clinical volunteering: ~400 hrs at my research lab for one summer (not sure if this counts??), random hours (20) community service gigs

Research: Worked at a lab for 2 years (got credits for it for 4 semesters), no publications yet, did get awarded a summer research fellowship + poster presentation

ECs/Other: Treasurer for an art club, member of fitness club and another cultural culture (nothing crazy), TA instructor for a biology lab for a semester, also was teaching intern for a chemistry (developed pedagogical methods and tutored)

LORs: I think they should be decent (my strongest one is obviously from my PI)

I guess that's all - what can I do to strengthen my app? I admit research took up A LOT of time for the past 2 years and made it incredibly difficult to get involved other activities. How would I fare in research-heavy schools? (not planning on pursuing MD/PhD though). Should I just take more time off and focus more on clinical experience/volunteering?"

We just got a booking for a girl who is going to be staying with us for three months here in Austin. She is here for an internship. 3 months is a lot longer than most of ours days, but we we're looking forward to the consistency and, of course, the money.

She mentioned a few weeks before showing up at her mother might come visit for a week or two. We said that would be fine. We have an additional rate of $10 per night per extra person. 

Yesterday she shows up with her mom. She casually announces that her mother will be with her the entire three months. Our house isn't very big, and we already have a roommate, so that means 5 people in a small house for 3 months. That's not really what we bargained for. But we were willing to help her out. So we adjusted the listing so that she would have to pay the $10 per day surcharge for the extra person for the entire duration of her stay. And she paid it, no problem, so we seem to be fine there.

But today, when we asked her what her mother would be doing while she was working her internship but she came here to Austin for? She said her mom would probably sit around the house and read and watch TV all day long.

We live in an area popular with young tourists. All of the guests we get come here, they sleep here, and then they go do tourist stuff all day long. That's how we like it. We've had guessed that we haven't even seen before, because they come in late at night, leave in the morning, and are gone all day.

I guess mom will be here all day, every day. She doesn't have a car. And she is from China, and does not speak a word of English. To make matters worse, I work from home. So, during the day when I am used to having the house to myself and getting work done, there will be someone there who I can't even talk to cooking, watching TV, and generally just being in the way.

Here's my question: is there a polite way, and a way that is acceptable to AirB&amp;B, for us to say something in tje listing, something like"" guests must not be at home the majority of the time during the day."" I see this in classified ads looking for roommates all the time.

What do you guys think? Our other roommate is already miffed about the little old Asian lady who has taken over our kitchen. LOL."

Fresh out of college I was expecting to get an internship and maybe end up doing weather reports for the local news, but my first week assisting Tempe, Arizona's star reporter, I accidentally stumbled onto an innocuous lead about an assemblyman's drug possession and *that* story took off like a rocket.

&amp;nbsp;

Almost overnight I was tracking down a cascading trail of leads that wound up linking several state officials to a drug-trafficking ring of Muertes 13s - probably the most violent international gang to ever come out of South America.

&amp;nbsp;

A year's worth of investigative reporting and a collaborative effort with the assistant DA saw sixty M13s in Arizona alone get sent to prison and my career skyrocketed.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, a year later, I'm scheduled to meet with the same assistant DA, Abigail Crowley, at the very prison where about twenty of the M13s are incarcerated for a follow-up piece that I hope to roll over into a larger expose on the gang.

&amp;nbsp;

My crew - two camera operators and my producer, Mike - are waiting in the warden's office for what seems like an eternity when Abigail finally arrives.  Blonde and in incredible shape, she looks like she belongs on the cover of Playboy and not here in this prison.

&amp;nbsp;

""Brittni,"" she smiles.  ""Thanks for coming.  Listen, the security team is setting us up a space in the yard and everything should be going into lockdown in a few minutes so we can--""

&amp;nbsp;

Abigail is interrupted by the blaring of an alarm and almost immediately a security guard bursts into the room.

&amp;nbsp;

""Everyone, we need you to stay in here,"" he says.  ""We've got a riot situation on our hands.  As soon as we're clear we're going to have your security team escort you from--""  But he's cut short when he is struck in the head from behind, crumpling to the floor.

&amp;nbsp;

Six M13s enter the room.  Mike and our camera operators immediately drop their gear and back away, while Abigail and I are frozen in place.

&amp;nbsp;

Mike raises his hands, ""We don't want *any* trouble....""

&amp;nbsp;

""These are definitely the bitches,"" says one of the gang members, nodding towards Abigail and myself.  In a flash, they grab us and - almost as an afterthought - snatch our crew's cameras, filming us as we are dragged through the halls of the prison.  Alarms are going off everywhere and the sounds of a full-scale riot echo throughout the facility.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, they lead us down several flights of stairs to an area roped-off for construction, finding an isolated room at the end of a long hall, pushing us inside.

&amp;nbsp;

Abigail and I find ourselves trapped with six hulking, tattooed gang members, two of them pointing cameras at us and I can only assume that our abandoned van outside is still setup for live feed, broadcasting our image far and wide.

&amp;nbsp;

""So,"" says one of the M13, approaching us, ""*These* two are the reason we're serving life sentences.""

&amp;nbsp;

The cameras are directed at our faces.

4lqqux,1,2016-05-30,"My girlfriend [21/F] of 6 months, graduating this year (before me) broke up with me [20/M] ~7 weeks ago and I'm finally beginning to come to terms with why and 'accepting' it`",I_AM_STOAT,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lqqux/my_girlfriend_21f_of_6_months_graduating_this/,"So, everything was absolutely perfect. We're both attending the same uni, she's in her final year (3rd) and I'm only in my second. We never once argued, we were always happy to be in each other's company and always laughing. The sexual side of the relationship was great too.

 I really couldn't have asked for a better girlfriend. She'd told me I was the kindest boy she'd ever met, and I know she was 100% into me, she told me so many times how much she likes me

We would text often, there was never a day where we didn't communicate in some sort of way. Then, come the Easter break off from uni. This is 3 weeks long and is a time to allow us to begin revision for our final exams that have just happened last week and the week before today, and to really put the work in to finish assignments and dissertations to meet deadlines.

Over Easter our, or should I say her, texting slowed down quite a lot on several days. This did set off alarm bells in my head but when I asked her 'is everything alright?' she told me yes, we're fine and she'd just been really busy and stressed with studying. She had a lot of work to do to get her dissertation ready to be submitted. We managed to see each other twice over Easter and everything was always as it had been, a good laugh and good sex.

I trusted this girl so much so I took her word for it when she told me everything was fine.

Come the day before her dissertation is due in and now complete, April 14th, she brings me lunch to my house and sits with me laughing and talking while we eat. Then she hits me with the bombshell as she's about to leave. ""I want to break up"".

To say I was upset is an understatement but at the time I tried to remain very calm, and while my sadness showed we managed to talk in my room for 5 minutes. She told me that she couldn't realistically see our relationship continuing next year, as she's done with uni and will have a) a job, or b) an internship abroad. She had not once voiced these concerns to me. She also said that she felt our levels of investment in the relationship are different.

At the end of the day, although it sucks, and I really wish things could have been different she had made her mind up that we absolutely, categorically could not work out next year. She said so in the 'post break up' texts that followed.

She also cut off all contact with me, deleted me from everything and untagged any pictures we had together. This hurt an awful lot. When your closest friend at uni suddenly no longer wants to speak to you anymore, it's hard not to take personally, even if she did tell me in my room 'its not you, it's me' or words to that effect.

I now understand that this realisation of us not being able to work out next year, caused her to emotionally distance herself and pull away from me over the Easter break, when we're not so geographically close to each other. This then let her deal with the sadness of not having me around, so when the time came to break up she'd been through the sadness, and probably the tears that come with that, and was able to really, well and truly break up with me. She told me in no uncertain terms on text that it wouldn't work out, she wants a clean break and after a few texts that this one will be the last I'm sending.

I now know she did this to help herself recover as it must be difficult to try to move on when you keep seeing that person everywhere. 

Ultimately though, today I have realized that no matter what, orwho she was dating (it could literally have been Zac Efron) a break up would have happened because of her life circumstances.  And while this doesn't make it easier, it feels a lot less personal. I'm still hurting though, and miss my best friend a lot but I've realised it's simply not worth texting her to see how her exams or anything like that went. We haven't exchanged any form of communication at all for over a month

TL;DR - girlfriend broke up with me and I've just realised that no matter what, or who she was dating, there was nothing they could have done to change the sitatuation. She had made her mind up after graduating to leave her uni boyfriend behind."
4lqrqw,3,2016-05-30,"One year left to Bachelors, but I've been offered a job. Do I take it?",tangrei,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/4lqrqw/one_year_left_to_bachelors_but_ive_been_offered_a/,"I'll try to make it really easy to read, I'll cut out all the fluff.

I have one year left in order to complete my bachelors. Total GPA is 3.3, past year GPA is about 3.5. I have no work experience, no volunteering. I have a website with some personal projects relevant to my field of study, but that doesn't make much difference for employers.

I do not want to stay in academia, I want to work in the industry. Getting a job in the industry depends more on past work experience rather than GPA. In this sense, I feel like I'm lagging behind and I need to get some work experience quick.

My original plan was to enter a terminal masters program, get one or two internships while I am doing my masters and then start working afterwards. 

However, I just got an offer for an entry job with the government for one year (July 2016 to July 2017). This means I will have to quit school for one year, which I am not stoked about. 

Having in mind the fact that industry employers put so much value into past work experience and not so much on academia, is it a good idea to take the job for one year in order to get experience and enrich my CV? Or am I better off just finishing my undergraduate degree and getting internships during my master studies?

I would normally decline the offer, but seeing as I have no work experience and work experience is highly valued in the industry, I feel like it would be wise for me to take this opportunity."
4lqv8o,4,2016-05-30,F4M - Celebrity wins hot vacation,[deleted],AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/4lqv8o/f4m_celebrity_wins_hot_vacation/,"""By ""raffle"", I won a trip to special vacation resort. This resort is unique because it’s ONLY for couples and no one seems to know much about it, as people who won tickets have to sign nondisclosure agreements. But the rumor is that it’s really great, and most importantly one of the most exclusive in the world. I really want to do that trip, but have nobody to go with, so I ""catch"" you and drag you into it so I can go.

In that resort, a lot of activities are organised for couples. We quickly discover that some are mild, and some aren't at all. Romantic dinners, massage lessons with other couples or just the two of us, sexy cooking lessons, but also more kinky ones. Moreover, some employees can give dares to couples every time they see them, from kiss and grope each other right here (“here” being anywhere from an empty corridor public places)or skinny dipping to have sex in that place without getting caught (or make sure you do get caught by somebody). Each couple can choose anytime between 3 categories and activities and dare at the beginning of the day, but won’t know any details until they start. You can be an employee or a fan, or some rich friend and you have to act like your bf. At the beginning You'd probably kind of shy/nervous because of all of this, hanging out and pretending to be with THAT celeb's boyfriend. On my side I'm having a blast, enjoying myself and keeping us from all the things you'd love to try.

And from here, the scenario can go differen ways depending on what you want to do, your kinks &amp; limits… So let’s discuss it

Do youstart to enjoy yourselfself and we both start to take part is more and more daring activities? Do you figure out that you can take advantage of the situation, start to get more and more touchy every time you can? Trying to get us into the hottest activities, and if I refuse to play along threaten to expose us as a fake couple? Or maybe you start to even blackmail me after getting some serious leverage, and get me to do everything you want.

LOTS of possibilities, with either a young celeb and an older employee, assistant, agent... Or an older one with the new intern or some fan she randomly picked, I'm open to suggestions !

I'm an 18 year-old graduated senior heading to Georgia Tech next year for Computer Science. This summer I was looking for a job, and I've had a lot of trouble finding anything. I used the word ""talented"" in the title because I have quite a bit of experience programming on my own and developing software. I have written numerous small programs, and worked on a couple larger programs. I know numerous programming languages including Java, F#, and HTML. I say I know languages like C, and C++ but I have dabbled in them before and believe I could become quite familiar with them if it was necessary. That's a little info about myself, and so now for the question. JobFair, what advice would you give an 18 year-old graduated senior on trying to find a summer internship or job involving Computer Science. Many of the internships/jobs I looked at were targeted for college students on a Computer Science major. Thanks for any help, and I'll try to answer any questions you have."

I as well as many other here have been gaming for as long as I can remember. I was never that good, but it was something all my friends could do together and have fun doing. But I know I need to stop, and it's hard. Right now I have an amazing internship where I work full time and I have goals I want to accomplish in my time after work but as soon as I get home I'm on my computer until it's time for bed and justify it by saying I've been working all day. Then when it's the weekend I don't study or work towards my goals because, well I've been working all week and deserve to relax right? Lately, I've become more and more detached from social media and reddit is the only thing I browse anymore, but that is mostly because of the amount of gaming I do so I figured it was okay since I wasn't mindlessly browsing facebook or something. For the past year, I have been working out almost daily so once again I used that to justify the time I spent on video games. But for over a year I have been telling myself I will work towards my goals and have made absolutely zero progress. I can't even read a book anymore without getting bored and I used to be able to read a 700 page book in just a day or two. I can't study for the certifications I want because it seems pointless and I don't want to ""work"" in my relaxation time. I start to work on a programming project and scrap it because I feel like *that* is a waste of time. I didn't think I had an addiction but after finding this subreddit and reading some posts I have come to grips with the fact that I do. 


Now, the toughest part is that I live with 3 roommates who do *nothing* but game and have been my friends for 8+ years. As soon as I get home they are asking when I am getting online, etc and they would think I was an idiot for quitting or boring. All of my best friends game and don't want to hear anything about quitting and disregard any negatives that come from it. That is my biggest challenge. But I am going to try to make it.


So today I am reformatting my PC, and never installing a game again. 
I am going to go sit outside and read a book.
I am going to work on a programming project on my fresh and clean PC.

4lr3lf,1,2016-05-30,Need Advice On Life Plan[recently red pilled],bro_scientologist1,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/4lr3lf/need_advice_on_life_planrecently_red_pilled/,"I want to start with the background then move on to ideas on how to improve.

Background:

I grew up in a disfunctional family. My parents are not divorced but my father neglected
me in early years of my life. I grew up with my grandparents(we are the kind of family from
rural Eastern Europe who live together: parents, grandparents etc.). As a result of not having
a father in my life(my grandfather is very beta), I grew up a beta bitch. I am 23 already and
having studied philosophy and TRP I find it hard to forgive my father for bailing out on my early
development years. However, I respect him because he works hard, is a smart person and supports me
through university if I need it.

However, my parents are not successful in life. Actually, none of the people I grew up with that I consider
family are satisfied with their life. I study Computer Science in UK, having finished my 3rd year. I graduate
next year and want to achieve success and satisfaction in life.

Ideas:

Having studied TRP, I found that a man is happy if he is healthy, have a fulfilling career, women and
a successful social circle of bros who support each other.

I have none of those and certainly am not happy.

* Health - I have problems with health but I am working on going to best doctors to determine the cause.
In other areas, I started lifting and eating properly a couple months back and I absolutely love it. I went
to weightlifting class and will join a university weightlifting club next year because I felt like a beast
when doing snatches, cleans etc. I also want to do yoga routine 3-4 times a week to increase flexibility.

* Career - I will work in London this summer doing software engineering. I have never had a proper job doing that
and could use some advice on how to maximize my networking and career opportunities from this position.

* Women - I am a total failure in this department. I am timid and have little experience with women. Having read TRP,
I did go through anger phase but then also remembered that human female does not really behave that differently from
animals(I watched a lot of documentaries). I also found that females are human and just like males, there are many who
are shitty and I shall not tolerate them. It does not help that I am not that attractive and do not have a body to be proud
of but hope lifting to fix that. I do not regard my appearance to be a major hinderance though. It is lack of confidence,
psychological issues and inexperience with females. I can also see that women are interested in me(thanks to TRP) but lack condifence
to approach. I also admit that I am not into relationships and monogomy and just want to fuck women until I am 30 and hopefully
have a good life built before considering commitment to someone.

* Social circle - This one is also a major lacking area in my life. I do not have true friends and it is my fault. My social skills
are not great. However, recently I was told by numerous people that they regard me as a person who likes to interact with people. I
always considered myself an introvert but those friends unveiled that I look like an extrovert. I want to build a circle of successful
men aound me because one very successful person told me that a network of successful people will advance my career a lot more than working
my ass off alone(working hard is still required).

My current plan is to study hard for technical interviews, do my best in the internship and train very hard in the gym, try to get rid of
health problems. As you can see, I have a clue about first two points above but I need advice on 3rd and 4th. Also, I want to thank TRP community for waking me up from the illusion and now I want to start practice what is preeched in this community because theory alone never change anything."

I am in need of your assistance, i indeed *upgraded* to Windows 10. Now now put down those pitchforks. My old Windows 7 system had a lot of problems. I was an intern at a local PC shop and we built a decent PC together. The Windows 7 system they had was giving me problems after a few months so i decided to take a risk and download Windows 10. And what a surprise everything was smooth and glorious.... except some games. League of Legends would work better than before, but most other games i would play would go from 45-60 fps to 20. On the old Win 7 i had horrid stutters and fps drops, now i have no stutters just bigger fps drops. Skyrim is 20 fps, Grim Dawn 20, about all games would drop their fps for about 60%. I would get solid 30 fps in the Witcher 3, everything on High now it won't even get to 10 lol. I have an R7 370 2GB, i downloaded the latest driver for Win 10 and nothing, i downloaded the latter one but still no results. I believe it's due to the GPU, my CPU is the 8320 and i have the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo so temps are not a problem. So i finally turn towards you my brothers. Any ideas?

We have made it through the first academic year and now are on to summer trainings and internships.  I see her usually about once a month.  Currently I am in Annapolis on training and she is in Erie on an internship.

Recently we have been in a rough patch with a lot of fights.  It seems like she is getting mad at me for like everything.  For example, hanging out with friends or not having time to talk to her.  She also blames me for the distance by saying we are apart 90 percent of the time and she did not choose this lifestyle.  She also claims I do not care enough or take her feelings into account.  

I, however, think I am doing everything possible to make this work within reason.  I am not going to be able to go home often or anything because I am in the Navy and my schedule is not decided by me.  

I am trying to find a way to see her in a few weeks but that might fall through.  My problem is that my life will always be like this when I commission as an officer in a few years.

I do not want to lose her because I love her so much but I do not want to feel shitty about what I am doing.  What am I supposed to do to make her happy despite the distance and changing schedule?

TL;DR; How do I fix this problem with my long distance relationship?"

I finally got an interview early today and they told me at the end they'd take me on.

The problem is, alot of the work they are asking me to do is not part of my course, or ever has been. I feel like I could have just have done this internship a year before my course even started and  it wouldn't make a difference. 

Also, I got the feeling the interviewer (future boss) wasn't a nice guy. He would chastise me if I didn't get information right and made me feel rather stupid at points. Pull faces when I asked questions. He also said there was a chance they'd possibly drop me if I wasn't pulling my weight.

I've had stomach aches and my heart has been racing all day since the interview. They said I can do the internship but I feel this massive sense of dread hanging over me. I've felt like puking and have cried since then. 

Later on, while talking to my Dad, he told me something that changed everything. He said ""You don't have to do it"".

I immediately felt this huge weight lifted off my shoulders. My stomach ache cleared and my anxiety stopped. Now, every part of me wants to go with my gut and not do this internship. But my brain is telling me I won't be able to find anywhere else, and anywhere else I do find will probably be the same. 

I can't tell weather I'm thinking logically or if my anxiety is controlling me. Or if I really don't think this internship is for me or if  I'm just looking for an excuse to run away.

I need to let them know in the next 2 - 3 days if I will take them up. Any one got any advice? (If not, thanks for reading anyway, typing this stuff out really helps.)"
4lrgly,4,2016-05-30,Seeking INFJ relationship advice/opinions...,Timmy_Skytower,infj,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/4lrgly/seeking_infj_relationship_adviceopinions/,"Hi all,

I've been a long time lurker on this subreddit, but never really posted anything. I'm usually one to internalize and handle things alone, but I really think I could use some external opinions on my situation. I feel this one means that much to me. I apologize in advance if this becomes a massive wall of text. I just think that some backstory is needed to understand where I'm coming from.

Anyhow, to start, I'm a 29 year-old male who's right on the line between INTJ and INFJ... I can go either way, as I have many traits of both types. Love is a serious word, but I want to say I'm in love with a 28 year-old, very INFJ female. 

We met about 10 years ago, during early parts of our college years. She was probably the most reserved person I had ever met at the time. I remember her being both easy and hard to talk to all at the same time; she'd be a great listener who remembers all the little details, but at the same time never gave out any information herself. Being an introvert myself, working with this put me way out of my comfort zone. Although our interactions were awkward, we'd spend long periods of time together, often talking or walking around until early in the morning, or in some cases sunrise. At some point I had asked her out, because I really enjoyed her company. She agreed to see me, but our relationship was short-lived as she just had too many things going on in her life at the time, and she felt she wouldn't be able to give me the time I deserved. It hurt, but I understood, and it didn't help at all that I was awkward as hell myself back then, with a game as smooth as gravel. However, despite not being in a relationship, she wanted to keep in contact, as she said she really valued our friendship, which I really appreciated.

After college, she moved out of the country for a few years and would continue to go back and forth... both to spend time with her family and to complete an overseas teaching/counseling program (she wants to be a psychological counselor). We kept in contact, although not too frequently. I probably saw her maybe 5 or so times in a period of 5 years or so. I had been in a couple relationships since our time in college, and she had mentioned she had currently had a boyfriend, so our communication wasn't nearly as regular as it used to be, but we still managed to talk here and there. It was kind of a pain to keep in contact, but I valued her friendship and didn't want it to fade away like my friendships with some others from school. It was like this until about late 2014.

In December of 2014, she came back to the US and would be staying to complete a Master's program relevant to her field. We met up in early 2015 for the first time in almost 2 years or so. It was really nice seeing her again, but I would say we weren't in the best of places. I had recently broke up with my girlfriend of 5 years, and she had broken up with her boyfriend a month prior, as she found out he was cheating on her. She had most definitely changed over the past several years, as she was much more open and outgoing with her thoughts. Her heart was broken, but she took great steps in overcoming it and focusing on herself... which I thought was really endearing. We talked almost all day and all night that day, and caught up on almost everything. We've hung out a handful of times since then, but again she's quite busy with her schooling, counseling internship, and other activities. We're also don't live close to each other anymore, like in college. Despite that, at least there wasn't an ocean between us.

Now, fast forward to about 2 days ago. Again, we still don't meet up that often due to our conflicting schedules, but we do try and meet every once in a while. We met up for an early-ish dinner, and did some catching up, which lasted for almost past closing time. We talked about a lot of things, as usual, but the real focus this time was (surprisingly) relationship talk. To my surprise, she mentioned that she was actually looking for a relationship, and has been having a really hard time meeting new people. Since she's changed so much over the years and learned from her previous experiences, she explained her seemingly simple, new criteria of traits she's looking for in a guy. She's looking for emotional intelligence, a ""sense of humor,"" someone who's a bit extroverted (to encourage her out of her shell), and someone who with she shares a decent chemistry. She also added that they absolutely must share her core values of family emphasis, self-growth, mutual trust, treating each other as equals, and a healthy harmony at home. I think this is one of the few times she's been so sure of what she was looking for.

As such, this brings me to the point of my post, and why I'm looking for fellow INFJ opinions/advice.
Although it might be dangerously arrogant to say, I can't help but feel she's pretty much describing me, as well as what I look for in a relationship (although I'm not exactly extroverted). She knows where I stand regarding values, she knows what qualities I look for in a girl, and she pretty much knows what I want. She also must know that she fits my description pretty well. However, what she doesn't know is that I really like her, and that I don't think I've ever stopped liking her in the 10 years I've known her. As far as I know, she just knows that we're great friends, and that I'm one of her longest-standing friends. As such, do you guys have any ideas on how I can move forward about this? Because of our past, am I eternally friend-zoned? Her statements are so neutral, I can't tell if she's being strictly platonic, or if she's giving me subtle hints. To make things worse, I know she's not an initiator, and is extremely hesitant to take risks. I'd like to be able to tell her how I feel, but I really don't want to strain or jeopardize our friendship twice. I can't help but feel like I'm walking through a minefield with flip-flops. The only thing I do know is that I honestly think she's the girl for me, and I'd hate myself if I didn't try.

Anyhow, any and all opinions/advice is appreciated. Thanks so much for your time, and sorry for the wall of text. 

Have a great Memorial Day holiday!

- Complicated logic and control flow.
- Minimal library wrangling. Much of my internship has been spent trying to get third party libraries running and playing nicely with each other. I don't hate that, but it's not my favorite thing to do.
-  Little UI design.  Again, I don't hate it, but not what I prefer.
- Designing a complicated system. I liked creating the architecture, designing all the relationships and what should have responsibility for what.

We have made it through the first academic year and now are on to summer trainings and internships. I see her usually about once a month. Currently I am in Annapolis on training and she is in Erie on an internship.

Recently we have been in a rough patch with a lot of fights. It seems like she is getting mad at me for like everything. For example, hanging out with friends or not having time to talk to her. She also blames me for the distance by saying we are apart 90 percent of the time and she did not choose this lifestyle. She also claims I do not care enough or take her feelings into account.

I, however, think I am doing everything possible to make this work within reason. I am not going to be able to go home often or anything because I am in the Navy and my schedule is not decided by me.

I am trying to find a way to see her in a few weeks but that might fall through. My problem is that my life will always be like this when I commission as an officer in a few years.

I do not want to lose her because I love her so much but I do not want to feel shitty about what I am doing. What am I supposed to do to make her happy despite the distance and changing schedule?

TL;DR; How do I fix this problem with my long distance relationship?"
4lrsq6,0,2016-05-30,Thinking of a second masters... Wanted to know if it's a good idea.,spetnamu,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4lrsq6/thinking_of_a_second_masters_wanted_to_know_if/,"I am a MS CS student here at Rutgers, and my GPA is very bad. It's not because, I am bad at programming but it's because most of the CS classes that I am interested in taking are very mathematical/theoretical. I feel like I need to take a few maths/statistics classes to be able to better understand these classes.

This summer I will be interning at a bank and people who interned there last year told me that they mostly will give FT jobs to everyone who interns there. Some 6 or 7 people interned there last year and everyone got a FT offer. 

Now I am happy with the bank, it's a good company, people are friendly, I get to work on Scala, there are some teams that are doing cutting edge work and I might get to work with them too, but it's not a technology oriented firm and I feel to be truly be good at it, I need to know a little bit about finance/economics/commerce or something. I feel it will limit my options in the future.

This year, when I was applying for internships,  apart from this lousy internship I did in India I had 0 work experience and also had a bad GPA, so I got very few interview calls. But now I have this internship and I will also be TA'ing an intro level course which can give me some leverage I believe. Besides, now I know which companies will definitely call people from my college for an interview so I will make sure to apply to them(I missed a lot of companies cause I didn't even knew they existed, like Blackrock, Cray. I was also too late in applying to Amazon, so I can try my luck again this year).

So to further my job prospects, I am thinking of staying back another semester in college and doing a masters in stats. My reasons are as follows.
(1) My college's stats department is similarly ranked as CS, but it is relatively easy to get good GPA in stats, so atleast one of my two degrees will have a good gpa(Could some one tell me if this would give me any advantage?) Also two of stats courses count towards CS so I will have a chance to improve my CS gpa too..
(2) I am extremely interested in machine learning, but I am terribly sucking at it cause I don't have a firm foundation in maths, I am hoping that a stats degree could serve as a bridge course to make me proficient in maths and help me get better at ML.
(3) With a stats degree, I can target way more jobs then I am currently able to(Can someone confirm this?).
(4) With two internships(including next year's internship, if I get one) I will be in a better position when I start applying for full time jobs.

What do you guys think? Also wanted to ask any recruiter out there. If you see someone with a shitty CS gpa but a goodish Stats gpa, would you call him for an interview?"

I'm a subscriber and occasional commenter to /r/gradschool on my main account, but now I would like some advice on a difficult situation.

I'm going to be a fifth year PhD student in an engineering field and I was originally hoping to finish by the end of April 2017. But unfortunately, there's only enough money in our grant to carry me through December 2016. So now my advisor wants me to get out by then. I really do not think that is enough time and I really want to have that extra semester to make sure that I do a good job on my project and my dissertation.

The only reason that I'm in this situation is because of a lack of money. If we had a way to pay for another semester, I'd bet my advisor would be cool with it. But he's not going to help me look for anything and I do not want to have to take out any loans. So now I'm asking you guys to help me figure out some other options.

Before anyone suggests me doing a TA, unfortunately I don't think that is possible. I was a TA last semester in our department for a class dealing with a subject in which I had very little experience. And well, I didn't do a very good job. So now the department thinks that I'm not fit to be a TA and they won't let me be one again. I could look outside the department, but that is not a guarantee since they give preference to their own students and whatever spots are left are very competitive. And it's too early to tell if there will even be anything, so I'd rather not put all my eggs in that basket just yet.

One thing that I would really enjoy doing is work in industry or research in my field, like for a company or scientific organization. Not only will I have more time to make a better dissertation, but I can also get some valuable work experience. But I wonder, is that something that is commonly done? Essentially being an intern or something during a non-summer semester? Or is that all just wishful thinking?

If anybody has any other suggestions, I would be glad to hear them. Thank you.

***

**TL;DR:** Not enough money, advisor wants me to finish my PhD by the end of the year, I just want one more semester."

4lsgzc,15,2016-05-30,"Basic questions about using a crock-pot: Meat, vegetables, and do I really need chicken stock?",forensicpath,slowcooking,https://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/4lsgzc/basic_questions_about_using_a_crockpot_meat/,"Just BTW, I've read through other ""basic questions"" in this sub!

This is the first slow cooker I've used, given to me by my parents (and it's about a decade+ old; 2 quarts, only Low and High settings), and they did not teach me how to use it. 

I don't really cook using recipes - it's just some variation of whatever is on sale (college student) but because of an internship, I legitimately don't have much time to cook anymore and I refuse to eat out. So if there's a recipe calling for spices I don't have (garlic, onions, green onions, salt, pepper, Tony Chacheres), then I don't do it. 

From what I've read in the sub, I don't need to put liquid in with chicken thighs? The thighs I have are boneless/skinless but it seems I really should put them on the oven-top for a few minutes for browning/crisping (if I had skin), and I can make time for that at least. As far as vegetables go, I don't eat carrots or potatoes, which seem to make up a LOT of popular recipes... I only ever cook with bok choy, spinach, broccoli, cauliflower...etc. So do I only put these in the last hour or so? What about green onions? I am confident I do put diced onion/garlic in the beginning though, right?

A lot of people say to cook chicken thighs on low for 6 hours. But I am always gone 7:30AM to 4:00PM - so basically 8 hours minimum, I'm out of the house. What's going to happen to my chicken? Should I not bother adding in vegetables for an hour or so while I do chores/errands, or is it okay for chicken to be sitting there for 8+ hours? 

Also, I'm assuming this is a non-issue, but I'm not gonna have to worry about salmonella or anything, right?

Yet gladly say adieu, for the pain you have wrought.

.


When my babe was in the NICU, I clung to you so tight,

Desperately making milk for her, beneath the dreaded blue light.

You let me feel like part of her, when I couldn’t bring her home,

And I prayed the familiar milky taste made her feel less alone.

.


When I returned to the OR, to scrub and scrub and scrub

You gave me an excuse to take a break, and think about my love.

You taught me how, despite protest, to put myself first,

To demand breaks for my boobies, and water for my thirst.

.


But let’s not forget the stress, the pain, and the ever present fear,

That I’d make too little, forget a part, or drink too much beer.

I lived and died by ounces per day, and stretched myself so thin

That panic built a cozy home, just beneath my skin.

.


On busy days, I made my intern flip with me, even while I pumped,

On awful days, I left milk out and watched it all get dumped.

On good days, I met the quota and breathed a sigh of relief

But on most days, all you brought was pain and stress and grief.

.


And so I thank you for your service, and send you on your way-

May you know that you were loved and hated, multiple times a day.

I’ll see you in a few years, if life grants us more babies and good luck, 

So thank you, good riddance, and always remember- that you really really suck."

4lst3i,6,2016-05-30,TIFU by vacuuming,georgenutmeg,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4lst3i/tifu_by_vacuuming/,"So this was actually a week ago but whatever.  


I have this weird job/internship/volunteer thing I do once every week where I go down to this cool old boatyard/museum and basically do all the boring jobs the people who actually work there don't want to do. (Painting, vacuuming, cleaning, etc.) 

I don't get paid for this, because I'm just a freshman in high school and it's only once a week and the place is non-profit, but my parents give me an allowance for it. And hey, at least it's some experience I use for college essays and future jobs and such. 

Anyways, there were some transportation issues after school that day, so my mom had to drive me over with my bike in the car (I don't remember why) and I locked it up outside the dock. I'm pretty flustered because I'm 15 minutes late for the first time, and I'm not really paying attention to anything. 


I walk inside and and see the guy who usually helps me out and tells me what to do (let's call him Scott) and I see he's actually building a small canoe. I ask him what he's doing, and he replies, ""Filming a commercial for (company)."" I laugh and say, ""Ok, but why are you building the boat?"" I finally decide to look up and see that I'm surrounded with tons of lights and a couple of cameras on some crazy rig, and I immediately nope out of the shot while frantically apologizing to everyone. They didn't really care because it was just a time lapse and I probably didn't get in any of the frames. He was filming a commercial where he builds a boat in 24 hours and that somehow promotes a water bottle that stays cold for 24 hours and they were filming him building it and drinking water from the bottle and stuff. 


Anyways, I talk to another guy who works at the boatyard, and he tells me to prime these wooden covers for an antique drill press, (random, I know) and that when I'm done, if I have time I should clean up some areas with shit tons of sawdust. I start to work away and although these filming guys are a little bit intrusive, I'm not going over there anyways so it doesn't affect me that much. Also it was pretty fun to listen to their conversations because they were so stereotypical for a film crew. The director/boss man had this total superiority complex, but the sort of complainy kind where nothing's ever good enough and everyone is there to serve him, and the interns were trying really hard to work their way into conversations and see what was going on and so on. 


I have 15 minutes left on my ""shift"" and I decide I'm going to be a nice guy and not leave early and instead clean the sawdust up. All the filming guys are outside messing with a drone or getting dinner, so it's just me and Scott, who's busy building a boat in 24 hours. I walk over and grab the vacuum, and start to look for outlets to plug into. My logic was as long as I don't plug into the same sockets and power extensions as them then I'll be fine. I find an empty power extension and plug in, and turn on the vacuum. It seems really weak, so I keep turning it on and off again, when suddenly it's completely out. 


I go to Scott to ask him why it's not working, and see all of their camera equipment is off, along with all their high powered lights. ""Did we just blow a fuse?"" Scott asks. Oh shitshitshitshit is all I can think. God damn it thats like 5 hours of footage and all this equipment that just got unplugged. I know nothing about this stuff, so of course the conclusion I immediately jump to is that they just lost all their footage and will have to redo it and I just wasted a shit ton of money. So Scott goes and resets the fuse or whatever and the powers back on, but they're all out getting lunch, except for the director guy who is outdoors flying a drone. 


Scott says he will talk to them, so I just get on my bike and leave. I'm not dealing with that shit (even though it's my bad). I still don't know what happened. I'm guessing it's not too bad but I thought I would share it because it's sort of unique. I'll find out tomorrow if anything bad happened.  Who knows, maybe they'll get really pissed at me or maybe I'll be let off scott free. 

Big sorry for any grammar/misspellings because mobile. I know it was a lot of words for a pretty small fuck up but I'm a wordy person.

Tldr tried to vacuum ended up breaking a fuse and abruptly turning off a ton of filming equipment that had been going for over 5 hours. Oops"

I'm Asian (Korean). And every time my parents did something that my friends said was wrong or fucked up, I imagined it was just simply cultural differences. I think what makes this even more difficult for me is that my parents weren't always this way. I remember them being warm, caring and loveable in my youth. But immigrating to America, and the stress that came with it, changed them so much. Yet I can't seem to let go of the image I had of the as a child.


My father has developed anger issues. And no matter what he got angry or stressed at, he takes it out on his family. I finally decided to look at this subreddit because of the events that happened today, and I'm sorry if this gets very long. 

For memorial day, my father asked me to plan a 2 night 3 day trip. Leaving approximately at 4PM Saturday, and coming back Monday night. I have horribly decision making and responsibility issues, but I tried because I wanted to make my father happy. I found a gorgeous state park about 5.5 hours away (my father loves parks and we've been to all the ones near us before) and I showed it to him, with a safari planned for Sunday and an easy day of hiking and stopping to eat on Monday. He told me it looked fine. A couple weeks pass, I'm still looking for the perfect hotel (my father demanded that there be a kitchen in the hotel room, but that it shouldn't cost more than 150 dollars a night). He suddenly tells me two weeks before the trip that the 5.5 hour drive is too long. Oh and my aunt (his sister) is now coming with us, so I'm to plan something that's not as physically tasking. I searched and offered to go to a quite village, then a bigger city the next day. I search for hotels, but because of the influx of people for memorial day weekend, nothing is open for Saturday night. I relay the message to my parents, and they say that we will leave Sunday morning then. 

Saturday morning comes around and I'm told that we're leaving that day at 5PM, and that I am to be ready by then. I hadn't packed, and neither had either of my sisters. We attempt to get ready by 5 and when we're late, we're yelled at. When I mention that there will be no where to sleep tonight if we leave on Saturday, my father tells me that it's my fault for not booking it earlier and that we are to go pick up our aunt today anyway. I am also told on the car ride to my aunt that I'm to give up my room for her. 

So we leave on Sunday morning, and because my father woke up an hour ealier than planned, the entire house is now to get ready an hour earlier. We're constantly yelled at as we try to hurry up getting things into the car. I booked a King suite for me and my sisters with a conjoining double queen for my parents and aunt. My sisters and I were to sleep on the king bed together, and my parents had access to the kitchen. When we get to the hotel, my father states that he is uncomfortable sleeping in the same room as his sister because he is a grown male with a wife. So we offer to give my parents the king while my sisters, I and my aunt figure out the double queens. My sister states that my aunt snores, and that she has tried sleeping in the same room as my aunt before and she couldn't get sleep at all (she's a very light sleeper). My aunt offers to sleep on the sofa bed that is separate from everyone else but my father starts yelling that me and my sisters are disrespectful pieces of shit for ""making"" our aunt sleep on the sofa. Me and my sisters all tried to convince our aunt that we would take the sofa and she could sleep on a bed but she wouldn't budge. And so, my father continued to yell at us, throughout dinner (which I reserved at a nice french place thinking this would be a happier trip) and is a general nuisance to the waitress. My father is still angry when we get back to the hotel, and tells me that I screwed every thing up because of my horrible planning. That my sister should suck up sleeping with the snoring and she's being a brat. He promptly tells us that we are leaving at 1PM tomorrow (checkout is at 12) and I tell him that we have to leave by 12. He tells me to take care of it and that he is going to bed because he is tired. He takes the king bed. I call the front desk, apologize and get check out moved to 1 (with a bit of a hassle as the person at the front desk had to ask his manager to move the time). I toss and turn all night as I'm stressed and tired (which made me lash out at my bf, which only caused a fight that left me drained and crying at 3 in the morning). I finally fall asleep around 4, and my father wakes us up at 6, stating that he doesn't want to sleep any longer. He pulls and pushes me and my sisters off the bed. We meet at breakfast, and my father states after his meal that he is tired and in need of a nap. So we go back up, and he goes into his room. Assuming that he's going to nap, I go back to my hotel bed and attempt to get some more sleep, only to be woken up by my aunt who states that we are wasting time sleeping on a vacation and that if I'm so tired, they'll just leave me as they do other things. This hurts me (as I'm the one who found the place she wants to go to because I wanted to go too, just later in the day) and I cry a little bit out of frustration. My oldest sister is still getting ready (as we had 5 females and we all had to take showers) and at 10, my father comes barging in, yelling at us for making him wait an hour and half. He tells us we're being disrespectful and when Monica tries to tell him we're almost done he tells her to shut her mouth. She gets upset and starts yelling back, to which he tells my sister (24) that he's tired of her shit and that he's kicking her out. She had an internship and is in the process of getting a job. He screams at my mom that this is her fault for raising us wrong, and that the family is crazy and abnormal and that he's the only normal one. My oldest sister tells him crying, that he's threatened to kick her out since middle school and that she hopes he has a good, ""normal"" life. He cuts our plans short and drives back home alone in the van that fits 7, forcing the rest of us to fit in my oldest sister's tiny car to drive back home.

Back home, he tells me and my sisters that we're all lazy pieces of shit and that we all have until November to pack out stuff and get out. He tells my mom that this is her fault, and that she raised us wrong and that he hates this household because it's again, so abnormal. 

I'm 20, still in college and my other sister is 24, currently looking for a job. Me and her have said nothing to him since breakfast, but because he's upset at my oldest sister, he tells all three of us that he's taking his stuff and leaving without us come November because he's sick and tired of this shit.

My mother tried to calm him down, but her attempts are met with more yelling about how useless she is, and that she's the reason me and my sisters turned out so abnormal. That when he was me and my sister's age, he was worried about putting food on the table, not lying around being disrespectful and lazy.

He leaves to take my aunt back home with my mother, and when he comes back he yells at all of us again that we are to start packing now so we can get out of here by November. He never let me have a job as a high schooler or college student because I had to focus on being a good student, and that meant no jobs. I have no car (can't get one because no money because no job) and when I tried to get a part time job, he refused to give me a ride and told my family that no one is to take me. 


When I was younger, he was a passionate teacher that took countless days and hours trying to help the children he taught. It meant he was home less often, but he was never a bad parent. Whenever he came back home, I was greeted with warm hugs and kisses. When I got sick, I was always coddled and taken care of by my father. This is the image is have of him, and I try so hard to make him happy. It's like the person I remember and the person he is now are two completely opposite people.

I don't know what to do anymore, and I didn't know where else to share this. I know it's a very isolated incident, but my father's narcissism has been gradually building, and I finally saw just how bad it had gotten today. Thank you for reading, sorry about the wall of text. 


TLDR; My father, who used to be sweet and caring, has turned into a narcissistic monster who has threatened to kick all of his family out (including my mother) because we couldn't cater to his time frame and dared talk back to him. "

I also was offered another internship for application development (C#). I was wondering which internship I should take. I am kinda curious about algorithm development but I don't know much about it. Which path would you take and why?

How bad is it for me?,ProblemsAtCl,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/4ltr6a/i_screwed_up_an_internship_how_bad_is_it_for_me/,"To keep it short, I did a 2-month internship in a family-owned company (~10 workers total). HVAC and solar heating.

I don't want to excuse myself or anything, just explaining what happened: my mother had a car accident and was hospitalized during the internship, I had to take responsibility for the house and my two siblings (never had any responsibility regarding this, tbh), I was working 50 hours/week, I had just broken up with my 5year girlfriend, and to top things off, my grandmother died in the last week of the internship.

I exploded. Couldn't handle it. I called in sick two days throughout the internship and when the final day came, my boss told me I had to recover those days. I couldn't. I didn't show up. I didn't respond to mails or calls...

One month after, I needed documentation to present at my college... damn... so I had to courage up and go there, and he gave me a lengthy talk about how we all have problems but if I want to be an adult I should learn to deal with them without my work suffering, how he was really disappointed and didn't expect someone from my college (respectable one in my country, top 1 maybe) to do something like I did, that my work was really good but attitudes like mine could really hurt my career, etc. He gave me the papers I needed but it was *really* awkward.

So... what does this mean for me in the future? I still need to do one internship more, and I'm afraid to mention this company because I won't be able to get a recommendation or even appraisal. I'm also afraid to not mention my previous experience because it makes for a weaker CV...

Should I mention the previous experience and explain my situation there if needs be? Or should I just avoid mentioning I worked there for other internships and/or job hunting?

I'm sorry if I sound like a child... I'm really bummed over all this. Please give me your opinion!.

**TLDR** Didn't show up for a few days at the end of an internship. Boss was mad at me. Should I mention my experience working in that company when applying for other internships/jobs, or should I sweep it under the rug to avoid any contact with that company?"

Starting my 2nd week as an intern. I've been assigned to some tickets/bugfixes. I came in pretty confident in my programming/debugging skills, but I just can't seem to figure out some of these bugs due to the sheer complexity of the code / being unfamiliar with the language its in. I've been doing my best to learn about the language and I have a *pretty* good idea about what's going on, but to put it clearly, I have no idea why X feature is not working. Some of these I've been spending 1-2 hours on individually.

I've been asking my mentor/other teammates for help and we usually debug these bugs together; however, it often takes a long time (the other day I used 2 hours of another engineer's day helping me debug this one nasty issue.) Is this a bad sign? How many questions would the average intern ask in his/her first few weeks? Am I spending too much/too little time on my own trying to figure out before asking for assistance?

To better this situation, I spent time this weekend reading about the frameworks and debugging further (to no avail.)

Thanks for the advice."

so I've decided that I want to get involved in the netsec field

I regularly do VulnHub VMs for fun. My programming skills are quiet poor honestly But I'm working on that. 

I've decided to sit the SATs test in November to get into a BA of computer science with a major in cyber security. 

But I'm curious if there any short courses or such I can do that would help me get a internship or some form to get more into the amazing field.

So, after the past month storm, that ""reassuring"" message, the guy with the vision burned out and bailed. 

After more than a year with an unstable and unfinished release, we're left with underpaid interns and these guys http://www.flyingtigerentertainment.com/products.html making a console port which I HOPE wasn't the great news we're waiting.

Thanks for all the effort, Harvester, but beyond the circlejerk in that other thread the game future doesn't look quite bright.

A game where major area are underdeveloped (career/science/balance) with much stuff left out in the 1.0 rush (antennas, multiplayer) many components elements plain broken (LY-01 anyone?) many quality of life feature relegated to mods (but mods void your warranty!).

I believed and funded Harvester vision. Godspeed man, but while you fly high we're stuck with this for the time being.
Look, we really believed. And we trusted. And we waited. And we weren't even in a rush! Many on the forum and elsewhere were begging for more beta time and prepared to wait even more. And then we waited some more because the fixes were coming! 

With all up in flames, it's time we get some answers about 'the future of ksp' - without the condescending bullshit that was used the last three times. Sorry, but some unspecified, undefined 'features and fixes will be in'! from the quitting developer doesn't quite cut it.

My habit escalated past what I imagined it ever would, well in reality I knew it was just more of a 'I'm too much of a pussy to off myself, dope do it for me' decision, the amounts alone as far as what goes on the scale then into the spoon, how much I spend, and what I buy deserves a bit of written reflection I think. Last summer I had a cushy NYC area internship that paid decently (for an intern) and in the first week I went from an honest, legitimate chipper to an everyday user.  I was paying too much for these buns, definitely no question, but holy shit these things were good despite not even being that heavy.  I was a terrible employee, not that I ever used during or before work, but I'd always come in still kind of high from a nice xanax/dope binge fighting a war inside to stay awake and produce the kind of bullshit dumbed-down asskissing client presentations the company passed off as greatness and bullshitting my way out of getting fired for it.  I experienced my first awful withdrawals, first boulder-sized and consistency shits as well as hemorrhoids from pushing too hard after a full week had gone by with nothing, and having to overdraw from an atm and do sneaky shit for food while considering beginning dealing again except this time to basically strangers in order to be be able to work the next day.  Some bridges were scorched a bit to put it nicely as is standard in business that contributes nothing, but I got out with a pair of good enough references, a couple thousand dollars left for the fall, and by the skin of my teeth, I wasn't fired!  So it was great really other than the job/field which sucked and I had no interest in going back either.  In the fall, other than a few failed meet-ups with people I met online in these two cities of Minnesota, all but one was a bust - getting shorted, robbed, or nearly arrested - and the decent one dried up almost immediately.  Fuck that shit, I just would order a gram at a time on darknets from the only vendor whose price was remotely justified - which I may be back to in not that long - and managed to binge on grams, be kinda sick for a day then take a week or two off and repeat.  I stuck to my budget and was happy only snorting even when narcan and syringes suddenly were made available locally in our midwest frozen chunk of paradise out of nowhere.  

Back this winter, I returned to an area near, like, a pretty large city in Illinois not to be specific or anything, for my final courses to complete my bachelors degree.  I snorted a jab every week, sometimes a bit more or less time, but generally much less as life progressed, my account balance continuously got smaller, and I kept on excitedly hopping on the L and handing my middle $100 a week after a 90 minute train/bus journey which turned into $200 per week or maybe a little more, two with some amazing control, for a slightly better deal and so on.  

At this point, I decided I was sick of spending $200 per week to not be high, have nosebleeds every morning and pull out pieces of flesh to clear the way for a deviated septum and decided to give the needle another try - go big or go home I thought: maybe I'll die, or maybe I'll bottom out and finally have some desire to stop. As I'm writing, I'm dissolving the crushed up pieces of a nice .15 g-.15 g speedball now; the coke is actually really good, way too expensive, but I'd rather pay 50-60% more than I'd like for several times higher purity than average out on 'dem streets than pay 30/g for 95 percent baking soda and lidocaine; the dope is standard Chicago grey raw bought locally (varies batch to batch from I'd say like 5-8/9 out of 10 in quality, the 5 just one time though maybe it was just me idk, it's always been a struggle for me to decide if it's rerocked or not because it either was cut or smashed off a hydraulically compressed brick or rerocked, but considering certain logistics of its path to me I kind of doubt they'd have bothered and Chi grey is almost always a pain to break unlike the off white variety of tan soft-chunk, easily-breakable 10/10 shit I got once in my life from somewhere on the East Coast that made me fall out and come back 6 hours later with almost no hearing, blurry vision, and projectile vomiting bile after snorting a point if that.  And no, there was no fent.  I wish I had a g of that to bang through now but that's life.  After my first non-using dealer disappeared very quickly after making me think I'd finally made it in addict life out of middlemanland - with hits like 'I need all the money now to buy both our stuff and only I can go in, take my backpack with empty, used points and some other useless but illegal paraphernalia for collateral' '5 min bro' 'yo can you stand around the corner there bro while this goes down' - after returning to my area in January said happy birthday by getting me for $200 rather than continuing to make $40 or so at a time because being an economist at the federal reserve bank just wasn't cutting it for supplying all that dope she needed to inject into her skin since her veins are made of lava and making an attempt at finding one is *hard*; I'm sure she has a heart-wrenching story of what dope reduced her to from her former self, making her a completely different person whose actions against others were and are now absolutely no reflection upon her own character and totally beyond her own control with the wise perspective of six weeks clean.

So here I am now, graduating in mere weeks at 22 with a math degree, a job offer that matched exactly what I asked for on salary - in hindsight I should have gone balls out and asked for 70/80k per year but I'll be fine where I'm at for now - with 80% paid dental and health insurance, some percent match on 401k, 4 weeks of PTO, the works.  The key parts are the PTO and insurance.  After years of hiding my drug problem and not being able to get serious help for depression and other shit and just self medicating my way through the day with increasingly dangerous drugs and ROAs, I finally have the ability to go to rehab at some point without feeling like I'm wasting anybody's money.  I have a solid 40k to pay in total for student loans with the added interest, but if I pay it over a long period like they want you to it'll be a pretty small fraction of my monthly income or I can pay it twice as fast.  But here I am - moving away from one of America's dope capitals back to Minnesota, where the dope is always underweight and in ripped, tied and/or bic-melted POS bags and basically just a maybe finger-sized rock of what some dude hauled out of Chicago and sprinkled some dorm into after crushing it all up and making everyone bend over for $20/$40 points/q-gram but in reality .15-.22 g bags.  In other words, I have some - not a huge, but finally some desire to quit - but moving from this easy, great local h access is hard.  At the same time, the thing that always forced me to stop, money, is about to not be an issue.  Unless I can't manage to keep it under 2k in spending per month, I have no absolute need to use if I can still do my job.  It's a really weird fork in the road to be in, and I think I'm going to try rehab largely to try to meet people like me - which is something I've never managed to do the last few years, not wanting to go full into the using crowd to maintain my facade of innocence but hanging out with people who can't even imagine what this addiction is like.  Anyway, that's more than enough writing for a while.  Should I give the evening rehab program they're suggesting to me a shot, save up a few weeks and go for full outpatient day-long or inpatient detox and rehab, or just keep going until shit gets worse and I lose my job or the rest of my veins?"

Picture of my grades: Fall semester, winter semester, spring semester
http://imgur.com/a/PLz0d

The first semester here was absolutely brutal and everyday I thought I didn't have it in me to go through engineering even though I know what I loved doing. I was so conflicted that my brain couldn't keep up with my passion for it. I remember getting an 85 on my statics test (ENES102) without studying and thought this really isn't that bad. I got a 20% and a 25% on the next 2 and failed the class with an F. I was proud to get the minimum C- in chemistry and i couldn't even get above a C+ in a gen ed, Criminal Justice. I was put on academic probation and thought it really is all coming down. I was doubting why I was admitted directly into the engineering school in the first place.

Over the winter I decided to take Statics again so I didn't fall behind. I got a B+ and missed an A- by 2 points (even got my final re-graded but couldn't get the points back). 

At the start of the spring semester I really decided to change stuff up. Between classes I didn't go back to my room, spent time out and about studying. I had joined a engineering club first semester and we won our regional competition in April and now we are on to nationals. Everything seemed to be improving and it really was all in my control. The last week of school I also found out that I have an internship lined up for the summer as well. Obviously I couldn't bring my GPA to a 3.0 but I'm proud of that 2.983 and that I worked my ass off to get that close.

I know this is a long post about my personal year but I just wanted to say even if it's all going to shit, know that you can make it better. Obviously I know it all gets harder from here but as of right now, I feel like I hit that rock bottom after transitioning from high school. Once you decide to grasp the situation, you can move things in your favor. Good luck to everyone !"

(24, no debt)",PM_ME_UR_CC_INFO,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4lvcur/need_help_deciding_how_much_of_a_student_loan_to/,"Hey PF. Apologies ahead of time if this gets long because of my formatting.

First time poster going to in-state graduate school in August. I was lucky and my parents and grandparents paid for most of my undergraduate degree. Because of that, I have no idea how loans work and need some help figuring out how much I need to take out. Below you'll find my cash/savings/awards, what school thinks I need to pay for the year, and what I spent on average every month.


**Cash, savings, awards:**

* Savings: I moved home and saved $10k which is now in a 529.

* Savings: My grandparents are going to contribute $7.5k, also in a 529.

* Savings: I have $2k in savings (depositing 20% [currently $125] per paycheck) and $1k in emergency funds.

* Cash: I work for AmeriCorps full time, which pays $483 biweekly, and a small business part time 6 or 13 hours a week for $10/hr. Searching for a better part time job. AmeriCorps ends before school starts.

* Award: AmeriCorps will provide $5.5k toward school before tax. I also extended my service, so I'll receive a cash stipend for my extra month and a half, but I don't know how much. Probably a couple hundred.

* Award: I received a grant from my school for $5k for the year

* Award: I received a scholarship for $2k for the year

* Award: I've applied for 3 need-based state scholarships. Two are $200-19,000 and one is $400-9,700. I won't hear back for a while, but my chances of getting them are good. Not a lot of people know to apply for them, a friend gave me a good word, and I'm pretty poor these days. :P


**Loans:**

* Federal Direct Loan Unsub: $20,500

* Federal Direct Grad PLUS: $16,674

* Total: $42,174


**Cost of Attendance:** (direct quote of numbers from the school, with my comments)

* Books and Supplies: $1,351.00

* Fees: $1,807.00

* Grad PLUS Loan Fees: $857.00

* Hospitalization Insurance: $3,600.00 (not sure I'll have to take this, I'm covered by my dad's insurance and waived the school insurance)

* Living Expenses: $19,350.00 (*see below*, pretty sure I won't spend this much)

* Malpractice Insurance: $27.00 (waived?)

* Stafford Loan Fees: $214.00

* Transportation: $2,000.00 (no idea if this is what they're charging me to use their bus or an estimate of what I'll spend to get there. I am walking/biking distance from campus already)

* Tuition: $12,944.00 (tru)

* Vaccines: $24.00 (doing this myself while I have AmeriCorps covering my copays)

Total: $42,174.00


**Living expenses:** (what I spend with one roommate)

* Rent: $515

* Utilities: $10 for water, varies from $25 to $75 depending on the month

* Internet: $25

* Car insurance: about $100

* Food: currently on SNAP at $194/month, trying to stay that way but I'll need at least 4 hrs/week of part time work if they accept my 16 hr/week internship.

* Gas: extremely variable but on average $70 a month

* Flex spending: $393, just under 30% of my income. I break this down further into budgeted categories on Learnvest, including eating out, bars/alcohol, Uber/Lyft/travel, unnecessary and necessary shopping, health spending, entertainment, gifts, charity, etc.

Total: $1138-1188/month, which is 13656-14256 a year. Less than the 19k my school estimated.

---------------------------------------------------------

**SO, my big question is: how much should I take out in loans?** Avoid the Grad PLUS altogether? My COA with the edits above comes out to $32,572. $18,316 of that is school tuition and fees payable through scholarships, AmeriCorps and 529. **The remaining $14,256 is living expenses - I assume I can only use my loans and savings for this. Everything else is meant for tuition and fees, right?** I'll only have $2750 in savings when I finish my job in August.

$18,318 - 5000 grant - 2000 scholarship = 11,318 to cover through AmeriCorps and 529 until I hear from other scholarships"

* As a teen, I worked as a receptionist for a chiropractor and when I left for university she took my job and has been a receptionist from 2009-present. (Though two years ago she left her job, and got the same job for a different chiro.)

Current situation:

I JUST got a professional job (yay! my post about it is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4lr99n/hearing_back_about_a_job_today_nmom_wont_stop/)) and my husband and I are in the process of setting ourselves up for financial stability so that we can move out and not end up having to come back home again. My husband will be doing an HR Management course in the fall, so now he works for a temp agency, and just goes where they tell him. Last week he was working a job that just totally sucked. He called the agency, and they said they have lots of other work so they gave him a few options to place him elsewhere.

Today:

My mom emailed me to ask me if he would be going back to the place he hated, and I said he didn't like it and had requested a new placement. She responded saying:

*Can I be honest without you getting all weird and defensive?*

So I told her that he and I know that he needs to work, and that he's not being picky. If there weren't other placement options he would have stuck with it. As it turns out, the other placements pay better so we're glad he's switching. So if that's what she was going to say, we already know. She wrote back:

*I just feel like I have so much experience and insight to offer but I feel like it offends you if I tell you things.*

I just got SO annoyed! She has virtually no job experience! The two reception jobs she has had in the last ten years didn't require any interviewing or anything because the first chiro was a family friend that I worked for, and she just slid on in there. The second one she met THROUGH the first chiro, and when he had an opening she asked if she could take it and he said yes.

Meanwhile, she's telling me that I should wear leggings to work, that I should ask for multiple days off because she wants to go shopping together, that I should work from home (as an intern?? Yeah right.), and generally telling me how to work in a professional office, even though she hasn't ever done that. For my teen sisters, she tries to force them to wear leggings or frumpy clothes to job interviews, tells them not to listen to anyone's advice but her, and gives them terrible suggestions for how to answer interview questions.

Based on NO job experience – what could she POSSIBLY say?? She is NOT an expert in jobs, office work, temp work, or anything remotely professional. We are being smart with our decisions, so what ""insight and experience"" does she have?? None."
4lvt6m,89,2016-05-31,The pressure of being the breadwinner is weighing down on me heavily. (Warning: long.),UnicornToots,RedditForGrownups,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditForGrownups/comments/4lvt6m/the_pressure_of_being_the_breadwinner_is_weighing/,"I'm the breadwinner in my family - I earn more than double what my husband does. We have a house, a dog, and a baby girl. I've grown quickly in my career, but have slowly been falling out of love with it.

I recently switched jobs to one which has different responsibilities than my past job. For the past 2 months I've been in this position, I've felt incredibly inadequate... and, frankly, downright stupid. It's a small start-up and everybody here is incredibly smart and quick to grasp onto the technology. Although I, too, am an engineer, I feel like I am taking so much longer to learn this than I have been at learning things at my previous jobs. Everybody here seems to be far more intelligent, adaptable, and capable than I do - even the interns and my subordinate (who has been here for only a few months more than I have). I'm almost certain I'm going to get fired within the next few months, at most.

I'm pretty miserable and I'm feeling really down on myself. For a long time (even when I had my last job) I have so desperately wanted to quit my industry altogether and start at the bottom of one that is more fun, more fulfilling, and more ""me"". The issue is the fact that I bring home about 65% of the money into our household.

I ***desperately*** want to be able to leave this job and give up my 6-figure salary for one that pays 1/3 less... but I'm stuck. I can't. It would royally fuck up my family, I'm certain of it. My daughter's daycare is expensive (about half of my husband's salary). We live in an incredibly expensive part of the country (the Boston metro area). My income is so important.

I stupidly wish that my husband and I were switched - that he were the breadwinner and I was the one with the lower salary. I feel like I could justify switching to a lower-paying industry more if it meant only losing out on $10k/year, not $40-70k/year.

I don't want to be the breadwinner, but I am. And I'm stuck.

I've talked to my husband about how I feel about my job, how I'm scared I'm going to get fired, and how I don't enjoy the work. He says that I'm my own worst critic (which is so totally true) and I'm unnecessarily beating myself up about something that is likely not really happening. He says that even if I were to get fired, we'd be fine because I'd just look for another engineering job that would pay close to what I'm making now... but when I tell him I don't even want to do this anymore, he says that it's just the stress talking and that he knows that I've loved this work for a long time. I don't think he believes I could fall out of love with my work, probably because he loves his work so much.

I just don't know what to do. I don't want to fuck up at this job and get fired because it would be a massive blow to my ego. I don't want to quit or get fired because unemployment would pay 1/4 of my salary. I want to completely switch industries, but my family is too financially dependent on me for me to do so.

I'm stuck and I want to get out.

Any words of wisdom, where I should start, how to better talk to my husband about this, stories about switching industries and losing pay... ***anything***... is welcome.

Thanks for reading.

**EDIT** - Wow. I just want to thank each of you, even if I can't individually, for all of the comments. I honestly wasn't expecting anything more than ""I don't get what you're complaining about"", at best. I have a lot of possibilities to ponder, thanks to you guys. I'm home and plan on chatting with my husband about this over dinner. I've already texted him throughout the day, so he knows what's up. I'll be sure to follow up with you in the near future, hopefully with good news. Thanks again. "
4lvt9t,5,2016-05-31,Our first LDR,DareToDiffer34,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/4lvt9t/our_first_ldr/,"My[24/F] SO[23/M] are going through our first long distance relationship this summer. We had been dating for 6 months and now both of us are spending the summer apart due to internships. He is an awesome guy and I love him. However he has never had this initiative of giving gifts or like small surprises which I like a lot (not every single second but you know from time to time) I am his first girlfriend and he is my first formal boyfriend before I met a guy I used to date but we never actually had any type of relationship. Anyways the way things started with us is that we used to spent a lot of time together we were bestfriends and I noticed things changing in our relationship. I started having feelings for him and he would compare himself with some other guys that would flirt with me but then he would pull back saying we were just friends. So I decided to take a time from the friendship and was straight honest to him that I couldn't keep being friends because it was hurting me because he had made clear we could just be friends. So he said he didn't meant it that way and that he was sorry that he hadnt realized his feelings for me. So we decided to give it a go. After that things went pretty well except for him usually forgetting or not considering like giving a nice card or anything for that matter. We had sex and that first time we just woke up and went straight to work on a school project (both of us are finishing our bachelor's) like I was expecting something sweet at least a word since he said he loved me soo much. But nothing, then things happened we had a fight about it and he apologized and he fixed things. He brought me flowers and wrote a really nice card. So I decided to keep trying. Then we had to decide what to do before summer he insisted that he still wanted us to be together.h honestly I wasn't that sure cause I kinda had the feeling that maybe he won't communicate as much or that I would have to be the one to initiate the communication and I wasnt sure I really wanted to go through that again because I really do love him. However we planned to go to a show that I really like a lot before he would leave for his internship. It was suppose to be a weekend for us to spent together. And it was around mother's day too but I was thinking of telling my mother that for this once and because of time conflicts I could just skip that Sundays celebration. But then he calls me and says that he will be leaving the Monday after because his parents wanted to go with him to the internship. I was left speechless. He said he had forgotten and I told him why he didn't plan better when we had that plan a month ago. He said it was mother's day too and then he confessed he was kinda expecting me not being able to go because my mom would want to spent more time with me. He apologized so much that I gave in and I just forgave him. However when his parents arrive he didn't call me the next day after our fight because his mom borrowed his phone the entire morning. I was kinda mad but at the samw time I didn't want to have a fight before he would leave for his internship. So I passed it. Then on Monday he called me saying that they would actually be leaving on Tuesday cause his parents had decided that because of etc reasons and I was pissed cause at the end that was the initial plan all along and we could have spent that weekend together. It didn't matter to me though I was so focused on that I would miss him a lot that I didn't get mad. Then when his internship started I started sending him emojis and texts and good luck wishes like ""show them you are awesome"" ""best of luck"" ""I love you"" "" I miss you"" and he would reply. But then one day I just felt tired of doing that so I stopped slowly and nothing I wouldn't get a similar text like that. Maybe just once. Not even a surprise picture like a simple drawn heart. So we had a fight about it and I almost ended and told him I wanted to just be friends. However after that fight he said he loved me he sent one text with emojis and he draw like a card and sent me a picture of it. So we decided to try again...but I wasn't feeling too much excited about it yet...anyways I tried...but then again...he only sends one text in the morning, another at night...nothing more. I talked to him and told him if even looked up how to keep a LDR what to do what ideas he suggests to do for both of us to share. He is like well we Skype and watch a movie from time to time isn't that enough? (When I was the one to start ""surprising"" him through Skyped like wearing something he likes or sending him pictures he would like) he did that once and I started to think that he did it just because I did it first and I hate that I'm thinking that way but it seems that it is that way. If i don't start something he doesn't do it and if I'm not responsive he just stops. Sometimes I feel like I'm asking him to give me some type of surprise or to put some kind of effort to keep this going but he is always okay with what I give and doesn't fully gives back. And I know relationships don't get measure on how much the other gives but I'm just soo confuse. Now I talked to him again. And told him I can't keep doing this anymore am I mistaken? He said he was sorry and he will try to fix it...but I didn't want to so he said it was okay. And I was left speechless again. He said he respects me so much that he won't try to push me to be with him. I thought he would at least try. Oh he did asked me to keep texting me which he does and he keeps saying I love you and good morning good night. But that's all. We are suppose to be friends now and I just reply and I love you back to not hurt his feelings but I don't even know what to do. This is so exhausting. This weekend he went out with friends and called me cause it was the first time he got drunk and I told him it was okay to feel sick. He said he loved me and thank me for taking care of him through the phone. I think I made the mistake of telling him that I loved him a lot. After that the next day he texted as always just in the morning and once at night which is when he wanted to talk. I thought he was trying to win me back somehow or maybe that's what I wished but it's the same behaviour. So I don't know why he keeps saying that he loves me and that he doesn't want me to go out with other people. I just don't understand him. All I asked from him is a little bit more of ""attention""? Surprise factor? To keep our relationship going, but he doesn't seem to get it. He says he can't do anything from far away. Please help!"
4lw49c,0,2016-05-31,F4M - Celebrity wins hot vacation,[deleted],AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/4lw49c/f4m_celebrity_wins_hot_vacation/,"""By ""raffle"", I won a trip to special vacation resort. This resort is unique because it’s ONLY for couples and no one seems to know much about it, as people who won tickets have to sign nondisclosure agreements. But the rumor is that it’s really great, and most importantly one of the most exclusive in the world. I really want to do that trip, but have nobody to go with, so I ""catch"" you and drag you into it so I can go.

In that resort, a lot of activities are organised for couples. We quickly discover that some are mild, and some aren't at all. Romantic dinners, massage lessons with other couples or just the two of us, sexy cooking lessons, but also more kinky ones. Moreover, some employees can give dares to couples every time they see them, from kiss and grope each other right here (“here” being anywhere from an empty corridor public places)or skinny dipping to have sex in that place without getting caught (or make sure you do get caught by somebody). Each couple can choose anytime between 3 categories and activities and dare at the beginning of the day, but won’t know any details until they start. You can be an employee or a fan, or some rich friend and you have to act like your bf. At the beginning You'd probably kind of shy/nervous because of all of this, hanging out and pretending to be with THAT celeb's boyfriend. On my side I'm having a blast, enjoying myself and keeping us from all the things you'd love to try.

And from here, the scenario can go differen ways depending on what you want to do, your kinks &amp; limits… So let’s discuss it

Do youstart to enjoy yourselfself and we both start to take part is more and more daring activities? Do you figure out that you can take advantage of the situation, start to get more and more touchy every time you can? Trying to get us into the hottest activities, and if I refuse to play along threaten to expose us as a fake couple? Or maybe you start to even blackmail me after getting some serious leverage, and get me to do everything you want.

LOTS of possibilities, with either a young celeb and an older employee, assistant, agent... Or an older one with the new intern or some fan she randomly picked, I'm open to suggestions !

4lwb1e,0,2016-05-31,I'm making $6k/month for the next 6 months. Rate my budget?,SuitGuySmitti,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4lwb1e/im_making_6kmonth_for_the_next_6_months_rate_my/,"So here's the situation, I got two tech internships back to back that pay $6k/month (before taxes), I'm going with corporate housing so I won't be paying rent and I don't have any debt to start paying off (nor any savings). Here is how I'm breaking down my budget.

$3000 - Long term savings (not sure what to put this in, maybe a mutual fund?)

$900 - short term saving (for college/rent when I get back, $5400 after 6 months, I need $4.5k to finish college)

$200 - eating out

$100 - groceries

$300 - shopping/fun money

$1500 - taxes (assuming all of my income is taxable)

Questions:

1. Should I combine short term and long term savings and just withdraw my short term savings when I need them?

2. Are my proportions reasonable? Will I be able to survive on the funds I've given myself.

3. Suggestions for Mutual funds?

4. Is it worth taking a chunk of my long term savings and try my hand at trading? If for nothing but to learn more about it?

Can't think of any more questions. So yeah, let me know what you think!"

But at work all I do is fix computers all day, which means that all I do is basically make a back-up and doing a clean Windows install.

4lwesl,1,2016-05-31,Unsure About My Future,_TapiocaMan_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4lwesl/unsure_about_my_future/,"As a forewarning, this will be a long post, so grab the popcorn. 

First things first, I go to a small school. It's technically a university, but there's a population of maybe 2,500 students. My program (Computer Science) had 5 graduate last year. There's 4 instructors for the entire department. I like to plan ahead, so being me, I'm already planning for my future career even though I still have 1.5 years left. I have most of my upper 300 and 400 classes remaining, but am done with the basics. 

I applied to over 30 internships this summer, and didn't get notified by most of them. I heard back saying I didn't get it from around 5 of them. So currently, I am working a position in PC repair and a position in general IT with two different companies back in my hometown. Not my ideal situation for this summer, but it's working out. However, I constantly stress about where I will end up in the future. It's what's on my mind probably 75% of the day when I'm not occupied with other things. 

My school has no career fair, no large organizations for my field, and definitely no speakers that I could learn from and network with. I've attempted to talk to instructors about possibly helping me find people to talk to about my career, and I mostly either get dead ends or turned away due to their time constraints. It's incredibly frustrating, as that's my only network at this point.

I've worked on one website and custom CMS for a local business, and I've worked on side projects for the IT department at the university, but other than that, I have no significant projects or experience in either software development or web development (however I do have minors in both web development and GIS).

I'm worried and extremely nervous that once I graduate, my degree will be useless. The school I am graduating from will most likely not be recognized by employers, my project base is very small (I have a hard time getting into larger Github projects as I have little experience with large project management), I have very little on paper to set me apart from anyone else, and algorithms/math aren't exactly my strong point. I'm good with analytical and practical thinking, but the logic and theory behind everything is normally still difficult for me to grasp.

If anyone else had similar problems to me, what did you do? How did you end up and are you content with what you currently do? How can I make sure I obtain an internship next summer? I definitely don't want to work in IT Helpdesk positions for the rest of my life. I love web development, I love iOS development, I really enjoy practical applications of what I've learned. I'm just not sure that I will be employable by the time I graduate. 

Edit: For reference, I'm at Lake Superior State University in Michigan, and I'm a senior in Computer Science with minors in Web Development and GIS."

4lwll2,8,2016-05-31,"Done 4 years cooking, now seriously considering culinary school.",theothercobra,KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/4lwll2/done_4_years_cooking_now_seriously_considering/,"I hate my fucking corporate job. I'm the assistant manager of a local grocery store chain's kitchen. We do subs, sandwiches, grill, fried food and fucking dank pizza. We're basically one of the local pizza joints. I get paid well, 4 annual bonus for all employees, a 5th sometimes just because, great health bennies, and upper management loves me. It's the kind of place where if you stick with them for 20-40 years you will be extremely well off in the end. The job should be so easy, but shitty employees, poor communication from upper management and the general stress of direct customer service make the job end up being overly complicated and sometimes feeling like it's damn near impossible to accomplish anything. 

But the money isn't worth it for my sanity. I've worked for this company since I was 17 (now 22). First as a cashier/bagboy then switching the to kitchen when I was 18, leaving to work in a restaurant when I was 19 and coming back to the store when I was 21. I've thought of going to school a bunch of times but have always thought that it wasn't worth it for me to spend money to learn something that I could just as easily learn from working in a restaurant. 

But recently my best friend from high school graduated from university along with many of our other high school classmates and I realized something. A lot of these kids have jobs lined up for them upon graduation through the people that they got to know through their time at university. Professors giving internships to their students, clubs and organizations leaders, knowing someone's father, scholarship programs etc etc. And I thought, ""Why wouldn't it be the same for culinary school?"" I've already got a few years of real restaurant experience under my belt so a formal training could probably help fine tune and build on skills that I already have a foundation of. And it could potentially open a whole bunch of doors that I otherwise wouldn't have access to if I just tried to get a job and work my way up the ranks somewhere. 

I'm only 22 years old right now. I have never had a job where I didn't become one of the go-to people and all of my managers/bosses have only ever had great things to say about me. I'm the hardest worker at my current job, I stay late, come in early, work through breaks, constantly try to do my job better and deal with the daily shitshow of events with a smile on my face about 82% of the time... although I've been handling it worse and worse lately.  

I was already planning on leaving after the new year and go back to cooking at a proper restaurant or maybe a bakery. But my new epiphany about college has had me seriously considering culinary school again. I've even gone as far as emailing an admissions counselor for information. I guess I would just like to know if anyone has been in a similar situation or maybe what someone who went to culinary school thinks about it in hindsight. Any words of advice are greatly appreciated. Cheers!"
4lx5qy,5,2016-05-31,what should I do next?,Calder34,lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/4lx5qy/what_should_i_do_next/,"Hey Reddit,

Never really posted anything, I normally just read the hot page and browse some of the sub Reddits :) anyway today is a bit different, I need some advice and I'll try my best to keep this as short as possible!

So a few years ago I started a software company (I'm a programmer) with my boss from my previous company, this was really great and also really stressful. There were a lot of late nights working on code with very little social interaction but I thought it would be worth it for my future. A couple months later I decided to move out of my parents place and become semi independent, I got a bond and moved into an apartment with an old friend of mine (and his long term girlfriend who seemed to stay over quite a bit! but I didn't mind, my only complaint was that she left a lot of hair lying around the place, anyway off topic..). My friend shared this apartment with me for around 2 years until his girl friend had to go off to do her 2 years of internship at a hospital in a different province (around 1000km away from me). I decide not to get another flatmate which was great in the beginning. It has now been around 7 months since my roomate left and I think I'm finally starting to get a bit lonely.

This idea of loneliness only recently set in because I used to hang out with my friends most of the time but now most of them have gotten into new relationships, or are in long term relationships or getting married. I'm not sure where this leaves me, being quite an awkward guy it's quite hard for me to meet new people let alone even think about getting a girlfriend. I did speak to a psychologist a few months back and he suggested meeting new people by doing something I enjoy, so i joined a running club - which has been great but I haven't made any solid new friends. As for the dating aspect, I went on a few dates from Tinder and okcupid but nothing came of it. Also I'm quite nervous about getting intimate with a girl, I mean I haven't even kissed someone in around 3 years (since starting the company). So basically now I've started to worry if I am ever going to meet someone that I can fall in love with, I see everyone on Facebook with their SO and they all look so happy. I am happy for them (well my friends anyway) but it is very depressing for me, I think about the subject quite a lot (especially since i am turning 27 this year... I feel I should be in a serious relationship by now) and this has affected my sleep patterns (it's very annoying as I love my sleep!) So yeah I'm just not sure what to do next, any advice?


TR;DR: Started a company, spent 3 years working/ being in my comfort zone, now all my friends are in serious relationships/getting married and I'm left alone and asking myself what should I do next?"

Met het aantrekken van de D66 mastodont /u/Mitorr hebben de drie heren gezamenlijk de Liberale Unie opgericht. Dit duidelijke eerbetoon aan Pieter Cort van der Linden en Tak van Poortvliet lijkt alvast een voorproefje op het partijprogramma.**

Eerder deze maand splitsten /u/Vylander en /u/SabasNL zich af van de PVV na wat interne strubbelingen. Volgens partijleider /u/kooienb was de fractiediscipline een terugkerend probleem binnen de PVV. Te vaak waren er interne conflicten en uiteindelijk kwam het tot een laatste waarschuwing voor de twee dissidenten. Op dat moment besloten beide heren om af te splitsen en zonder de PVV verder te gaan.

De twee partijloze kamerleden gingen eerst samen verder als een groepering binnen de Tweede Kamer. De Groep Vylander/SabasNL had verder geen ideologie op het feit dat beide heren liberaal waren na. Samen werd besloten dat ze ideologisch gingen stemmen op stukken in de Staten-Generaal, geen partijpolitiek maar kwaliteitspolitiek. Ondertussen begon het ook te kriebelen, waarom zou dit geen echte partij kunnen zijn? ""Ik wilde verder dan de PVV, verder dan de VVD. Ik wilde iets progressiefs, iets echt liberaals, maar ook iets wat realistisch, doelgericht en nuchter zou zijn. Binnen de huidige politiek kon ik dat niet vinden. Ja, ik heb erover nagedacht om mij weer bij de VVD te voegen maar toch zat het niet lekker."" zei /u/Vylander.

Uiteindelijk kwam de redding in de vorm van de politieke veteraan en voormalig premier /u/Mitorr. De man die ooit de aanvoerder van de Coalitie van Morgen was leek al minder tevreden over de linkse neigingen van zijn partij. ""D66 bevoer een te linkse koers, het werd tijd voor een echt liberaal-progressief geluid in Nederland"" zei hij tegen De Republiek. Kamerlid /u/SabasNL kende /u/Mitorr maar al te goed uit zijn tijd bij D66 en zo vonden de twee elkaar al snel, de motivatie van de D66'er sloot ook perfect aan op de overtuiging van /u/Vylander.

De partij heeft zich de Liberale Unie genoemd in een duidelijke verwijzing naar Pieter Cort van der Linden en Tak van Poortvliet. Twee progressieve liberalen die veel gedaan hebben voor Nederland tijdens de 19e en 20e eeuw. De Liberale Unie zal dan ook hoogstwaarschijnlijk een mix worden van sociaal liberale en klassiek liberale aspecten. Intern zal er wel wat uitgevochten moeten worden, zo zijn de voormalige D66'ers pro-EU maar is /u/Vylander een bekend euroscepticus. Een partijprogramma is er nog niet maar /u/Vylander zei wel dat ""voor verkiezingen een partijprogramma een vereiste is"" wat er wellicht naar hint dat de Liberale Unie ook van plan is deel te nemen aan de aankomende TK-verkiezingen. Voor nu is /u/Vylander partijleider, /u/SabasNL kamerlid en staat /u/Mitorr op de achtergrond, ook gaan er geruchten dat hij zijn zetel in het EU Parlement meeneemt naar de Liberale Unie maar hiervoor konden wij nog geen bevestiging krijgen. Een Senaatszetel zit er voor de heren helaas nog niet in. Bij De Republiek wensen we ze in ieder geval veel succes."

I broke up with my girlfriend with whom I was in an intense relationship for a year and I just can't seem to accept it and move on. I apologize for the wall of text but I feel like I have to explain a bit about our history in order for you guys to understand why it is so hard for me.

Some background info: we met five years ago at work and we immediately got along great with each other. I had liked her (let's call her Amy) and it was obvious she liked me. However back then she was 'only' 18 where I was 21 and it seemed like the biggest age difference, so I decided we should just be friends. Years passed and we stayed friends, mostly chatting in Facebook. I ended up dating a girl from the same work for three years and she would constantly bring up why I'm not dating Amy, since we seem perfect for each other. In fact I had thought about it too but I would just come up with something like 'she feels like a sister to me'.

Then came autumn 2014 and one night I initiated a chat between me and Amy. We hadn't chatted in Facebook probably for six months and turned out she had moved abroad to study natural sciences. From here on we chatted every day and night for the next 4-5 months or so and our relationship started to deepen very quickly. It was as if the fact that she was in another country and not available made it possible for me to just engage in getting to know a person without any expectations.

She came to visit her parents in my town for Christmas. We met for a coffee and from there on the ride ride started - the most intense relationship of my life. We ended up spending the next two days in bed without even getting dressed (almost not even for the pizza delivery guy) and just being in an intense state of symbiosis. She went back abroad a few days from there. 

Both of us were tripping quite badly about each other and our feelings now. We acknowledged it right away and started talking about what we're going to do now. She explained to me that she had made a promise to herself not to get involved with anyone for the time she is living abroad doing under and post-grad. She explained that she wants to keep moving in order to fulfill her dream of becoming an ornithologist. I understood her. I was amazed by her determination and control over her emotions, and also a bit freaked our about how can somebody make such promises. It seemed absurd that someone is able to rationalize their feelings to an extent that they are able to subdue them.

After a couple of months of back to chatting on Facebook again the feelings for each other just kept getting more intense and we agreed to try spend the summer together, as she was coming to spend the summer in her hometown. As summer grew closer she told me that she was so happy to see me and spend time with me, but she was also afraid that she would fall in love with me, because of the long distance and the fact she doesn't know where her career will take her.

Long story short: the summer was spent in total symbiosis and in a perpetual state of love. I know this sounds silly but I had't even dreamed that a person can feel that way. I would compare the feelings to the onset of the drug ecstasy. That's the only time I have felt something similar to what I was feelings constantly with her.  At times she would be sad as she knew she was going away, and I knew that the promise she had made was fighting her inside. Mostly we were able to block that noise and enjoy our summer together.

Came the autumn I had to say goodbye to her again. The next two weeks was hell for us. We would complain to each other in Skype how it feels like nothing is real and the terrible heartache. We decided to break up. After two days we got back together again since neither of us could deal with the fact of not seeing each other again. We agreed to try and make it work long distance and  I traveled to be with her immediately. 

First days seeing her again was bliss, but a week into our trip we started actually to have our first arguments. It was more about me getting angry noticing how she wasn't including me in her future plans. I'm self employed and keen on travelling the world - why not take me with you? She told me she wouldn't be able to live with the fact if I had abandoned my life to be with her. Little did she know that I felt that she was my life. I was constantly stressing about the fact that she had got a great internship but that meant her relocating to another country - even further away. The future seemed like this dark uncertainty that neither of us knew nothing about. We ended up arguing most of my stay there, and I know it was because of me being afraid of losing her.

A month after that we broke up. It felt like we were only cheating ourselves and delaying the inevitable with the long distance thing. It would get into this loop of she being involved with academic studies, and me being frustrated that she wasn't sharing her life with me. In our relationship she had always been the rational one and more contemplative and introverted with feelings where I was the complete opposite. She was always able to move aside negative thoughts and emotion and process them in a way that allowed her to move forward without hesitation. Whereas I'm more slave to my emotions.

It has been six months after we broke up. We stayed in contact after the breakup and tried being friends. Every time I would bring up something about our relationship I wanted to discuss she would always turn into this what I call the 'robot mode' where the way she speaks and writes completely changes. She rationalizes everything into this cold data was seems so harsh to me and would always bring more pain. It was obvious to me that she had already done her job with her emotions. We tried to maintain chatting but she would get more and more distant. This caused me a great deal of pain as she had been a dominant part of my thoughts and feelings for long time. I told her it's for the best that we wouldn't communicate for a while. I got the 'robot' answer for that too. Nothing about how she felt about it, more about what's the nature of such a decision. 

Turns out I couldn't even live without her. After two months I got in contact with her again, more confident that would could be friends as I had dated a couple of girls during those months. We started chatting intensely again and the feelings came back: longing, craving, not wanting to believe it's over and it will never be back. After a while I confessed my feelings to her. I told her that I'm confident that we could make it work, with me relocating. She told me that getting back together would make zero sense as we would be back in the same situation again. To quote her 'a hearbreak waiting to happen'. Even brief moments of potential happiness would ultimately lead to the same situation where both of us suffer.  She told me that I'm important to her and my well being is important to her and she doesn't like to see me suffer. I told her I understand and I cut off all communication to her again, as she did with me also.

At times I'm encountering an intense feeling of anger towards her - how the fuck can you love somebody and not want to share you life and future with her? Why wasn't she able to commit to me? For me it's a no-brainer to want to spent time and make sacrifices for a person I love. I would have made the sacrifice a hundred times if she would've permitted me to. I keep hearing her 'robot mode' words and output and it makes me so friggin' mad. I hate her for not allowing me to love her and allow herself to be loved by me.

I also keep bouncing back to a state where I still hold hope for us being together again and being in that blissful bubble where there's only us. I keep telling myself that it will never happen - it's impossible. Then I get sad, then angry and then longing and craving again - the cycle continues. 

Thank you so much if you read all of this and find the time to share with my an advice or something that might help.

**TL;DR** Broke up with girlfriend due to long distance. We had an intense love relationship, and I can't move on even after months of processing.  I keep bouncing back to the loop of contemplating what went awry and blaming her, being angry and longing and craving. I want it to stop.

She has been in college and recently graduated. She got an internship in my town.

When I heard this news I was very happy, ecstatic actually. We would have a chance to try this out. She came a few months back, she was visiting me and looking at my house. I wanted her to move in to put the relationship to the fire. See if it was for real because she doesn't like my city and if the relationship was working I was willing to move.

She was put off by something, probably a combination of things. My house isn't great( I bought it so I could pay it off quick), I was probably being overbearing too. Everything was fine until she left and then she wasn't very responsive and I didn't handle it well.

 We eventually talked and she was just scared, she decided she wanted her own place and I was supportive, she also told me she would be in my city for awhile and there was no rush.

We were good for a few months and then a couple weeks ago. She wasn't really talking to me, she was freaking out about the move and was not handling it well. When I tried to get her to talk to me, she just got angry saying it wouldn't fix anything and she didn't want to be forced to talk, it was confusing since we had talked just fine for 8 years. I was hurt and it became harder to talk to her.

She then told me she was going to get a cat, I told her jokingly""so you want to break up with me"", I explained I was allergic and it would be hard to come over to her place because of it, she got mad because she has had controlling boyfriends in the past. I got mad because she said ""why do I have to give up on my happiness?"". The conversation didn't go well. 

We ended up making up and I thought that was the end of it. 

3 days ago i fly up to help her drive down. She didn't ask me but I was insistent because I wanted to make it easier on her. We spend the night at a motel since she still shared a place with her ex(she couldn't afford to move after they broke up) I had a problem that she wouldn't let me come with her to finish packing but her ex has anger problems and she wanted to avoid the drama. I understood her point of view and didn't fight her about it. 

She took awhile but we eventually left. 

While we were in the truck she started laughing and saying she had to tell me about something. She then said it wasn't funny(I figured it was nervous laughing). She proceeded to tell me she has two kittens in her car. She told me she didn't like them and was going to get rid of them. I was still mad though because I felt like even though we talked about it, she just did what she wanted with no care for me.

We didn't fight then, she said she didn't want the whole ride fighting. The rest of the day went fine.

The next day. I ended up super upset, sometimes it happens and I didn't want to fight so I was sulking. A few hours passed by before she got fed up with it and we ended up fighting. I find out all she wants is to do what she wants. She explains that because she's had controlling boyfriends she wanted freedom. I'm not controlling though I have my own free due to old relationships. I ended up telling her we should just be friends.

She still wasn't nice. I doubt it because i told her we would just be friends, she had her own plans and I know i wanted the relationship more than her. It was very contentious the rest of the drive. 

We get to my place, she couldn't move in yet until today. We have spouts of fighting and peace, sometimes i got hopeful.

I help her move in today, during part of it I bang up her door, she freaks out, I tell her I can fix it. She yells at me, I tell her to stop jumping down my throat, I'm just trying to help. We finish up unloading the U-Haul and we drop it off. While driving back to her car I tried a last ditch effort to talk things out, she ends up stonewalling me and not talking at all.

I dropped her off at her car and tell her I don't want her to come to mexico with me. I had invited her months ago. It was something with my cousins and I was just miserable around her. I texted her after to tell her to let me know how much repairing the door will be.

I think I was too quick to cut it off but I was miserable idk what else I could have done

   
**tl;dr**: I don't know if it was fixable or not. Girl I've known for a long time was treating me terribly because she was going through a hard time. I was trying to help but she just responded negatively and I pretty much ended the relationship then the friendship with in days"

We had a relationship there (she was my flatmate, among 4 other people) for about 7 months, (between 6 months in Ireland, 1 month in France).

Then, we stayed apart for 2 months, because I came back to Brazil and she came 65 days after.

We always had this very passionate, overattaching relation from both sides, very stick one (not in public, not at the point of make people unconfortable around us), so for us stay togheter, we sick for any possibility, for her to get a visa to live with me in Brazil, or for me to get a visa to live in France.

Thats when all the stress started. The only fucking solution was the marriage. We knew it was too soon, but we tried to look for any other possibility. We really tried. So we decided to get married in France.

Ok, we were going to get married in France, everything set, both of our families excited. But then, she went back to France 1 month and a half ago (middle of April), because her visa expired and I couldn't go with her because my sister was about to give birth to our first baby in the family (I'd finnally be a uncle, awesome).

Everything was going fine until this morning, when she appeared to be feeling a little bit down during our Skype cam call. She started to open up, telling me she wasn't sure about the marriage anymore. And to get worse, my flight is on Saturday (04/06), all my luggage set, all my life left behind in Brazil, to stay with the girl of my dreams.

To clarify, I don't have a specific graduation, so I could or study there, or find a job in the area. Brazilian currency, the real, worth 1/4 of Euro. So to study French, would be a solution, because I could stay there for a year, working part-time, but, we don't have the money. It's very expensive, and it's in Euros.

After she opened up with me, I told her I'd respect any kind of decisions she would make, but didn't want to lose her, and talked about how the marriage thing scares me too, but we have to give a shot so we could stay togheter in Europe, or even in Brazil in the future.

She said she would think about it better, she said that she still loves me the same way before she left, but the marriage is a very complicated and responsible thing to have to worry, with only one year and 3 months of relationship.

Well. I don't know what to do, if she decides not to marry, I'll still go to France, but I need desperately a plan B.




**tl;dr**: fiance wants to give up on marriage, which is the only thing that could keep us togheter, she is French and I'm Brazilian."
