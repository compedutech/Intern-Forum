2kxpj8,6,2014-10-31,Is anyone that works in the oil &amp; gas industry willing to help a student get an internship or co-op?,Hallownthrowaway,houston,https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/2kxpj8/is_anyone_that_works_in_the_oil_gas_industry/,"I'm a mechanical engineering student in a state that doesn't get oil and gas recruiters. I've applied online to almost every place I can think of that offers internships/co-ops. Its just that I know it would be far easier and more successful if I had some connection with someone that worked in industry and could help out.

I'm just interested in learning more about the field and getting experience through an internship or co-op. I would like to try to gain experience in process engineering setting in a refinery(its a long shot considering I'm a ME student, but I've seen a few places offer placements for non CHE majors) or maybe drilling/production(fracking seems very interesting, especially the type of fluids/material they use to do it). But, I am completely open to any opportunities in any location, it doesn't have to be in Houston.

If you'd be willing to help, I can send you my resume via email(its not great to be honest) and we could even talk over the phone if you wanted to. I know this probably isn't the best way to go about this, but just trying to exhaust all possible avenues in order to get a position.


Thanks.

The two I am most interested in are Development and Security. I have really enjoyed all my projects and assignments in my programming classes, but don't really know how that compares to real world dev work. On the security end, I have pretty limited knowledge, but am very interested in the subject, especially in pen testing.

I am currently hunting for dev internships for the summer, so hopefully I will get a taste of that soon, but security work seems harder to come by. How did you decide what you wanted to do for a career?"

Background: lost non-IT job in 2011, attempted to become self-employed in that field but missed licensing by 1 point on the exam. I wanted to be self-employed so that no single person would decide if I have income, besides myself. Live and die by my own means, you know? 

Went back to school for IT instead.

So I'm about to get my BSIT, I have a CCNA, MCSA and a good internship under my belt.

I find that, as I get shot down by employers or given the runaround by recruiters, the urge to be self-employed is coming back. 

**With my qualifications, what (if any) prospects are there for becoming self-employed in IT?** PC repair would be acceptable except the profitability seems poor. I'm really sick of dealing with hiring/firing, recruiters, and that nonsense.

Ideas?"

You're outspoken on gender issues, you hold a chair at several senate committees related to women's issues. You have a staff team full of male employees, so you're used to men taking orders from you. Even your own husband has a tendency to buckle when confronting you.

But there's one man who doesn't buckle when facing. Quite the opposite, in fact. He's the most unlikely one, a fresh new intern at your office headquarters, so new that he's still tasked with fetching coffee for his seniors. He's so unremarkable that most people who pass through probably don't even notice him.

But he's the only one you will cave for. How many times have you let him fuck you after everyone else had gone home? How many nasty, demeaning names have you let him call you? You stopped giving blowjobs to your own husband after a while because it felt too demeaning, but you'll drop to your knees for him and swallow every last drop he gives you.

And he knows that no matter how many times you swear to yourself that last night was the last time, that it's simply too dangerous to your political career to have an affair with an intern, let alone one where you're so blatantly submissive, you'll be on your knees again.

I moved to the big smoke and found work as an office manager/administrator in an American startup where I have been working for four months. Although I really enjoyed my degree I think I lack the academic ability as well as the desire to study it further or begin a career in academia.


I'm good at my job - I can second guess peoples needs and problems and have the solution ready for them when they need it and I am good at keeping on top of multiple things at once (I'm an avid list maker). However whenever people come into the office they expect me to be an intern rather than a full time staff, just by the work I do. We recently had  the head of HR fly in from the states for business and we had a meeting where she told me about where my career can lead (they seem very willing to keep me on long term and give me these opportunities for growth) however they seem fantastically boring and I'd like to achieve more from my career than just what they were offering (basically adapting my role into HR).

I'm happy to spend the time and money training and learning and starting from the bottom if its something I know I want to do and I don't want to find myself stuck doing the same thing for the rest of my life.

I know that in there twenties people do a lot of rubbish jobs but I'd really like to achieve more. Speaking with a friend she offered the solution that I should produce a list of things I'm good at and want from my work, so here's mine:

* I would prefer something with a more structured 9-5 M-F schedule, although I am happy to put the time in to complete the work. I definitely don't want shift work.
* I would like something where there is always an opportunity to grow, i.e. promotions or opportunities to advance, as I work well when I'm working towards a goal. 
* I'm not particularly money focussed (as long as I have enough to eat and pay rent)
* I find great satisfaction in doing a really good job and exceeding expectations.
* I don't like doing repetitive work. Although I know its expected to a certain extent I'd like minimal repetitiveness.
* I have been told I have a great eye for design (and I enjoy it) but I'm not very good at drawing. 
* I enjoy organising and being the one who knows all the answers.
* I enjoy projects - working really hard towards a final product and putting your heart and soul into it feels really good.
* I'd like to work in a team of people. Having friends and people to joke with at work really motivate me and keep me positive when I'm working.
* I reasonably good with computers (front-end, not back-end) and can quickly learn how to use new software and figure out problems.
* I don't have much experience of managing others and can sometimes struggling to be stern/authoritative. This is something I'm trying to improve.

I'm sure there are other things but I don't want to present a wall of text (although this already is one). I'd really love some advice or help about where I can take my career as I want to achieve great things. I just don't know where to even begin."

2kyzj5,2,2014-11-01,I completely screwed up my college education because I had medical and mental health issues and was too scared to ask for help.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2kyzj5/i_completely_screwed_up_my_college_education/,"I don't know how I possibly graduated on time. I had a wonderful first semester.  Everything after that was a foggy and confusing blur.

At some point I began to have medical issues. I didn't know who to tell, and that made me feel extremely alone and helpless.  The medical issues were also affecting my mental health.my advisers always seem to want to just get my classes sorted out and get me out the door, I didn't think my professors would care, and I didn't have any friends.  it seems like nobody was in my corner.I was unable to eat most of the food in the cafeteria due to dietary restrictions related to the medical issue, and because my parents didn't understand why I couldn't just walk up to the administrators and tell him what was going on, they became really upset with me.

Part of the problem was that I simply didn't understand how any of this work. My high school counselors had called me into their office one time when I was a senior to discuss what I was going to do with my future, and when I told him which college I planned  to go to they basically told me to quit wasting their time and shooed me out the door.  I didn't understand that it was because I had selected a fairly high-end University. I found out later that they had at some point contacted my mother and asked her ifshe was open to having me put in a GED program. I still don't know why. I was in all AP classes, wasn't getting in trouble, really mostly kept to myself.I had friends. They weren't exactly the smartest people in the world, but they were the people who were willing to hang out with me, so I hung out with them.

Anyway in college I didn't know that I could talk to professors. Sure, they started every semester by saying that they had an open door policy or office hours or whatever, and everybody was encouraged to go see the professors, but for whatever reason I figured that didn't apply to me because really, who would waste their time on me?I had horrible horrible anxiety about everything and I didn't even know what anxiety really was in this context, much less how to deal with it.

Matters were compounded when I decided it was time to start working and living in my own apartment. My father made it very clear he was no longer willing to pay for me to live in a dorm, and I had no idea what else to do. I spent many hoursthat I should have been spending on school, working extra hours so that I could pay my bills. My grades obviously suffered.I began having serious nutrition issues and my medical issue was made worse at this time. It wasn't so much that I didn't know how to take care of myself, so much as it felt like I wasn't allowed to because everything else is more important. Paying bills seemed more important than taking care of myself.  I was officially overwhelmed and had absolutely nobody to turn to. The few people at the school I sought help from couldn't understand why I didn't just focus on school, but I didn't know how I was going to pay to live.I even tried speaking with the school counselor, but got absolutely nothing out of it. I think I actually left the office crying because her answer was to borrow a phrase, pull myself up by my bootstraps, pray harder, and God would give me what I needed.well, I have lost my faith or whatever it was before eighth grade even, so I was even more frustrated by that.

Anyway, I don't know how I did it, but somehow I muddled through and graduated on time. I switched majors three times, all completely widely varying different majors.I absolutely regret that I was not able to be a better student because some of my professors were really amazing, but I could not find it in myself to explain to them why I seemed so so interested in class, but just could not produce the good grades.somewhere around my sophomore year I simply stop to being able to read textbooks without having anxiety attacks. At the time I didn't know what they were, but now I do.I basically ended up learning as much as I could from the Internet and just trying to squeak by.

The very last semester that I was in school, I had an academic adviser who was in charge of my internship. I had to turn in the paper talking about what I learned. I didn't think it was anything special, but he smacked himself on the four head and said out loud while earth did I not figure this out before, you're a wonderful writer.but by then it was too late. I was already about to graduate. Just barely.

I guess kind of the point of talking about this now is that if I was able to get the grades that I didn't graduate under the circumstances I was there, I have to wonder how great I would do now that I know how to deal with that medical issue and the resulting mental health issues.The medical issue that I have is now a little more well-known, definitely not embarrassing, and could have been a great source of personal strength had I known how to use it. Instead I just felt like I was completely alone and that nobody wanted me around and nobody wanted me to succeed. I honestly felt like the world would have been better off without me. At least that's how everybody around me acted. I was a burden.

Things are incredibly different now. I really wish I could have a do over, or at least go back and talk to some of my professors and explain what happened."

I did use the search function, read a few relevant threads, but am looking for up to the minute input as well.

I am at the end of my recruiting season and am in the enviable but still difficult decision of juggling between a handful of offers. I am a candidate for full time audit and I have never done an internship. I have offers from National firms as well as big 4. I am not sure which Big 4 I would take (leaning towards Deloitte) and I have landed squarely on Moss Adams as my alternative to Big 4.

Im in the San Francisco area. Commute is a component of my decision. MA is an office outside the city with parking, Big4 is all downtown with long public transit commutes.

Also... I know that 90% of people say ""Judge on the culture and the people you met"" but I have a tough time with that advice because the cultures are fairly interchangeable and the people I met were ALL nice because they were selling the firm to me (and I was nice because I was selling myself to them) so it's hard to predict if the social dynamics will be the same when the tire meets the road.

**The questions I am MOST interested in having answered are:**

1) Moss Adams is advertising a better work/life balance than Big 4, should I count on this promise being fulfilled?

2) I'd imagine I can always go down to Moss Adams (or a comparable firm) from Big 4, is it possible to go in reverse?

3) Do people find the mid-tier firms to be easier or harder work with than big 4 and why? (fe: harder due to less training, easier due to smaller clients, etc etc)

4) In what ways am I limiting myself by going Moss Adams over Big4?

...but ANY input is extremely appreciated."

So I'll try and keep this as short as possible. I'm in the final year of my 4 year honours degree in game development. During our 3rd year we had a 6 month period where we went on an internship / paid placement. For my placement I worked for a very large computer company as a software engineer. The reason I chose to work there was to get experience in a different field as well as to have a big name on my CV.

I got on very well at my placement and the opportunity for a job there when I finish is reasonable high I would say. So where my dilemma lies, is if I were to be offered a job there out of college I would find it very difficult to turn down as it would pay well and would mean I could go straight from college into industry, but my problem is I really want to experience working in the game industry.

So my question is, if I took a job out of college for a couple years as a software engineer would it hurt my future opportunities to move to  a game development company and as a result does that mean I would have a better chance to join a game company straight from college?

Any advice would be really appreciated!"

My wife feels it is time to end the naps but, because she often gets home at 7pm, she doesn't want to put my daughter to bed any earlier. My wife wants to see her, have us all have dinner together, etc. 

On the days my wife has my daughter, there are no naps and my daughter is cranky by evening. But my daughter still goes to bed at 8pm at the earliest, so no real benefit in terms of having extra time in the evening. 

The two hour nap period is when I get a good chunk of business work done. I realize the naps will end some day and when they do a big chunk of work time will go away with them.  I was wondering if anyone has any advice concerning how to deal with this transition.

Some of my friends have suggested just putting my daughter in front of a DVD but I feel this is unhealthy and I am unwilling to do it. On the other hand, with the nap gone, I am looking at entertaining her for 4 hours, which I'm not that well prepared for. She can play for short periods alone but needs a good deal of supervision, which of course is age appropriate. 

Thanks in advance for any insights. 

EDIT: just to clarify, I believe my wife thinks that, since my daughter can make it through the day without naps, there is less need for them. This works well for my wife because she likes to pack their day with activities. Also, she feels that when my daughter naps she (my daughter) has to go to bed later. We disagree on this and I am committed to continuing the naps on my days until my daughter no longer wants one. I like to nap when she is napping on occasion, which is supported by research like this study: Arch Intern Med. 2007;167:296-301

Also, thanks very much for the suggestions on what to do when (eventually) my daughter stops napping so I can better prepare for that eventuality. "

2l14j6,38,2014-11-01,I'm [23 M] realizing my sister [25 F] could be a compulsive liar after she cried about something that hadn't even happened. How do I approach this issue with her?,Glassfeet8,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2l14j6/im_23_m_realizing_my_sister_25_f_could_be_a/,"Hi guys. First off, thanks so much for taking the time to read this.

So we both live with our parents currently. She goes to grad school just 30 minutes away so it's convenient and cheaper for her living at home, and I am currently in a gap year before starting grad school this upcoming fall. Anyway, getting into the story: I finished the day at my internship, which is in the city where my sister goes to school. She came to pick me up as she was on the way home. A few minutes into the ride, she said, ""so Henry and Chelsea [our cousin and his wife] called, and they called me Dr. ass-weenie.""

Immediately, I knew I was going to get destroyed. My sisters name, unfortunately, sounds like ""ass-weenie"" if you're a 5 year old. As a child, she was bullied with this nickname, and so she hates it. One night when we were all having a sleepover with a lot of family friends way back when I was 16-17, I brought up the nickname because we were all talking about how kids changed our names to tease. My sister was sleeping but I still knew I had made a mistake immediately after I said it. Our friends unfortunately loved the nickname, and despite promising not to say to her when she woke up, that's exactly what they did. She got upset, they had to apologize, I apologized profusely, but that has hung over me ever since. Any time someone mentions the name, I get destroyed by her and have to apologize again. I agree I made a mistake mentioning the name, and despite the nickname being silly I know sometimes silly things like this cut deep when they are related to childhood bullying, so I've never tried to tell her to just get past it or anything like that.

That brings us back to the car ride. She tells me they mentioned it, and I said sorry. All of a sudden, she starts crying while driving, and says, ""aren't you even sorry?! [I guess she hadn't heard me]"". I tell her I was, I had just said so, and felt terrible. She got calmer and said, ""and don't bring it up to Henry and Chelsea, it'll just make it worse"". I agreed, but I planned on bringing it up in a text anyway because I saw no other way to keep them from mentioning it again in the future. I'm glad I did, because I learned that it was all made up.

That's right. My plan was to send the text, then go to CVS and get a card and write a heartfelt apology. That was derailed because almost immediately after sending the text, both Henry and Chelsea said sorry, but they hadn't spoken to my sister in months.

I felt like I was going crazy. I asked my sister if she had spoken to Henry and Chelsea today. She said yes. I asked if she was sure, and she got started getting frustrated, saying of course. I told her Henry said he didn't speak with her today. She said something about the phone sound being off, which clearly didn't make sense. When she asked me why I cared, I said, ""because someone in my family is lying to me and I want to know who and why"". That's when the truth came out.

She says Henry and Chelsea had said this comment 6 months ago. I was studying for my grad school entrance exam, so she was advised by my mom to not bring it up right then, and to wait. One of our other friends had just mentioned it on the day she picked me up, not actually saying it, and so my sister was reminded. That's right, she held on to this for 6 months, and brought it up in a flurry of tears and lies. Nothing had happened the day she picked me up. Beyond the embarrassment involved with Henry and Chelsea, I was absolutely incensed she would lie so casually. I also think the reason she brought up Henry and Chelsea rather than her friend is so I would be more hurt because I look up to both of them heavily.

I got upset, she apologized profusely. As I said, I have paid dearly for mentioning this nickname and have apologized every time, but the fact that she made up something to get ANOTHER apology, and to hurt me again with it, it's just too much, right? More importantly, she called this a ""white lie"" that she didn't think would be a big deal. That's really stuck with me. How many other ""white lies"" does my sister tell that I haven't caught her out on? As I thought about it, I realized my sister has lied a LOT about a lot of serious things. She had lied to her friends saying our father owned a gun. The friend brought it up when I was around, and I said our dad clearly didn't have a gun. My sister explained it away saying, ""oh, I thought for sure he did!"". There's no way she thought that, my father has never mentioned owning a gun in his life. Also, last night one of her friends said to me at a halloween party, ""Oh man, your sister told us the story of you being roofied by gay guys!"". That has never happened. There was one night where a gay guy invited me to his table at a club, which is likely the story she was referencing, but she had obviously embellished a great amount. These are just a few examples but this has been happening for years, where someone will mention something to me that my sister said happened that I know didn't. It's so common that sometimes I'll save her the embarrassment and just go along with it (I'm realizing now how this enabled her compulsion).

All these lies and embellishments are really messing with my mind. I have no idea how to approach her and discuss this, but the reality is that I don't really feel I can trust her recanting anything that I wasn't there to witness myself. How best can I approach this issue with her, and how can I repair my relationship with my sister?


---   
**tl;dr**: My sister cried and made me apologize for something I had done and apologized for years ago, using a completely fabricated story. This made me realize she lies often, likely more often than I even know, and I need help figuring out how to proceed.

Of course, there were 6 or 7 people on the back porch passing around a blunt.  I smelled it, went out there to say hi, and I stood in the circle for a few minutes.  The smell was so tempting, I almost couldn't keep myself away from that circle... as they passed it around, 4 people ahead of me, then 3, then 2...

And then I thought about how much I smoked this summer, and how it totally ruined my internship and a very huge software engineering opportunity... And how I didn't get the job because I decided to smoke almost every morning and go into work either high or late, or both, and it started to show in my work, and I started missing important meetings....  All because I couldn't control myself.  When I didn't get the job and I went back to school, I decided I was done with weed for good.... But all of that was about to potentially come undone just because at this party, there was a blunt passed around, and it smelled so good... Just one hit couldn't hurt, right?

And then it was my turn, and the dude next to me was holding this blunt in front of me, burning strong...

It took a monumental amount of effort for me to raise my palm and say ""no thanks"".. and as he passed it to the next guy, right in front of me... A huge surge of relief washed over me..  I had to get out of there.

Didn't go back to the porch all night, and I'm very proud.  At the same time I'm ashamed at how hard I had to push myself to stay away... It wasn't easy.  I thought about going back for the rest of the party.

It's hard.  I'm so tired of the temptation."

we'll call the male in this scenario H. H and i had been dating since april - at which time we lived about 2 hours apart, as he was home for the summer from school. in may, however, he went out of country for an internship for three months. during that time, we talked fairly often, bonding a lot and generally getting a strong like for one another.

he came home in august, and we saw each other for about four days. it was great - it was so nice to see him again, and in both september and october we saw each other over one weekend (each month). we're both really busy right now - him with school, and me with work/classes, so one weekend is all we could afford.

i knew he had some qualms about committing to a long distance relationship - he has mentioned that he had one go sour before, and is therefore uneasy about them. i understood, and only once asked him where he was at in regards to considering us committing. he said that he didn't want to rush, but that he wasn't going to make me wait another six months. i haven't asked him about it since.

H would often make references to us in the future - over the summer he had mentioned that he could see us being together in a year/2 years, while visiting me two weeks ago he told me about how it would be nice that he was staying in his current city for his winter job, so it would be easy to see one another. (for reference, as well: in the spring i'm moving to the city that he lives in when not in school, and which he'll likely live in when done school.)

during our last trip, H also was very affectionate, as he usually is - he told me how he liked me a ""humongous amount"", joked around with me, was almost constantly telling me how into me he was, how attractive i was, and nothing really seemed all that off. the same weekend, though, as he was staying at my house, he met my parents, which i think freaked him out.

we haven't talked much since our last trip - we've both been really busy, and his first week back he had midterms to worry about, and i didn't want to bother him. i'm also just not always great at initiating conversation, as it can sometimes make me feel like i'm a bother or something, so i just backed off a little.

on thursday, he messaged me to ask if i would be able to skype this weekend. i pretty much immediately knew what was coming. when we skyped, he said that we just didn't have enough in common, didn't have enough things to talk about, and that we just weren't working out. but here's the thing: none of those have ever been brought up with me before - he's never mentioned any of them as being an issue. i don't understand how there could be such a huge switch in his thinking/feelings in the span of (less than) two weeks?

should i try talking to him in a few weeks, and see what's going on? or leave it, although i'm still confused? i like him a lot still, but really don't want to be clingy or freak him out. help me pls

also for reference: i do have social anxiety disorder, which sometimes makes it difficult for me to initiate conversation all the time"
2l22l9,2,2014-11-02,I'm a recent graduate working in an office - how can I move my career on from administration?,gamesqueen,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2l22l9/im_a_recent_graduate_working_in_an_office_how_can/,"I am 21/F who graduated in July with a reasonably good degree in Biological Anthropology. I moved to the big smoke and found work as an office manager/administrator in an American startup where I have been working for four months. Although I really enjoyed my degree I think I lack the academic ability as well as the desire to study it further or begin a career in academia.

 
I'm good at my job - I can second guess peoples needs and problems and have the solution ready for them when they need it and I am good at keeping on top of multiple things at once (I'm an avid list maker). However whenever people come into the office they expect me to be an intern rather than a full time staff, just by the work I do. We recently had the head of HR fly in from the states for business and we had a meeting where she told me about where my career can lead (they seem very willing to keep me on long term and give me these opportunities for growth) however they seem fantastically boring and I'd like to achieve more from my career than just what they were offering (basically adapting my role into HR).

I'm happy to spend the time and money training and learning and starting from the bottom if its something I know I want to do and I don't want to find myself stuck doing the same thing for the rest of my life.
I know that in there twenties people do a lot of rubbish jobs but I'd really like to achieve more. Speaking with a friend she offered the solution that I should produce a list of things I'm good at and want from my work, so here's mine:

* I would prefer something with a more structured 9-5 M-F schedule, although I am happy to put the time in to complete the work. I definitely don't want shift work.
* I would like something where there is always an opportunity to grow, i.e. promotions or opportunities to advance, as I work well when I'm working towards a goal.
* I'm not particularly money focussed (as long as I have enough to eat and pay rent)
* I find great satisfaction in doing a really good job and exceeding expectations.
* I don't like doing repetitive work. Although I know its expected to a certain extent I'd like minimal repetitiveness.
* I have been told I have a great eye for design (and I enjoy it) but I'm not very good at drawing.
* I enjoy organising and being the one who knows all the answers.
* I enjoy projects - working really hard towards a final product and putting your heart and soul into it feels really good.
* I'd like to work in a team of people. Having friends and people to joke with at work really motivate me and keep me positive when I'm working.
* I reasonably good with computers (front-end, not back-end) and can quickly learn how to use new software and figure out problems.
* I don't have much experience of managing others and can sometimes struggling to be stern/authoritative. This is something I'm trying to improve.

I'm sure there are other things but I don't want to present a wall of text (although this already is one). I'd really love some advice or help about where I can take my career as I want to achieve great things. I just don't know where to even begin."
2l26kh,70,2014-11-02,Umbridge's backstory | Brand new writing by J.K. Rowling for Order of the Phoenix (from Pottermore),[deleted],harrypotter,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/2l26kh/umbridges_backstory_brand_new_writing_by_jk/,"**The story of Dolores Jane Umbridge**

Dolores Jane Umbridge was the eldest child and only daughter of Orford Umbridge, a wizard, and Ellen Cracknell, a Muggle, who also had a Squib son. Dolores’ parents were unhappily married, and Dolores secretly despised both of them: Orford for his lack of ambition (he had never been promoted, and worked in the Department of Magical Maintenance at the Ministry of Magic), and her mother, Ellen, for her flightiness, untidiness, and Muggle lineage. Both Orford and his daughter blamed Ellen for Dolores's brother's lack of magical ability, with the result that when Dolores was fifteen, the family split down the middle, Orford and Dolores remaining together, and Ellen vanishing back into the Muggle world with her son. Dolores never saw her mother or brother again, never spoke of either of them, and henceforth pretended to all she met that she was a pure-blood.

An accomplished witch, Dolores joined the Ministry of Magic directly after she left Hogwarts, taking a job as a lowly intern in the Improper Use of Magic Office. Even at seventeen, Dolores was judgemental, prejudiced and sadistic, although her conscientious attitude, her saccharine manner towards her superiors, and the ruthlessness and stealth with which she took credit for other people's work soon gained her advancement. Before she was thirty, Dolores had been promoted to Head of the office, and it was but a short step from there to ever more senior positions in the management of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. By this time, she had persuaded her father to take early retirement, and by making him a small financial allowance, she ensured that he dropped quietly out of sight. Whenever she was asked (usually by workmates who did not like her) 'are you related to that Umbridge who used to mop the floors here?' she would smile her sweetest, laugh, and deny any connection whatsoever, claiming that her deceased father had been a distinguished member of the Wizengamot. Nasty things tended to happen to people who asked about Orford, or anything that Dolores did not like talking about, and people who wanted to remain on her good side pretended to believe her version of her ancestry.

In spite of her best efforts to secure the affections of one of her superiors (she never cared particularly which of them it was, but knew that her own status and security would be advanced with a powerful husband), Dolores never succeeded in marrying. While they valued her hard work and ambition, those who got to know her best found it difficult to like her very much. After a glass of sweet sherry, Dolores was always prone to spout very uncharitable views, and even those who were anti-Muggle found themselves shocked by some of Dolores's suggestions, behind closed doors, of the treatment that the non-magical community deserved.

As she grew older and harder, and rose higher within the Ministry, Dolores's taste in little girlish accessories grew more and more pronounced; her office became a place of frills and furbelows, and she liked anything decorated with kittens (though found the real thing inconveniently messy). As the Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge became increasingly anxious and paranoid that Albus Dumbledore had ambitions to supersede him, Dolores managed to claw her way to the very heart of power, by stoking both Fudge's vanity and his fears, and presenting herself as one of the few he could trust. 

Dolores's appointment as Inquisitor at Hogwarts gave full scope, for the first time in her life, for her prejudices and her cruelty. She had not enjoyed her time at school, where she had been overlooked for all positions of responsibility, and she relished the chance to return and wield power over those who had not (as she saw it) given her her due.

Dolores has what amounts to a phobia of beings that are not quite, or wholly, human. Her distaste for the half-giant Hagrid, and her terror of centaurs, reveal a terror of the unknown and the wild. She is an immensely controlling person, and all who challenge her authority and world-view must, in her opinion, be punished. She actively enjoys subjugating and humiliating others, and except in their declared allegiances, there is little to choose between her and Bellatrix Lestrange.

Dolores's time at Hogwarts ended disastrously, because she overreached the remit Fudge had given her, stepping outside the bounds of her own authority, carried away with a fanatical sense of self-purpose. Shaken but unrepentant after a catastrophic end to her Hogwarts career, she returned to a Ministry, which had been plunged into turmoil due to the return of Lord Voldemort. 

In the change of regimes that followed Fudge's forced resignation, Dolores was able to slip back into her former position at the Ministry. The new Minister, Rufus Scrimgeour, had more immediate problems pressing in on him than Dolores Umbridge. Scrimgeour was later punished for this oversight, because the fact that the Ministry had never punished Dolores for her many abuses of power seemed to Harry Potter to reveal both its complacency and its carelessness. Harry considered Dolores's continuing employment, and the lack of any repercussions for her behaviour at Hogwarts, a sign of the Ministry's essential corruption, and refused to cooperate with the new Minister because of it (Dolores is the only person, other than Lord Voldemort, to leave a permanent physical scar on Harry, having forced him to cut the words 'I must not tell lies' on the back of his own hand during detention).

Dolores was soon enjoying life at the Ministry more than ever. When the Ministry was taken over by the puppet Minister Pius Thicknesse, and infiltrated by the Dark Lord's followers, Dolores was in her true element at last. Correctly judged, by senior Death Eaters, to have much more in common with them than she ever had with Albus Dumbledore, she not only retained her post but was given extra authority, becoming Head of the Muggle-born Registration Commission, which was in effect a kangaroo court that imprisoned all Muggle-borns on the basis that they had ‘stolen’ their wands and their magic.

It was as she sat in judgement of another innocent woman that Harry Potter finally attacked Dolores in the very heart of the Ministry, and stole from her the Horcrux she had unwittingly been wearing. 

With the fall of Lord Voldemort, Dolores Umbridge was put on trial for her enthusiastic co-operation with his regime, and convicted of the torture, imprisonment and deaths of several people (some of the innocent Muggle-borns she sentenced to Azkaban did not survive their ordeal).

**J.K. Rowling's thoughts on Dolores Jane Umbridge**

Once, long ago, I took instruction in a certain skill or subject (I am being vague as vague can be, for reasons that are about to become obvious), and in doing so, came into contact with a teacher or instructor whom I disliked intensely on sight. 

The woman in question returned my antipathy with interest. Why we took against each other so instantly, heartily and (on my side, at least) irrationally, I honestly cannot say. What sticks in my mind is her pronounced taste for twee accessories. I particularly recall a tiny little plastic bow slide, pale lemon in colour that she wore in her short curly hair. I used to stare at that little slide, which would have been appropriate to a girl of three, as though it was some kind of repellent physical growth. She was quite a stocky woman, and not in the first flush of youth, and her tendency to wear frills where (I felt) frills had no business to be, and to carry undersized handbags, again as though they had been borrowed from a child's dressing-up box, jarred, I felt, with a personality that I found the reverse of sweet, innocent and ingenuous. 

I am always a little wary when talking about these kinds of sources of inspiration, because it is infuriating to hear yourself misinterpreted in ways that can cause other people a great deal of hurt. This woman was NOT 'the real Dolores Umbridge'. She did not look like a toad, she was never sadistic or vicious to me or anyone else, and I never heard her express a single view in common with Umbridge (indeed, I never knew her well enough to know much about her views or preferences, which makes my dislike of her even less justifiable). However, it is true to say that I borrowed from her, then grossly exaggerated, a taste for the sickly sweet and girlish in dress, and it was that tiny little pale lemon plastic bow that I was remembering when I perched the fly-like ornament on Dolores Umbridge's head.

I have noticed more than once in life that a taste for the ineffably twee can go hand-in-hand with a distinctly uncharitable outlook on the world. I once shared an office with a woman who had covered the wall space behind her desk with pictures of fluffy kitties; she was the most bigoted, spiteful champion of the death penalty with whom it has ever been my misfortune to share a kettle. A love of all things saccharine often seems present where there is a lack of real warmth or charity. 

So Dolores, who is one of the characters for whom I feel purest dislike, became an amalgam of traits taken from these, and a variety of sources. Her desire to control, to punish and to inflict pain, all in the name of law and order, are, I think, every bit as reprehensible as Lord Voldemort's unvarnished espousal of evil. 

Umbridge's names were carefully chosen. 'Dolores' means sorrow, something she undoubtedly inflicts on all around her. 'Umbridge' is a play on 'umbrage' from the British expression 'to take umbrage', meaning offence. Dolores is offended by any challenge to her limited world-view; I felt her surname conveyed the pettiness and rigidity of her character. It is harder to explain 'Jane'; it simply felt rather smug and neat between her other two names."

After first few weeks of getting used I was (still am) thriving in my internship position. I constantly jump between backend to frontend and get my stuffs done quickly. Helped introduced many new tools, frameworks and even languages (Node.JS) etc into that company and everybody loves me and want me to work there after I graduate. They've already raised my salary twice. And the best thing is I don't have to make an effort. I did had to make effort in my freshman year when I was learning Java, C#, Node, Javascript, HTML, Linux Deployment etc but now with 3/4 big Web App in my portfolio and two big internships. I'm really well set to be an web developer and I can see my perspective in this company or similar companies in Texas or other similar states. I recently got into mobile development with iOS and Android and I'm also doing really great in this side project and making progress swiftly(get the pun?). And I think I can be such good mobile developer too. 

However, the dilemma I've is that I have one year left to graduate (two semesters and one summer), should I keep doing in this path of web developer and mobile developer ( which is my comfort zone) or spent this one year on data structure, algorithms, github building, oss contribution and interview question mastery to get into Big Four companies? 
While focussing on web dev and mobile dev, I've neglected my core cs courses such as data structures, algorithms, automata etc. and I think I'm weak at those. Is it really wise decision to spent one year mastering and preping with data structures, algorithms and github to get into Big Four or I should stop about that get better at web dev and mobile dev?

Like in my freshman/sophomore years when I decided web dev is for me, I don't know what to do and I'm at this crossroad.

When I returned I found out that two out of three other students (one a 3rd year PhD student) in the group went back to their home countries. My advisor made excuses that they just weren't working quickly enough and gave up. I took over part of what one of them was doing and found out that some published papers have incorrect numbers. When I dug into this I found out that the Prof. was telling the researcher to measure a key width by holding it up to lines on a paper and estimating how close it was. This width was already just a few cm so the errors made a big difference. I told the Prof. about the error and he kind of blew it off and once again blamed the work ethic of the guy who left. To top it all off, he is currently non-tenure and should have an evaluation in the next couple years and if they know about all this, I don't think he will pass. 


To those who have done something like this before, what is the most correct way to go about switching? Do I talk to the department head and voice my concerns about the incorrect numbers in the published papers? If I want to keep doing the same topic I will likely have to switch departments so should I go directly to one of their professors and ask him if I can join his group? I don't want to harm the remaining student or even the Prof. with how I go about this but is there anyway to keep that from happening?"

I just never figured it out.  I still reminisce while taking walks with my son what it would be like to suddenly levitate, then propel myself into the clouds on a beautiful day.  

**We can experience this today...***

I'm not talking about doing this in Unity or Unreal Engine.  I'm talking a true, CG animated, flying through the clouds.  Like How to Train your Dragon or Chronicle (2012).  Just me and the clouds, the wind in my ears, flying.

Make it 360 degrees, true 3D.  I know real life cameras this is impossible (for now), but for CG, why not?  Using players like MaxVR, or LiveViewRift, give us an high qualify MKV that we can replay over and over.

**I would totally kickstart this.**  You need funds?  I'm sure I'm not the only one.

Those shorts you do before the feature film?  Maybe this can be one, or possibly even great exercise for some of your interns.  You can make this happen!

Please give this 30 year old dude his childhood dream of flying in the clouds.  I can't be the only one whose bucket list would be fulfilled by something like this!"

 As expected it does not put the focus on any one language though c++ has 3 associated classes that are required. 

I am currently working on 2 android apps. One with a group and one solo. Apart from this I do not have any experience I can put on paper as a developer. 

 I am currently in a .net class and find it enjoyable so i'm considering putting time into .net, and maybe xml and ASP or ADO.

Would it be worth it to get the Microsoft cert for C# and maybe even MCSD? or are certs not worth it anymore?

Here are my details:  
    I am a college student graduating in May 2015.  
    I have accepted a full-time job with salary of **$75,000/yr** and will begin in June 2015 after my graduation   
    **Savings:** $19,500 in money-market savings account  
    **Checking:** $750 in checking/cash  
    **Student Credit Card** (used for gas/groceries)   
    **(Current credit score of 751)**  
    **No Debt/Loans**  
    **Current Rent:** $600/month  
    **Monthly budget** (food+gas+entertainment+misc): $600/month  
    **Current Income** (scholarships+part-time employment): $1400/month  
  

  
  
  
**Expected Future Expenses:**  
    $6000 - Trip to Europe after graduation (during May/June 2015)  
    $2000 - New Furniture/Apartment Down Payment (June 2015)  
    $7000 - Engagement Ring (Potentially around December 2015)  
  
  

  
So, now for my question. I have been extremely fortunate and have worked extremely hard during my undergraduate career, but am unsure about how to best set myself up for success after graduation. I made most of my money during an internship this summer and would like to open a Roth IRA before the end of this contribution cycle. I have been looking into Vanguard and ETrade. Any other recommendations? Also, should I contribute the full amount ($5500) since I just have the amount in a savings account currently? I have more than $15000 of expected expenses between June 2015 and December 2015, but will also have started work by then. I just want to make sure that I have enough liquid savings for everything as well as enough for my emergency fund and enough to take advantage of my employer's 401k match next year. Also, I am looking into applying for another credit card with a low interest rate since the max on my student credit card is only $500. I would be smart about using it and not letting debt accumulate, but it would be another helpful tool as I transition into working life.  
  
  
  

What are r/personalfinance's thoughts and advice?

I've applied online to almost every place I can think of that offers internships/co-ops. Some companies don't even take online applications and the only way to apply is to be at a school they recruit from. With all that said, I know it would be far easier and more successful if I had some form of a connection with someone that worked in industry and could help out.

I'm just interested in learning more about the field and getting experience through an internship or co-op. I would like to try to gain experience in process engineering setting in a refinery(its a long shot considering I'm a ME student, but I've seen a few places offer placements for non CHE majors) or maybe drilling/production(fracking seems very interesting, especially the type of fluids/material they use to do it). But, I am completely open to any opportunities in any location.

If you'd be willing to help, I can send you my resume via email(its not great to be honest) and we could even talk over the phone if you wanted to. I know this probably isn't the best way to go about this, but just trying to exhaust all possible avenues in order to get a position.

In all seriousness, being a political junkie and holding an apolitical job in Washington is tortuous. It's what I studied, it's what I'm interested in, it's all happening down the street from me, I want a piece of it. Even if that piece is a tiny, insignificant sliver that I will be forced to toil and sculpt for years into something of substance.  

I know... take a number, right? Plenty of others are aiming for the same thing. So how do I get my foot in the door? I am a few years out of college, close to three total years of post-college work (research for a transportation related non-profit; market research for a transportation related start-up; political and corporate PR firm) so I don't know if an internship would make sense. I don't know anyone in the field. I have begun sending out applications, but I would really like to have some edge that could make the process more personal. I'm willing to take a slight pay cut, move into a group house, etc. to get this started.

I'm looking for left-leaning or nonpartisan positions. Anyone have any ideas?  For those of you that had similar desires, and tried to transition into the field a little bit into your career, how did you do it? I'm working two jobs so I don't have as much free time to spend on happy hour networking, but now that I have become determined to do this I will try to attend as many events as possible.

2l3cna,1,2014-11-02,[Summer Internships] Programming language familiarity for interviews,raichud2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2l3cna/summer_internships_programming_language/,"**TL;DR:** I've been coding in almost exclusively C++, Python, and MATLAB for the last ten months. I need to work back up my Java chops for an upcoming interview. What resources are there out there for me?

Longer story:

For the last ten months, it's mainly been C++ and scripting, because that was what I did at my internship last summer, and that's what I've been doing in courses since last spring. I recently had two phone interviews with a company I really want to work at, and while both interviewers said that any language was okay, the first interviewer gave me the problem in Java syntax, and the second interviewer said he was less familiar with C++ than I was.

What I did was okay, as they invited me to an onsite, but I think it would behoove me to code in Java when I'm there. I want to aggressively refamiliarize myself with Java's libraries, its lesser-used syntax (such as bit manipulation), and whatever other Java chops I need to demonstrate. Any resources out there or projects that would require me to use and become familiar with a wide variety of Java data structures that you can recommend?

**EDIT:** also, learning things about implementation, for example the starting size of an ArrayList or HashMap on initialization, and how often they reallocate would probably be useful."

Some quick background, I graduated from a top 20 CS school with 3 internships and went to go work for a pretty large well known software company (not a top 4/5) after graduating. After spending 2 years there I got promoted and decided to try for a new position to get better experience. So, I found a startup that seemed to fit the bill. Small engineering team of ~10 engineers, mostly senior people (turns out I'd be the most junior one). Company itself was growing and had been around for about 4 years. I'd be working with a bunch of new frameworks and languages, the job seemed like a great learning experience so I decided to go for it.

At this point I've been in this position for 3.5 months now and I feel like I'm still a step behind where I'm expected to be. At first I thought it was because of the huge learning curve of jumping into a ton of stuff I wasn't familiar with at all but at this point I can't really blame that anymore. A combination of devs not having the time to sit down and go over current architecture or do design reviews, documentation/comments being really sparse and no unit/functional testing has made it a bit tough to get adjusted. Most devs here work ~50-55 hour weeks normally, so having to put up with the expected workload while trying to figure a lot of this stuff out has made for a couple stressful months.

The other week I had my lead pull me aside last week and let me know that if my current output keeps up he doesn't think I'll be a good fit for this company. The expectation at this point was that I'd be up to speed and as productive as the other devs. It definitely seems like they were expecting someone more senior for the role which I don't think I'm cut out for at this point. It's been a great learning experience here and I've been willing to put in the time but I'm not sure if it's worth staying in at this point, especially with the looming threat of being fired hanging over my head now.

At this point I'm wondering if I should stick around and keep trying or find another job I'm more comfortable with. Anyone have experiences with this kind of situation?"

2l3itg,16,2014-11-02,"My girlfriend (20 F) of 18 months and I (20 M) decided to break up to avoid long distance, just learned she has moved on.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2l3itg/my_girlfriend_20_f_of_18_months_and_i_20_m/,"My ex girlfriend and I had been dating in college since spring of 2013.  We both agreed it was best to split up in September because I am working an internship in Los Angeles for the next few months.  We agreed that if I returned to school we would get back together, but because I was considering transferring we decided it was best to break up rather than risk long distance just for me to transfer.

Anyways, I've had a really hard time adjusting to being alone, and without friends my age in Los Angeles it's difficult for me to move on and stop being reliant on her for emotional support.  She's still my best friend.  The highlight of my time in Los Angeles was last week when she showed up at my door to surprise me for the weekend.

This last week in particular has been particularly difficult.  When we first split up I was at least excited to start an internship, and by the time I realized how lonely I was here I had forgotten how much I loved her.  Since she visited last week, I can't stop thinking about how wrong it feels for me to be here alone when I could be with her, and I think I've decided to return to school sooner than planned in Winter.

This morning, she admitted in conversation that a few weeks before she visited me, she slept with another person.  I'm not mad at her and  don't judge her at all for doing it for several reasons: 

-We agreed it was best to break up, and were explicitly free to be with other people, but were trying to stay away from serious relationships in case I came back.

-She barely knew the guy, and he lives a few hours away.  She admitted other guys at school have tried hitting on her and she's avoided it because she doesn't want to get involved with someone she can easily see.

-She says she only slept with him to help get over being lonely about me, and I believe her.  She was miserable when we first split up, but since has become more confident being alone (I could tell from talking to her and knew something had changed).  In retrospect it all makes sense.

-I know that if I had been in her position surrounded by parties on a college campus the situation would have been the exact same, so I'm not mad or disappointed at all.

However, nor matter how much I keep telling myself those things, it still hurts.  The weeks before we split up I was excited to be single again, but ever since it happened I can't so much as think about even flirting with another girl without feeling overwhelmingly guilty.  I have absolutely no desire to be with anyone but her, and learning that she's moved on today hasn't changed that.  I'm an attractive guy, so in high school and my first year in college, I had no problem getting girls, which caused my girlfriend to be self conscious about her lack of partners before me.  I'm sure if I wanted I'd have no problem hitting up a friend at USC and meeting a girl at a party, but the desire just isn't there.  I've had plenty of girlfriends, but never one that I've still thought about this much after months apart.

We were both in love with each other while we were together, and I have no doubt that she still loves me.  I guess I'm just a little more in love with her, and sad to see how quickly she was able to be with someone else.  She's a very attractive girl (in my opinion much more attractive now than when we started dating), and she hadn't had much sexual experience other than me, so I know part of her is just taking advantage of this opportunity to help overcome several confidence issues which she has explicitly traced back to her lack of partners.

I'm not really sure what I'm getting at, and I don't want to write a novel here, so I'll wrap it up with this.  I'm in a lot of pain right now.  It hurts to know that someone you can't live without no longer needs you.  There's nothing I can do about what happened, but I'm not sure if I can continue to just be friends with her.  I need help figuring out whether or not I should still be talking to her daily, if at all.  There are too many factors:  

-I still love her and think that I will for a long time, but don't want my sadness to drag her down.  She deserves to move on if she's ready to.

-I'm not sure if I can even handle talking to her if I have to keep hearing about the parties she's been to.  My imagination is too wild, even if she's not.

-I know I'll be unable to move on if I keep using her as my emotional support.  I can't invest in another person when I still require so much attention from her.

However:

-Like I said, it's been lonely without the amount of friends I'm used to at school and it'll only get worse, much worse if I stop talking with her.

-She admitted that if we stop talking, it might just push her away further.  She still loves talking to me and I'm her best friend, it's just hard for me to accept that after she's been sexually involved with someone else, even if it wasn't emotional.  There's nothing I'm more scared of than pushing her so far away that she won't ever come back.

**TLDR** My girlfriend of 18 months and I still talk regularly.  I just learned that she has slept with someone else since we broke up, and while I understand and accept that entirely, I'm not sure I can continue talking with her as friends, even though emotionally I still need her."

Throughout college - relatively little amounts of drinking; though the more active my social life has been, the more I've ended up drinking, but it's never been a problem.

Fall 2011 - Freshman year, first encounter with weed. Start semi-regularly (once a week?) smoking weed with a couple friends.

Winter break 2011/2012 - buy my own MFLB and start buying my own weed. Start vaping what I considered to be a lot at the time (but only really bought 1g at a time and pretty infrequently at that.) Got really into masturbating while high.

Spring 2012 - maintain this, buying 1g or so at a time and smoking with friends. Occasionally had solo vape/fap benders while my roommate was out of town for the weekend. Also started to develop severe anxiety and attention issues from one of my classes that spread to the others. Went to my school's counseling center for it.

Summer 2012 - Back home for the summer. Have my MFLB, but not much easy access to weed. I went through less than an eighth this whole summer. I got tested for ADHD at the recommendation of my school's therapist. Start taking Vyvanse. Headed over to /r/keto, lost about 60lbs. Felt kind of depressed/lonely this summer but optimistic after getting some sort of help.

Fall 2012 - Got a long-distance girlfriend. 2 hour bus ride away; we'd spend plenty of weekends together. Best semester of college, grade-wise. Don't remember how much weed I smoked, but not much. Still took my Vyvanse daily, and I went off /r/keto after a while because seeing my vegetarian girlfriend for 2-3 days at a time made it hard to stay on the diet. Continued losing weight as the semester got more intense and I had less time to eat. Still pretty happy for the most part, but started feeling a little burnt out from school and had some family drama going on.

Winter break 2012/2013 - Total blur. I did take my MFLB back home, so I think I vaped a bit. Still not bad yet.

Spring 2013 - Still seeing girlfriend, taking Vyvanse. One of my two best friends at school dropped out, so I saw him a lot less. Having lots of motivation issues with school. I smoked a bit more often this semester. Had some more anxiety due to grades I wasn't happy with. Feeling some stress/depression about finding summer internships, family financial issues, etc. Started to put some weight back on. Started to get very curious about psychedelics, but ultimately didn't pursue anything.

Summer 2013 - Looking back, I think this was kind of the turning point. Went back home, had a solid internship. Had a falling out with my other best friend from school. Started to put a little more weight back on. Switched from Vyvanse to Adderall since I felt that Vyvanse had to do with my motivation issues. Switching helped. Vaped more often than I did during previous breaks.

Fall 2013 - Moved into an apartment where I had my own room. Very lonely without my old friends; still see gf on the weekends. Gradually started skipping classes, vaping/fapping all day, every day,  and procrastinating more than ever. I'd generally take a week or two off after blowing through an eighth or a Q, and during this time I'd start to feel really anxious/depressed about what I'd just done. Gradually started to withdraw from friendships with classmates, etc. Started to do reckless things like (surprisingly very successfully) taking an exam high, coming to classes really tired from weed benders, etc. Overall, I felt very depressed/lonely/shitty. Start to feel really anxious about grad school plans. Struggle with feelings of weed cravings/dependence and feel guilty about that.

Winter break 2013/2014 - Went back home. More family issues going on made me feel a little more depressed. Vaped/smoked quite a bit, both alone and with friends. Binge ate a few times. Applied to some summer internships. Still felt pretty depressed/shitty here. 

Spring 2014 - Got a good summer internship. Took on a bit more schoolwork than I could handle as my second major really kicked into gear. Vaped a lot for the first month. Once I got my offer, I took a little break from vaping in case I had a drug test (didn't happen.) I felt kind of emotionally rocky after quitting. Had a huge fight with my best friend from home and didn't talk for a few weeks. Got bed bugs and got rid of them fairly quickly, but my roommate moved out; I started to vape again all the time to cope with loneliness.
I really started to loathe school even more; around finals, I had a couple of breakdowns because I felt guilty for being so unmotivated. Ended up buying more weed. I was also VERY anxious about grad school; I was unsure if I'm even going to go or if I'll work instead. 

Summer 2014 - killer internship. Still taking Adderall on the daily. Girlfriend moved in with me and it was a bit rocky getting used to it as she was struggling with her own problems. I still vaped but less than before, but she still got a little annoyed with it. Took a trip with some friends, tried MDMA here and liked it.

Fall 2014 - terrible semester so far.  Got a new apartment with my girlfriend and started very rarely hanging out with a couple old friends, which is a definite highlight. Still taking Adderall every day, and vaped a LOT. After a few weeks, I did stop doing work after sobering up/going to class pseudo-high, though. Decided to move forward with grad school, but I feel a constant impending sense of doom regarding the applications process due to an average GPA, weak rapports with professors (so I can't get good letters,) and just a general uncertainty about life. Struggling very hard with anxiety/depression regarding this process, started to go back to therapy but it hasn't helped much. Had a few emotional breakdowns after I feel overwhelmed by my excessive amounts of schoolwork, anxiety about grad school, impending GREs, etc. I have a very hard time starting work, often not able to start until 12AM-5AM the day it's due.

Tried shrooms with my girlfriend about 3 weeks ago around Columbus day; I felt something that resembled every feeling that one could possibly feel and perceived all of space and time simultaneously, then felt reality shred apart and lost all sense of self as I had to piece back together who I was. I don't think it had any effects beyond the following day, but I haven't really smoked any weed since then because I haven't felt like I have the time, and had a mildly unpleasant experience the one time I tried to vape after the shrooms--I ended up feeling really guilty and just threw the rest of my weed out (it was just a stem anyways...) I also want to start turning life around. I still constantly get cravings and occasionally come close to succumbing.

Finally started taking Zoloft a few days ago to help with the anxiety/depression, still on Adderall. Haven't used weed since 10/15. But I'm not sure how much of these extreme emotional highs/lows are related to my Adderall use and my on again/off again relationship with weed."

We had a really strong connection, and the 6 months we were together, it felt like a year and a half. She brought out both the good and the bad in me. We were technically FWB and somewhat exclusive for the first few months, then feelings got involved, and we tried to make it official.

Anyhow, I had to move to a different city (350 miles away) for an internship gig for two months. We were still dating before I left, but given the distance, we had numerous conversations on the phone that went bad, which eventually led to our breakup.

I'll be honest, I was inexperienced, jealous, and needy at times, but that's only because I found out she cheated on me with her ex-bf of 5 yrs. She told me she needed psychological help (given she was abused and cheated on in that exact relationship). She has a lot going on in her life, the kid she nannied started going to school, so she lost that job and is now doing deliveries for Instacart. 

When we had a bad breakup, she took me off all her social media accounts, and blocked me on instagram. Two days ago, she unblocked me and accidentally followed me, and quickly unfollowed me (but I still got the notification).

Back in July, when her and I were together, I bought 2 tickets to our favorite comedian as her birthday present. Her birthday was a week ago, I broke NC by wishing her a happy birthday, sent her the two tickets with a letter and said she can take whoever she wants, given they are her tickets now.

Since she knows I'll be in town the week of the show, she might text me asking if I still want to go, cause we've looked forward to this show for weeks. What should I do? I'm in town because I have to go to court for a speeding ticket, and it just happened to be that same week.

I of course still love her, and would love to try to make things work again, but there's nothing in my power that I can do to fix this. If she does/does not contact me to go to the show, I won't let it effect me. 

Any advice on this would greatly help. I love this girl, but she has a lot of maturing to do and needs to figure out her shit -- or else the fighting/arguing will continue to happen. I on the other hand need to prevent myself from making those mistakes (jealousy, neediness, social media visits, etc). I want to better my appearance, social life, and professional life. 

If you're into any of the above, please PM me! Always looking for advice on these things!!

2l3xi8,3,2014-11-02,Computer Science Transfer Student [Questions],vaironl,UVA,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/2l3xi8/computer_science_transfer_student_questions/,"Hello all,

I’ve been asking the following set of questions around everywhere (forums, current college counselors, UVA admissions office) as I’m hoping to increase my chances of becoming a UVA transfer student. I’m currently studying computer science at a community college in Virginia. I was initially fulfilling the requirements to the B.A in Computer Science, but this was not only an accident, but also a lack of research on my first year. This has led me to be a 3rd year student at a community college having around 15 extra credits which will not transfer.

I’ve recently been fairly interested in the engineering side of things which has led me to attempt to transfer as a B.S in computer science. However, I still need to take Calculus 2, 1 semester of calculus based physics, and 1 semester of calculus based chemistry to fulfil the minimum requirements for the B.S. On top of this I will be taking a one credit elective to complete an associate’s degree from my community college and have to work ~20 hours/ week to pay for necessary things (transport, home, etc.). To add salt to the wound I last took the SAT in high school year 2011 and got scores of 390 reading, 460 math, and 410 writing. Which are all bellow the recommended average for UVA, and from speaking with the admissions advisors SAT scores are also required from transfers. 

So my current plan is to begin preparing for the SAT in between school work and work and prepare to take chemistry, physics, calculus 2, and a physical education elective for the next semester. For over a year now I’ve been working at an internship related to my degree and I’m hoping this helps me when applying (I’m not sure how).  I’m just afraid that even after I do all of this UVA will reject me. I have a realistic view on this which is that I’ve wasted quite a bit of time trying to complete the B.A, had low scores for the SAT, and will have extra credits($$$) unused, but I’m hoping to receive advise on what to do better to make myself a better candidate. I wonder if acceptance into the school of engineering is even in the envelopes of outcomes.

I plan on visiting UVA this week and hopefully talk to counselors, professors, and students directly to ask these questions and show my high interest in the school.

I’ve thought that I would like to work on software development for companies developing mobile and desktop applications and the B.A seems to be ok for that, but in recent years for as odd and childish as it sounds I’ve also thought about working on developing software to deflect asteroids that are on course to earth. I can’t see any companies in relationship to the latter position hiring me with a B.A in Computer Science.

Thanks a lot for any help that anyone can provide! "
2l3y8p,5,2014-11-02,My height is a sexual death sentence,[deleted],short,https://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/2l3y8p/my_height_is_a_sexual_death_sentence/,"I'm getting close to the end of the line guys. It didn't have to be this way, and it wasn't always this way, but the evidence just builds and builds with each passing year. As the time goes by I sink deeper and deeper into isolation and depression, all because of this shit tier body I am trapped in.   
  
  

Let's jump back to high school, a great time in my life. Like many shorter men I hit puberty early and finished growing very early. I reached my peak height of 5'5 around age 12. At this time I was just above average sized for my buddies and popular at school. I never had problems making friends or meeting girls. 
  
  

I was always of a quiet and serious nature, I enjoyed making music and writing poetry. I never had trouble meeting women as a kid and had my first girlfriend at age 11. I went to all the school dances with different girls and lost my virginity around age 15. Things were good until the end of high school - little did I know the end was near.  

  
  
  

When I got to college I instantly knew things would be different. For one, all my classmates had grown up while I stayed the same size. I didn't know anyone at school and I found it difficult to make good friends. Everyone I would meet was either rude to me or treated me like a little buddy rather than an equal. I still had a girlfriend in high school at this point but I could tell things were becoming strained.   

  
  

As college progressed I began to realize more and more how big of a disadvantage my stature proved to be. As a kid I rarely even considered my height but at college I was forced to deal with it head on. My girlfriend went off to college too and realized her sexual value was far, far higher than mine (she was taller than me). She ended up leaving me, but not before taking every opportunity to humiliate and emasculate me on the way out.   

  
  

This threw me into a bit of a funk for a while. I tried to brush it off by partying with my friends and meeting new people. At this point I started going out with my roommate (6'0) and some friends from school (about 6'1 to 6'3). this is when reality hit me HARD. Seeing the way women treated these larger men compared to me was one of the hardest things to accept.   

  
  

Seeing first hand that these guys simply walk up and say ""hi"" and the girl is interested whereas I have to jump through hoops and all this just to get her attention. I started feverishly reading about PUA and social development, convinced that my problem was my social skills and by mastering pick up I could somehow change my fate  
  

  
  

Fast forward another year it takes me to realize that pick up will really only get you so far. It seems women, like men, are more likely to instantly decide your genetic worth based on your appearance than to care about how bold and charismatic you are. Don't get me wrong, PUA and social development is very important if you lack social skills but if you have those skills they will only get you to a certain point.  

  
  

I decided the only way to make up for my shit height was to become so cool that no girl could resist me. I got more into drugs, did everything I could to be seen as a local big-shot in that world. I made new friends with ""cool"" underground reggae type musicians and moved to an expensive trendy urban neighborhood.   

  
  

Fast forward another year and I'm having a party at my apartment. I was playing a show that night in my crib and we had about 300 guests give or take. It was a wild party and I kept thinking to myself ""this is it! I'm going to get laid tonight and now everyone will know how cool and low inhibition I am... by next weekend every girl will want a part of this life""  

  
  

two things happened that night to break me out of my fantasy. One, while I was playing my show a girl I had been hitting on hooked up with a guy in my bedroom. I had someone watching the room while I played and I heard frmo him later she starts making out with the guy on my bed and only leaves when he kick them out. Second thing that happened is I got arrested and spent the night in jail.   

  
  

I had a lot of dark thoughts that night in the cell. Mainly about how all the other guys would have a girl waiting for them after this bullshit whereas I would be going home alone and broken. I decided that I need to change my lifestyle because I could have been arrested for a whole fucking lot worse than a house party.   

  
  

Fast forward another year and I've stopped hanging out with all my old friends. All them are into hard drugs and I can't relate with that life style anymore. All my high school friends went off to different schools and fit in with new social groups while I drifted from circle to circle unable to find people who treated me as an equal and respected me for who I am.   

  
  

One last year passes and I slowly reject all the friends I ever had. i began to ignore even the few people who would hit me up to chill. the lack of female validation from the past 5 years has built and built until I feel that there is really no point in going on.   

  
  

I honestly worked my very hardest in this life to overcome my challenges. I got accepted to university on a full scholarship, I have held 5 jobs over my teenage years and worked two professional internships while in college. I am a classically trained pianist who has performed piano concertos since the age of 16 and I am a deeply caring person who's only want is to find one single woman who truly loves and respects me.   

  
  

Sadly all this amounts for nothing in this life. The only things that matter in the sexual market are normal social skills (required), good looks (including 5'10+ height), and social proof. social proof is refused to short men because other men will not show you respect in the company of women. Sexuality is refused to short men as we are seen as a disgusting perversion of the human archetypes (tall masculine men and small feminine women).   

  
  

Perhaps the most sad part to me is the effects of the feminist movement on sexual dynamics. Because heightism itself is a form of sexism, it would seem that feminism is a promising movement for short men. In my experiences this could not be further from the truth. All women despise short men so naturally a women's rights movement has no interest in provisions for short men.   
  


  
  

In my view, all that this movement has accomplished is convincing women that they do not need a man to provide for her and convinced women that it is perfectly okay to sleep around. As a short man, my career is really all I have to offer a woman besides my personality.  
  

  
  

I know that my $60,000 starting salary means nothing to a young sexual woman with her own career plans and ambitions. As a result of this change short men are really seen as nothing more than ugly useless worker ants. this trend has simply grown and grown in the past decades and I expect it will continue until men under 6' are simply bred out of the gene pool.   
  

  
  

I plan to give myself 2 more years to keep working on myself. I will put all I have into my career as well as a start-up idea I have in the works. If neither of these are successful I will say my prayers and swallow a .308 winchester round   

  
  


I'm certain most people will not take the time to read this narcissistic post. I don't blame you. for those who do, thanks, feel free to comment as I'm sure many of you will disagree. As far as I'm concerned I've harbored these delusions of equality long enough and it's time to face the facts. "
2l3yw9,3,2014-11-02,"Me [20 M] with my girlfriend [20 F] of 7 months, we're taking a break. Feeling hurt and confused.",TokyoUD,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2l3yw9/me_20_m_with_my_girlfriend_20_f_of_7_months_were/,"I'd like to apologize ahead of time for the length of this post. I'm just being as thorough as I can.

Obviously, my girlfriend and I are college students. She's a nursing major and I'm in urban planning. Both of these majors are demanding in various ways. Her nursing classes require her to wake up early (6:00AM) and they can keep her late some days. On top of that, she works at a local hospital for some extra income. I'm on a co-op semester (paid internship) and occasionally work late due to meetings and helping with events (small office, big events). As a result, we've only been able to see each other once a week for the last three months. Before that, we were seeing each other two to three times a week at minimum. But things were okay. We got together to watch movies and share a meal every once in a while. Mixed things up and went to go see a few movies. Things were going well, until the last month or so.

As mentioned before, my GF has a really busy schedule. She's a hard worker but even she's been getting worn down from juggling school/work. As a result, she's been distant and hasn't really been reaching out to do anything. I've trying my best to give her the space she needs and be perceptive of when she's not in the mood to hangout. But then I started getting the feeling when she did want to hang out that she didn't really want me around/found me annoying. I talked to her about it and we kind of realized that we both have a tendency to push people away when we're feeling stressed or worn out. We agreed to be more communicative and it seemed like things were going well again. Then things just went to shit.

My GF really loves Halloween, so we planned to do a fun couples outfit (Old, creepy couple with roles reversed). Due to work/school, we ended up going shopping for our costumes the day of Halloween. We agreed to go thrift shopping together and she was driving us there. We agreed to meet at 4:30PM. She ended up picking me up around 5:10PM. When I got in the car, I noticed she was in a bad mood so I didn't really ask her why she was late. For the first hour of shopping, she was really reserved and cold. Eventually, things just relaxed and we had a fun time shopping for our costumes. The evening was fun. Things felt good.

The next day, we were planning on going to a Halloween party with a group of friends in the evening. Once again, things were awkward between us while we were getting ready. Once we got to the party, things only got worse. We're both introverts and the party scene really isn't our thing, but our friends wanted to go take a look. Unsurprisingly we end up in a corner sipping drinks. I tried to get her relaxed and less tense, but turns out I'm rubbish at comforting people. She moved away from me and ignored me for a while. We ended up leaving early with our friends (By this point, I had a nice buzz going). She didn't want to hold hands on the walk back and was still acting cold towards me. When everyone slipped to bed, I took the opportunity to ask her what was going on with us. 

She explained that she wasn't really feeling a spark between us anymore. The only things that she really cared/worried about lately were work and school. She also admitted that she was taking out some of her frustration and stress out on me. She called herself a bad girlfriend. Admittedly, I was fairly drunk by this point. I offered that we take our time to work things out and that I was interested in still staying together. Ultimately, we awkwardly slipped into bed together.

This morning, I ended up waking up earlier and I slipped out of the apartment when she went to the bathroom. Things hadn't ended well the night before and I needed space as well as time to think things over. Once I was better composed, we agreed to go on a break for a week or two to figure things out.

At this point, I don't really know what to do. Logically, I know that being in a relationship where there's such a disparity between emotions will only end badly. But there's still a part of me that believes that we can work through this together. I still feel strongly about her. I still love her, even if it hurts. I just don't know what to do. I plan on asking her to get coffee a week from now to talk things out some more. But will it be enough?

I know there are a bunch of posts about these sort of things and I have been reading them. I just feel like mine is a little more specific in terms of asking about WI salaries.

Tomorrow I will be talking to a company about an offer they want to make. I am wondering if it is acceptable for a soon to be graduate to negotiate if the salary seems low. I am also wondering about salaries in WI. From what I've been seeing online a good starting salary here in WI would be 50k with 45 being average and 40 being low. Does that seem about right to you guys? I've been looking on glassdoor and that seems about normal.

In case if it matters I go to an alright UW school (apparently the company I am talking to thinks it has a hard CS program so maybe that will be in my favor). I had one internship and have a 4.0 GPA. I will be graduating with a BS degree in Comp Sci.

Any input is appreciated.

Thank you."

I am currently in the process of interviewing for data analyst roles. I graduated with a degree in statistics and I am proficient in R and Excel. I have not utilized SQL during my current data analyst internship that I started after graduation in May. 

I have had several interviews for Data Analyst roles and many have required SQL experience. This has led me to miss a lot of these opportunities, so last week I decided to start learning on my own. What I have been doing is learning how to write queries from different online resources. A lot of it is coming naturally to me because of my background and so I really think this is something I could pick up right away if I practice daily on the job. Unfortunately, using the  ""I am a quick learner and could pick SQL up quickly"" line with recruiters and hiring managers is never enough to move me forward. For the time being I am going to continue practicing writing queries and understanding SQL.

I just wanted to know if anyone has advice on how get my foot in the door as a data analyst with minimal SQL experience. Would saying ""I can write basic queries"" be enough to move me forward in the interview process? I am a greater interviewee and have a analytical background, so this has been my only obstacle in obtaining a full-time position as a data analyst.

At 42, while we were on vacation, she had some strange behaviors. We had two minor car accidents, and she was even more mystic than ever. She lost cousiousness, and woke up at hospital.

Doctors found a highly nast tumor in the perfect center of her brain. No one told her, but since we both sweared to tell each other the truth if someday one of us would be facing this very special situation, i had no choice but let her know the truth. I'll remember all my life the way she looked at me when she heared the truth about her condition. I'm not sure, but i think she already knew at this point that she would be dead in a short amount of time.

I lived in Paris, and her little familly was located at the south of France. So she has been moved here, while i was living in Paris. I was able to see her no more than twice a month.

So doctors choosed to do the only thing they could try : a surgery to dig very deep in her brain for removing whatever could be removed. Since it was too deep, not everything has been removed.

Right after her surgery, she woke up violently dystonic with a fucked up brain. So doctors choosed to put her in an artificial coma, then adopted the ""wait and see"" attitude.

I went to see her. Here comes my first life traumatic experience. My mother was a really beautiful person. She was crazy AND class. I remember her, stopped at a traffic light, spotting a white hair in the mirror. She pulled out a black marker from the glove box, and fixed the problem before the light turned green. The same person was in front of me, lying on a hospital bed, uncounscious, with very short grey &amp; white hairs. She looked like 10 years (if not 15) older. Her head was covered with bandages. Dozens of wires came in and out from her motionless body. I remember the cynic and creepy sound of the artificial breathing machine.

She stay silent for few months, then she kind of woke up, hemiplegic. All she was saying was spoken via a very weak breath. Her brain was fucked up, she was often crying (in a whishper ..) because of the situation, sometimes because of an evil and dark snake that she thought was under her back. She also felt and knew that a part of her brain was missing, and that she was paralysed from one side.

And there i was, sitting next to her. I heard her thinking about how tough life would be for me, since im one of those over sensitive child blessed with a resigning father, while she was slowly dying. I could feel a deep distress in her eyes. I could feel she was even more scared about me than about her own fate. Then she died.

Last image i have from her is her naked back on the hospital bed getting ready to be washed by interns. I refused to see her dead body before the cremation. I saw a fucking oven eating my mother's coffin.

I grew up, and today i'm in the same bands than her. She was a fan of O.D.B (it's considered as pretty avant-garde in France lol) Underworld, David Bowie, Bagdad Cafe movie and ost, she was doing extasy, she was raving, she was smart &amp; brillant, she asked for weed while in hopsital, she threated to cut the surgeron's balls if things turned bad, and among all, she was love.

Today, i'm a weird sad dude. I'll never be allowed to know her as an adult. And 11 years after, i feel like ill always have this heavy weight on my heart. Its something that i can feel PHYSICALLY. It prevent me from being simply happy, despite i know that it would be my mother's deepest wish.

2l4ti3,2,2014-11-03,Would I be wasting my time to learn Go really in depth? Should I stick to something like Python or C++?,ryman2012,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2l4ti3/would_i_be_wasting_my_time_to_learn_go_really_in/,"I am a third year computer science student, I am just finishing a one year development internship.

One thing I realized is I don't know any one programming language very proficiently.

I've taken courses that need assignments written in Java, C++, Objective-C, C.

And my internship I only use Javascript daily (web application).

But even at work, with most things I always Google it just to make sure, double check, or I just don't know the syntax I need.

I know how to solve the problem, but to write the problem in code, without Google I'm almost useless.

I feel pretty fake, because everyone has told me I'm doing a great job and learning well, but I just feel like I can Google well.

I guess right now I'm most proficient in Javascript, but I just don't really like it and its probably not the most versatile, although I might be wrong, it seems like a fad right now.

Right now, if I need to solve a problem or write code for something, I need to look up every little detail on Google. I'll have a very good idea what I'm looking for or searching for, but I just don't know the syntax or details to do it on my own without a reference.

It would be nice to be able to have enough proficiency that if someone asked me to solve a programming task I could do it from my head without looking every little thing up.

C++ has been my favourite language to use, I don't know why, it just seemed to make sense to me off the bat.

I have been looking at Go, and it seems very cool.

And Go works with Google App Engine, so perhaps I can make cool things with that.

Should I learn something that is more common?"
2l4ufj,1,2014-11-03,Well...,OpenCap,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2l4ufj/well/,"Don't let my badge deceive you. That's not my real count. I just never bothered to fix it when I put in the wrong inputs. I guess that goes to show how badly my decision making has been affected by so much PMO. Mostly M and O. 

I've made an account on here before and I had lots of support. Furthest I had gone was 53 days and ended up relapsing around the same time as now, except for a year ago. 

You know, fapstronauts. Let me be real with both you and myself right now. This is a personal post, much like many on here, that I really want to be comfortable with by shooting it out into the wild web. 

It's been almost two years, I believe, since I've come to terms with my problem - that is masturbation on a highly excessive level. I began to realize how much of a problem my masturbation had truly been when my grades in university began to dwindle lower and lower. I told to myself that my university career will have the best grades that I have ever produced. That I'll ""always get A's"" and be ""on top of my shit."" That never happened. I then started to think as to ""why am I always late on things? Why do I procrastinate so much? What is it that's truly stopping me from achieving what I want?"" It took a long time for me to figure out that at the crux of most of problems stemmed masturbation, the unusual suspect. 

You know - it's really quite difficult to type about a subject that has really occupied you for most of your life - so I'm having trouble really getting my thoughts together so I can form some sort of coherent picture about where I stand. I digress. 

After trying to battle it out, and reaching 53 days, I ended up discovering a lot more about myself. I ended up finding out that I had this weird, sexual, anxious, and almost fearful energy that I had been storing inside of me. The way that I had been dealing with it was through masturbation, which ended up feeding itself into this loop of anxiety. That's what it really is. It's a loop. A cycle. A pattern of thinking and movement that ends up resulting in the same process and comes to the same conclusion with masturbation and self-loathing. I guess one has to briefly step out of this pattern to really see how easily it's been affecting them. My coping mechanism to all my fantasies and desires and anxieties and fears was to masturbate. I've had this habit since I was at least 7-8 years old. I'm 20 now. More than half of my life I have been ruled by this selfish, self-deprecating act of disgust. There have been numerous amounts of attempts to go for ""3 days"" or ""just go for 1 week"" but all have resulted in failures. I haven't given up yet, and I am not planning on it. I will push through. I don't know what kind of advice I can give to those who are in my position or anyone, really, but if I were to say one thing, I guess it would be to not give up. And, in a way, just by writing this I think I'm inadvertently telling myself to not give up. I know there's both a fire and a cockroach inside of me. I need to use my fire to burn this cockroach right from my system but something has been stopping me. Fear, perhaps. Anxiety. A clouded brain. Not being able to deal with the trappings of life. Fear of failure. No. Fear of succeeding. Fear of standing out. Fear of being known. This is my anxiety talking. What does it take to become a Hemingway? Or a Sun-Tzu? Or a Bruce Lee? Or a Pavel Datsyuk? Or a pilot? Or a physicist? Or an overall efficient, productive, and happy person? Like Arnold Schwarzenegger? I think the biggest thing is that they all knew how to harvest and harbor their energy the right way, and along with that, they also know in which ways to go about using it. This is what I yearn for but something has been holding me back for so long. 

I feel like I'm in a dream. Like, I'm living my life constantly battling with myself, alienating myself from my friends, my family, society, trying to find this dark demon that I absolutely can't talk to anyone about. I feel like it's maddening at times. Maybe it's becomes I haven't reached the point where I'm comfortable with myself, or maybe proud of myself by saying that I've beat this terrible habit, to go out and talk about my problem openly to people. Sure, I've told my friends about it..hinting at several aspects to it...but they've all laughed it off and wrote it off thinking it's a big joke. I haven't had anyone really understanding this pain. Sometimes I feel like a true drug addict. Bags under my eyes. Brain pounding. I need to wake up for school...maybe if I sleep for ten more minutes I'll get up...be late for class. AHG! FUCK! 

I don't know what to do. 

People are moving forward and here I am lamenting about my own pitiful downfall. I feel like I've just been watching the world go by from inside my room. Many seasons have come and gone yet I have stayed the same. 

I don't know what to do.

My grades are shit. I'm dirt poor. I've been alienating myself from my friends. At this point I won't be able to get an internship for next summer so that's fucking that. I haven't been sleeping. I've become reclusive. My once personable self has become secluded and cold.

What more do I need to experience and realize to truly get off my ass and commit to this fucking journey? How is ranting to the internet going to solve any of my problems? How am I going to get up on my feet and just jazz my way that way I want to and not the way my demon does? *deep sigh*


I don't know if this rant relieved me of or added more stress to my life right now. I need to get my shit together. And fast. 

I guess I'll report back here if I have anything at all to report. 

Signing off.

However, we have yet to complete very many projects and now, my artist can not contribute at all. My primary goal for creating my own independent games has been to build skills and experience towards a career in the industry. Therefore, I am now looking for a team to work with that will be able to stay motivated and finish a project.

Game design is my passion. I love programming also, but I learned it so that I would have a tangible skill to contribute with beyond design. The perfect project would be already planned and underway, yet open to potential design input. I am available to meet in person in the Raleigh, NC area or work remotely.

I am willing to work for a profit share from the game if that is the only form of compensation a small team could offer (I have been there myself). I am also open to an entry-level hourly rate or even an internship with the right company.

You can check out my previous endeavors at [Detour Games](http://www.detour-games.com/home.html). I also host most of my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/amplify91) if you would like to take a look. I have even taught programming to 8-10 year old children in the form of a week-long Minecraft modding camp. You can check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amplify91) for more information about me.

If you have a small project already under way and are looking for another programmer to help finish completing, PM me with details about the project and the team and maybe we can work together. If you are looking for something else, PM me anyways and I may consider it. Thanks for your consideration!

You can reply in this thread, PM me, or email me at amplify91@gmail.com."
2l506a,2,2014-11-03,"Nothing interests me, fulfills me, or makes me happy. Not sure what to do with my life now that I graduated.",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2l506a/nothing_interests_me_fulfills_me_or_makes_me/,"So in June, I graduated from college with a B.A. in English. I studied English because it was always my strong point in school, and I graduated with a 4.0. Ever since then, everything has been downhill. I feel like I majored in the wrong thing. I never really liked my major, but I knew I'd be good at it, so I kept on. Now I feel like in order to subsist I will be forced into a soul-draining marketing job that I probably won't be very good at because I have literally 0 motivation to succeed at it. I can't get a master's in anything I might want to work in, and I can't afford a second bachelors, because I'm still in debt from my first. I am looking for a job but it's not going well because it's hard for me to fake enthusiasm (very important to people hiring writers and editors, for some reason).

Even if I saved up for another degree, there's an issue. If I knew what it is that I wanted to do, I'd have no problem going for it, but I have been too depressed for too long to have any interests remaining. I used to write creatively in high school/early college, but now can't bring myself to do it. I have tried many times to develop new interests - I started a blog, tried hiking, writing poetry, even just reading books for fun - but it all feels forced, like I'm doing it just to say I did it, I don't take pleasure or even relaxation from them. I even tried out religion, and couldn't convince myself. 

I am afraid that I will never build a meaningful life for myself because I have lost the ability to enjoy anything, and therefore pretty much suck at everything. I feel stuck in a life path that will not be successful or fulfilling because I don't care about it, and therefore have no talent or motivation. It makes me feel like a failure, and it makes me afraid at a life of misery. I do have a (mild) interest in science, animals, and nature but because I am so inexperienced in those things, I wouldn't even know where to start doing anything like that, even as a hobby, and I am afraid if I tried I would stomp out the little interest I do have.

My dad tries hard to help me but simply doesn't understand depression because he never experienced it. I have taken medication and while it did help me (very mildly) with my depression, it made my apathy and lack of interest in anything worse, so I stopped. I am looking for a low-cost therapist but it's all interns and they aren't often very good (""have you tried doing breathing exercises?"" ugh.). However, at the end of the day I sometimes think, maybe I'm not clinically depressed, maybe I just suck and have a life that is going to suck (in a low-grade, average way, but still) and am rightfully upset about sucking. 

I am tired of people telling me that other people have it worse. A life full of emptiness and nothingness is its own type of hell, maybe a step up from a life full of negative things, but at least a person who has obstacles in front of them still has goals and draws meaning from life. People say that what I'm experiencing is ""normal"" but I want to have an excellent life, not a normal one, and I think a lot of normal people are perpetually unsatisfied because they settle. I am afraid to become one of them.

I know this is a long post and I may just delete it later, but I felt like maybe in this community of all places maybe someone would have something helpful or at least understanding to say. If you got this far, thanks for listening. "
2l533s,6,2014-11-03,I am the youngest child and I am the only child with a real job. It is incredibly frustrating and I get a lot of resentment from my siblings for it.,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/2l533s/i_am_the_youngest_child_and_i_am_the_only_child/,"I am the only one who has worked or payed taxes in 7 years (when I entered the workforce). I am the youngest of three. I started working in retail shit jobs and then progressed into a career in programming.

My brother and my sister have not held jobs in close to 10+ years. My brother has some mental health issues so I sort of understand him not working (although I truly believe he can..) but my sister is completely able bodied and capable of working.

I face a lot of resentment from them and it's driving me fucking insane. I hear shit like ""oh you act like you're better than us"" and ""you don't do anything for the family like we do"" etc etc.

I have gotten into screaming fights with my sister about her not fucking working. The last real job she held was helping her best friend's parents at their fast food shop for like 4 months IN HIGH SCHOOL. That was well over 10 years ago. But she always refers to it when I tell her she has never worked a real job in her life.

OH REALLY? You worked for your best friend's parents???? Yeah tell me how that's exactly like working for some manager who doesn't give a shit if the bus was late to the stop and its raining out. Nope you're late, that's a write-up.

Then she says how she worked at a place during high school that was run by a bitch manager. Ok, cool. But again that was over 10 years ago. What the fuck have you been doing with your life since then?

It infuriates me that somehow my wanting them to GET A FUCKING JOB is me being superior. Then the two of them go off to talk shit about me and make fun of me. I can't express how much this makes me hate them.

I don't want to hate them. But how the FUCK do you get to be 30+ without fucking realizing that YOU NEED TO FUCKING GET A FUCKING JOB

I want them to be successful in life. I want to fucking be able to share work stories and gripe about grownup things with them. I want to bitch about taxes and retirement with them. I want to do all the normal adult shit and have them experience and commiserate with me.

But I fucking can't, because any time I try to say something about my job... I get shut down. 

I want to fucking scream in their faces constantly GET A JOB GET A JOB GET A FUCKING JOB

It does not matter WHAT you do, I only care that you are doing something. It's really not about fucking prestige, I don't care if you work fast food. An honest day's work is INFINITELY BETTER than nothing at all.

Now, they help my mom at her store. That I can give them credit for, but the only reason for that is because my mom realized that they weren't doing fucking SHIT with their lives and they needed some kind of employment. 

Also, working for your mom IS NOT THE SAME THING. It does not matter how ""crazy"" mom is being, she will let you fucking bring your laptop to work or leave and go on breaks whenever you want or whatever the fuck. Try pulling some shit like that anywhere else. Just fucking try it.

My sister has a boyfriend who ""has a good job"" and she likes to talk about his job with pride. Okay, that's fair. Better than dating some ""loser,"" right? But I try to tell her that it doesn't mean shit. That is HIS pride and HIS accomplishment. You're just fucking him. It's not YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENT. 

Again, I am not trying to shame her but she needs to realize that these are not hers. If they break up, what does she have? What life skill could she fucking rely on? What fucking job history?

It doesn't help that she talks shit about me to her boyfriend, ranting and raving about whatever the fuck. Besides this anonymous post here, I dont fucking say shit to anyone about them not fucking working. Is it too fucking hard to expect a similar curtousy? No. Because clearly I think I'm better than her. Clearly, I just think my shit don't stink.

She doesn't know how to fucking pay taxes, she complains about $60/mo being expensive. She's never had a fucking interview in her life. You are a grown ass woman of 30 years how the fuck have you gotten this old without once thinking ""hmmmm maybe I should change this.""

I started to feel lame about not having a real career at age 23 (was working retail then) so I got my shit together and landed an internship. From there I fucking crafted a fucking career and life for myself, and this is without a fucking college degree. HOW THE FUCK do you get progressively older without fucking wanting to change.

I don't attack her about this. I really don't. I know I'm upset in this post but yall are strangers. I calmly ask her things like ""maybe you should get an internship somewhere"" or ""just work part time like 20 hrs a week"" but I instantly get a fucking defensive attitude back. I don't even fucking mean it in an aggressive way but her response is ALWAYS FUCKING ANGER.

I can't stand it. I feel like I'm fucking taking crazy pills here.

It gets to a point where I even feel like my parents don't support me. Occasionally my mom joins in on the shit talking about me and they all have their little fucking laugh about me. I can't stand it I really can't fucking stand it. How is it that I am getting shit for wanting a good fucking future for my siblings? For myself?

It makes me hate them. Truly hate them. And I don't want to, I really don't. I fucking cry because it makes me feel so fucking alone and frustrated.

I want to see my fucking older siblings have great careers and solid futures. Instead there is a wedge growing between us.

I'm going to fucking say it. I am more fucking mature than they are. I know I am younger but you know what? I've done more, I've experienced more, I've had a fuck lot more growing up than they but still somehow I'm a fucking baby. My words don't carry any weight. I'm just being a child.

I can't fucking stand it."

Would anyone be able to help / advise me find on how to find a roommate/place to stay? Any advises about living in Reykjavik in the winter would be highly appreciated as well.

2l5twq,4,2014-11-03,I need to move in January and I need to help deciding on where/what type of rental I should choose.,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2l5twq/i_need_to_move_in_january_and_i_need_to_help/,"I currently live in a 2 bedroom town home style apartment with a room mate. We split $650 in rent. He is moving in with his girlfriend in January which means I'll need to make some decisions on where to move. I don't really wish to stay in this apartment. It's expensive for the quality and I know I could live somewhere nicer (my kitchen and bathroom are tiny, like one bedroom apartment tiny) for the same price.

I have a few options I've been thinking of which I'll list here. My current apartment is about 10 miles from school.

* Stay in my apartment and go on a month to month lease which would probably cost me $700 monthly plus utilities while I look for a place.
* Rent an apartment in a complex close to school. 2 bedroom ranges $650-900. Try to swing that on my own and find a room mate. Hope that the complex isn't god awful.
* Rent a house for $650-$750 and find a room mate or try to swing it on my own.
* Rent an apartment somewhere that isn't next to school. 1 bedroom would probably cost $450-600

I've been looking around for a room mate but I haven't been able to find one. I've had bad experiences in the past and I have a hard time trusting people. I'd really like to get a house. I feel like it's cheaper to rent a 2-3 bedroom house. I could then try to find a room mate after I rent out a house. The only problem here is that I might need to stay in my apartment and pay the extra money for a month to month lease until I find a good house to rent out.

My mom has agreed to help me out a bit with rent (about $200) which is helpful. I'm living off student loans and my internship. I get about 4-5k every four months and I make about $400 a month at my internship. 

I felt like moving into an apartment right next to campus would save me money (gas/parking permit) but it seems that all these properties are really expensive for mediocre quality. I know they are charging for the convenience. Parking is awful for guests, too. They tow like crazy. Couldn't I just get a nicer house for the same/cheaper price? 

TL;DR I'm a single college student living off loans. I'm 24 so I'd prefer to live somewhere nice where I'd be comfortable living for a couple of years. I'm open to room mates. Should I go with an apartment complex or should I hold out and find a house for rent? Should I sacrifice living close to school in exchange for a nicer/cheaper rental?"

I really want to stay in the US as I have been here for a long time now, and whats worse is that companies like Texas Instruments, who I would love to work for, won't take internationals for almost all their positions (if not all), despite the fact that I go to the 5th best program in the nation, they don't want me.

Smaller companies are also unable to give sponsorship to international hires.

2l66gk,6,2014-11-03,System Administrator/Developer Position,packets,capstone,https://www.reddit.com/r/capstone/comments/2l66gk/system_administratordeveloper_position/,"Hey everyone.

I currently work as a system admin and developer for an office here on campus alongside another developer. My co-worker is getting ready to graduate here in December and I will be graduating in May, and thus we're looking for someone to fill our shoes once we're out the door. We're looking for you to start in January to give you about a semester with me to get trained up and ready to take the reins.

A bit of background about what you'll be doing:

The job more or less has two ""sides"" to it. Internal and external work.

Internally, you'll be managing our local servers and insuring they stay online and run smoothly. Additionally, you'll provide miscellaneous tech support for all interns and full-time staff in the office. This can be anything from getting someone set up with a domain account to figuring out why someone's computer isn't connecting to the internet. There are no full-time IT professionals on staff; if something goes wrong in-house, it'll be up to you to fix it.

Additionally, we do development work for outside clients. This is typically in the form of web development, but we also have developed and continue to maintain more archaic applications for some of our older clients.

As you can see, this is a technical position and candidates will need to have the skills to match. While we certainly don't expect you, as a student, to be an expert on everything we do here (we do a lot of different things), some of the big areas that we are looking for people with experience are:

* Web development (any language/framework is fine)
* SQL Databases (Oracle or Microsoft)
* Web hosting
* Server management
* Virtualization (VMWare)
* Software/Hardware troubleshooting
* Experience with Windows, OSX and Linux

This is a pretty short list, but if you have some competency in most of these areas (again, you don't need to be an expert on all this stuff) you'll be a strong candidate.

Regarding hours and compensation:

During the school year, you'll be working a maximum of 20 hours a week. That's all the University allows students enrolled in classes to bill. During the summer, you'll be working a full 40.

Pay is an hourly wage that is determined on a student-by-student basis, so I can't give you a figure here. I can say, however, that if you do a good job the Director will look out for you. Not only have I received a raise on my wage sine starting here, but my boss has allocated endowment money to pay for my graduate school tuition.

As a sidenote, we're only interested in people that can work a minimum for 1.5 years. 

All in all, it's a great gig. The people are great, the environment is relaxed and you'll get a ton of great experience in areas most other students aren't getting it. This'll give you a great leg-up when you graduate and are looking for a job.

If you're interested in the job, or just want more details, please PM me expressing your interest. I'll give you my email address and you can send me your resume for me to review.

2l69zd,208,2014-11-03,How do I explain a huge gap in my resume caused by major depression? It's eating me up.,Murphreesboro,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2l69zd/how_do_i_explain_a_huge_gap_in_my_resume_caused/,"I don't know if anyone here can help me, but this has been hugely contributing to my depression lately and any advice would be hugely appreciated. 

So, I've been diagnosed with major depression since childhood and functioning around it had always been hard. Still, being in school and having constant structure always helped me push through and do what I needed to do most of the time. I got into a good college and graduated at the top of my class and parlayed an internship into a full time job when I was 22. Things were ok and I was lucky to have a job where I could work from home a lot (I have huge anxiety issues that made leaving the house very difficult some days). But I was constantly stressed out, feeling like I wasn't good enough and the pressure mixed with the largely untreated depression led to a very serious eating disorder that got so severe I had to leave my job to get treatment two years ago.

The facility I went to was terrible. Since I had to rely on help from my parents to pay for treatment, it was in their hands where I went and they chose a place across the country from my friends, my boyfriend, my whole life so that I could be a couple of hours away from them so they could watch over me. I don't blame them for making that decision but the only treatment center that fit the bill for them was a terrible fit for me. Long story short, it was primarily an outpatient facility so I was left to stay in a bare apartment in a city I didn't know without friends, a job, or anything to do outside my 5 hours in therapy a day and absolutely no support on the weekends. I stayed for three months because I didn't know what else to do and all the while my depression and my disorder got so much worse. My friends stopped talking to me, my boyfriend of three years at the time got fed up with the distance and ended up cheating on me, my job who had told me there would be a place for me when I was ready to come back ended up instituting massive layoffs and I ended up having nothing to go back to.

I was forced to move back in with my parents for a year. Back in my hometown, all of my friends have moved away and I barely know anyone so it's just constant isolation. They didn't have health insurance since my dad had also been laid off and I had been a full time contractor with temporary health insurance which was immediately discontinued as soon as I was let go. I had no money to pay for therapy and no sense of purpose in my life. I had always made it through the hard times by knowing I had responsibilities and a network of people who cared about me and when I lost those things, I completely fell apart. 

I ended up getting part time work back in my city and moved back for about eight months just getting by- still no treatment and descended farther and farther into depression. Again, I was laid off from my crappy part time job and had to move back home where I've been since this past may. My parents finally for health insurance back at the end of the summer and luckily for the next two months, I'm still young enough to be on their plan. I've been seeing an excellent therapist and have been making a lot of strides in getting back to functionality and battling my eating disorder. The thing is, I'm at the point where mentally and practically I NEED to get back to work.

I'm turning 26 at the end of December and won't have insurance any longer. Also now that I'm lucid again, the life I've lived in a depressive funk doesn't work for me any more. I desperately want to start living my life again and even though I know what a huge struggle it will be for me to go back to a full time job after two years of floating around in a pit of depression. Still, I feel like I'm never going to make the next step in my recovery if I don't get out there and feel a sense of purpose in my life again. Lately I've been falling back into anorexia and bulimia just because I feel like I have nothing to do with myself and I can't stand it.

I've started applying for jobs in my field again but the stumbling block that's been coming up is this massive gap in my resume filled with short term part time work and then just months of nothing at all. I don't know what to do about this. I can't exactly tell a prospective employer ""oh yeah don't mind the last two years of my life, I've just been horribly depressed and self-destructive. But you don't need to worry about it!"" I just feel like all the hard work I put in for years to make something of my life has been trashed by the last couple of years and that's been extremely hard to come to grips with. It's not like people see this as an illness, it's just a glaring red flag not to hire me. I've been working for my parents and taking some classes ever since I started getting therapy and functioning better just to show that I've been doing something with myself, but the work is irrelevant to my field and doesn't even come close to covering the gap in my work history.

Has anyone else ever had to cope with this kind of situation? I'm just so frustrated. I know that there was no way I could've just continued working and ""gotten over it."" Getting treatment was necessary, I just didn't get the right treatment in a timely fashion. I just don't know what to do about it. I feel so unmotivated to even try because I feel like everyone else my age has been working and getting better at what they do and I'm completely out of the loop. Even though I did have a good job when I worked and know I'll get excellent recommendations from my old bosses, I don't feel like that's enough for anyone. Hell, I feel like no one will even take a resume with nothing substantial since the end of 2012 seriously at all.

I've considered things like going back to school full time or getting an apprenticeship and a part time job to get back in my field while making some money, but I don't even know how plausible THAT is given my past.

Sorry for the wall if text, I just felt like I needed to provide context for why things are the way they are. So:

I have completed many projects in my free time as a programming hobbyist and I feel I am strong at answering both technical and non-technical subjects in interviews. I also have a year and a half of internship experience developing enterprise software at a large financial company. My GPA is about 2.9 (hopefully will pull up to a 3 after my last semester is completed but I'm not counting on it). Its mostly because I'm a bit of a workaholic that stretches himself thin. 

I also have always felt like the goal of school is to learn rather than to get high grades. If busting my ass to get a good grade adds less to my knowledge than spending time pursuing my own hobby programming and other interests I have a hard time motivating myself to get more than a B. I don't feel like this reflects on my workplace work ethic since the goal there is to provide a good product or service to the team or client.

I just interviewed with a less-famous consulting firm which does both management and technology consulting. I got to the final round (which consisted of a two day several-interview process) and I think it went really well. I had the VPs giving me positive feedback as I was leaving, something other candidates I spoke to did not get. I expect to hear back from them with positive news but I'm not getting my hopes up yet. This has inspired me to consider consulting more seriously as it seems like an amazing field. Originally I was planning on going into software development for a typical big tech company but now I'm seriously considering what other kinds of consulting companies I could get an interview with. 

My question is, what places will consider me despite my GPA and non-target school? I know MBB is out of the question, and honestly I'd feel a little intimidated working alongside the likes of Rhodes Scholars.... What are companies like Accenture like?

Thanks!"

Midwest area
About to graduate with a 62K starting salary in the IT Field. 

About $18,000 in Federal college loans. @3.4%-4.6% 
Which totals out to ~$180 a month. 

After taxes I believe I'll make around $1800 bi-weekly. I already have a Roth-IRA I've been contributing too. And a employee 401k which I have current access to as an intern. 

My rent expense will be around $600-750 (including utilities, etc) 
Car expense $300-400 (Including insurance, gas, payments, etc)
Food is around $200-300(I cook home mostly) 

My main goal is to live on half my salary. Which seems pretty possible even including my student loan payment. That means I'll have an extra $1800 (post-tax) to play around with. 

Question: Should I aggressively pay off the student loans?  OR try to put that money somewhere else where I can expect a higher return. 

If I aggressively pay back my loans I can knock them out less than a years time.

Edit: 

Emergency fund will be built up! Sorry should have included that. "

With this post I wanted to sort of vent my story, but most importantly thank everyone here for the support.

Early 2013, I fell really sick. After 2 months of enduring it, I decided to see a GI knowing that it could be Crohn's like my dad.

Over the next 6 months I underwent several colonoscopies and blood tests. I was doing my internship at a start up web development company, but had to let the job offer go because I was not capable of functioning in the company due to my health at the time.
With daily fever, diarrhea and my new start as a web developer slipping away, you could say I was having a shitty summer. In the midst of this all, I received more bad news that got added to the pile. I was diagnosed with Marfan Syndrome.

After a stay in the hospital I was finally diagnosed with Crohn's disease on November 1st.

I started my treatment, started feeling like I could take on the world and was getting hopeful for my future once more. This lasted till just past new year when I had to taper off my Entocort and started feeling worse again.

While I had struggled with depression before, my fear for what my future could be like made me slip back into depression. I doubted myself, my reasoning and my purpose. Starting off on 6MP at the time didn't really help me a lot. The fear of what a drug like that could do to me was screwing with my head.

Now, 6 months after I started taking 6mp, I am starting to feel slightly optimistic. My blood results are cautiously optimistic and I started therapy in September to work on my psychological issues.

So far for my story (I tried to keep it short :))

What I left out however, is the **AMAZING** support I received from the people of /r/CrohnsDisease 

Every step of the way. When facing doubt, fear or other issues. This sub was there to help me out. I made new friends on the IRC channel (seriously, drop by everyone :)) and knew I wasn't in this alone thanks to every one of you. "

I did not apply, they contacted me from a ""resume book"" from my college, I did not plan on doing an internship but the opportunity would be amazing!

So I just had my first real interview today with them and after reading advice on this sub all weekend, practicing in front of mirror and family I felt pretty prepared. Now I am extremely introverted so this was nerve wreaking to begin with. 

Overall I felt that I did a decent job, the interviewer mainly wanted to know if I had any questions and we chatted. Now there were a few red flags, 1. he asked if I had anymore interviews lined up and he said I should go do more interviews for practice and 2. he stated he has to interview 5 more people and there is only one to three positions available but he doesn't know for sure.

So what do you think? Am I over thinking this or do these flags prove that I probably did not get the job?

Also now I want to get a tax internship! Should I walk in other CPA firms and ask if they have any positions for tax either as an intern or part time? Or just look through my university career center for available positions?

One last question! If I can't find a tax position for next semester what are your guys opinion on working at H&amp;R Block? I am pretty sure I can get a job there..."

**How do I get that first entry level job?**
.
So where to begin.....
.
I've been struggling pretty hard since 2008. 
.
**Some Stats**
.
* Worked as cashier from high school to 2008
* Lost job at end of 2008 enrolled in a community college
* Graduated with an Associates in Liberal Arts, 3.8 GPA in 2010
* Graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from a small private non-profit college, 2.9 GPA in early 2013
* Worked as Dish washer while going to college
* Couldn't get an internship while in college or after graduating
* Unemployed for 8 months after graduating and then found a job doing manual labor in a warehouse, still my current job
* Currently 30, $40,000 in student loan debt (I can't even pay), no savings, no retirement, working six days a week breaking my back to afford my tiny studio apartment and high millage old used car. 
* In a major metro area with around 5 million people
* I make close to the federal poverty level in wages for a single person for the year
.
**I can't: **
* Relocate, I just renewed a 1 year lease for my apartment and I don't have savings to move with
* Move back in with parents, that's not an option
.
.
So I find the stock market very interesting, the valuation of companies very interesting and looking at data very interesting. I thought that becoming a Financial Analyst looked like a job that I would enjoy. I've tried applying to entry level positions and internships but I've been unable to get an interview for ether. 
.
I thought that being a Business Analyst looked interesting as well. I'm currently trying to teach my self SQL through the internet and I am very good with Excel. I've also been applying to entry level Business Analyst positions and internships with no results. 
.
I've had my resume professionally redone several times and I've had interview coaching, but I keep getting a response back ""You don't have enough experience"" for entry level positions and internships ""We are only interested in current college students"" or I never heard back. I've gone to many job fairs and networking events with no success to break into the entry level business world.
.
I've been able to get interviews and job offers for low wage retail/manual labor jobs. I've tried to become a teller at a bank or customer service representative with a bank to get my foot in the door but I keep getting told I am unqualified to be a bank teller or customer service representative for a bank because of lack of bank experience. I've tried to get in with Robert Half, Accountemps, Office team to get office experience but they told me they couldn't place me in any positions what so ever because of a lack of previous office experience. 
.
I got a Bachelor of Science as opposed to a Bachelor of Arts by taking extra Accounting, Finance and Statistics classes. I thought that would make me more employable. But I've been stuck in the same low wage jobs that I had before I went to college. 
.
My current employer is a high turn over job doing manual labor in a warehouse. I have a good reputation as a hard worker and someone who has stuck around. I've looked at some of the internal corporate postings and to move into corporate they require at minimum masters degrees and 10 years of experience for almost all entry level corporate postings. Talking to my managers they do not think that I would be able to move beyond my current level with out the experience and education they now require (They didn't require all this extra stuff back before 2008). I really want to get out of back breaking work and do work with a computer.
.
My biggest goal is to ~~be able to find a career I enjoy,~~ make a wage that pays enough to survive and pay off my student loans. 
.
.
.
Any advice besides trying to find a time machine before all this outsourcing and ridiculous education/experience requirements stuff started?

I made up a throwaway for this in case he does reddit, btw.  Sorry for the long backstory.  I've been obsessing about this all weekend and I took the day off of work to figure this out.  Any help or perspective you can give me would be appreciated.

Backstory: I grew up in a suburban area of upstate New York.  In HS I met Jim and we dated for most of senior year.  Jim was awesome.  He was an honest to god eagle scout (I went to the ceremony) and brilliant.  He was a soccer player and did a lot of climbing so he was buff.  He was the nicest guy ever and I was thrilled to be his girlfriend.  He got into RPI and I got into a west coast university though so we decided to split up instead of trying a LTR at the end of the summer.  He was great.  But I wanted to have some experience before I settled down and I got into a very prestigious program.  We promised each other that if we still felt strongly about each other after graduation we would consider settling down together.

We both went to school and after keeping touch with each other online for a few years (and hooking up around the holidays when we both went home to see family) we started to drift apart.  He was in a very demanding program and so was I.  We each dated other people.  He had a girlfriend for at least part of his undergraduate career and I dated several guys (only one “seriously” 18 months).  Then Jim’s mom died, he took a semester off from school, and I lost touch almost completely.  I had an internship that took me to South America where I had a few bad boyfriends (Latin men grrrr ) and then one disastrous relationship with a grad student in my department that escalated to a restraining order. After that I swore off relationships and just dated casually when I got back to the States. 

After college I took a job in Sand Diego and did really well.  I got promoted twice in two years.  I also started to see all my friends start to get married and have babies.  Things weren’t looking too favorable in that direction for me (I haven’t had a “relationship” with a man for more than six weeks in the last two years).  After discovering a guy I liked was already sleeping with two other women in my department with no sign of commitment in sight I decided to stop fooling around.  I wanted babies and a husband I knew but not with the clowns I was dating.  When I thought about it long and hard enough I realized I still wanted Jim.

I looked him up on FB and found out he was still in our old home town.  I did some investigating and learned that he had gone back to school and finished his degree, then had gone to work for an aerospace company for awhile before he opened his own consultancy.  His Linkdn profile was incredible.  So was his house and the articles in our local paper about his community work.  I reached out to some of our old mutual friends and found out he was still single. Bingo! Or so I thought.

My parents had both left our town when they divorced but my sister was still there.  She had married a guy who got her pregnant and settled into a working class life.  I went to visit her and see my nieces and nephews for Halloween because the oldest also had a football game championships or something.  I also used the chance to look up Jim.  We had a coffee date the day after Halloween.

Jim looked great.  If it was possible he looked better than he had as a kid.  He worked out hard and it showed.  He had gotten even more handsome as he matured.  He also dressed really well, very professionally.  He was still the nicest guy.  He jumped at the chance to see me for coffee and we reconnected.  All that goofy eagle scout charm was still there.

At first things were great.  We caught up with each other and our families (I always loved his family, and his father in particular).  He was doing very, very well, building a lake house, fishing, working, enjoying life.  He sounded like he was very happy.  It sounds crazy but it was like I wanted a piece of that.  All the old magic came back, how comfortable I felt with him, how I didn’t feel like I had to be anyone special with him, that spark when I looked in his eyes or touched his hand.  It was all there and even worse than it had been.  He had matured into such a good looking, successful man. I had no idea how he had gone this long without getting married.  He wanted kids.  Really wanted them.  

I asked him why he hadn’t gotten married, just casually.  That’s when things started going wrong.

He told me he hadn’t found any woman who met his standards.  I was confused and asked him what he meant.  Jim said that he was very serious about family, and that he wasn’t willing to settle for less than a worthy woman.  He would not go down the aisle for less than that.

I was a little upset by that.  I reminded him about our promise, just light heartedly.  I thought he would laugh but he got real serious instead.  He asked me if I still had feelings for him.  I told him that I wasn’t sure, I thought I might, but I’d have to find out.  He said he still had some feelings for me, which made me feel great.  But he didn’t act like he was happy about it.

I asked if he was still attracted to me, and he said yes.  I told him I was still attracted to him.  I also told him I was open to exploring those feelings again.  He agreed and said he was, too, and I thought everything was fine, then.  But he didn’t look fine.  When I pressed him he admitted that he was worried about investing in a relationship long distance.  I reminded him that he could run his consultancy from anywhere which must have been the wrong thing to say.

That’s when he hit me with the sledgehammer.  He asked me why I thought I was “worthy”.  I wasn’t sure what he meant at first, and I asked him to explain (I was starting to get tense).  That’s when he told me that he was still attracted to me and of all of his girlfriends he had enjoyed our time together the most, and had even considered a future with me, but that he didn’t really know me very well anymore.  He still had feelings for my 18 year old self but didn’t know the mature 25 year old woman I had become.

That was fair.  I didn’t really know him anymore either, although it felt like we were still back in high school.  He was so much more of a man than I’d imagined him becoming it was amazing.  I was really looking forward to getting to know him again.  He just seemed really reluctant, I thought at the time due to the distance. 

The more we talked the more it became clear we were still both willing to consider the possibilities.  That was more than I’d hoped for honestly.  But then he asked me that “worthy” question again and we were back to square one.  I was starting to feel a little judged.  I asked him again by what he meant by that.  He was still serious when he asked me “just what I thought would make me a good wife”.

I was floored.  We hadn’t even been out on a date in over five years and he was questioning me about what kind of wife I’d be!  I got a little pissed off.  He noticed that (he’s not an idiot) but instead of backing down he looked me in the eye and explained that if he was considering the possibility of proposing to a woman that he wanted to know what he was getting.  I told him he’d be getting me, all the good, all the bad.

  That wasn’t a good enough answer, though.  He wanted me to pitch myself to me like some goddamn commercial.  It was a little humiliating but I was pissed enough to play along to prove what an ass he was being.  I told him about what a great goddamned woman I am, how good I am at my job, how we’d have plenty of money with our combined incomes, how I was healthy and respected.  I was confused.  I didn’t know if he wanted a statement of personal net worth or what.  
He told me it was a start, which really pissed me off.  That’s when he told me he wasn’t marrying my resume.  He wanted to know what kind of “wife” I’d be.  I explained that I would be an equal and honest partner.  It didn’t matter to me who made more money to me (I thought he might be intimidated by my job, which is silly because I know he makes more money than me by far).  He also said he would only ask a woman once to marry him and that he would only marry once in his life.  I asked him what would happen if it didn’t work out?  He told me he wasn’t going to get into a marriage that wouldn’t work out, which was why he was so stubborn about this.

That wasn’t the worst of it though.  The absolute worst of it was when we started talking about sex.  I admit that I was thinking about sex since the moment I saw him again.  He was the second boy I had ever slept with and the best until college.  He had only gotten hotter.  I’d like to think I did too (California living).  But when he brought up sex I actually blushed.  I thought he was teasing.  But he straight out asked what my “number” was.

I was shocked and offended.  I told him that was none of his business.  He just looked stubborn and said that any woman he would consider marrying would have to be forthright (I had to look it up) about her “number” with him.  He said that if I wanted to be his wife I would have to be completely honest about my past, including the number of men I’d been with.  My brain kind of threw up.

On the one hand, it is none of his business.  On the other hand he was so genuine and direct about it I kind of respect that.  He went on to say that women with a “high partner count” were less reliable wives.  I asked him to explain that and he said they were more prone to cheating and divorce.  I thought that was the most ridiculous thing I’d ever heard and said so.  I changed the subject to the sexy possibilities of married life with me and he seemed willing to leave it alone.  That was revealing too however.  He asked me how often I could see having sex with my husband (he didn’t say him, just “my husband”) when married.  I thought that was a stupid question and said so.  Then I laid it on thick and acted all goofy and said that I’d be at his beck and call sexually if I was his little wifey.

At that point I was a little disgusted and a little hurt anyway.  I had hoped to re-connect with Jim and explore my feelings for him and to my surprise I had plenty to explore.  He had seemed very friendly and even flirty until I talked about marriage.  Then he got weird.  We had things mostly patched up by the time we were done (4 ½ hours, a new coffee date record!) and he even gave me a hug and a kiss.  What kind of kiss?  The kind that makes you catch your breath and feel faint and want to have babies.  NOT the brotherly peck I expected to get after asking all those questions.  I was starting to think about inviting him back to my motel for dinner when he broke it off suddenly.  That’s when he asked me if I was serious about considering a long-term relationship.  Actually, the way he said it was “So do you want to be seriously considered as a wife, or are you just fucking around?” After our discussion I didn’t know what to say.  I told him I’d get back to him on that, he’d given me a lot to think about.

Since I left I can’t stop thinking about Jim and his hard-assed approach to commitment.  The thing is, I actually respect it.  He knows what he wants.  I’m just not sure it’s me, even though I’m starting to want him more and more.  I get the feeling he wouldn’t be into moving to California to be with me, even though he could do his job anywhere, because his dad is elderly and in poor health.  But since this last promotion I’m not really tied down to one place anymore either.  I could move back to NY if I wanted to and still do my job.  In some ways it would make it easier.  

I guess my big question is, are Jim’s standards just too high for me to consider? I started thinking about my “number”.  I know the whole “if he’s worth it, he won’t judge” line, but the fact is Jim really IS worth it.  He’s a hell of a great guy by any standard.  The guy you want to be the father of your children and the one who puts the ring on your finger.  He’s the kind of guy who would dive into a river to save a child or spend his vacation building houses for the poor.  Funny, smart, good looking, strong, well off.  He’s absolutely perfect, and the more I think about our conversation, the more I’m thinking I want him.  But is he going to want me?  When I started to think about the number of men I’ve been intimate with, the numbers do start to add up.  But Jim made it pretty clear that if I was going to have a shot, I’d have to be absolutely honest about that.  

I’m so fucking confused right now I don’t know what to do.  And I’m afraid if I mess up this opportunity it will never come again.  What should I do?  Any and all advice would be appreciated, and I'll try to answer any questions I can.  Really, keep it constructive.  My sister and mother say I should throw myself at him by any means necessary (my sister has had a crush on him for years) but my BFF says he's being unreasonable, nosy, and controlling and that I can do better.  But I just can't see any better coming along.  HELP!

**tl;dr**:Reconnected with my HS sweetheart, had sparks and definite interest, but when subject of marriage and commitment came up he got  stiff and wanted to know what made me ""worthy"" to be his wife - WTF?  When did this become a job interview?!



***UPDATE***

Okay, first thanks to everyone for the great advice. This is the first time I've crowd-sourced this kind of thing, and I'm finding it oddly helpful, even the negative comments.  To recap, 

Reconnected with Jim, my HS flame, as we both hit a more mature part of our lives. Had a single coffee date where we discussed our past relationship, but when it came to the idea of commitment things got weird. 

Jim and I have been talking for the last two nights, and in general things have been really good.  I mean REALLY good.  We set aside the awkward relationship crap for the benefit of actually getting to know each other again beyond catching up.  There are definately sparks there on both sides. 

This was complicated somewhat by me doing some research, based partly on what was suggested in this forum.  Someone said something about the possibility of Jim being a ""redpiller"", and I had no idea what that was and had to do some research.  After a couple of hours I came to the conclusion that Jim might be a redpiller but he never brought it up, nor do I think that's all that important. From what I can see by the few sites I've visited it isn't as big of a deal as some of you made it out to be at least for me.  Jim isn't a misogynist, he is just very sure of what he wants out of life.  I respect that.  Actually, that's one of the things I found extremely attractive about him. I've dated enough flaky men over the years who had no plan, it's quite refreshing to meet a man who has an idea of what he wants.

There are plenty of other issues, of course. We've talked for a total of 6 1/2 hours, to the point where we both agreed to take a break tonight.  We covered a lot of territory, and yes, much of it was about relationships, sex, family, marriage, etc. That doesn't scare either of us.  We're both there.  

But there are issues.  Some of you described Jim as narcissistic, which I would disagree with. He's quite self deprecating and charming.  He really doesn't like talking about himself which I would think would be important for a narcissist. To the point where I had to drag some stuff out of him.  He doesn't do sports, despite his fitness orientation, which sucks for me because I'm a HUGE baseball fan. He doesn't like horror movies, he doesn't eat rice (who doesn't eat rice?) and he wants just a few more kids than me. My career is an issue for him, and yes, my sexual history did come back up in a moderate way.  So did his. It's clear I've had more sexual experience than him, in terms of partners, and while we haven't discussed this specifically since our coffee date, it was a little awkward.  

I don't know what to think about that.  From what I can tell, Jim has only been with a handful of women, so I guess from his perspective I can understand why my history looks a little daunting.  He's only had two real relationships since High School.  Part of me thinks that's noble, endearing and thoughtful, but part of me is wondering what's wrong with him.

And that's the big problem for me.  I keep trying to find something wrong with him.  My mother thinks I'm trying to subconsciously self-sabotage my relationships to deprive her of grandchildren, because every time she talks to me about Jim I keep voicing doubts.  But every one I mention she counters with something about a former boyfriend who was much worse, but was still acceptable.  She says I'm going to screw this up.  Thanks, Mom.

My BFF on the other hand is siding with many commentors: no guy is that perfect.  He's probably a child molester or something.  She hates the fact that he's a Boy Scout leader, for instance, because she thinks that's creepy for a man who doesn't have a son.  She also thinks his reluctance to plunge into a LDR with a woman he barely knows somehow makes him unsuitable for me.  Of course she also said she'd steal him away from me in a heartbeat after she saw a picture, pervert or not, so I got that vote of approval at least.  She thinks it's really strange that he doesn't even have a dating profile listed on any of the major sites.  She thinks I'm going to screw this up, too.  Thanks, BFF.

We want to give a chance to some IS and CS students. We are asking basic things on the interviews, like ""explain me DNS"" or ""tell me what is DHCP used for"" and ""command to find IP address"" stuff like that. Now, we want to narrow down or choices by calling some people for a third interview in which they can do a presentation or we can set up a scenario that they need to solve. 

So I'm asking if anybody can help me with some ideas of what kind of scenario-based questions or troubleshooting we can ask/tell them to do. We are also, thinking about telling them to do a presentation (in like how to set up a samba server, how to create a linux container) again, something somewhat basic.

One that we like is, setting up a Windows workstation with static IP but without DNS configured and see who can troubleshoot it."

Here is what is listed for experience:
**Education and Experience

    A degree/diploma in business/supply chain management or equivalent and working towards a SCMP or CPPB designation.
    A minimum three years experience in procurement, sourcing, inventory and contract/supplier management; experience in the public sector and familiarity with the municipal budget process, is preferable.
    Strong organizational and communications skills, effective negotiating and analytical skills, and  the ability to multi-task and meet multiple deadlines is required,
    Working knowledge of procurement contract and case law,
    Demonstrated ability to establish effective working relationships with client departments and outside agencies,
    Experience with cooperative purchasing initiatives is an asset,
    Experience with automated procurement/inventory modules and strong knowledge of Microsoft computer programs is an asset.**

So I received two offers for Summer 2015 internships - one from Company A, and one from Company B.  Both are big companies in Wisconsin.  Company A is willing to pay roughly $25/hour, while Company B will only be paying $17.50/hour.

I understand that the difference between these pay figure is astounding and should make this an obvious decision, but the position at Company A is more of ""Technology Leadership"" position, while Company B is an actual programming position.  I would really like to program, and from talking to the people at Company A it sounds like my work there wouldn't involve much, if any, programming.  I have also attended an open house at Company A, and I really love the environment and people there.  I could certainly see myself being happy with a full-time position at this company after graduation.

What would your advice be in this situation?"

*One month and Three Weeks after the Vancouver Incident*

It had taken them an entire week to limp their way to the Third Planet of the Epsilon Eridani system. The Ships head engineer had survived the explosion that had occurred with the missile had impacted the Bladed Claw. Unfortunately for him, without access to a fully stocked med-bay he would never walk again, his legs having been crushed by a collapsing bulkhead. He was quickly turned into an instructor as SSgt Brooks started pumping him for information in order to keep everyone alive. 

Epsilon Eridani - 3 was a beautiful world. Gravity was one G, Oxygen/Nitrogen atmosphere. No apparent toxins or pathogens in the air that could cause the Humans on board any problems. Dr. Cranex however was worried about the rest of the crew. The gravity was 30% greater then what was galactic standard and the atmosphere thicker. It was frankly perfect for the combination of military and civilian personnel.  

Capt. Drake felt the planet was beautiful as it filled the view screen, but it wasn’t home. It was untouched wilderness with its own challenges to their continued survival. Thankfully only the Corti had bothered to chart the systems within about twenty light-years of Earth. None of them had been interesting to the Corti save Earth, and the lack of any Temperate worlds Class 9 or below they were seen as uninhabitable to the other races of the Dominion.  

They had to survive first, then they had to find others. If thirty-four of them had been abducted by the crew of the Bladed Claw, then the number of humans out there could have been in the hundreds of thousands, possibly millions. Jackson Drake, and the majority of the humans on board, had all sworn oaths to defend their countries and their peoples from all enemies foreign and domestic.  

But what was the operational objective? He had thought about that over the last week as they had tried to learn how to fly this alien craft to safety. It was clear to him that Earth was in danger. Who that danger was from was up for debate. The Corti Directorate definitely ranked up there. The Hunters not far behind on Drake’s scale. The Hunters were for all intents and purposes Ambush predators/cannibals. They could be defeated with minimal effort it seemed. The Corti however were amoral scientists that would be facing life sentences back home if they had tried any of their actions within Earth Jurisdictions… most of them at least. 

Then there was the Celzi Alliance, they were currently at war with the Interspecies Dominion from the limited amount of intel they could gather from the ships database. That was another thing they needed, information. When they got back to Earth, not if, then they would need to be able to let their respective commands know of the general and specific details of life out here as they could. The database was the first step. 

One of the abuductees on board was a detective with the NYPD, a Claudia Dresden. Det. Dresden had been collecting evidence and assessing all the information they had available to them and had kept Drake up to date on what she had learned. For now she was their best choice for an intelligence officer. There was just so much they didn’t know, that they needed to know. The state of the Galaxy, the politics, the economics. They needed that information, if only so they could determine their next course of action. 

Clearly they had to return to Earth. The ship provided a fully operational FTL drive, at least according to Brooks. The only reason they couldn’t use it at the moment was because they weren’t certain on what damage may have occurred when they were hit. 
He hit the public address button on the central chair and spoke, “Alright everyone, we are about to make planet fall. Strap yourself in and hold on tight, we may encounter a little bit of turbulence and then… explode.” 

A few people on the bridge couldn’t help but chuckle at that. Seaman Matthews had figured out how to fly the ship rather easily once he figured out what controls were what. Navigation towards Epsilon-3 had been easy enough with the ships navigation suite. They had made orbit that same day and drilled the survivors of the crew hard for the last day about re-entry procedures. It seemed a lot of things had been automated to the point of excluding the need for an organic pilot.  

One of the other soldiers had medic training. Specialist DuFrane had been learning from Cranex. DuFrane had been working towards a Medical Degree, hoping to get his commission and serve as a medical officer. When asked, the man had said he wanted to help people as best he could, to cure them instead of making them feel better while they died. Cranex had begrudgingly accepted him as an intern. Drake had everyone he could all over the ship, trying to keep them busy while he figured out their next move. 

Maybe things would become clearer on solid ground. "

I recently had a job interview in chicago and was really excited for it.  They sent a plane and picked me and some other people up for the interview but just from that group I felt like I was the best canidate due to my higher GPA and my previous internships. The job interview was split up into two parts; a meet and greet and then formal interviews.  During the meet and greet I felt that I did all I could to show my interest in the company and how I wanted the job.  I talked to as many people as I could have and even talked to the hiring manager who felt that I was a good candidate for the job.  During the interview I felt that I answered all of their questions well and felt confident leaving it that I did everything I possibly could have to nail the job interview.  They told us that we would hear back from them within two weeks to find out.  It has been three weeks and I talked to one of the guys who flew out with me and they called him back and he accepted the job.  My problem is I felt that I was doing really well in the interview and I know I'm a better engineer than him based on school and internships.  It just hurts that I didn't get it and he got it and he barely cared about it as much as I did.  Sorry for ranting but I guess I'm just upset over this big lost.  "

He told me that he was going to call me today and if he didn't get ahold of me, for me to call him.  He only had one more person to interview on Monday and would try to let me know afterward.  So I waited until 3:30 and tried his phone only to get his message system.  I tried again a couple times over the next couple hours, I just figured he was on the phone with clients, etc.  I got ahold of him around 5:40 and didn't expect him to answer.  He pretty much acted like he didn't remember who I was or what I had interviewed for.  He then told me he had two more people to interview and would let me know by email Wednesday.

2l7rhf,1,2014-11-03,Internship/Job offer advice,wesder4,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2l7rhf/internshipjob_offer_advice/,"**Little background info:** CS major. Prior to this fall semester I had some extenuating circumstances that forced me to move about an hour and a half away. I then applied and was accepted to an internship with the county government where I now live. Moving forced me to switch to my schools online Software Engineering degree.

I didn't find the online courses very fulfilling and felt I wasn't learning a whole lot so I decided to switch back to CS on campus for the upcoming spring semester. The online program is also very new so I was one of the furthest along in the degree. I wasn't able to register for some classes that I was able to get into because the classes were not created yet due to the lack of students who were at that same level.

I told my boss that I might be moving back down to go to in person classes. They said that if I stay I will have a job working there. The starting hourly salary is about $21 an hour and the starting salaried position is about 50-55 thousand a year. I'm not sure exactly what I would be getting paid but I assume the hourly pay. Seems crazy to be offered something like after working jobs that paid slightly over minimum wage.

I have a few options here

1. Stay up here, take the position and stay in the online program
2. Stay up here, take the position and switch to a private school (ERAU) as a software engineering major. (This program is a little different as far as degree requirements. More physics classes for instance. The tuition is also far more than the state school but may be doable if I get scholarships)
3. Decline the position and move back down.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!    "

She put her bags down in the closet and looked around her new room. It was on the top floor of the company's hotel, with a beautiful view of the city beyond the decorated courtyard and office buildings surrounding the glass-dome entrance in the center of the complex, where she still saw men walk and and out periodically. The room reminded her of the centerpieces in furniture catalogs, all pristinely cleaned and organized like it was meant for viewing, not using. Despite its uncanny cleanliness, Tress felt almost unusually comfortable in the room, like it was inviting her and her alone in to rest and relax. She noticed an LCD panel on the wall near the door which seemed to control temperature and lighting. Feeling a light draft from the open window across the lofty room, she pressed  the ""+"" mark until she felt comfortable, and made her way to the mahogany desk set up adjacent to the bed. 

Opening her computer, she found only a few emails had been sent to her since she left for England. Her old high school friend had sent her a few albums from her recent Bahama vacation in celebration of her engagement. Jamie asked how things have been, and what had been going on at her internship. Tress had been discouraged from communicating heavily with her family on the business trip, but she still took the time to respond to her email. Seeing Jamie's new picture, she was amazed at how much they had both matured since High school when they separated. Jamie now had full B cups by the look of it; Tress remembered how they both had been called flat chested by their peers through high school. Tress, however, hadn't changed much physically. She still had 34As, and narrow hips that made her look boyish most of the time. While aesthetically attractive, she was never feminine in any way that one could call her ""sexy"" or even ""hot"". While Jamie had been with that guy for two years now, Tress always tried to avoid admitting she was still a virgin, and that her fling with Corey in 12th grade never got past some mild making out. Since high school her devotion to her desire to become a computer scientist put her in a field dominated by men at best with the same relationship history as her, and like her avoided getting involved at the expense of time and energy.

Below Jamie's email was her boss, who sent her a link to an overview of her trip. Having tirelessly accosted her boss for a schedule that she could read before she left, she now felt relieved that he finally ceded to her requests and she could find out what she was to do over the next fortnight. She opened the surprisingly small word document and found it only contained a single line:


		10:30 14 April: Report to orientation lobby 110A for introductions and briefing


Perplexed by the Spartan-like military briefness of the document, she remarked at why it would be in a separate Word Document anyway. She checked it there was any hidden text in the document, but she found that her whole job wouldn't be disclosed until the following morning. What kind of job is this that provides its employees with such luscious rooms yet doesn't tell them what they're actually here to do? She sent her boss a quick email asking if there had been a mistake, and got an immediate reply

	RE: Unexpcted Briefness of my Schedule

	Dear Ms. Evergreen,

		The schedule contains everything necessary for you so far. Please follow its 	instructions and follow what commands are given to you at the briefing, thank you.

She felt like her situation had become even more Kafkaesque, but she felt less exceedingly attentive at this moment, and decided to leave it at that and find out what she could tomorrow.

After working on her product report due when she returned home for a few hours, she decided to get an early rest and went to look for the bathroom before heading to bed. At the end of the long carpeted hallway was possibly the most extravagant restroom she had ever seen. Nearly the size of her childhood bedroom, a long glass sink ran down an 18ft counter top next to a 5ft high mirror. In the center was a glass bathtub which stood in front of a wall literally covering the adjacent wall. Already impressed by her accommodations so far, this was incredible. Tantalized by the sheer quality of the setup, she decided to take a bath now, at least when she was not bogged down by the stress of work she would most likely feel tomorrow.

She undressed and turned the curved handle counterclockwise to let water rush in. Placing her right foot in, the water seemed heavier than what she expected, like the water was pressing down on her foot from added weight. Putting her other foot in, she turned herself before lying down and saw her naked body in the full wall mirror. While she had seen her naked self a hundred times before, this time she was surprised by what she saw. Her hair was definitely brighter, now seeming like a dark hazel rather than a dark mahogany, and she noticed it went down to her shoulders now. She lifted up her hair and found it felt smoother, more shiny, like she had just conditioned it. She before had always been lax about personal hygiene and presentation, never doing more than minimum so that she never smelled bad, but never smelled ""good"". But her hair made it seem like she had put effort into it, like she wanted people to notice her, even though Tress had never cared about people noticing her for anything other than her intelligence. Still looking at herself it seemed like her whole body was fuller. Her breasts looked almost like she was pushing out her chest, and feeling them she noticed that she could now grab a small chunk without effort, rather than having to press against her skin to really fondle her flat chest. It was like her now 34B breasts wanted to be held, wanted to be touched. She thought it must just be weight gain or her period after sitting in a plane for 10 hours, but it still perplexed her. Holding onto her left breast, she looked down to her hips, which now appeared to jut out more than she had ever noticed before. She dragged her left hand down to feel the contour of her side and felt her hand go farther out. She put her hand on her ass. It was so plump! The whole thing felt rounder, wider, and more... inviting? She didn't know what to make of it, except that it made her feel slightly... horny. By then the water had almost reached the edge of the tub, so she turned around and bent over to turn it off. In that position, leaning over the faucet, something motivated her to turn around and look back at the mirror to see what she looked like now. Between the wider mound of her hips were her protruding lips of her luscious vagina. It now looked like it was screaming to be filled; wet at the edges, it opening up slightly between her hips so that a big fat cock could thrust in and fill her...

Wait, what was she thinking? She turned back around and stood up to collect her thoughts. Was she just... wait what? At that moment she felt a wave of shame rush over her as she stepped out of the tub and sat down in the corner of the room. She thought, ""What the fuck is wrong with me? Did I just fantasize about... that? Do I... do that sort of thing?"" At once all her resentment of the more sexually promiscuous and more ""adventurous"" girls from high school and college came flooding back to her now. She rarely masturbated, and often did so only to relive stress or feel connected to someone else. She never trailed off into fantasy, even when boys she admitted to be attractive do what they can to flirt with her, and get rejected. But there, right there in the tub, she had transformed into the worst of the Beckies, Brittanies, Sashas, Trixxes, and Kourtneys which she found revolting and even pitied. She started crying. She was emotional, not sexual. If she was to marry, she would do based on personality, charm, and kindness, not dominance, appearance, or... penis size. Trying as hard as she could to empty her mind, she sat for a few minutes and then quickly entered the tub to wash off, and after brushing her teeth got to bed as quickly as possible.


""It was just a weird moment, probably will never happen again."" She thought to calm herself down, ""Why am I freaking out so much, we all have intrusive thoughts, but only recurring when they tie to the person we are, and I'm not that kind of person. I ... uh... never find that kind of stuff sexy, or attractive, or... anything. I'm a smart girl, women with 35s on their ACT and valedictorians are not... sluts. I am not a slut."" She continued these internal affirmations until she no longer felt affected by the incident, and drifted off to sleep.

[MF, Bimbofication]",BDTHrooaway,eroticliterature,https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticliterature/comments/2l8cl2/starting_a_new_story_does_anyone_want_me_to/,"Tress was still skeptical at why her boss would send a 6 month intern on a 2 week business trip to England, let alone the fact that he paid for all accommodations and expenses, as if her leisure was a financial asset to the company. She put her bags down in the closet and looked around her new room. It was on the top floor of the company's hotel, with a beautiful view of the city beyond the decorated courtyard and office buildings surrounding the glass-dome entrance in the center of the complex, where she still saw men walk and and out periodically. The room reminded her of the centerpieces in furniture catalogs, all pristinely cleaned and organized like it was meant for viewing, not using. Despite its uncanny cleanliness, Tress felt almost unusually comfortable in the room, like it was inviting her and her alone in to rest and relax. She noticed an LCD panel on the wall near the door which seemed to control temperature and lighting. Feeling a light draft from the open window across the lofty room, she pressed  the ""+"" mark until she felt comfortable, and made her way to the mahogany desk set up adjacent to the bed. 

Opening her computer, she found only a few emails had been sent to her since she left for England. Her old high school friend had sent her a few albums from her recent Bahama vacation in celebration of her engagement. Jamie asked how things have been, and what had been going on at her internship. Tress had been discouraged from communicating heavily with her family on the business trip, but she still took the time to respond to her email. Seeing Jamie's new picture, she was amazed at how much they had both matured since High school when they separated. Jamie now had full B cups by the look of it; Tress remembered how they both had been called flat chested by their peers through high school. Tress, however, hadn't changed much physically. She still had 34As, and narrow hips that made her look boyish most of the time. While aesthetically attractive, she was never feminine in any way that one could call her ""sexy"" or even ""hot"". While Jamie had been with that guy for two years now, Tress always tried to avoid admitting she was still a virgin, and that her fling with Corey in 12th grade never got past some mild making out. Since high school her devotion to her desire to become a computer scientist put her in a field dominated by men at best with the same relationship history as her, and like her avoided getting involved at the expense of time and energy.

Below Jamie's email was her boss, who sent her a link to an overview of her trip. Having tirelessly accosted her boss for a schedule that she could read before she left, she now felt relieved that he finally ceded to her requests and she could find out what she was to do over the next fortnight. She opened the surprisingly small word document and found it only contained a single line:


		10:30 14 April: Report to orientation lobby 110A for introductions and briefing


Perplexed by the Spartan-like military briefness of the document, she remarked at why it would be in a separate Word Document anyway. She checked it there was any hidden text in the document, but she found that her whole job wouldn't be disclosed until the following morning. What kind of job is this that provides its employees with such luscious rooms yet doesn't tell them what they're actually here to do? She sent her boss a quick email asking if there had been a mistake, and got an immediate reply

	RE: Unexpcted Briefness of my Schedule

	Dear Ms. Evergreen,

		The schedule contains everything necessary for you so far. Please follow its 	instructions and follow what commands are given to you at the briefing, thank you.

She felt like her situation had become even more Kafkaesque, but she felt less exceedingly attentive at this moment, and decided to leave it at that and find out what she could tomorrow.

After working on her product report due when she returned home for a few hours, she decided to get an early rest and went to look for the bathroom before heading to bed. At the end of the long carpeted hallway was possibly the most extravagant restroom she had ever seen. Nearly the size of her childhood bedroom, a long glass sink ran down an 18ft counter top next to a 5ft high mirror. In the center was a glass bathtub which stood in front of a wall literally covering the adjacent wall. Already impressed by her accommodations so far, this was incredible. Tantalized by the sheer quality of the setup, she decided to take a bath now, at least when she was not bogged down by the stress of work she would most likely feel tomorrow.

She undressed and turned the curved handle counterclockwise to let water rush in. Placing her right foot in, the water seemed heavier than what she expected, like the water was pressing down on her foot from added weight. Putting her other foot in, she turned herself before lying down and saw her naked body in the full wall mirror. While she had seen her naked self a hundred times before, this time she was surprised by what she saw. Her hair was definitely brighter, now seeming like a dark hazel rather than a dark mahogany, and she noticed it went down to her shoulders now. She lifted up her hair and found it felt smoother, more shiny, like she had just conditioned it. She before had always been lax about personal hygiene and presentation, never doing more than minimum so that she never smelled bad, but never smelled ""good"". But her hair made it seem like she had put effort into it, like she wanted people to notice her, even though Tress had never cared about people noticing her for anything other than her intelligence. Still looking at herself it seemed like her whole body was fuller. Her breasts looked almost like she was pushing out her chest, and feeling them she noticed that she could now grab a small chunk without effort, rather than having to press against her skin to really fondle her flat chest. It was like her now 34B breasts wanted to be held, wanted to be touched. She thought it must just be weight gain or her period after sitting in a plane for 10 hours, but it still perplexed her. Holding onto her left breast, she looked down to her hips, which now appeared to jut out more than she had ever noticed before. She dragged her left hand down to feel the contour of her side and felt her hand go farther out. She put her hand on her ass. It was so plump! The whole thing felt rounder, wider, and more... inviting? She didn't know what to make of it, except that it made her feel slightly... horny. By then the water had almost reached the edge of the tub, so she turned around and bent over to turn it off. In that position, leaning over the faucet, something motivated her to turn around and look back at the mirror to see what she looked like now. Between the wider mound of her hips were her protruding lips of her luscious vagina. It now looked like it was screaming to be filled; wet at the edges, it opening up slightly between her hips so that a big fat cock could thrust in and fill her...

Wait, what was she thinking? She turned back around and stood up to collect her thoughts. Was she just... wait what? At that moment she felt a wave of shame rush over her as she stepped out of the tub and sat down in the corner of the room. She thought, ""What the fuck is wrong with me? Did I just fantasize about... that? Do I... do that sort of thing?"" At once all her resentment of the more sexually promiscuous and more ""adventurous"" girls from high school and college came flooding back to her now. She rarely masturbated, and often did so only to relive stress or feel connected to someone else. She never trailed off into fantasy, even when boys she admitted to be attractive do what they can to flirt with her, and get rejected. But there, right there in the tub, she had transformed into the worst of the Beckies, Brittanies, Sashas, Trixxes, and Kourtneys which she found revolting and even pitied. She started crying. She was emotional, not sexual. If she was to marry, she would do based on personality, charm, and kindness, not dominance, appearance, or... penis size. Trying as hard as she could to empty her mind, she sat for a few minutes and then quickly entered the tub to wash off, and after brushing her teeth got to bed as quickly as possible.


""It was just a weird moment, probably will never happen again."" She thought to calm herself down, ""Why am I freaking out so much, we all have intrusive thoughts, but only recurring when they tie to the person we are, and I'm not that kind of person. I ... uh... never find that kind of stuff sexy, or attractive, or... anything. I'm a smart girl, women with 35s on their ACT and valedictorians are not... sluts. I am not a slut."" She continued these internal affirmations until she no longer felt affected by the incident, and drifted off to sleep."

I was originally looking for a summer internship, but I ended up with a Spring offer from this company. I have never had an internship and I do not really know what area I want to work in when I graduate so I figure that this could be a good learning opportunity. I am just a little hesitant because I would have to take off from school for a semester and graduate a semester later.

# /r/CivBeyondEarth

**9,217** cultures going beyond earth for **6 months**!

23 years ago, the gaming community learnt to live, love and work off of the land. Now, they must learn to live, love and work *off* of the land. 

A familiar, yet tantalisingly different adventure awaits you beyond earth! Since its tentative but instantly successful launch into the gaming world, the Civilization series has offered an unrivalled and instantly recognisable experience, and with Beyond Earth, the latest title in this series is sure to be no exception; with [high-quality artwork](http://i.imgur.com/Pabq5SC.jpg), astounding graphics, an easy-to-use interface and the backup of timeless classics, the latest title in the Civilization series is sure to become a classic in its own right. Our day's star, /r/CivBeyondEarth is a subreddit dedicated to discussing, describing and improving at this game; even before the game was released, the sub was ubiquitous within the Civ community, and has proved a useful, entertaining and often game-making experience for the people in it.

So why should you be interested in Civilization: Beyond Earth? The same reason thousands of critics and millions of players have; the Civilization series are almost [unequivocally the most popular strategy games of all time](http://imgur.com/v414bFs), with ground-breaking releases, whether full or just expansions, coming nearly every other year, taking what they know has worked in previous years over, and discarding what didn't work - this approach to development refines each progressive title in the series, providing brilliant, innovative but also easily accessible releases every year!

The subreddit of /r/CivBeyondEarth has had a short but successful history. [Shuddering into existence hot on the heels of the announcement of the game](http://www.reddit.com/r/civbeyondearth/comments/22v0dj/hello_new_subscribers/), die-hard Civ fans and first-time players alike flocked in droves to the subreddit, sharing a friendly enthusiasm for the game; the sub rocketed into existence, which is why it is today's star! With brilliant and varied content, ranging from [tips and tricks](http://www.reddit.com/r/civbeyondearth/comments/2kdd14/civilization_beyond_earth_gameplay_tips_megathread/), to [wallpapers](http://i.imgur.com/bhQ0qv7.png) and [fan-art](http://i.imgur.com/NFcR5OC.jpg), to an [AMA with the designers of the game](http://www.reddit.com/r/civbeyondearth/comments/2jwiuy/were_the_designers_of_civilization_beyond_earth/), this subreddit's content is going from strength to strength, with no sign of slowing at all.

If you're still not convinced to make the leap into the unknown, let some of the more experienced and interested members of the community convince you.


&gt;## What is the best thing about the Civilization community to you?

&gt;&gt;**/u/_Taydolph_Swiftler_ :** The helpfulness has to be the best thing around! You look around not only our subreddit, but the whole community, and find nothing but helpful people!

&gt;&gt;**/u/apocalyptictodd :** I love the cohesiveness and friendliness of the community; everyone is there because they love Civ and enjoy talking to others about it - only a few other games have ever accomplished this without devolving into a bunch of 10-year-olds fighting.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Monotrak :** I love hearing the insights from both new and veteran members of the community. Many have been playing games in the Civ series since the original DOS version came out in 1991, while others are just joining the game now with Beyond Earth.

&gt;## What does Beyond Earth offer over any other Civ game, in terms of, say, graphics, gameplay or strategy?

&gt;&gt;**/u/apocalyptictodd :** It is very similar to Civilization V, but has a lot of improvements; for example, improved affinities and the tech web. You really need to play it to see how far improved they are.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Monotrak :** I like the new Sci-Fi theme as well as the improved flexibility you have with all the options when first choosing your civilization.

&gt;&gt;**/u/_Taydolph_Swiftler_ :** With new Civ game they always follow the maxim of:

&gt;&gt;33% New, 33% Old, and 33% Modified - I think that holds very true to this game. The game dynamics have changed, victories have changed, and even things like the Aliens having an AI just for them have revised the game in a major way.

&gt;## How do you see /r/CivBeyondEarth changing in the next few months?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Monotrak :** The peak of our growth was when game released, in the future I see a slow, but steady, growth.

&gt;&gt;**/u/apocalyptictodd :** Once we move away from launch, the launch day bugs and the chaos of a new game, I feel that we will see more discussion posts, mods and ideas/discussions pertaining to the future expansions of the game.

&gt;&gt;**/u/_Taydolph_Swiftler_ :** I see our growth slowing down a bit, but with that the community becoming more tight knit and more of a closed unit.

&gt;## How does it feel to be subreddit of the day?

&gt;&gt;**/u/apocalyptictodd :** Pretty rad m8!

&gt;&gt;**/u/Monotrak :** Feels good - hopefully it will attract more new subscribers!

&gt;&gt;**/u/_Taydolph_Swiftler_ :** These feels are hitting me harder than a Xenoswarm!

**Sup everyone! This was my first post on this subreddit - I'm /u/_gommh_ and I just enrolled in the SROTD internship program; any tips and constructive criticism you could give me would be much appreciated! I'm gonna be submitting a few times per month from now on, so I'll see y'all around very soon!**"

**PSU:** Corsair HX 1050

**2nd CPU Cooler:** Corsair H80 CPU cooler

**HDD:** I don't know what we use

**SSD:** Samsung 840 EVO 500GB 

**RAM:** 32GB Corsair Vengence 1600

___________________________________________________________________________

I've called with the guy and though it be useful to note why he chose the parts

**CPU:** Dual Xeon, lots of cores, useful for videoediting

**MoBo:** Supports the CPU's and 64GB RAM

**Memory:** Same as the 32GB that we're already using

**Storage:** SSD and HDD won't be replaced

**GPU:** This is where I have my doubts. It has 1664 CUDA which is important for the Adobe software we use. The 780 Ti has 2880 CUDA so what is the main diffrence between these cards? Let me know!

**PSU:** Won't be replaced

**Case:** Most ugly case imo. He chose it because it supports the MoBo EEB formfactor but for what I could find there are a lot of better (?) and better looking cases that also support EEB. He said the case was massive and had good cablemanagement support. I found that some other guy here build with the Panthoo Primo and the same motherboard, that case was in the same (expensive!) price range as the one the guy chose. Any tips for this? 

**Case Fans:** I think he bought these before. Corsair SP120 or something seems good to me, more expensive but that doesn't really matter. If it's worth it to upgrade all the fans, even the h80 fans and case fans to corsair fans, let me know.

The house is cramped, and has a lot of sex going on.  Rents where my college is located are pretty high, so there are some shared rooms and room conversions.  In the RP, I'd like you to pick a character, and make things a little less awkward. Or more awkward.  Perhaps talk about the cheating, and scanty clothes.

- Jackie:  Shares the largest room with her boyfriend Michael, and cheats on him frequently.  Unclear if he knows and tolerates it because she's hot, doesn't know, or likes it.  She 5'9"", very thin, very fit, B cup (US), and has black hair, blue eyes.  Business major.  Senior.  Works part time at a Cajun restaurant.  Works late.  Wakes up late.  Walks around in a sort of long t-shirt and panties.  Drives a Jetta.  No real job yet.

- Michael:  Shares a room and dates Jackie, as mentioned.  They look like they could be siblings.  He's 6 feet tall, fit and lean.  Black hair and blue eyes, he's just as good looking as Jackie.  Business major.  Super rich family.  Drives a BMW. No job yet.

-  Annie:  Shares the next largest room with Josh.  Best friends with Jackie.  They were freshman room mates.  Blonde hair, green eyes.  Small slipper tits with super puffy nipples.  Wears tight wife beaters with no bra that show them off.  Pretty obviously gets off on guys looking at them. Super thin. 5'6"" give or take.  Runs cross country and track.  Senior.  Japanese major.  Already scheduled to teach English in Japan when she graduates.  

- Josh:  Brown hair, brown eyes.  Big guy.  6'2"", gym rat. Pre-med.  I don't know if he has a car, but he has an internship at a really prestigious lab, and will work there after he graduates.  Then apply to med schools.  Walks around in his boxer shorts or tight gym shorts.  Yeah...he's hung.  Fucked Jackie at least once, and Steph a few times.  Annie doesn't know.  

- Stephanie (Steph):  Her room would be the dining room, but there's a curtain for a door that separates it off.  It's private, except people can hear her having sex if you're in the living room.  You also have to walk through that room to get to the laundry room.  Black hair, brown eyes.  5'4"" with really big boobs.  Vegan. Dated a black guy on the basketball team from her freshman year until he graduated last year. He didn't go pro (and was never in the running), and barely graduated.  She broke up with him because he had a shitty job (I won't say what).   Is FWB's with Phil, but hooks up with a few other guys now and then.   Fucks Josh.  Asked Sam not to tell.  English major.
  
- Phil:  Doesn't live in the house, but spends 3-4 nights a week there fucking Steph.  Pisses off Jackie and Michael because he's not paying rent.   

- Jake (my friend and role play part):  Jackie's younger brother.  He looks even more like Jackie than Michael, but he's short (5'6"") and skinny.  Their whole family is tall and slender, except for him. He's short and slender.  When the three of them are together, it's really obvious and weird that Jackie's boyfriend looks so much like her brother. He's a sophomore, and lives alone in the smallest room in the house.  It's really a den that like the dining room has been treated as a bedroom.  He walked in on Steph and Josh fucking going to the laundry room, and has heard them other times.  He can hear his sister and Michael through the A/C vent when they go at it.  Thinks Annie has the sexiest boobs on the planet.

I live in the Midwest in an area with almost no local software developer or internship positions but am willing to relocate anywhere for a job. I graduated in May 2013 with a BA in Computer Science. Since then I have applied to hundreds of jobs all over the United States, had dozens of interviews, and so far have had no luck finding a position. 

I have no internship experience as when I was in college my professors told me it was unnecessary and that ""I could find a job anywhere"". That was obviously not true as I now know. Unfortunately, now that I'm graduated no internships will hire me as every one I apply to says they are looking for college students even though most of them would be perfect for my skill level and need for experience. I'm not even looking for top jobs, I will work almost anywhere just to get experience. 

It's been 18 months since I graduated... should I continue applying or is there another option? I feel like I could be a great fit at a company but nobody's luck can be this bad right? My family has suggested that I possibly go to graduate school as another option. I realize that would be expensive but is it the best option to get me more experience and make my job search easier?

2la579,0,2014-11-04,Advice for Starting Accounting Career as an Online Student?,gamemaker14,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2la579/advice_for_starting_accounting_career_as_an/,"Hi all,

I'm changing careers from a Video Game Sound Designer and Audio Producer into Accounting.  I'm a very career driven person, so it really means a lot to me to succeed in my goals and have strong upward mobility in my career path.  

Right now I am an online student at Western Governors University earning my B.S. in Accounting.  I'm on track to graduate mid 2015, but currently do not have any Accounting/Book Keeping experience (Aside from some Peachtree and AP/AR stuff I did in my father's business growing up for about 6 years) and I am desperately trying to change that by obtaining an internship or entry level role like bookkeeping/accounting clerk.  Unfortunately, although I love my online education, I am starting to feel it's downsides with trying to actually obtain an internship.  I feel that many of the internships are going to students at B&amp;M campuses thanks to job fairs and networking events.  Western Governors University also unfortunately does not use a GPA system, and I feel this is going to be a major roadblock since almost every internship I looked at is basing candidates off GPA.  WGU's pass status DOES equal a 3.0 GPA, but I'm afraid it's not enough. 

Where do I start?  Ideally I'm hoping to ultimately stay in (or end up in) the technology, software, entertainment, and media industries and some of my ideal internships would be at places like Sony, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Video Game Developers/Publishers, etc.  I also live close to Chicago and felt it might be beneficial to try to get in with one of the big 4.  What would make me stand out on my CVs that would get me some of these tough to get internships?  "

I was hoping you could offer some insight/suggestions for short term living for Spring 2015, specifically January through April.

I have an internship for that period in downtown, and have been searching for a place, browsing both the Chattanooga Apartment Guide as well as Craigslist.  Unfortunately, Craigslist has been pretty useless, as most of it is more of a ""month-long vacation"" style property in the ads.

I am not opposed to extended stay, especially since I will only be there for such a short time.  I saw the ""Chatt Inn"", and it seems relatively decent (price looks good), but you all may have a different opinion.

I looked at the UTC sub, but it doesn't seem very active, so I figured there might be some UTC students here close to my age that could also chime in their thoughts.

Any help is appreciated!!

Thanks"

The first one is for a regional firm that would start full time next summer. I'm not done with my 150 yet so I would have to take classes part time if I worked there. 

The second one is a second tier firm. This one is an internship next summer, so I could continue to take classes full time. At my interview, they told me they generally hire 99% of their interns for the next year. 

The last one is an internship at a big4 next summer as well. 

So here's my dilemma. In my mind I've always thought I would go for the big4 job. However, I've done some research on glassdoor.com and indeed.com and it just seems like everyone hates working for the big4. I want to stay in public accounting for a while so I don't really see myself exiting anytime in the next couple of years. 

I guess there are pro's and con's to every decision:
Big4: pro's: good paycheck, prestige, networking, oppurtunities
        con's: work to death, no work/life balance

2nd tier pro's: good benefits (once hired for full time), seems like a better work life balance, probably would stay here longer
           con's: less prestige, still work long hours, bad reviews on glassdoor.com

regional firm: pro's: start working right away, good salary, good benefits
                   con's: will have to take night classes, would probably be stuck here forever

Idk. if you were in my shoes what would you choose? Would you go for the prestige of the big4, the long term attractiveness of the second tier firm, or the comfortable guarantee but feel like you're settling for the regional firm?"

Having trouble getting my foot in the door....,scaryblackguy,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2larfj/can_anyone_that_has_a_career_within_the_music/,"Hey all,

**TL;DR** Would like if someone in the music industry (specifically artist booking, management or A&amp;R), could take a look at my resume and cover letter and tell me what they think I should change to possibly hook some interviews.

I recently moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career as a booking agent for music artists in the field of electronic music or try to become an artist agent or A&amp;R/Talent agent.

I have a lot of past experience in putting on events and have a lot of knowledge within the genre of electronic music but due to the lack of my network, I am having a lot of difficulty getting my foot in the door. I've tried everything from trying to get internships or opportunities for temp. work to prove that I am more than competent, but no place offers those kinds of deals to people out of college or have temp. work positions.

I've sent out a ""million"" resumes, have 2 different temp. agencies helping me (although I am unsure about how hard they look for jobs for each candidate), have been going to all types of meet ups just to try and meet people, yet still nothing....

I would appreciate if someone in this field of work could possibly look at my resume and and cover letter and maybe give me some pointers or just tell me about what steps they took to help them get hired. 

Much appreciated!"

She has an internship that is willing to swap her a fully functional e-commerce website for 3 days a week of work for a few months. I am worried about a few things: 

1. Since she is not a customer, she has no real path to get things fixed or for her problems to be treated as a priority. 
2.  I think that they will put their worst people on this website and only in their spare time
3. I am worried that they are inflating the value of the webpage (they claim at least 5K) in order to get some cheap labor. 

In general the opportunity sounds good. she will be learning quite a bit of marketing, SEO, a bit of coding, and get a lot of connections. I have looked online, and a good e-commerce webpage can be very valuable to a company and cost upwards of 50K. 

Are there some requirements that I should insist on for the webpage to make sure she is not getting a fancy template in exchange? are there any intelligent questions I can ask? I really have no idea where to start.

I can't seem to get the paragraphs to space out any more to avoid a ""wall of text"".


I've been lurking here a little bit over the past few days, because I saw something near the front page a while back and got in to reading a lot of these stories on this subreddit. I've decided that I'm just going to leave my story here in hopes that it will help someone either overcome a broken relationship like I was too weak to do, or discover what they need to be doing in the relationship to make it work for the future. There will be a few tl;dr;s and take-aways towards the end. Here goes:


It began during my freshman year in college as an engineering student at Virginia Tech. I went over to a friend's sister's house occasionally to relax/unwind (underage type things away from dorms) and ended up meeting the sister's roommate, Elizabeth (my now ex-gf). The first time I met her - I absolutely knew that I was in love and that I wanted to be with her forever. It sounds stupid and stereotypical, but that's how it was - it was truly love at first sight. I vividly remember telling my friends that I was going to marry this girl one day. Out she walks in sweat pants, a t-shirt, glasses, with a crazy dog barreling out of the room towards us. I was awe-struck and wanted to be able to talk to her, but I've always been afraid of messing things up with girls that I've liked. That and she was almost a senior in college, so I figured she was out of my league.


Fast-forward about a year and I'm helping the sister, Nicole, and Elizabeth move in to a new apartment in another part of town. Elizabeth is there with a somewhat short-term ""boyfriend"" that I am obviously jealous about, but I keep my cool. We get to talking about things like animals, and I discover we actually do have a lot in common. We both absolutely love animals for one, which is a huge thing for her.


Eventually, I find out Elizabeth and the boyfriend break up after only about a month of being together. It's at that point that the word gets to Nicole that I like Elizabeth. I still don't understand how it wasn't easily apparent before (1), but you can't rely on people to fight your battles for you. There is a party at a mutual friend's house and we, again, get to talking and hit it off extremely well. The alcohol obviously helped the situation and eventually we find ourselves in bed together. I know a decent amount about this girl now from what we had talked about and what I had learned from Nicole. I am experienced and lost it when I was 14 (I'm not particularly proud of that) (2). Elizabeth hasn't ever been in a serious relationship and she is a virgin. I'm not one to take advantage of situations like that, because she blatantly told me that she wanted to lose her virginity, so while we're in bed - I tell her that I want to wait it out. 


Fast-forward another month, through all the texting and dates, and we're back in bed together and end up having sex. After we're done, I remember holding her in my arms and telling her that I really want to make this ""Facebook official"". She is extremely apprehensive about this and tells me that she doesn't want me to hurt her. I told her that I wouldn't, because I know I won't.


Everything is great, as it typically is, for another 6 months or so. We go on countless dates together, spend each night cuddled up in eachothers' arms, and always communicate and laugh about everything. I'm the type of person that wears their heart on their shoulder and it's in this time that I tell her that I am in Love with her. She says the feeling is mutual, and everything is great.


Everything is good, except for the fact that I don't get a whole lot of space anymore or time to myself. In my junior year in college, I was  basically working four legitimate jobs. I had an internship, which typically took up ~20 hours a week. I was the general manager at the largest dining hall on campus, which typically took up ~25 hours a week. I had a full 15 credit course load of engineering classes. I also had a girlfriend (3). She never seemed to understand that, while she had a few classes a week and a job she worked ~20 hours a week at - that I had a hell of a lot else going on in my life. I would wake up at 7AM and be on the move until I got home at 10PM, at which time I would either be back on the move by 11PM to head to her house to spend the night or she would come over to my house.


It was because of this that our relationship seemingly (to me) became a competition of who could put in more work. She always told me that, because she came over x number of times a week - that I had to come over x number of times a week. I didn't find that fair considering my schedule, but I realize now that she was far too important not to give that time to. I am just an extremely committed person. It was very, very, very difficult to finally give up my general manager job during my last year in college, a year after this was happening. (4)


Another part of our relationship that we differed on was the phone call part. I was always working on projects and generally just angry about all the work I had to do when I was doing it, so was never in the mood to talk on the phone. My major sucked and was hard, but that's no reason to let it flow over to your relationship. (5) We also texted all day, every day, so I figured that was enough.


During my final year at VT, Elizabeth was ending her master's program and we were discussing plans for the future. I had been offered a job in DC, so suggested that she start to take a look at jobs up there. Eventually, she was offered and took a job in northern VA (near DC). We began looking at apartments up there to live together in, because we both kind of figured it to be the economical solution to always having to go to other's places every night. (6)


While she was up in northern VA, I did not do enough to help the relationship. She was in a place without any friends and support, with only her dog to cuddle at night. I didn't call her as often (or really at all) as I should have. I didn't give her the support that I should have. I was too pre-occupied with finally getting out my last semester of partying and college fun with friends. Still, through it all, we texted all day every day, so I figured it was enough. (7)


At the end of my senior year, I had made plans to go to Japan (where I've lived 14 years) to visit friends and have some fun before starting in the ""real world"". Elizabeth was fine with this, even after not having seen me much throughout the past six months. She said she didn't expect an email every day, but that it would be nice if I'd send her one every now and then to let her know how I was doing. I spent roughly three weeks in Japan while she was still in northern VA. (8)


After I was back, we still had to make visits to a few apartments and settled on something in northern VA in the middle of our two work locations. I could metro to my work and she could drive to hers - great. We also settled on rent. Tech guys make good money, but unfortunately she wasn't making much, so I ended up paying 2/3 the rent. We moved in together in June of 2013 and really loved everything about our place.


It wasn't even August yet before we were having issues. She was questioning whether or not she wanted to be with me any more and kept proposing the idea that ""maybe there is someone out there better for me"". If you've ever heard this before, then you know what kind of toll this can take on you, especially in a ""trapped"" situation like ours. I ended up going to Aruba with her family (who I absolutely love and miss) and had a great time for the first few days. It just seemed like something was missing. We didn't have that spark anymore and we seemed bored of each other. It got to the point (on vacation in Aruba) that I was a phone call away from buying an early plane ticket back because I didn't want to ruin their family vacation with our fighting. However, we got through it. Immediately when we got back, though, it was the same thing. The second we got back - she said she was depressed from not being able to vacation again and immediately went to sleep. (9)


In the next few months, from the end of August to April, we nearly broke up a few times. We had our ups and downs. She still was thinking ""maybe there is someone out there better for me"", but other times she would put in the effort. I always ""tried"" to put in effort to make things better, but I was in a bad situation myself. I didn't have any friends that had moved to the area and I just couldn't bring myself to leave her because I felt like I needed to be there to help Elizabeth. I think it was completely the opposite. My happiness all revolved around her at this point, but because she was obviously so unhappy - it made me extremely unhappy myself.(10) I turned to weed/alcohol to try to ease the pain and distance myself from the situation. (11)


On April 20th, 2014, Elizabeth came home from visiting her family two hours away. At this point, for whatever reason, I didn't trust her on what she said (An ex had contacted her awhile back. She told me once, but then didn't say anything more about it), but I didn't really care either. It had all become too much for me to handle. As I lay there on the couch, stoned, I wanted to hear her say something to me. I remember it vividly - she sighed her usual sigh that means something is wrong and she wants to talk, but won't open up first. I waited, and waited. More sighing and then off to bed, without a word. No kiss goodnight. Nothing. (12)


The following day, Monday, April 21st, 2014, Elizabeth finally said that she wanted to break up. I don't know why I put myself through the situations we were in for so long, but I did. I also realize that I didn't do as much as I could have to prevent this from happening. I became lazy, had no interest in much, and let her dictate how the relationship went (complete opposite of college, where I think I had most of the control). We talked, very bluntly for awhile, as she cried. I didn't cry at the time, because I had been expecting it, but I was honestly completely distraught. I didn't say much aside from that I saw it coming and that I agreed this was for the best, but that wasn't all I had felt. That wasn't all that I needed to say. (13)


I told her that I would sleep on the couch and that she could take the bedroom and that was that. Over the next month, I was actively looking for a new place to live, which was difficult due to my lack of friends in the area. One person that I hadn't been able to hang out with the entire year (due to his studying for MCATs), Snuggles, ended up hearing about my situation and told me to come meet people he knew since I didn't know anyone in the area. He proved to be a great friend and introduced me to some of my closest friends I have today. 


In the time that I was meeting these friends, things were actually going well with Elizabeth. We were communicating at night, laughing together, and generally seemed like the pressure was gone from our situations. She checked up on me when I went outside on the deck for some music/alone time and really made me feel like she actually cared about me again. Somehow, I still just figured that it wouldn't work out, especially after reciting in my mind what she had constantly been saying - ""maybe there's someone better out there for me"". 


So, I tried to force my way back in to a relationship as soon as possible. (14) I didn't give it any time and tried to rush in to things with other girls. I wanted to go out and be crazy like I felt like I could/should have been in college if it were not for Elizabeth. I blamed her for that and didn't care about how she felt about me going out and taking pictures with my arms wrapped around girls, drunk out of my mind. I figured maybe she would be jealous and come back to me, but Elizabeth isn't that type of person at all. (15)


It was around this time that things went completely sour with Elizabeth. We were still living together in late May, when I was about to move, and she was spending nights out with other guys. I ended up asking her who she had been sleeping with, because I suspected it was a mutual friend of ours, but she denied it. She didn't deny sleeping with other guys while we had still been living together though. Even though I had gone out and been trying to meet friends/girls, I still hadn't made any moves on girls, so this was a complete and utter shock to me. I broke down and did not deal with it well at all. We barely talked or saw each other until I finally moved out in early June. 


It has now been over six months since we broke up. I've read some other posts on here about how long it takes to get over people and I can tell you that I'm definitely not over Elizabeth, but I'm slowly getting there. I've contacted her twice in the past six months. Once was when I needed to get her signature on our security deposit check. I asked her to meet up since we both needed to sign it, but she refused (2-3 months after the break-up). That hurt, but I figured she just needed some time and I still held out hope that things would work out some day. 2 months after that, I came to the realization that, if you want something in life - you need to take it and you can't live with regrets. I've lived with too many regrets in my life to not try to make mends to our 3.5 year relationship in which we had talked about getting married, starting a family together, etc. I ended up contacting her again and told her I needed to discuss some things, because I was in a completely different place. I had/have a great friend group around me. I have hobbies. I do things for myself and do things for others. I take care of myself and am a responsible person now. However, she did not want to meet up again. (16)


I have finally come to the realization recently that things just aren't going to work out for us. I feel like we complemented each other well, but the feeling just wasn't really ever mutual. I also maybe tried to mold my ideal girl in to her, so maybe she wasn't a fit for me after all. All I know is - I will always love Elizabeth and I sincerely hope that she is happy throughout her life. While Elizabeth hurt me immensely - she taught me what it is like to love someone. It's not about the feeling inside you. That has nothing to do with it. That's infatuation. It's about wanting to make things work and willing to do anything and everything in your power to make them work. If you've done that - then you've done all you can and you can rest happily. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am posting this ridiculously long story for two reasons:

1. I really hope that someone will see some of my mistakes above and realize how to correct them in their own relationship. Please know that it is worth it. You don't want to live with the regret that I currently have about what I could have done better in the relationship to make it work. However, I also know (and so should you), that it is all in the past and you can't do anything about it aside from being a better person in the future.
2. It always feels good to write out your thoughts and feelings.

********************************************************************
********************************************************************

Take-aways (from above):
1. Take initiative for what you want

2. Realize you're more experienced and take control of your relationships

3. Make sure you have time for yourself and your relationship

4. Know your priorities and stick to them

5. The little things, like phone calls, really, really matter to your SO

6. MAKE SURE YOU'RE READY TO MOVE IN TOGETHER. Discuss this EXTENSIVELY. Don't just do this because it's ""economical"".

7. Put yourself in your SO's shoes

8. If you're in a place with people your SO doesn't know - communicate! Re-read (7).

9. Talk to/try figure out how to help your SO

10. ""Don't put your key to happiness in someone else's pocket""

11. Never turn to drugs or alcohol to try to mask the pain. It only does the opposite.

12. Man up and take control

13. Say everything on your mind. Open up.

14. Give it time. Time heals everything.

15. Don't be immature and try to make someone jealous over something.

16. Never don't do something that you might regret in the future. Take action!

2lbnyw,0,2014-11-04,What is the Feasibility of Moving to Norway From Outside the EU?,ScholarOfVoices,Norway,https://www.reddit.com/r/Norway/comments/2lbnyw/what_is_the_feasibility_of_moving_to_norway_from/,"I know you get a lot of these threads, but so far none of the ones I've read have answer all of my questions, so here goes.

I'm a college student in US studying Computer Science. In a few years I should have a bachelors in Comp Sci. In a perfect world, I'd like to work on video games as a programer, but I'd be willing to do anything in the field. I'll probably graduate with a little bit of experience in the field from internships. I currently have no knowledge of Norwegian, but am more than willing to learn it.

So more specifically does anyone know how feasible it would be to find a job in the Comp Sci field as a US citizen? I have heard things can be difficult with employers and visas. Some have said employers are reluctant to hire if you don't have a visa, but to get a visa you need to have a job offer.

How important is knowing Norwegian when it comes to finding a job in Norway? I know English is well understood by many Norwegians, and that people can get jobs there without knowing Norwegian, and you can take courses there to learn the language. But how much does it help to have a very basic framework of the language, or will knowledge of the language only help if I'm proficient.

Finally, how much does work experience help with getting a job in Norway? In the US it seems like qualifications are respected more than work experience, but in New Zealand (another country I'm considering moving to) it seems like work experience is valued more than qualifications. Where does Norway stand in this regard? Would staying in the US with a job for a couple of years be necessary, would it help a lot, or would it be possible to get a job right out of college?

TL,DR summary.

I'm from the US. How does the Comp Sci job market look in Norway? How do Visas work with job offers? How important is knowing the language, and how much knowledge is needed to be significant? How helpful is work experience and how much is needed in general?

Thank you very much, and sorry for the long post."

2lbv7m,1,2014-11-04,My pathetic story that I have to write to get it off my chest (mild depression),[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2lbv7m/my_pathetic_story_that_i_have_to_write_to_get_it/,"I'm 30/M. Typing this at 3am on a day off (we'll get to that). I'm not fully depressed, but I'm very susceptible at the moment.

2 years and a month ago I was about to get depressed. I was studying at university, but had only 1 course left. Most of my friends got jobs or internships that year, I didn't. I had a weekend night job, but it had nothing to do with my field. I was seeing someone for a short time, but she didn't think it would work so she broke up with me.

A week later I caught an amazing break (though I did not know it at the time). Colleague of mine asked me out. I always enjoyed her company immensely when I saw her at work. So we went out and had a blast. We started seeing more and more often. I took more shifts at work making it a full-time job. I basically kissed the University and my old life a goodbye though I did continue to search for an internship/job.

I was ridiculously happy. Not only did we love each others company, we also had almost all the same days off and the same sleeping pattern (we were doing only night shifts) so we were able to do all kinds of fun. We travelled everywhere and partied alot. I liked her family and friends alot, but she didn't like mine. I didn't much care. So we spent most of our time with her social circles (I was losing even more of my own life, though I didn't notice or give a flying fuck at the time). I moved in with her after just 3 months. Very soon we were already planning our future together. Life was so good.

Fast forward to 13 months together. Her birthday was coming. I had made her a cake and bought two presents she had wanted for a long time. I was working the night, she was home alone drinking. Alcohol had become a bit of a problem. She'd call me all night and was very happy until 4am when she was supposed to go to bed. We said good nights. But she called shortly after and she felt like a different person. I don't know what it was she got mad about, but it was clear she just wanted to argue. When my shift ended and I got home, the door was locked from the inside. I had to retreat to my parent's house on her birthday morning...

We made up after I woke up and we had a nice rest of the day, but it was clear that enough alcohol changed her personality. This was evident again roughly a month later when we came home from night out. We watched some tv, she continued to drink and boom, a fight out of nowhere. I wanted no part of it (man I wish I would have just told her I love her instead of walking angrily away) so I told her I'd go to bed. When I went to brush my teeth she stormed after me, shut the lights from the bathroom and blocked the door from outside. I didn't try to negoatiate. I just tried to push the door open without luck. I waited a few minutes and then bust the door.

Now we did have an amazing relationship still, but I guess these events started to haunt both of us. Last summer our sex life slowly died. We still loved each others company and it's not quite sure what happened to her not wanting to have sex anymore. Anyway, she didn't want to talk about the problem which made me really upset.

Constant rejection ate my self esteem and I became jealous. So I began to suspect cheating and in August I read her facebook. There were 1500 messages between her and a male colleague. Some flirting, but not clear enough to know for sure. When I was about to confront her she came up with a solution to the dead bedroom, that it was her birth control pills. Ok, great that she'd try to work on our relationship, but I had to ask about the colleague. And because I'm a bad liar I told her I read her facebook. Long story short: we continued for a month until she broke up with me.

So there I was, alone. My life and happiness had been built around her. We were to get married, have kids and a house. Now I have just my own life. The life I abandoned more than two years ago. It's like I had to get it from garage and blow the dust off. There will be no marriage, kids or house for a long time. I'm working a dead end job that kills all social life because it's night shifts and weekends. My studies still lack the master's thesis. Add to that I'm already 30 and it's a nice recipe for full depression.

Of course I began to work on myself after the breakup. I applied to all jobs that matched my studies. I searched for an apartment and tried to up my social life. And I did make some progress. I will be moving to a new great apartment in a week. I've been seeing someone who finally gets my mind off the ex. Only the most important thing, a new job, seems like an impossible feat. And everything seems to rely on getting that job.

We have no mutual days off with this new girl. She works 9-5 monday-friday. I work basically 6pm-6am thursday to sunday. We see 2 or 3 times a week and can't spend the nights together, because I can't change my sleeping pattern on my days off. I'm starting to fall for this girl and now I'm really afraid she won't tolerate the lack of time together for much longer. Also I want to take her somewhere, but how can I when I'm always working on weekends?!

So it's 4am now and I can't sleep nor will I want to because it's going to be day soon. I'm typing this because there is absolutely nothing constructive I can do at this time of day. I tried to look for jobs online, but there are none. I could go to Uni today and start working on my master's degree, but it's going to take 8 months minimum. And when it's finished there's still no guarantee I'll be any more successful at the job hunt. And I'm once again way too dependent on a girl for my happiness and I'm afraid that it will scare her away even if our lack of time together doesn't.

I could probably change my job to some no-skills-required day job, but I actually enjoy my current one and it pays decent, so I don't think I want to change it to something I don't like that pays less. Oh well.. At least letting this all out helped me organize my thoughts and distract me for 1½ hours. Thank you for reading. I really do appreciate it."
2lbxf7,5,2014-11-04,Can I hear some stories from college graduates who didn't major in CS/STEM and managed to get a job as a software developer/engineer?,thatshitcrayaintitj,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2lbxf7/can_i_hear_some_stories_from_college_graduates/,"I'm an Economics undergrad at the University of Washington and I've been taking a bunch of CS classes..

2lc4iy,9,2014-11-04,I can't connect with anyone anymore,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2lc4iy/i_cant_connect_with_anyone_anymore/,"I don't know what I've fucked up, but sometime this summer I just suddenly felt extremely alone.  The previous semester was great, I made a lot of new friends and had great self-confidence, but about a month in, everything kinda went to shit.  I don't know what prompted it, but this feeling intensified as the summer progressed since I was stuck in the city I go to university in, working at a research center.  I'd smoke weed all the time to cope with it and dabble in psychedelics until I had a terrible experience which served to widen the gap I felt.  I promptly quit doing the psychs, but the weed continued, which was a terrible move.

I abuse weed too much, and have for too long, to the point where I mess up speaking after I've sobered up, and I weird people out, which further worsens this situation.  I recognized this and cut it out a month ago permanently (and my speech has recovered, the one positive thing), but the damage is done and I have sufficiently weirded enough people out to feel uncomfortable all day, because they're uncomfortable with me.  I'm a good student somehow, but the professors I interact with are among those weirded out and I fear that I have established a precedent which will continue into further education, since when I try to reach out to professors at other universities, I screw up those conversations as well.

Even just meeting new people doesn't go well.  I meet girls for the first time with only the intention of meeting them.  I've given up going any further in order to work on myself, I don't want to somehow get into a relationship (not that I'd know how to, I've fucked up every single opportunity to be with somebody) but use her as an emotional crutch to distract myself from these issues, but I guess even my general demeanor is creepy.  I just want to see people I met recently in the hallway and say hi and for them to respond without grimacing.

My friends from high school have faded from contact, all except for one who I truly considered my best friend, but she's moving on to great things and I feel like I'm falling out of her mind and heart.  As a group we were incredibly close, and most of them remain that way, but my family no longer lives in the same country, so I don't return as frequently or as long as the rest of them do.  Nobody has really tried to talk to me at all, which is somewhat to be expected, we're all moving on with our lives.

But the worst part is that I feel like I have failed my parents.  Far and beyond everything else.  I love them with all my heart, and I know they love me too.  But I have thrown away my gifts thanks to my stupidity with drugs.  I feel like if I told them I'd break their hearts, and there's no telling what my dad would do.  I've failed him completely.  I tried to follow his path, as I find everything genuinely interesting, and want to continue it, but I'm just not as smart.  I can't get an internship beyond this job I currently work at (which is extremely prestigious, but I still feel hollow for some reason), and I indirectly asked them for help, but I feel like he thinks less of me for it, like he shouldn't have to do this for me.

Somehow I keep going on with my life, but once I leave here to move on to graduate school, I don't know how I'll manage it.  I can't connect, I can't casually talk to strangers, I'll be far away from the last good friends I managed to make, who, if the trend continues, will fade as well........ the times that I think about ending it (and its never really seriously, thank god, but it's enough to bother me a lot), I get really messed up because I always think of my parents.  But I don't know what I'm going to do once they start leaving the picture.. I hope I figure this out "

I’m a freshman computer science major, and I’m already having second thoughts about my major. I chose to pursue computer science because I love programming, and I’m very happy to have gotten into the major at UCSD. I have about 5 years of programming under my belt, along with internship experience with a local San Diego tech start up. At that job, I’ve been primarily using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP and I’ve since learned that I love designing and coding websites. To the extent that I would consider Web Development as a career.

Now I’m taking CSE11 for my introductory Java course and it’s just the right difficulty that I’m relearning material in greater depth without the course feeling slow. But I can’t help but feel the assignments are so bland: everyone turns in the same project, with little room to take what we’ve learned and be creative with it. 

My question is if at some point I will get some creative freedom over the assignments, or if computer science courses are all like this, and is computer science even the most relevant major for an aspiring web developer?

Thanks for the feedback!"

2ldncb,2,2014-11-05,Utterly sick and tired of this distance but I don't want to leave him,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2ldncb/utterly_sick_and_tired_of_this_distance_but_i/,"My fiance and I have been together for a little over a year and 7 months. Up until May, we had lived in the same city for all of it and lived together in the same apartment for a lot of that time. We got engaged in March. He graduated from college and moved on to a teaching residency back in his hometown, 2 1/2 hours away. He is temporarily living with his parents (getting a place would be pointless if we dont know where in the city ill be working) until I graduate from college in December and we're currently apartment shopping for that. 


A little backstory on me. Prior to my fiance, I had a couple boyfriends, but one super-long-term mostly long-distance relationship for 3 1/2 years. It was abusive and once it went long distance, we were 11 hours apart and only saw each other once every 4-8 months. It was hell, I was miserable, and he was an all-around awful guy (drug abuse, dropped out of community college, cheated on me). I hoped I'd never do distance again, but that was mostly just trust issues.  So when that finally ended and I had some time to heal, I met my fiance and we began a slow, but great, relationship. 


I was used to my fiance being busy all the time - he had a really difficult major, he was on our college's drumline, and he taught an independent drumline 4-5 hours away in Daytona on the weekends (sometimes I went with him). I didn't mind this because we were in the same city, and even just a few hours at home at night was enough for me. 

When he graduated in May things just seemed to get really difficult once we went long distance. I promised I'd never do distance again but I saw this as worth it - very much so. By then we were engaged and our families were in love with the relationship. I was working 2 jobs (40 hours/week for my internship + 20 hours/week in retail for extra money) and he had started the grad school portion of his residency program. We began fighting just simply out of frustration - usually revolving around us not being able to get time off to see each other. 

When I started back up at college in the fall, we were able to see each other more frequently (once every 2-3 weeks or so), but he ended up taking on more responsibilities. So now, he's 1) teaching at a high school full-time 2) taking grad school classes 3) again teaching a drumline in his hometown. It was already getting to the point where *I* was always the one to drive to him, because he was too busy to leave. We have a great time when I'm over there but I wish with all my heart that he could just... come here and relax..
He was juggling the idea of teaching the Daytona drumline in the spring as well and I had to BEG HIM not to.

We have two close friends getting married in January and I'm a bridesmaid while he's a groomsman. The bride's bridal shower is this weekend and it's supposed to be a coed party for all of the attendants. He can't go because of the local drumline having a competition on Saturday and a meeting with a professor on Monday. I know these things are his responsibilities and he shouldn't push them aside, but I can't help but be absolutely pissed off. Kind of a straw breaking the camel's back. He keeps apologizing and saying he'll try to pull strings but oh my god I'm at my wit's end. 

Don't get me wrong, we have a great time when we're together and he is definitely my best friend and best relationship. But this distance is awful, despite it being doable and drivable every other weekend or so. I wouldn't mind at all if we were living in our own apartment again and he were this busy, but it's like I have to fight for his time. I feel so selfish being upset about this. It was so much easier when we lived in the same place. I could deal with him doing a million things. We're moving back in in December but the emotional strain I'm dealing with right now is so hard. Though I do voice my opinion (ie begging him not to do the Daytona drumline), I try not to let him see how much this hurts. After the whole bridal shower cancelation on his end I'm just in tears and frustrated. I've been angry for the past 24 hours straight. I haven't told the bride &amp; groom he's not coming and I don't know if/how I should. I'm not the type to cheat or run off with someone else... I'm just mad and I guess I just wanted to complain."

I know what I have to do in terms of the courses I need to take, clinical/non-clinical experience, etc but I'm not sure if I'm on the right mindset or on the right track. I just need some advice from people who have gone through this (postbacc, community college, whatever) and if I'm being too crazy for aiming so high.**


Hi r/premed,

I just joined this subreddit after finding r/medical school and I thought you guys would be the first and best place for me to get some answers to my questions.

I am a recent graduate of a university in California and I majored in anthropology with a focus on biological/physical. When I started at my university, I was a bio major but realized later (after failed classes and nearly getting kicked out of school) it wasn't the right major for me. I then switched to anthropology after taking a physical/biological class that I absolutely loved, and it's been great since. 

My grades during my time as a bio major was TERRIBLE. Like straight-up terrible. It got so bad to where I was put on academic probation and then standing for disqualification (aka the last thing you can get before you get barred from the university). I think I wasn't unhappy in the major because my family (Asian) pushed me to do the major despite me clearly not enjoying it, and continuously saying that bio major is the only way to go in the ""real world"". I was also fighting depression during that time because of a chain of unfortunate events (dad passed away, sister [my only sibling] ran off with a guy she met on the internet, best friend left for across the country without saying anything to me, being in an abusive environment where nothing I did was good enough and who I am physically and emotionally wasn't good enough). 

Despite all of this, however, I was able to pull up my big girl panties and pull myself out of standing for disqualification in 1 quarter (which usually it takes people 2 quarters to do but I was able to do it in 1, yay!), changed my course of major and started in anthropology. 

Since starting in anthropology and cutting off ties to my toxic family, my grades have been on a continuous rise: I ended senior year with a 2.9 (Fall quarter, on 19 units [5 classes]), 3.7 (Winter quarter, on 19 units), and a 3.7 (Spring quarter, 2 classes). During this time I was able to spend a lot of my time working in the anatomy lab for the anthropology department with dissection, taphonomic projects for the Smithsonian, be a peer adviser for the department, take part in Rotaract (like the college-aged version of Rotary), and be a Publicity/Outreach Coordinator for my department's club. 

I take pride in the fact that I was able to do so well my last year knowing that I had a lot on my plate but still did really well. I was proud of that, and I still am, and everyone who's known how much I struggled for the first 2 years was equally impressed with my progress. 

Now, onto the present. I'm looking into medical school for forensic pathology, and is in the middle of doing my research. In case you were wondering why I'm interested in forensic pathology, a huge part of it is that my dad died under known circumstances and my dad's family didn't believe in autopsies (due to religion) and he was basically ruled as a heart attack victim. I never got the closure and the answers I wanted about my dad's death because everyone in my family thinks it's taboo to talk about it. Because of this, I want to help others find closure in what the time when they need it the most, and to give them a solid answer and a rock they can lean on as they push through the hardest time of their lives. To me, it's just as much of helping the family members and the living understand and come to terms with what happened, as it is about figuring out what happened and finding the answer to a clue or a puzzle. That's why I want to do forensic pathology.

But anyway, here is what I know for sure:

* I'll have to go to medical school. 

* I'll need to go back to community college for a while to take all the pre-req classes

* I'll have to get As (and maybe 1 B) on the pre-req classes I take at community college to even have a shot due to my mediocre grades in undergrad.

* I'll need clinical experience or real-world experience (I'm in the process of talking to a forensic pathologist in the county about their future internship so hopefully that pans out!)

* I'll need to kick some major ass on the MCAT/GRE

* I need to be able to explain why my first 2 years of undergrad was so shitty and what I learned from it

* I need to have amazing letters of recommendations

* Do more volunteering (both clinical and non-clinical related)

I know what I have in store for me for the next year or two in terms of the schooling I need to get done. I also know that because of my past with bio I'm going to struggle, but I've never wanted to do this as much as I have with anything else I wanted to do in the past. I know it'll be hard, especially seeing all of you guys' high GPA on here and high marks, I know I'll have to work my ass off and then some to even get on par with where you guys are. I'm willing to do whatever it takes; that's how badly I want this. 

My question is: am I on the right track? Am I in the right mindset? Is there anything else I need to do or keep an eye out for? Is there anything else that I'm not thinking of or not considering? I'm absolutely terrified that I'm not doing the right thing or not even thinking about it in the right way and it'll come back and kill me later on :(

And please, no circlejerk replies or answers. Harsh, yes, but I know I'm in the deep end and I don't need others to weigh anchor on me and kill me. Words of advice, encouragement, or anything like that would be helpful. 

Mega thanks in advance!"

Don't get me wrong, we have a great time when we're together and he is definitely my best friend and best relationship. But this distance is awful, despite it being doable and drivable every other weekend or so. I wouldn't mind at all if we were living in our own apartment again and he were still this busy, but it's like I have to fight for his time now that we're a couple hours apart. I feel so selfish being upset about this. It was so much easier when we lived in the same place. I could deal with him doing a million things. We're moving back in around ~December but the emotional strain I'm dealing with right now is so hard. Though I do voice my opinion (ie begging him not to do the Daytona drumline), I try not to let him see how much this hurts. After the whole bridal shower cancelation on his end I'm just in tears and frustrated. I've been angry for the past 24 hours straight. I haven't told the bride &amp; groom he's not coming and I don't know if/how I should. I'm not the type to cheat or run off with someone else... I'm just mad and I guess I just wanted to complain.


How do I deal with the way I feel? I don't want to guilt trip him, especially when much of this deals with his career and he's not doing anything wrong. So I haven't really said anything to him aside from ""I wish you could figure something out"" and ""I'm just really upset."" I am committed to him and this relationship and leaving is not an option (unless he did something that actually, warranted leaving. which he did not).

---   
**tl;dr**: Super-busy fiance's schedule is taking an emotional toll on me while we're 2 1/2 hours apart (temporary from May 2014 - December 2014). Last straw was him missing our close friend's bridal shower in my city because of a grad school obligation he has in his city. I don't want to leave him, and I need to figure out how to emotionally handle this distance and this situation."
2ldsph,25,2014-11-05,I just found out that the company I interned at over the summer didn't use any of my code. What now?,kiptar,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ldsph/i_just_found_out_that_the_company_i_interned_at/,"It was my first internship.  I was doing .NET development.  I worked full-time (paid) for 2 or 3 months.  A couple days ago I found out that they trashed everything that I worked on.  Supposedly because it was not worth using.  

I've never felt like such a complete waste of flesh in my life.  Where do I go from here?  I'm pretty sure I gave that internship everything that I have as a programmer.  

I'm halfway through college and I guess I can change majors if I want, but I don't want to because of how ridiculously valuable a degree in Computer Science is.  Also, if I finish with this degree, I'm already going to be $100,000+ in debt.  Changing majors would only make it worse - especially since I'd probably transfer into something that isn't as well paid.

I guess what I'm asking is, if I'm going to be bad at programming in the real world, should I even bother getting the degree?  As crazy as this sounds, are there other things that I can do with a CS degree that don't put such a heavy emphasis on coding? 

EDIT:  Wow, thank you all so much.  The positive words of encouragement really, really helped me change my viewpoint on this.  Thank you! "

Been lurking for a few months, but wanted to finally make a post to share my blossoming skin care addiction and what it's done for me.

All my life, I've had fairly normal or combination oily/dry skin, with just a pimple here or there during high school. Acne and oily/dry problems increased a little during college, but stress/hard water/really freaking cold winters with really intense dorm heating pretty much explained that. The week after I graduated college was the clearest my skin has ever been. I thought I looked like a fucking dream. Then, that July, I had the worst acne breakout of my entire life. I was living in a different place, working an internship and searching for ever-elusive full-time positions, so stress/hard water may still have been contributors. But the pimples that had only struck my T-zone and chin before were spreading out to my cheeks and so dense, I couldn't see the true color of my forehead for two months! I knew my skin was too sensitive for harsh SA and BP treatments, so I was at a loss. Finally, I went to my doctor about it. Praise God she's a wonderful, caring practitioner who's also fairly knowledgeable about skincare. I requested birth control, which she prescribed along with Ziana gel (1.2% clindamycin, 0.025% tretinoin). She also recommended Purpose soap for cleansing as a gentle alternative to typical acne cleansers. At about the same time, I was really getting into this subreddit and gleaning all the info I could to save my skin. The tretinoin was making my skin really red, irritated, and flaky, and it wasn't until a couple of weeks ago that I started using a moisturizer that actually helped my skin. I had tried Cerave, but it broke me out/irritated my skin, so now it's just body cream ;) Then, after reading a thread for people sensitive to Cerave, I found these [little tins of Nivea cream](http://www.amazon.com/Nivea-Creme-Unisex-1-Ounce/dp/B000VR4T2W/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1415209645&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=nivea+cream+tin). The very first morning after using it, my skin was so calm that I could finally see all the progress the Ziana had made against my acne, since the redness was gone! I only had one or two active pimples and a little bit of PIH.

So much for story time. Here's my skincare routine to date:

AM

Cleanse: Splash of water and mix up a honey/colloidal oatmeal mask (sometimes I add the matcha green tea powder my roommate buys in bulk)

Tone: Thayers or straight up rosewater

Moisturize: Nivea Cream

Protect: [Derma e Antioxidant Natural Sunscreen](http://www.amazon.com/Derma-Antioxidant-Natural-Sunscreen-Oil-Free/dp/B00IJ6899G/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1415208132&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=derma+e+antioxidant+natural+sunscreen) (not the most cosmetically elegant, but it's a zinc formula that makes my face happy)

Makeup

PM

Double cleanse: OCM with almond, jojoba, castor oil, and glycerin to help it all wash off, followed by [Purpose](http://www.amazon.com/Purpose-Gentle-Cleansing-Bar-Pack/dp/B000VR021Y/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1415208347&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=purpose+soap)

Tone: Same as AM

Ziana

Wait 10-15 minutes

Moisturize: Nivea again

The improvement in my skin over the past few weeks has been incredible. I was so worried because I took a job in cosmetics and, for the first 2 weeks my skin was all flaky and weird, so how could anyone take me seriously?! But in the past 2 weeks, 3 of my coworkers have complemented me on my skin and **all of them used the word glowing**. So, thank you so much, SCA!

Feedback welcome. I'm about to run out of Purpose and, though it's been okay for my sensitive, dry skin, I do feel tight and dry if I don't slap on some moisture real quick. I'd like to replace it with a milky/cream cleanser or oil cleanser that emulsifies and rinses more cleanly than my OCM. I'm also on the hunt for a day moisturizer that absorbs well, but keeps me hydrated. Surprisingly, Nivea isn't too bad for me during the day because I wear mineral powder foundation and they get along pretty well. Light dusting of finishing powder over top and I don't look shiny. And, if you want to recommend a hydrating or antioxidant serum, go for it! As mentioned, I work in the cosmetics department at Nordstrom, and there's a Sephora in the same mall, so I can sample lots of stuff. Not that I mind drugstore purchases :)

Starting salaries for software engineers in my area is ~60k. My question is with the knowledge of 4 years of experience making 80k here, is it feasible to use that in my own salary negotiations? So if no experience is 60k, 4 years is 80k, if I request 70k is that unreasonable?"

Or am I just looking at this wrong and there's a specific answer they want.

Should I have lied to them and said yeah I'm an expert in bla bla, and then make it up as I go along? Or should I have said ""Umm, nothing, I'm in college..""

With that said, how realistic is it for us non-degrees to get a decent/good paying coding job?  Is there a lot to miss out on by not having that degree?  Does the original low-balling of salary haunt you the rest of your career?  Is this a pipe/unrealistic dream?

How do I go about making myself more marketable for a field where I do not have any particular advantage over others?

My first internship was a bit of a letdown, I was a lab tech in a manufacturing plant. Second one was much more awesome, working in R&amp;D for a consumer product company where I was really able to take ownership and initiative in leading a lot of projects and assignments.

I'd really like to explore the automotive/aerospace field, particularly either in manufacturing or in development. My past internships aren't giving me any particular expertise in those fields and in those areas. In interviewing for the summer for 2-3 companies, I made it past through the initial screening and to final interviews, but did not manage to secure any offers. In all those cases, I was interested in a manufacturing/development position.

Starting now including the upcoming spring semester, I'd really like to make myself marketable towards obtaining those positions. My GPA is good and I am involved in positions of leadership on campus, so I feel what is really holding me back is a lack of experience/interest in working in the areas I am applying to. I have the opportunity to take some classes that concentrate on automotive/aerospace/manufacturing areas, but am hesitant about increasing an already heavy workload as those classes do not involve any hands-on projects or experiences. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated!"

I have had two internships, both of them related to web development on the front end. One during summer 2013 and another during summer of 2014. During and after this last summer, I have been contacted by many recruiters. They email/call me with new open positions that companies have. I interviewed at a couple but have yet to successfully get an offer.

I find that during interviews, most technical questions involve data structures and algorithms, both of which I have not had classes in. What has gotten me through most skepticism is my self-motivated desire to learn outside of classes. I've learned most of JavaScript and JS frameworks online; I make sure to tell them I learned most of my web dev knowledge outside of school which usually impresses HR recruiters, but makes technical recruiters skeptical.

I'm a bit worried that I'm exhausting my options very quickly. I am currently learning algorithms through online lectures. If I interview at multiple companies and get rejected because my algorithm knowledge is bad, they may not want to interview me in the future because they have my interview record on file or something.

On one hand, I don't have a job yet and I'm still actively looking. But if I interview at too many places, I might run out of options. Then what? Should I stop applying to places and only do so once I get a firm grasp on algorithms? Should I apply to less technical (more design oriented) positions? My applications have been for front-end development positions, which many say that the relevance of algorithms and data structures is debate-able."

**Background**

&gt; Age: 24

&gt; Education: BA in Economics from a University. Graduated Last December ('13)

&gt; Location: Los Angeles


**Current Situation**

Interning at a startup (approaching my 4th year). Position for which I'm interning for is called ""Technical Services"". We pretty much use an in house proprietary data manipulation software one of the developers made. It uses syntax that's very similar to SQL. We also occasionally dabble in terminal. I've learned a lot here but they are currently in some financial lock. They can't bring me aboard salaried even though I'm putting in 45+ hours a week. They dangled the possibility of employment after the holidays but quite frankly I'm not sure if its a good idea as I'm putting in a ton of hours as an intern now, I know it'll only go up even more when I'm salaried.

I've been learning Ruby on my free time whenever I get the chance. I've been using this site [Link](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/) and I've gotten about halfway (twice) through in a span of two months for reiteration. About to start the latter half this weekend. This is in a span of two months. Now with the limited free time I have (3-5 hrs on the weekends), I'm thinking I should probably devote more time to learn what I need. At my current pace, I'm not even sure how long it'll take me to be adept enough for an entry programming job.

- Stability is very important at this moment (to the point where if I don't get any of those jobs, I would have to go to a warehouse to earn rent and food money). I'd say quite low risk tolerance.
- Salary doesn't matter that much, since it's gonna be enough for me either way.

What would be the best play here to not accidently outplay myself?

2lfolu,9,2014-11-05,"Renegotiate, jump ship, stay with it",Ttiamus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2lfolu/renegotiate_jump_ship_stay_with_it/,"I graduated in May and currently work for a subcontractor on a decently sized federal contract. During my last semester of school, I had trouble finding work after an internship so by the time I was offered this job in July, I was running low on funds. The job is working Maintenance on Java web apps as well as some development of new ones, but mostly just maintenance. 

This job is paying at 35k with fairly average benefits with a bonus of getting a Secret Clearance. Low end of average in my area is 45k fresh out of school for developers, but since I was running out of funds, I jumped on it when the company said that was the most they could do. I later found out after seeing emails between my company and the main contractor, that this position was budgeted 60k from the contractor. 

My initial plan was to stay with this company for about a year to get some more experience, since all I really have before this is a couple months at an internship and some side projects I'm working on now. The more I do at the job though the more I realize I'm being paid way too little to put up with a lot of this mess with the government red tape. 

The way I see current options are like this...

1. The company does yearly evaluations around Christmas. From everything I've been told this is the only time that I can be given a raise. At that point I'll have been with the company for 5 months, but only really working on projects for about two months. Because of the short time, I'm not really expecting to be able to get up into that 50-60k range from where I'm at now. Also from what I've heard from talking to other people on base, my company has become known for underpaying.

2. I can proceed to fill out applications currently and switch as soon as possible. My biggest concern here is I haven't been a part of much yet with the company, so I wouldn't have much to talk about my time spent with them in future interviews, and I don't know how well leaving after only a few months would look. 

3. Stick with the current plan of staying about a year then find a different job. I've just about decided that I don't really want to work for the federal government if I can help it, but that's also 75% of the work in my area. 

Any advice on a course of action going forward? Or just advice in general. Thanks everyone!"
2lfpnf,2,2014-11-05,TIFU by accidentally agreeing to pay €900 for a really bad film,[deleted],tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2lfpnf/tifu_by_accidentally_agreeing_to_pay_900_for_a/,"For some backstory, I've been organising a pretty big two-day conference for the last seven months in between Uni and summer. The thing just happened a couple of weeks ago and everything went well, we had a great line up of speakers and multi-media stuff, and people actually showed up and were engaged.

I was patting myself on the back for managing to pull it off with pretty much zero experience and getting through it all alive. The only thing is the conference, I now believe, is cursed.

The thing had problems from day one, the NGO we were working with couldn't even get a bank account sorted (al the banks were too 'unethical') and when the original conference director got some swanky job abroad I was selected to take over. I led a team of all unpaid student interns (including myself) for a couple of months with this NGO until I went off on a long planned trip over summer, thinking everything was pretty much sorted and the rest of the team could take over from here. 

Then one day, half way through my trip on the other side of the world I get an email from our intern treasurer telling me that the conference has been cancelled. The NGO decided that they didn't really know what they were doing, and it was getting too late without enough being organised (especially on their part with the bank account, the programme and speakers were sorted). At this point I think hey fuck them! I busted my guts over this for six months and now they're *cancelling*? I didn't sign anything, I'm resigning and taking the conference with me! I know, karma's a bitch. so I quit and we take the conference to another, better NGO, a new intern team is selected and we're good to go.

Then all the shit goes down, first one keynote's flight is too expensive so I find a kind company to foot the bill, then the speaker cancels on us. I replace her. Then our second keynote speaker cancels, at which point I get so sick i'm almost admitted to a dodgy Asian hospital and cut my trip short to fly home and recover/fix this shitfest of a conference. i find another keynote. OK back on track.

In the middle of all this I move to a different city and start a new University course. 

Three days before and the intern team is asking how to get hold of one of the films we were going to show, recommended by a higher up. I send some emails inquiring, as I thought it had already been confirmed.

Here's where shit really goes down. The leader of the NGO who was supposed to be chairing the thing/ supporting us interns gets sick and is HOSPITALISED the night before the conference is due to start. I, of course, am left to pick up and keep going, so have to write welcome and closing speeches, and generally stand up on the podium and lead the whole event (I hate public speaking). 

Remember that film? Yeah, well it turns out in all the confusion and chaos i'd overlooked a crucial thing. The fuckers were asking €900 to rent the film. Because of the way they phrased it, as well as my chicken-headed stress, I interpret it as being €900 for flights for the director to speak, as well as the rental. I said we can't pay that, and can't they donate the film like all the other artists? I get an aggressive email slating me for not having 'high ideals' and I say of course we'll pay the rental, we support artists rights! I thought the rental fees were going to be max €100 or something.

I was so, so wrong. Now I have a €900 rental fee with an international film agency chasing me up, and no money as we spent our measly grants on making the conference happen, and then the small profits on reimbursements. The leftovers are no where near €900.


**tl;dr** TIFU by promising €900 which we don't have to international film company in midst of stress and panic after organising conference from hell."

A lot of you all will sit here and tell me that it's a sob story and that you don't feel bad for me based on the description, but hear me out because I'm depressed as fuck and I really don't know where I'm going in life right now. I'm 22, I'm a senior in college and I am in a funk. They say that these are the years to live it up and look back on as the most fun times of your life, and don't get me wrong, I've had some great times but I really don't know if what I did here was worth my time. I'm graduating as a political science major in the spring with a 2.7, a mildly shitty GPA. I have no interest in pursuing this field, and the more classes I take the more I realize that. I got fired from my internship this summer. I was working at a spanish law firm, which I thought was a good fit because my minor is legal spanish,  but I got fired because my spanish wasn't good enough, and I pretty much sat around the entire time doing nothing. There were two lawyers there and neither one of them had time to teach me about anything in the field. I had training from one of the paralegals who I was supposed to be taking over for, but I honestly had no idea what the fuck I was doing the whole time and they just got rid of me because I was getting paid 10 bucks an hour to do nothing. I voluntarily quit on my last day of my restaurant job which was the other job I was working at the time, I was bussing tables and working my ass off the entire summer and just got fed up with people bitching me and decided to take the last day off. Despite me telling them that I wasn't coming in, they told me not to come back in the winter, and I could have really used the money to sustain my drinking habit over winter break. 
              So I'm sitting here with a set of discussion questions due for my international ethics class, but I really have no idea what I'm reading. Shit was due at 9, its 11, I keep getting extensions in this class to have my assignments due. I've got an outline for a research paper due tomorrow too, so that will probably be keeping me up for the rest of the night. I literally am concerned for myself, because I might actually be stupid. All these kids at this college know what they're talking about, and not only do I not know what the context behind their responses to questions, I just don't care at all. I'm wasting my parents money on a degree that isn't even marketable. Two summers ago I got in the best shape of my life, I lost 25 pounds and got ripped, which didn't even matter because I have zero game and can't talk to girls if my life fucking depended on it. I'm fat again, wohooo one year of constantly working out put to waste, thats depressing right? Lol so funny story, here's where you probably won't give a fuck, but I'll just tell you anyways. So somehow I got into the best fraternity on campus as a freshman. That was back when I was a raging fattie, so how it worked out, not sure. Guess I have a chill personality. Well, turns out that being in the best fraternity still doesn't get you laid if you have no game, even when you're in great shape and have a great mindset. I've pretty much said the dumbest things to the brothers and went from being the vice president at one point to being the almost inactive, creepy piece of shit that stands around at parties and doesnt talk to girls. Don't I sound like the type of person you love to hate? I'm fucking jewish, I have a fucking big nose, I'm unathletic as shit, my parents aren't proud of me, I have zero prospects coming out of this place and honestly? If I put in a little bit of hard work, things would work out. Life is just getting the best of me right now, and it's hard to think positively and keep negativity out of my life because I'm stressed the fuck out and have a terrible addiction to tobacco. I blow way too much cocaine, drink til I pass out, and wake up every fucking day without a bitch. Why the fuck do I suck, and should I kill myself? Probably, idk, I'm just trying to gauge whether or not I'm an average joe or someone that might actually have potential. Thanks people on the internet, you make life way more interesting.

All options would look solid on a resume as opposed to no work experience but I am not sure which to take. All 3 options don't seem like what I would enjoy doing long term.

2lgkae,20,2014-11-06,Strong Music Writers Also Cry: Getting Coverage for Emerging Bands in Establishment Media is a Sick Game of Catch 22. A Rant,metroknome,WeAreTheMusicMakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/2lgkae/strong_music_writers_also_cry_getting_coverage/,"I’m writing this to vent as well as to seek advice. Please excuse the massive wall o’ text and I am deeply grateful to anyone who can find the time to read this and perhaps share thoughts and advice.

I’m 35 years old. I became a cadet journalist when I was 18 and was editor of a fairly unglamorous consumer magazine at 20. I continued editing various slightly more glamorous magazines in different cities until I was 26. All throughout that time I was freelancing for music street press and websites, even serving a stint for a couple of years with a weekly column, plus album reviews and interviews from various local and international acts. At 26 I moved to Japan and I now write advertising copy for a living.

Now my kids are getting older, I have time to get out and see bands again. Not every night of the week like I did in my 20s, but enough. And the stuff I’m seeing is blowing my mind. A lot of the bands I see come via recommendations from musicians I meet at the studio where I rehearse with my own band. One thing leads to another and you find yourself tangentially involved in a scene. Making friends. In this case, people involved in extreme hardcore punk, black metal, psychedelic rock, and other experimental music.

So I found myself able to talk to and meet the people behind some seriously incredible and wildly imaginative music. I can’t believe they aren’t known outside of the country. I offer to help. I *want* to help. Figure that any music website of a decent size purporting to be “dedicated to the discovery of exciting new sounds” would be pleased to receive a short interview, some pics, and audio files free of charge, from somewhere other than America, Australia, or Europe, of good quality.

Boy was I wrong. First I interviewed my mate’s band (themselves veterans of the local hardcore scene, being a primary influence on countless bands including Envy), easing myself back into the saddle. I got it published first try on a small but established UK website. Cool! Then I wanted to start talking to bands outside of my circle that I’d seen live on tour, that were just really freaking outstanding. So with the help of my drummer (translator) and a couple of other connections I was able to hook up an interview with the guitarist from a cult underground black metal band from Tokyo currently on one of the larger indie labels here. They are about to release their second album on a French label and the excitement in the local scene is considerable.

I never met the guitarist, and he naturally had no idea who I was, so it seemed like common courtesy to let him know where the story would be published since he was taking the time to answer my questions.

No worries! I hit the web and started emailing people. First I started with all the major metal websites, through to second- and third-tier sites. Then most of the print mags dealing with heavier music. Then all of the arty “diverse music” ones—think the slightly less pretentious versions of Pitchfork. Then a lot of the more general music websites carrying interviews that attract a decent amount of traffic. I didn’t carpetbomb. I took a week to research the ones I thought would be down for a story of this kind and took some time to get a feel for what they might be after.

Then I sent probably 20 brief, personalized emails to editors and other relevant people pitching the idea. And then waited. And waited. One of the major Pitchforky-style sites eventually replied with a request to send some music over (though I actually emailed them three times, each time being automatically referred to some lower-ranked person as the editor was “Currently On Sabbatical”. LOL). So I did, and haven’t heard anything from them since. The music files I sent haven’t even been downloaded. And in a similar handball-situation I eventually got the following from a major metal website, which when not fawning over Machine Head, Metallica, or Meshuggah (all relevant about 15 years ago), are circlejerking about the latest label-sponsored KVLT sadsacks from Norway:

&gt; Thanks. We’ll pass.

No!! Thank you!! I’m just fucking overcome with fucking joy you would deign to flick your fingers to reply to such a craven one as me! Thank you so much for your irreplaceable time, Great Gatekeeper, Great Arbiter, Great Judger of All Music Heard and Unheard!! 

Another “metal” mag in the UK, biting back an outburst of scornful laughter, sent [this](http://i.imgur.com/mFFHU2d.png). Which made me laugh. Bitterly. Because it cuts to the heart of all that’s fucked up with western music journalism and the ridiculous Catch 22 that seems to exist for bands trying to find people not from their own city to give their music a 30-second chance.

From what I can figure out, a band can only qualify for exposure on any site getting more than 100 hits a day if:

(a)	They’ve already “made it” by generating enough “buzz” in other media
(b)	They are lucky enough to be ordained by a staff member or regular contributor as worthy of exposure
(c)	They are “owed” exposure in return for an advertising commitment from a label.

I want to be clear that the reason I am kind of outraged about this is not that this rejection is some sort of crushing blow to my ego. Believe me I can handle it, I’ve even doled out a few myself after 10 years grinding out magazines at the sausage factory. The thrill of seeing my name is print has faded. I realize am a workmanlike writer, but if nothing else I have at least matured beyond the painful purple floweriness that almost all music writers in their 20s suffer from. I try to write plainly and communicate clearly. I don’t want money. I don’t give a shit about bylines. I don’t give a shit about setting myself up as some kind of tastemaker.

What I *am* upset about is that a band from a non-English-speaking country—even one with a supposed cache of cool like Japan—are totally passed over, not given even the merest glimpse of a chance of having their music exposed to potential fans, despite climbing about as high in the indie scene as you can in a country of a 133,000,000 people. 

I’m upset at the apparent snobbery of the media establishment, the way these people jealously guard their gates lest one of the unwashed slips in. 

And I’m upset that probably hundreds of other writers, most of them young, keen, and thin-skinned, have *their* submissions totally ignored or rejected, for who knows what reasons. They won’t ever know because the people they are sending them to have an over-inflated sense of their own importance, and can’t find it within themselves to type out a couple of lines. Or, heaven forbid, why not give them a fucking chance and *read the story and watch a youtube clip of the band*? Are you *that* fucking busy? Are that fucking *jaded*?

I for the life of me can’t figure out how a band from another part of the world—Russia, China, Thailand—can ever expect anything more than a trickle of interest from beyond their own narrow national borders without a couple of leg-ups from those with some influence online. Most of them will never seek it, but it seems the small percentage that try are slapped down. 

These hipster outlets—and being a metalhead does not preclude one from being a god-damn hipster—promising to “find the next great band before they get big” are full of horseshit. They are fishing from a small, shallow pond and ignoring the wide ocean at their backs. They are speaking into an echochamber, congratulating each other with smug pieces about bands who they would never have fucking touched prior to being an approving paragraph in *The A/V Club*. A friend of a friend who saw them in some Manhatten basement. An accidental find while browsing reddit. Who knows? I wish I had the secret.

To be successful, a website needs diverse new content that’s continually refreshed and replaced. It needs content that is unique to balance the high-profile stories and news items. Something that won’t necessarily be parroted back breathlessly two days later in another place online who saw the same item in *The A/V Club*. 

To reject a gift-wrapped story offered free of charge written for a medium where it costs essentially nothing to publish is insane, even if the band were not of quality. I can’t fathom it. The high-handedness only adds insult to injury. Who the fuck *are* these people?

I’m not naïve: I expected to be ignored or rejected out of hand by 80 per cent of the outlets I contacted, that’s why I contacted so many. I thought I would probably win three or four longer replies with expressing cool disinterest. And I thought maybe one… or even two… saying: “Sure. Send it over when it’s done and we’ll take a look. Can’t guarantee anything though.” 

This situation hurts the diversity of independent music. It sucks for bands with established local fanbases who would probably break through and find wider appreciation if only for a helping hand. And it sucks for writers and photographers and videographers and whoever else is inspired by quality music and wants to help bands in whatever they can. 

The “indie” outlets jack themselves off feverishly in the corner to a crumpled photo of Ariel Huffington while muttering “we are freethinking and independent” and “a band’s relative popularity means nothing to us, we *are kingmakers*”, and sending off a Google Analytics figures to Sketchers or Captial Records. Go fuck yourselves, you unbearable wankers.

I’ll probably get this interview published on one of small, struggling blogs I know who’ll be happy to have it for the year or so they survive before sinking beneath the digital waves. The interview will receive 35 views, all from the band’s friends, and it will sink into obscurity. 

Just for once I wanted to give the music the voice it deserved, a chance at being a part of the conversation in its rightful place on the world stage. But it looks like unless this act pulls off some kind of miracle and gets signed to a major label with $$$ to throw around, or I somehow luck out and get a “yes” from a coke-hazed sub dizzy from being rimmed by an intern desperate to slide on her own pair of black-framed glasses, it probably won’t happen. 

Which is a fucking shame. It’s a shame for them and it’s a shame for you guys and girls who make incredible music and don’t want to compromise.

I know that I could weasel my way in ever so sycophantically to some mid-sized Arts &amp;amp; Culture magazine with one or two brow-furrowing, chin-stroking album reviews about bands I don’t care about, using words like “sinewy” and “topographical”. That would not serve the band that made it and it would not serve me. If I’m going to write for free, I’ll write about who *I* want to write about. Bands with drive and ambition that don’t know the code to at least getting a fair fucking hearing.
 
I’ll close with a couple of questions:

(a)	How do you as musicians deal with the frustrations of “not being big enough” to be worthy of the attention of the establishment press?
(b)	Do you have any suggestions on what I can do in this situation before I flick the review to an outlet “more in line with the band’s profile”?
(c)	Am I too old and cynical to persist with this nonsense?

I thank you for reading this diatribe, if you made it, and I appreciate any comments.

Edit: it's necessary to add this post came from a point of frustration. I don't know the band in question personally and I have nothing to lose at all by putting the idea down on the floor and walking away from it. The band doesn't give a shit. They never asked to be interviewed. *I* asked *them*. They don't make any effort to promote themselves in any way. Like most awesome bands, they leave that shit up to random people who see them live. I'm frustrated that couldn't happen in this case and saddened that the western media is is closed in. There is good music beyond the English speaking world... Open a window."

I've wanted a gaming rig for a long time and this was the first time I could afford one.



A couple of months ago I was just about to pull the trigger on a prebuildt one since I've never built one before. But I asked around here and a few redditors convinced me and helped me out. And I found out that one of my friends was familiar with building PCs so helped med with part picking and the build process.




I am so happy with the result and I am glad that I now have a PC that I can upgrade and not having to spend a lot of money on a new one in a couple of years.





There is just one thing, that isn't really a problem but it is an irregularity that I would rather be without. Sometimes my monitor has a kind of a line. It's hard to explain but almost like a wave that the old VCRs would have after a while. Or if you could picture you pulling your finger on water and causing movement in the water, except the wave would be in a thin straight line.
Now I don't know if it is because of the rig, some driver issues or because of my old screen, it's a ""generic PnP screen"", 27"" from LG. And it happens sometimes when I game and sometimes when I browse the Internet.


And while we're on the subject I am thinking of buying a new monitor. Not now but in the possible near future. And I don't what to go with.

All I know I want is a 27""  since I've grown accustomed to it. But I wonder how much of a strain a 1440p monitor would have on my card? Would it be better to go with a 144hz 1080p monitor instead?
Because I might add a second screen so later on.

It is not clear whats gonna happen with rekkles and yellowstar and whats gonna happen with FNATIC in general,
the new Team arround the previous fnatic members hasnt qualified for the LCS and won't play there the next split.
If Tabz joins the new Challenger Team and he wont does a new contract with alliance it might be possible that the rumors arround Rekkles become true and he joins Alliance.(Intern problems Tabz-Alliance were confirmed on Tabz ask.fm 2 weeks ago)

2lhiul,2,2014-11-06,It's been two years and I[19M] still can't get over her[19F]. What do I do?,2Years_AndCounting,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2lhiul/its_been_two_years_and_i19m_still_cant_get_over/,"I've been head over heels for Emily since the beginning of senior year, high school. It's been two years since then.

Started out not wanting to pursue anything, what with it being senior year and having to break up after a year anyway. We became friends, I got to know her better, got to know her friends better: there was nothing to dislike, and I liked everything about her, down to how she tied her shoelaces. Asked her out, told her how I felt, she said she didn't know how she felt, which is probably, lets be real, the nice way of saying ""I don't feel the same way"".

Fast forward several months and I'm still crazy about her, continue to be her friend, but the obvious flirting and allusions to ""what could be"" don't cease. Finally hook up, talk it through, we're together until I have to leave the country to return home (I'd been studying broad for high school). Our relationship as we knew it ends, but we talk for hours each day for the next 5 months or so. 

December comes around, I go to see her as a surprise, tells me she doesn't think of me that way anymore, fine, I've got a lot of other friends there. Still hang out with her some, still have a great time. On the night before I leave to return home, we watch a movie, get close, things get heated, I pull away (mostly because I knew how much worse it'd be the next morning if I'd let things continue the way they were going) and remind her we're not a couple anymore. God it was difficult. But I wanted to get over her, wanted to move on. 

Call her at midnight, new year's, someone else picks up her phone: a mutual friend who I'm pretty close to. Says Emily can't pick up the phone because she's ""engaged in more important matters"". Dig at her for more details, she's hooking up with some random. I'm pissed. I'd never been so pissed in my life. Hands shaking, temperature flaring, I hang up, knowing I'm in no position to be pissed. We've moved on, we're nothing anymore, she's moved on, why can't you? 

Spend months, 3 or 4, not talking to her at all. She tries engaging in conversation several times, I cut them all short with curt replies. I feel better. I have an internship, am surrounded by other people, I'm feeling much better. Summer comes around and I return to the country of my high school to see friends. She's there. After an awkward first encounter we resume friendship. 

I hook up with some girl - Amy - at a bar, end up deciding she's really great. Love her looks, her personality; constantly catch myself comparing her to Emily but Amy's great. Spend a lot of time with her. Assure myself I've moved on, have myself a summer fling and all, things are looking good. 

Then comes the night of some event at some bar that everyone goes to. See Emily there. Amy's with her friends, nowhere in sight. I'm only a little intoxicated, but I pull Emily aside, and tell her I'm still crazy about her. She words say no but her actions say yes; she's got her arms around mine and looks close to tears, and says the words ""you make things so awkward, why can't we just enjoy the night?"". I tell her I need an answer, she begins tearing up, saying ""I can't, I can't"". I storm off. 

When I return home from my trip I don't talk to her at all. That was June. It's November now. I'm in college, have a girlfriend, a whole new set of friends. Just ended a 4 hour Skype call that came out of the blue with Emily. Hearing her voice, her laugh, her awkward grasp of difficult-to-pronounce words, it brought it all back. 

I'm back to square one. What do I do?


---   
**tl;dr**

Really liked this girl in high school. After months of asking her out, we finally got together. Had to break up at the end of senior year. From then till now, I've tried everything to get over her. Skype call that just ended a few minutes ago brought it all back, I'm crazy about her again. What do I do?"

An Intro: The Fedex Forum
----

Who are we? What do we stand for? And how do people fall in love with the epic adventure that we call the memphis grizzlies? Starting with our den, the [fedex forum](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0b/FedEx_Forum.jpg), this is where we take care of the spurs forever aging bench, and yes, whoop dat clip, ^getem.. this bad boy built in 2002 of modern technology and innovation seats just about 18k memphibians at full capacity. dont let that scare you away if youre a visiting fan, this is one of the nicest venues you'll ever see.
 
If youre planning to visit, and want to see your team or the griz play, then youre in luck, for at todays state of the art Fedex Forum, a ticket would cost you as cheap as 3 bucks. Lower Level seats are $60 each, which is very nice because you can experience the grizzlies at an affordable price..

The atmosphere is always electric, and when you go I hope you're lucky enough to be able to experience one of memphis' local bands during time out and commercial breaks.

ok so yall mother fuckers want to know who plays for the memphis grizzlies these days? Guess what, [Vince Carter](http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/11206151/vince-carter-set-join-memphis-grizzlies) is like the best thing thats happened to us since Zbo broke his addiction to cocaine, or rather [his tendancies to get caught selling](http://www.oregonlive.com/west-linn/index.ssf/2012/03/police_documents_offer_glimpse.html).. ok.. now enough with the fucking around, heres the roster.


Players | Number | Position
-------|------|--------
Zbo | 50 | PF
Marc Gasol | 33 | C
Mike Conley Jr. | 11 | PG
Tony Allen  | 9 | SG
Courtney Lee | 5 | SG
Jon Leuer | 30 | PF
Kosta ""koufy"" the Koufing Koufos | 41 | C
Beno Udrih | 19 | PG
VINCE CARTER  | 15 | SG
Quincy Pondexter | 8 | SG
T-Prince | 21 | SF
Kalin Lucas | -- | PG
Jordan Adams | -- | SG


NOW  before you look at this and scream at me ""who the flying fuck is kalin Lucas,"" dont worry.. we're all thinking the same thing.. ok apparently hes a pretty good player trapped in the d-league (brother, go to fucking europe and get paid a salary!!) [that has taken on a temporay position in case something happens to the Mike AND Beno.. lol pls no.](http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/11/05/grizzlies-sign-kalin-lucas/)

Zack Randolph &amp; Gang
---
recent news: [lol](http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/11/03/anthony-davis-with-ridiculous-putback-over-zach-randolph-video/).

my take:

this guy, Zbruh, is a part of the heart and soul of the memphis grizzlies. This so called heart and soul consitis of non other than the marc gasol, zbo, MCjr, and tony allen.. T-Prince is slowly joining, and Vince Carter seems to be loving it in memphis so far.. Besides, it was a great time to get out of dallas with all this ebola going around. After Zbo was traded from the clippers to the grizzlies, he as grown into some phenom of a player. developing a midrange game has made him one of the leagues hardest players to defend, and I'd go as far as to put him in my top ten of current best PF..

Marc Gasol is having a contract season, yall.. expect great things from him. Hes probably gunna try a lot harder to get the most out of a contract that hopefully the grizzlies can seal on him. I would absolutely HATE TO SEE THE LAKERS TRY TO TAKE HIM LIKE THEY DID WITH HIS BROTHER.. But ok folks, jokes aside, even ESPN has been making a big deal about how well [Marc Gasol looks,](http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/71085/stealth-mvp-candidate-marc-gasol) so theres got to be a little fire kindling beneath him..  maybe its the new haircut. i dont like the new haircut.. but then again, i dont like change.

Tony Allen is kinda dwindling in his ability to be effective offensively.. Defensively, hes pretty good.. just kidding, hes one of the best still which is scary because  we need him to be healthy the entire season to be really effective against top notch teams. People will retort by saying ""well the griz are 8th, thats technically top notch"".. Thats like Lower Top Notch, im talking about those powerful 3 eastern conference teams everyones watching these days.

Mike conley Jr. Well you know alot about him, hes a kid from indiana, played for ohio state, drafted by the memphis grizzlies and has stayed with them as a starter or pretty much a solid role forever. His father was an olympian, probably where he gets alot of his athletic ability. This guy is the unsung hero of the group, deserving a lot more attention than many of the other players bc if it wasnt for him, there wouldnt be a play.

The Coach
---

[Who the heck is Dave Joerger?](http://www.foxsports.com/content/dam/fsdigital/RSN/North/2014/01/31/PI-NBA-David-Joerger-013114.jpg)
Born on a cold day in staples, minnesota, Dave aspired to be a coach of an NBA team one day. He started off coaching the dakota wizards, then cedar rapid river raiders, the sioux Falls Skyforce, then back to the wizards, then for 6 years served as an assistant coach for the griz, before finally today becoming the grizlies HC..

and thats the coaches story. Hes won multiple awards on the way, including 2 time CBA coach of the year, 3 time CBA Champ, and 2007 D league champion.
Then he one an IBA champ back in 2001,but no one really gave a fuck abot that one dave, lets be honest..

 On a lighter note, apparently this goon of a golly gosher had a [bobblehead for his team in dakota.. what team does this with their budget](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Joerger#mediaviewer/File:Dave_Joerger_bobble-head.png)??

Hes a pretty good coach, who values team play rather than player v player play (the kind of environment players like VC can thrive in). Thats pretty much it though, hes 100% not as sexy as Lionel Holiness, but he's a better version of lionel as far as coaching goes.

My Expectations
---
Honestly, Ya'll, i wouldnt steer your wrong.. I see this team finishing the season either number 4 or 5 in the west. Having said that, I would like to also say that if you dont agree with me, thats ok.. the west is completely unpredictable. teams are so streaky, different teams have to travel different miles to their away games (The east is condensed, while the west is kinda spread, with a lean towards the west more) but at the end of the day, this is marc gasols career season. ZBo just signed a contract, but maybe marc and the addition of VC will help motivate him alittle more.
 I always love going to a game with the family, have some of those BBQ Rendevous Nachos, and a beer or two.. and boom shakalaka you have a party..

2lhsuc,137,2014-11-06,How I tricked my coworker into thinking I could read his mind. A short story about bad security.,ElGuaco,programminghorror,https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/2lhsuc/how_i_tricked_my_coworker_into_thinking_i_could/,"In the 90's I worked as a paid intern for a smallish company. The platform was a PICK database system that used a flavor of BASIC for applications. It was a pretty strange and antiquated setup even for that era, considering the ""server"" was 486/50MHz machine with a junction box that split out to dozens of dummy terminals communicating via 9600 baud cables. Hey, it worked, and it got me some real-world experience.

But this O/S was so bad. It had issues like ""compiled"" applications could not exceed 32kb. Yes, kilobytes. I once had to split an app into two because it had overgrown this barrier and so I used some trickery to get the apps to appear to run concurrently without interrupting the workflow the users were used to.

The most egregious fault of this system was that it was terribly insecure. Usernames and passwords were limited to 8 characters and no numbers or symbols. Usernames were typically the first name of the person which led to problems when you had 5 employees with the name ""Dave"". Being one of the few in-house developers, I had access to everything except the admin account for the server. I was carefully instructed not to misuse my powers as the VP's had carelessly stored HR and payroll info on the server. As a power user, I could also do other dumb tricks like take over a user's session and type on their terminal remotely, which was good for a prank at best, and at worst it could be used to spy on people's activities while they worked.
 
The absolute worst thing I discovered one day while I was trolling through the file-system/database one day, I discovered a table called ""Failed Logins"". To my horror/delight, the table listed failed login attempts with the username and the password attempt in *plain text*. Now, I don't know about you, but I often typo my credentials a few times a week depending on how tired I am or if I'm in a hurry. It seemed like everyone else did the same, and I could clearly guess the real password of every user on the system within a minute of searching this table. I got a really terrible idea and made a bet with my fellow programmer that I could guess his password by reading his mind. I made a big show of standing with my back to him while he logged in then logged back out. I then logged in using his credentials which I had deduced from my earlier scan. I quickly realized I probably shouldn't go around showing off this new ability lest it get me in trouble.

Good things can still happen.,Gavel5,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2li9o2/low_gpa_good_things_can_still_happen/,"It seems to me that a very common trend of students on this subreddit freak out at the thought of a bad grade. Yeah, grades are important, but in my experience, not everything. Now, I am not saying to find out the minimum GPA to graduate and shoot for that. But if you have a bad class or couple of classes, so what? Work hard in other classes to try and bring them up, and look at it as a learning experience.

Now, some might be asking why I am making this post. I graduate in 6 weeks. I recently was offered a full time cost accounting position for a rather large company (didn't worry about public positions, public has never been my style). I got an offer of 50K (pretty solid starting amount for BFE Indiana) and a 3K starting bonus. I networked myself well, had a public internship as well as a corporate internship at a small local business. 
My GPA? Currently, a 2.951. 

I got my interview for my job through my career fair. I had a friend who interned with this company, and she and I did a few group projects where we chose this company, so I had a decent amount of knowledge. I met with a senior Financial Analyst and made a good impression. He told me to apply on their website and I would hear back about a first round interview. I was excited. However,when  I got home and went to apply, I saw something dreadful: minimum GPA: 3.6. Well shit. Went and applied to a few other places and forgot about it. Until I got a phone call; it was the guy from the career fair. He mentioned I didn't apply, I told him honestly why not, and he said, ""I don't really care. Your resume is impressive enough that I want to offer you a first round interview."" Fast forward 3 weeks, passed the first round interview, had a second round interview at the plant with 9 other people. Felt like I crushed it. Got the call with the offer. So much happiness, relief, excitement. 

Just remember, GPA isn't everything. Don't freak out. Breathe. This is 4 (or 4.5 in my case) years of your life. It'll go by quick. Enjoy it."

My questions to you all are:

1) For those who have done this sort of trip alone, what sort of tips could you give me to make things easier for myself?

2) I'm considering just bringing a sleeping pad and bag (and blankets) and just sleeping in my car at rest stops. Is this a good idea? I will have room in my car to fit myself, so I'm just more worried about freezing while I sleep in the winter weather.

Thanks!

My major concern is my visa status

 In terms of what I would be doing, Oracle and Facset are a tad obscure but Im pretty sure they offer super exiting projects. For the startup, I would strictly be working on their IOS app.
I dont think I can mention the salary information but they are all pretty much the same.  You can look up the oracle salary here: http://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Oracle-Software-Engineer-Salaries-E1737_D_KO7,24.htm. The other 2 companies pay SLIGHTLY less.
Oracle is in San Francisco, the other 2 are in downtown Austin

What worries me about the startup is that while they have told me they will help me with the h1b visa and a green card later on, I am scared. I dont know if they will be around for another 5 years, and if that happens I dont know if I will be able to find another job due to my visa status

I know Oracle helps me get a green card as soon as I begin. Factset its after working 5 years for them. 
Oracle's green card offer seems awesome but I dont know how much it would help me since I will only have a BS in computer science so I need 5 years of experience to file for one .

I currently work as an intern for the startup and I love all the people there. So I know the environment is amazing.

What would you guys do? Or what should I ask my self

thanks

So, when I saw spoilers of Crisium Grid I was incredibly excited about finally doing an Off the Grid deck, and with Blue Sun's bounce ability to return Off the Grid to hand when it's no longer needed there's no better time than now to do it. I've been playing variations of this on OCTGN, expecting someone else to come and submit an amazing deck of this type on reddit, but I haven't seen any so here it is.

This is a glacier deck. Your ideal opening involves a few turns of getting your eco up and building up ice around centrals and possibly scoring out Project Atlas/Gila Hands. Don't worry about getting a big fort on HQ, you can always rearrange your ice later. 

In the midgame you might score agendas in the normal glacier fashion, but if you have enough money you can go Off the Crisium grid: stick a few pieces of ice on HQ, and Crisium Grid, with Off the Grid in a remote server. The runner must run HQ, pay 5 to trash Crisium Grid and then run HQ again to trash Off the Grid, and then run your agenda. It's not as expensive as you might think, remember that Off the Grid comes back to your hand if the runner doesn't trash it.

Since this deck's plan is based on credit taxing I've been very leery of Bad Publicity. No Hostile Takeover, no Grim, no Geothermal Fracking, but NAPD Contract fits in very well with credit taxing.

Economically you don't want to get trapped with something low, especially early on, so if that happens use beanstalk, Adonis, GRNDL Refinery, etc. to build back up. That's also why Gila Hands is the one pointer. I really hadn't expected Gila Hands to be very good when I put it in (surely this is a big money deck anyway) but anything that gets you going is vital. This deck can also spend a lot of money in one turn, if you drop a curtain wall onto a 2-deep HQ and rez off the grid then the difference between playing a Beanstalk at 19 credits is actually quite important!

Agenda mix: At first this deck had 3 Priority Requisition, but I decided to drop down to 2 and take 2 Gila Hands. The versatile agenda mix helps mitigate the 'I have scored 3 2-pointers, will I draw a 3 pointer?"" problem, and reduces the variance of random accesses. NAPD is great for the tax, and I don't need to tell anyone why Atlas is good.

Program destruction: so, I'm running two Ichii's! Well, having committed to no BP Program destruction was a bit of a puzzle. I don't have enough 1 pointers to happily drop them for archer, and I really like rearranging my ice anyway. Rototurret just isn't taxing enough in a taxing deck, but Ichii is perfect. It's also wonderfully scary once it comes back to your hand.
Will o'Wisp is nice, and I tried it in earlier versions of the deck, but the anti-synergy with Crisium Grid hurts. It's also an economy set-back, you'll never get those 4 credits back when you trash it."

2ljaa5,4,2014-11-06,My boyfriend [21M] and I [19F] are planning on getting engaged. I'm concerned my mom's knee-jerk reaction will be that we're taking things too fast.,Another_Fucking_Wasp,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ljaa5/my_boyfriend_21m_and_i_19f_are_planning_on/,"I'm sure that reddit will give me a lot of shit due to our age, or at least mine. I'm a college freshman, and he's also in college working to change his major (and therefore schools). 

We met in high school band when I was a freshman and he was a senior, and we were just friends for the school year. I was dating another guy from his class, and it was a nightmare relationship. My current boyfriend actually talked to my friends at the time saying, ""Hey, this guy is only trouble. Please try to get her out of it."" Regardless, the ex ended up being incredibly abusive, verbally, physically, and especially sexually. I somehow had this stroke of courage to break up with him before he went to bootcamp for the Army, and a month or so later, my current boyfriend and I started hanging out. While we were romantic (kissing, but not sex), we didn't really use the label of ""boyfriend/girlfriend"" for about another month, and waited even longer to start exchanging ""I love you""s. When we started having sex (which took us a while, with my past issues) he never pushed me. My point being, we took things slow, never rushed anything, and stayed honest.

He went to college, and while I was in high school I had issues with PTSD and PNES (Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures) from the last relationship. I would get seizures almost every day, and they were constantly experimenting with treatments to see what could get me to function. He came home when he could and took care of me like nobody else could. On really bad days he would just cry with me. I was worried that after my issues were taken care of, there may be problems. He does have mild depression, and that did surface after I was able to manage my issues. I pushed him to go to counseling, and it helped our relationship, though it was just counseling for him.

We've managed long-distance very well. With his school and internship positions, he would be anywhere from 3 to 12 hours away from me, and that is how it has been. But we've also had plenty of times of essentially living together. He knows my habits (ya know, sometimes I forget to squeeze the toothpaste from the bottom of the tube...I'm a monster!) and I know his. We know which aspects of each other we will be able to change and which ones probably won't, and are able to live with that.

Anytime we have arguments, they are never big and emotional. His parents have bad communication, and he said that's one thing he never wants to fall into. We always talk about issues before they get big. We respect each other, work out our differences, and our families get along great. He's actually been calling my mom ""Mom"" for at least a year. They constantly refer to stuff like ""Well when you and OP have kids"" and other kinds of references to our future.

We're on the same page with how parenting should be done, religion, finances, where we will live, and we've started talking about what family/holiday traditions we want to keep. We know we are getting married. I can't even see myself with anyone else. While we have been talking about marriage for a few years (for a while just as a hypothetical, but getting more serious as we go), I remember distinctly when I knew for sure. Last summer, we both had a really stressful week. To top it off, we were both bickering at each other and just in bad moods. I just didn't want to be around him one day. While we were at a play practice that evening (I was in it, he was playing in the orchestra pit), a mom whose kid was in the show (and we know the family pretty well) brought her very new baby, born the morning before. Her husband was holding the baby and talking to her. I just looked over at my SO and saw he was watching him too, then we made eye contact, and realized we were both tearing up. It was then we both knew we couldn't imagine our futures without each other.

We have been talking seriously about engagement for the past few months, and he admitted that he's planning on doing it sometime this year. Engagement doesn't change anything in the legal aspect, and our living situations will stay the same (my college doesn't allow us to move off campus. It's really stupid). We are in a firm, mutual understanding that we will not marry until I'm done with school (he'll be done before me) and that we have specific plans to fulfill before we start having kids (such as starting and getting solid in our careers, a little bit of traveling).

I don't know why I'm writing a novel with all of this, I don't really have to prove this relationship to you all. I guess writing it out solidifies in my own mind that I'm not getting wrapped up in teen emotions or anything, which brings me to my big concern. 

He is talking to his parents about it over Thanksgiving, and plans to ask my mom and my brothers for their blessing at some point as well. My main concern is my mom. I worry that she'll think we're rushing into this, that we haven't thought about it enough, and that I may decide to throw my college career away and elope, or something. I am completely aware that marrying before I graduate would affect my FAFSA, and I know we wouldn't be in the right financial place for it anyway.

What are your thoughts? Should I talk to my mom about this beforehand, or just see what she says when he talks to her and go from there?
---   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend and I of 3 years are in a committed relationship, and are talking about engagement. I am worried that my mom's knee-jerk reaction is that we're rushing things simply because we're a younger couple and I'm still in college. We both agree that we won't marry until after I graduate and kids will wait even longer."
2ljfta,99,2014-11-06,"My [24 M] ex won't move out of my [24 F] apartment, says he can't afford it",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ljfta/my_24_m_ex_wont_move_out_of_my_24_f_apartment/,"After 2.5 years, I called it quits with my boyfriend in late August.  Since we moved in together about a year ago, things deteriorated and became pretty unbearable. In spite of this, we talked about marriage, kids, etc., then I went out of town for about two months over the summer, and during that time I suddenly realized - I'd been unhappy for a very, very long time and didn't even realize it. Being away made me feel like a weight had been lifted. I love him, but we don't make each other happy, and he is not the person I want to spend my life with.


Problem is, it's been two months since the break up, he hasn't moved out and says he cannot afford to. His name is on the lease so I have no legal cards to play here, and as far as I'm concerned this is my place - there is no way I'm going anywhere.


A little over a year ago, he moved here, to a state where he didn't know anyone, to be with me.  After months of looking for a job he took up an unpaid internship.  I supported us during that whole time.  They started paying him about the time we broke up, so he has been contributing rent since then. (At least there is that).


He says he won't move unless he can find a place that is a) as cheap or cheaper than this place and b) within walking distance of work, like this place is.  He knows very well such a place is practically nonexistent.  He has a car, but doesn't want to drive it because it will cost him gas money and put ""wear and tear"" on the vehicle.  I did find reasonable options on craigslist which fit all his criteria, but then he said he only wants a month-to-month place, because he plans on leaving town and living with his parents as soon as he gets into law school - law school admissions are rolling so he could get in in a month, or 3 months, or he could not get in at all.  I asked if he has a plan for that, since he is only applying to top schools - he said no. 


This is a 1 bedroom apartment. We share a bed. I have been sleeping on the couch on and off for nearly two months. Every time I go back to the bed, he thinks we are doing better, tries to cuddle, gets sad when I say no, and I end up moving myself back to the couch.


I don't see an end in sight.  Every day is like breaking up all over again. It just never seems to end and I just feel so downtrodden and miserable. When we broke up, I said I needed time to work on being happy with myself before I can be happy with another person. I can't begin that process of focusing on fixing me when I am constantly dealing with this ongoing situation. 


I don't know if I need encouragement, advice, or what. Please, /r/relationships, just help me out!


*EDIT:* Made this account just to post this question and didn't check after the first handful of responses.  Obviously there is a lot of confusion here, and I expressed myself poorly, so some clarifications (if anyone happens to see this):

1) Both of us are on the lease, not just him.  I recognize he has a legal right to stay as long as he wants. I only mentioned the lease at all because a ""friend"" had suggested calling the cops to remove him, and I wanted to avoid a thread full of the same advice, because aside from the fact that it would be a nasty, unforgivable and fucked up thing to do, he has the legal right to be here.
2) I have paid his way for over a year. I (still!) pay 100% of the rent and utilities. I buy all the groceries. When we were together, if we went out to dinner, I paid. If he wanted a new pair of pants, I bought them for him. Every piece of furniture in the apartment belongs to me - moreover, I literally *made* some of the furniture. The bed is a family heirloom. When I say this apartment is mine, I mean that I pay for the rent and I paid for everything in this place. That doesn't entitle me to treat him like shit, of course. But please take this into consideration. 
3) The other reason he should be the one to move out is that he has made it clear he is leaving the state as soon as he gets into law school.  That could be within the next several weeks at this point, but definitely within the year. Meanwhile, our lease goes until August 2016. I will be here, and he won't be.  There is no way to give him the apartment without breaking the lease.
4) As for all of you asking why I go to the bed - maybe because I'm 5'8"" and the couch is only 5'5"" long, because I work 3 jobs to pay for all this crap.  
5) Everyone who is sympathizing with him about what a cunt I am: I didn't rant about the many reasons we didn't work out because the relationship is over and it's time for us to both move on.  We both got hurt by how this ended, but I'm just happy I won't spend the rest of my life dealing with the emotional abuse he slung at me.
TL:DR for the edit: thanks for calling me a cunt, here's why you're wrong, thanks for all the ""understanding"" /r/relationships. Isn't ""don't be rude"" over there in the rules column? ---&gt;

**tl;dr**: My ex won't/can't move out and it is leaving me emotionally drained."

All of my cousins completed their undergrad degrees in four years and are working decent paying jobs or have jobs lined up for when they graduate. 


I'm a 6th year senior at college and have no job offers. I'm majoring in a tech field and I have some good internship experience but it's been hard looking for a full time job. I have anxiety issues that I recently opened up to my family about, but no one understands what it means and they think it's my fault and I'm not trying hard enough. 

For my family success means having a job that pays 50k+ out of college. I'm not sure how likely this even is for me, but in their view its really easy because ALL of them successfully landed good jobs. 


The sad part is that I'm probably one of the smartest people in my family, but I've had so many other issues that have held me back including growing up in a dysfunctional family where my mom constantly threatened suicide, and anxiety/depression which led to substance abuse problems. 


For the most part I'm doing better now and so are my parents. But my family still expects me to be ""successful."" They look down on me for taking these extra years to study, they think I'm being lazy and wasting my life away and they are disappointed that I haven't found a job yet.

Almost every single incident has happened on Chicago Ave. Though I usually take North ave, Madison, or Lake st., depending on how much of in a rush I am, I sometimes found myself taking that route. While biking on Chicago ave, i've been kicked off my bike by a group of teenagers while at a light, my phone almost being snatched twice (stupid of me to have my phone out), threatened to be shot if they see me around that area again, and my bike was stolen (bike somehow ended up on campus but with everything taken off).

Second: $350 to a rated buyer (17)
Third: they actually paid with PayPal (legit payment not fake email)

Fourth: The shipping address has a totally different first and last name

Pretty much a paid internship where I was at school for 3 days a week and working as an IT junior for the other 2.  It seems to be a thing the rest of the world should adopt IMHO.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was finishing up my second day of the week and the OPs Manager walked in to let me know that the IT contracting company was coming in on Friday to repatch the comms rack.  It was bad, if I still had the pics it would be /r/cablefail worthy.

Friday came along and it was repatched to look less ugly. Then came Monday, seeing as I had to be at school I had no idea of the dramas the company was having after the repatching.  Also, because it was a Monday, I didn't get home till 7PM because of training.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I get home, knackered from 4 hours of training I jumped in the shower before having dinner.  While I was having dinner dad came into the dining room.

&gt;Dad: G'day boyo, fun day?

&gt;Me: Nya, school is school, still trying to stick my front layout full.

&gt;Dad: You will get it eventually.  Someone named [Corporate Managers name] called wanting to talk to you about something urgent.

&gt;Me: That's the Corporate Manager, I'll see her at work tomorrow. 

&gt;Dad: All right.

and dad went back to doing whatever he was doing before seeing I was home.

&gt;Receptionist: I don't think she is, she usually gets in a little later.

&gt;Me: OK, can you do me a favour? When she gets in can you let me know or get her to come in and see me please?

What the IT contractors did without telling us was connect the switches in to ring formation but didn't disconnect the star or leave a break in the ring to prevent a broadcast storm.

I sent my report to OpsMgr and CorpMgr as to what transpired and requested an explanation from the IT contractors.  A conference call was scheduled for the following afternoon to get answers from the IT Contractors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The call consisted of Myself, OpsMgr, CorpMgr, ITCon1, ITCon2 and ITCon3.

[call intro]

&gt;OpsMgr: Can tell us step by step what you did on the weekend?

&gt;ITCon1: Sure, ITCon3 was there and I'll let him explain.

&gt;ITCon3: Well, we logged where all the switch ports connected into the patch panel.  Removed all the blue data cables and ran them again using the cable managers in the rack.

&gt;Me: What about the red, yellow, purple and green cables?

&gt;ITCon3: We only touched the blue cables, the green went to the phone points, we only saw one purple phone cable that went to your Cisco router, we couldn't see where the yellow ones went so we left them alone and we couldn't trace where the red cables went from the servers.

&gt;Me:  You mentioned you made a list of where all the switch ports connected to, can you send me that list now?

&gt;ITCon3: No worries, give me a few min.

The email comes in with a spreadsheet of our network.  I see the first problem, they only list 4 switches.

&gt;Me: Guys, you only list 4 switches.  Where is the 5th switch?

&gt;ITCon3:  You only have 4 switches. We also noticed you had no interconnects between your switches so we put them in a ring and let spanning tree block one of the ports.

&gt;Me:  *Thunk*

&gt;OpsMgr: I think you guys broke slazer, he just slammed his head on the table.

&gt;ITCon1: Well that's why you don't hire teenagers as IT guys, they don't know how the real IT world works.

&gt;OpsMgr: You may want to take that back, this teenager has the power to challenge your invoice.

&gt;Me: Now that I have had a moment to process the incompetence of ITCon3 last comment I will be not approving the invoice. Here are the reasons why.

&gt;1: We have 5 switches.

&gt;2: The yellow cables connect the 4 switches in the front of the rack to the switch at the back of the rack making our network a star format.

&gt;3: You made a loop in the network on the assumption our switches, that you sold us, are spanning tree capable.  They are not, we have unmanaged switches.

&gt;4: We were told the earliest you could have someone out here was Thursday, 4 days after reporting a full system outage on Monday.

&gt;5: Considering problems we have had with your staff in the past, I don't know why I expected this to go off without a hitch.

The 3 ITCon guys start talking among themselves and OpsMgr mutes our end.

&gt;OpsMgr: What other issues?

&gt;Me: When they claimed to spent and entire weekend rebuilding the SBS server. 

&gt;OpsMgr: Oh right. Did we pay that one?

&gt;CorpMgr: Don't think so.

CorpMgr unmutes the phone.

&gt;CorpMgr: I will be reviewing our contract with you and seeing if we have grounds for reimbursement for downtime caused by your staff.  Expect to hear from me in the next few days.

CorpMgr hangs up the call.

&gt;Me: How did these guys get the support contract to begin with?

&gt;OpsMgr: The old IT guy recommended them.

&gt;Me: ........ Oh well, time to catch up on work.

and the three of us left the conference room

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The contract was cancelled the day I finished High School and started working full time.  Odd system issues stopped occurring once I changed all the passwords and locked out their maintenance account.

I don't know if we got reimbursed it wasn't my place to ask."
2ljptw,43,2014-11-06,"The Road I Never Traveled, Part 1",SadStoodUpBoy,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2ljptw/the_road_i_never_traveled_part_1/,"When I was a child, I used to have the same recurring dream.  I was on a long, paved road.  It was covered with cracks and crevices, like it hadn’t seen repair in many years.  A solid yellow line was barely visible in the center.  The tire marks left behind from screeching brakes were numerous, each one overlaid with a fresh one, always in the same place.  No matter what age I was when I dreamed it, I was always a toddler when I walked on this road.  My feet were bare and the asphalt burned them, but I didn’t care.  I had a sense of adventure inside of me.  The dream always ended the same.  A car came at me fast.  It hit the brakes as hard as it could.  Smoke erupted from the tires.  It never hit me though.  I always woke up before impact.

After each dream, I woke up in my bed, scared to death.  At first, my parents had to run into my room and check to make sure I was okay.  Eventually, they just put in a night light and told me they were nightmares.  They said I was too old to be scared by a silly thing like dreams.  As I got older, the dreams faded away.  They would still come from time to time, but they became less frequent.  I found myself forgetting about them as I got older.  The real world was scarier than the fog of night.  Things like getting accepted to college and finding a career became terrors of the real world, and I managed to overcome each of them until I considered myself moderately successful.  At age thirty, I was a manager at a Fortune 500 company, devoted to the interests of our clients, one case at a time.

The company I worked for conducted investigations for people who were too rich to sully their hands with trivial matters.  We specialized in everything from employee background checks to surveillance.  I got my start on the ground, trailing cheating spouses, insurance fraudsters and finding lost family members.  Eventually that led to a desk job where I did my investigations online.  I was fairly successful with my endeavors.  There wasn’t a case I couldn’t crack.  If the evidence existed, I could find it and wrap my fingers around it.  I went to school for software engineering, but the field was littered with others just like me.  My hobby as a photographer was what opened the door to the company, but my skills on the computer got me a leadership role.  In a cesspool of over the hill guys who hoped to turn the job into a career as a paparazzi and young women who hoped to stumble into someone like Channing Tatum, I stood out because I just wanted to work.

“Hey William!”  I was on my way to the coffee pot when Sam flagged me down.  She was one of the new interns.  She wasn’t special, I saw a dozen of them every year.

“It's Mr. Fields.  How can I help you?  Sam, was it?”  I knew her name, but she hadn’t earned the right to know that I knew it yet.  She certainly hadn't earned the right to call me by my first name.

“That’s right.  I just got a new case and I’m having a lot of trouble with it.”  She fluttered her eyelashes.  Was she really that stupid.  Half of the interns who walked in here thought they could show a little cleavage and land a permanent job.

“Can’t your supervisor help you?”  I paid people to deal with things like this.  My job was to make sure my supervisor team pushed every ounce of productivity out of people like Sam.  Interrupting my trip to the coffee pot wasn’t productive.

“She’s on vacation.”  Sam’s eyes turned to the empty cubicle normally occupied by the extra wide slab of human who cashed in her two week vacation and was currently on a cruise ship in the Bahamas.

“Ah that’s right.  Get George to help you.”  I dismissed her with a wave of my hand, aimed in the direction of another supervisor.  He was supposed to be the backup.

“Okay, thank you.”  Sam hopped, almost in a skip towards George.  I knew he would set her straight.

I filled my cup and went back to my office.  I would usually take it with a sugar and a cream, but Sam’s distraction had shaved two minutes off of my day and I didn’t have time.  I would just drink it black and blame every bitter sip on her.  She wouldn’t get the job she wanted.  She was already on the list of people I didn’t like.  If we weren’t short staffed already, I would have given her a cardboard box and had security walk her out.  We couldn’t afford that right now.  We had deadlines to meet, people who needed our services.  It was my job to make sure every client got the pristine work our company was known for and I would be damned if a bumbling intern kept me from it.

My phone rang.  The caller ID confirmed my suspicions.  It was my boss.

“Hey boss.”  I tried to act cheery.

“Are we on track for productivity today?”  His voice was gruff and sounded like a growl.

I scrambled to load the latest report.  I would normally have it set in real time on my computer, but I had let it time out while I went to get coffee.  Technically, I didn’t let it time out.  Sam caused it to time out because she distracted me from what should have been a thirty second trip.  I would have been back in plenty of time to refresh the report and when my boss called, I would have the answer ready for him.  Instead of being able to give him great news, I was struggling to get it set back up, a process that took longer than it should because we skimped on software in order to save money.

“Yeah we are-  Well.”  I wasn’t happy with what I saw.

“Don’t tell me we’re behind schedule!?”  It was a demand for the right answer, disguised as a question he would eviscerate me with if I gave the wrong answer.

“Not at all boss.  We’re on track.”  I lied.  It was a white lie though.  I would crack the whip and double up before the end of the day.

“Good!”  The phone clicked.

I created the own instrument of my destruction.  When I was still young and trying to get noticed, I built a software program that would monitor our progress in increments of time.  If we met the quotas, we would easily hit our targets and the cases would be done ahead of schedule.  Unfortunately, the software was built five years ago and a new operating system had rendered it slower than molasses.  I kept telling myself I was going to update it, but I never had the time.  I secretly hoped some other bright, young talent would do the work for me and use it to establish themselves.  None of them saw that opportunity, hence the reason I was in charge and they were still begging for a permanent position in the company.  It came with dental.  They should appreciate that enough to put in the extra time, but the Millennial generation didn’t see it that way.  They were all about what we could do for them, not what they could do for us.  I was having trouble adjusting to the new mentality.  Sometimes it felt like I was surrounded by aliens who landed on the planet yesterday.

The rest of my day was filled with high-end client schmoozing.  Most of them had permanent accounts with the company and called on us for trivial matters, but we were happy to oblige them because they paid well.  It got a little tedious setting up accounts to find their children’s lost puppies and making sure their wives were only getting tennis lessons when they went to the country club, but that was why we had interns.  As the sun set, I ordered some food from the only deli that delivered and polished off another cup of coffee along with a pastrami and provolone on rye.  Everyone in the office was clocking out for the day, but mine would continue for a few more hours.  I had reports to run and cases to review for accuracy.  There were things I didn’t trust even the best to handle.

When the last light went out, I dug into my drawer and pulled out a nice Cuban cigar.  They were a gift from a client who was happy he wasn’t going to spend the rest of his life paying alimony his fourth wife after she got railed by a poolboy.  The office was smoke free, as were all buildings in Atlanta, but the smell would be gone by the time our dreary eyed drones found their way to their desks the next morning.  I lit it and continued my work.  Every error pissed me off.  They were blemishes on my record, a reflection of poor customer service that I didn’t tolerate.  If the originators were still in the office, I would have them in my office for a nice screaming session.  Those always broke the tension nicely.

I smoked and the cloud formed an expression over my head which represented my growing anger.  If the sweet smell of child-labor tobacco wasn’t resonating from my mouth, I was certain my ears would be bellowing with a thicker cloud of rage.  I couldn’t believe how many problems were glaring back at me. I made note after note, firing off an angry email with each one.  There would be hell to pay in the morning.  I estimated at least an hour of wasted productivity would be spent correcting careless mistakes.  I remembered a time when people took pride in their work and wouldn’t dare leave the office with something so disgraceful left in a client’s file.  I needed a drink.  I risked a cigar after hours, but I wouldn’t dare risk a bottle.  That went beyond a policy and entered the realm of termination.  I put out my cigar and grabbed my coat.  I started to put it on, staring out at the city which was still bustling with life beneath my window.

“Mr. Fields?”  I almost jumped out of my coat when a light feminine voice started me.

“Sam?  What are you still doing here?”  I had no idea anyone was still in the office.  Nobody should still be in the office, we didn’t pay people overtime.

“I’m still working on that case.  I’m really having a lot of trouble with it.”  Her eyes were rimmed with redness and she looked gaunt in the illumination of the minimal lightning left behind after everyone else left for the day.

“I was just on my way out.  Go home.  You can work on it tomorrow.”  I would have words with George for not telling her the rules about overtime, although she technically just worked for experience, so she wasn’t hurting our budget.

“Could you just help me with something?  I swear I’ll go home right after that.”  She seemed very determined.

As tired as I was and as much as I really needed a drink before a few hours of sleep, I had to admire that dedication.  I couldn’t remember the last time I saw an intern stay in the office as late as me.  Even the desperate ones had parties and a social life.  Sam looked like she should have both lined up without any problems.  I couldn’t really deny someone a request for assistance, especially a subordinate.  I could pass them off to someone else if they were available, but my job description required me to step up when there wasn’t anyone else.  At least she wouldn’t be costing me productivity this time.

“Sure, show me what you have.”  I followed her back to her cubicle.  

Once I got to it, I saw why I didn’t realize she was still there.  Her cubicle was the one we called Siberia, because it was separated from the rest of the office by a pole.  She had turned her desk light off and was just working by the dismal incandescent glow of her monitor.  That probably explained why her eyes could use a dozen drops of Visine.  If she was pulled over on the way home, they would have a hard time believing it was just tiredness causing those bright red lines.  She moved her mouse across the screen and opened the electronic case file.  It was another program I designed, one that still functioned quite nicely even after all the system updates.

“This is the one I was asking you about this morning.  George tried to help, but he couldn’t figure it out.  I was going to move onto the next one, but they paid up front and I talked to them one the phone.  They sounded desperate.”  She moved her cursor over and showed me the balance on the account.

It was a decent sized budget for a first time account.  We didn’t always use the entire budget, but we contracted our services out on an estimation of time.  They must have thought it would require an investment in time and resources if they put that kind of money down.  I scanned the file as she guided me through it.  Everything looked pretty standard.  It was a family trying to figure out what happened to their child.  That wasn’t unusual.  We got a few cases like this every month.  Most of the time they just turned out to be runaways or relative-based kidnappings.  All that we normally did was figure out some leads and send the cops to pick them up.

“So what’s the problem?”  I really didn’t see anything that would require additional work.  This might require one person on the ground and some phone calls, but nothing more.

“Check out the date.”  She moved to the front page of the case.  I tilted my head and squinted, then opened my eyes in a little bit of shock when I saw it.  This happened twenty-five years ago.

“They’re a little late to be asking for help…”  We occasionally got desperate endeavors, but rarely one this old.

“That is what I thought too, but look. The boy was five years old when he disappeared.”  She showed me the mother’s statement.  It read like most pleas for help.

“A five year old boy who disappeared twenty five years ago.  Not much to go on.  Do they think he was kidnapped?  I’m sure he’s dead by now.”  I shrugged my shoulders.  It was hard to have much compassion in my line of work.

“They thought enough to pay us up front to investigate it.”  Sam’s sassy mood wasn’t appreciated.  I needed a drink right now, not a leap to conclusions.

“Yeah, I guess.  Email me the information.  I’ll call the mother tomorrow and let her know we can’t do much with this.  I hate to turn down money, but this is a waste of our time.”  I threw my laptop bag over my shoulder and reached to shut her monitor off.

“Okay, it’s just…”  She still seemed perplexed.  Interns had trouble letting go, especially when they got their first big dollar case.  I understood her hesitation but we needed her focused on cases we could solve.  We didn’t get paid if there were no results.

“What?  Spit it out.  I’m tired and I’m ready to go home.”  I didn’t like suspense.  She needed to tell me what was on her mind so I could tell her she was wrong.

“I can’t find any mention of this case in the police files, and I can’t find any articles about it.”  Our system tied into multiple archives.  We paid well for the service, but it solved half of our cases with a few keystrokes.

“It’s an old case.”  I dismissed her research.

“I guess so.”  She flipped through a few more pages before I could flip it off.  Something caught my attention.

“Wait.  Go back.”  I sat my laptop bag down.  I had only caught a glimpse of it, but something caused a chill to shoot straight through my body.

“Okay.”  She did as I asked, flipping back to a picture.  It was a screenshot she had taken from Google Maps.  It looked familiar.

“Pull this up, I need to see the area.”  I knelt down so I could get a better look.

She loaded a web browser and went to the address on Google Maps.  At first, it focused on a house.  The picture was less than a year old according to the date stamped on it.  The grass needed to be cut and the mailbox looked like it hadn’t been replaced in years.  I grabbed the mouse from her and spun it around, looking at the area.  I moved the Google Maps avatar one step and then I knew exactly why I recognized the area.  It was the street from my dreams, the one I had time and time again.  There was no mistaking it. I felt like I had been there a hundred times.

“Where is this?”  I spun the camera around a few more times.

“It’s uh… Thomasville.”  She pointed at the address on top of the map.  

I had heard of the city, but only in passing.  It was a small town somewhere south of Atlanta.  I was enthralled by the image as it unfolded on the screen.  I felt like I had walked that road as much as I had walked the roads in Marietta, where I grew up.  I had never stopped to consider that the road might be a real place.  I just thought it was some street I conjured up in my imagination, a road I created with bits and pieces of roads I had been on when I was younger.  I was certain I had never been to Thomasville.  Even our family vacations to Florida never brought us to a stopping place other than a gas station or our destination.

“Sam.”  I finally spoke after a brief silence.  “Send the details of this case to my e-mail.” I gathered my laptop up and shook my head for a second.

“Is everything okay?  Did I do something wrong?”  I wasn’t looking back at her as I headed to the elevators, but I could hear the fear in her voice.  She probably thought she made a terrible blunder and her badge wouldn’t work when she tried to pass through security the next day.

I didn’t give her an answer.  I was lost in my own thoughts.  How was this possible?  I dreamed that place up, I didn’t visit it.  I knew for a fact I would remember somewhere like that.  I had relayed the story to my parents a lot as a child, even describing the color of the grass, the old mailbox, and the street.  They never once gave any inclination it was a place I could have visited.  They just looked at each other like I had lost my mind or something.  Something was very wrong with what I saw, and I couldn’t explain it.  I needed that drink, I probably needed a few of them.  That was a road I never traveled."
2ljrtd,5,2014-11-06,Nightcrawler: A character study into the Capitalist mind (spoilers ahead for the film),TheLateThagSimmons,DebateAnarchism,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnarchism/comments/2ljrtd/nightcrawler_a_character_study_into_the/,"I felt like taking things in a new direction here in /r/DebateAnarchism: A film discussion.

[Nightcrawler](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2872718/?ref_=nv_sr_1) starring [Jake Gillenhaal](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0350453/?ref_=tt_cl_t1) released this past weekend. Short story: A sociopath rises in the business of local news. 

[Check out the trailer here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPawRAHG-0g)

While partially a character study into the evil protagonist, the completely sociopathic Louis Bloom, it can equally be considered a scathing satire on not only the media creation of news, but also a critique into the mindset of capitalism itself. 

Louis Bloom is a thief, violent, smooth talking, extremely charismatic, low life, with lofty ideals trying to make it in a competitive Los Angeles. When he witnesses a new opportunity in news journalism; video for sale. While a burgeoning market, he quickly realizes that in order to compete he needs to cut corners. For the movie, read a review or just enjoy yourself and watch the movie itself. This is primarily about the evolution of the success that the character experiences and why. 

----

Throughout the evolution of the character, we see not only his sociopathic tendencies, but the success that is the result. 

His first move after venturing into this new field is to acquire an employee. Taking advantage of the first person to respond to his ad for work, he offers an internship after it becomes quite obvious that [Rick](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1981893/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t26) is desperate and needs *anything*, but eventually agrees to $30 a night cash. It is immediately obvious that Rick would take *anything*.

* Exploitation at its finest. He does fill a desperate need, but an offer that is only plausible due to the desperation of the ""employee"". Bargaining power is maintained entirely in the hands of the ""owner"".

-----

As he finds success, he is offered a position with his [competition](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000200/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t4) to which he declines because he wants to stretch out and be his own company. Later we find him purposefully sabotaging Joe's van which results in a car crash (which serves as ""news"" that he can later sell). 

* Cutthroat tactics work. Even if they should be looked down upon, it brings about massive success due to reducing competition. It increases Louis' bargaining power over his clients significantly and increases his market worth now that he can get the best ""product"". 

----

Then there's the effect that he has on those around him. As the news station pushes for more graphic content, Louis finds and delivers. This in turn results in greater ratings for the station and its [director](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000623/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t22). Eventually they can't ignore what he's bringing to the table, to which he exploits repeatedly. They begin to revere him as his success brings about their success. A few within the organization complain about Louis' method, but they are shut down by those on top because of the success they have and can lose.

* In capitalism, the most ruthless and sociopathic are revered. Even if it's via questionable means, financial success makes people turn their backs on their principles and morals. 

----

As his methods become increasingly questionable, he crosses the line into breaking the law. While he doesn't commit the crimes he films, his methods do cross into withholding information for personal gain that results in others getting hurt at the hands of the criminals he's filming (which makes for some great material to sell). He's capable of easily getting around the law by manipulating the evidence.

* Even when the ""law"" would be used against a Capitalist, it does little to deter the mind set on success. 

---

The divide between himself and his employee, Rick, arises when Rick begins to object to the (illegal) methods being used which in turn adds bargaining power into Rick's hand. If he wants to keep working and doing illegal activities, he demands a raise. Even when the end bargain ends up being laughably low, the mere fact that Rick now hold bargaining power is enough to make Louis jealous. Not because he could cut into his profits, but because it's cutting into his bargaining power. This sets into a course of events in which Louis is able to trick Rick into a situation that gets Rick killed. Louis shows *zero* remorse over the ""accident"" and tells him directly: You took away my bargaining power. 

* This is a fantastic allegory to the shift of power that unionization brings against Capitalists. They have reason to react violently against unionization because of this issue. 

---

One last thing that I found intriguing was his motto set forth early in the film: 

*""If you want to win the lottery, you have to make the money to buy a ticket.""*

Surprisingly, this line is only uttered once (the second half is repeated a few times, but as I recall it was only once or twice) unlike the portrayal in the trailer. However, this highlights the very nature of Capitalism, even for capitalists. In the end, the system of trade for-profit via private property is in itself a lottery. All the aspects sold to pro-capitalists are tickets and nothing more. 

-Education. A ticket.  
-Hard work. A ticket.  
-Access to property. A ticket.  
-Born into a good family. A ticket.  
-White, rich/middle class, Christian. A ticket.

That's all they are: a small chance at success. If one does everything just right, plays the game perfectly, all they have is a small chance of success. In the end, it's still just a lottery. That chance to win is what keeps most of the world pining for a ticket. Despite the fact that their chances are absolutely minuscule, that *chance* is what keeps them going, it's what keeps pro-capitalists rabidly defending the system. 

---

In the end, I found his character to be intriguing, and that's not just the film fan in me (Jake Gyllenhaal will very likely be at least nominated for some sort of bullshit acting awards). If anything, it shows what it takes to succeed within capitalism. Sociopathic tendencies are *rewarded* in a completely top-down market competition approach. Those willing to cut corners, to profit off of others pain and misery, to exploit the desperate, and twist the media to present their story. 

There is, of course, the larger critique against the infotainment of the modern media which is the forefront of the story. However, as a character study, the movie presents a biting critique against capitalism itself. "
2ljsh0,2,2014-11-06,Unsure about path. Anyone who can advice who may have gone through relocation?,IllIIllIII,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2ljsh0/unsure_about_path_anyone_who_can_advice_who_may/,"Hello everyone!

I have a problem with choosing what I want to do. I currently have 3 options that I can pursue (all are engineering jobs):

1) A small company that is growing really fast. Hourly pay but essentially salary benefits (Not sure about how number compares). It is a tech job but not super difficult.

2) Currently trying to get a job at a really big tech company; currently in the interview process. Most likely salary but really good benefits. I would have to relocate so that is an issue.

3) Working at another big company which I interned at. Same as above but might not have to relocate. Intern pay was great so I am assuming full time will be great as well. The norm I saw were long hours and is mentally exhausting.

My parents do not want me to work hourly due to status symbol (Asian parents) and they think I won't get the same benefits. I am leaning towards the first option because the pay is decent and work is stress free for the most part. Also because the company is expanding so fast, I feel like I am getting a head start since I am joining when it is still at its growing stage which the other two company are not. I fear that relocation would be too rough, personally and socially, so I want to avoid that. 

Anyone personally gone through relocation can give me any insight? Was it worth the move? Anyone turned down a big company or a smaller one?"
2lju75,3,2014-11-06,How do I support my very good friend who's very depressed about his reapplication cycle? Venting a bit because he keeps complaining and acting depressed...,Aisin4azn,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/2lju75/how_do_i_support_my_very_good_friend_whos_very/,"Hi, so my really good friend and I are both reapplicants this cycle for various reasons.  Mine was b/c of a late mcat retake, his was because he submitted his application late and his secondaries in like november.

Just a bit of history between us: my friend is very very smart &amp; hardworking and a very cool guy.  He graduated from our school (top 25) with a 3.9+, PBK, highest distinction in major, and has many awards in research, business, volunteering, and more.  He has always done much much better than me (I'm not too bad) in everything up until we applied.  In fact, I feel that he never had any...""roadbumps"" in his undergraduate career (like a random B or a failure in achieving something).  However, personality-wise, he is a big perfectionist and stresses over every little thing whether it's that research experiment he did in lab or whether his e-card invitation was written well enough for a house party. 

Then came the MCAT.  We both struggled on it.  I took the MCAT 3x, he took it 2x. I took it a 3rd time b/c my VR was a 7, like him.  However, this is where we differed--he let the MCAT beat him.  He struggled and was scared of it, so much that even when he learned that I was retaking a 3rd time he started to get stressed out and he said his blood pressure went up.  He refused to retake a 3rd time because he never wanted to touch it again. He got a score he thought was good on his second try but one of his subsections was a 7.  Last cycle, my MCAT delayed my app and he was late b/c....I'm not sure why.  He just turned in everything slowly.

In any case, we both didn't get in last cycle (both had interviews).  Now this cycle, I got in all my applications ASAP since day 1 and he was on top of his primary too....but then the secondaries came in.  I turned mine in during July &amp; August. He languished, procrastinated, kept putting it in the backburner and spent *weeks* on secondaries.  Like he would take 2-3 weeks per secondary. Most of his were in by end of Sept/October.

Now it's November.  He is **still** doing a couple secondaries (mostly done) and he is very depressed b/c he has 0 interviews and I have 5 interviews &amp; 1 acceptance.  I didn't tell him any of that, but he knows I have at least 1 interview.  He keeps calling himself a failure, he keeps injecting himself with this negative....vibe &amp; mood.  And it's destructive.  It makes me feel bad...guilty that I have an acceptance and he doesn't.  That I have multiple interviews and he doesn't.  Because I know he is smart and capable of going into medicine.  

For example (of his negative vibe), he asked me what I was up to the other day and I brought up how I was celebrating how my cousin was accepted to be one of Hilary Clinton's interns &amp; was also accepted to Harvard for a PhD and he responds ""well I feel so small and stupid.""  Killed the mood immediately. 

As his friend, I really hate to see such a bright person act this way and I wish I could do something to make him feel better when he starts entering into these negative moods.  I **know** why he isn't getting any interviews this year (he didn't address any weaknesses from last cycle like his MCAT which he could have retaken last year &amp; he applied late...again).  I can't tell it to him bluntly b/c I know he would hate me for saying it.  He is considering Carribean and DO (which is fine but he just turned in his DO apps like a month ago) and I'm not sure what to say whenever he starts whining about med school apps/life again.

Do you have any suggestions on how I can be a better friend? Till now, I just listen and be there for him when he's down (which is often) and I don't offer my advice unless soliciated.  I feel a bit stressed whenever he enters those moods because I feel like he wants me to say something besides ""that sucks man sorry to hear :("" but I can't say ""dude you should have manned up, retook the fucking MCAT, turn in all your secondaries fast, and not apply to schools you stand 0 chance of getting in at""

Basically i am looking for input from you guys about Financial being early on in life. I feel like i am at a cross roads with very few places to ask for direction. First some background, i come from a family where my siblings and parents really never got the chance to advance in life and thus had no choice with jobs and ended up with low paying jobs to make ends meet. No one in my family got the chance to advance their education as well so college is a learning experience. My parents were on the older side and just retired to their home country and i now live with brother and his wife. All my siblings are much older than me by 10-20 years. 

I am a college student who has been attending college for a few years and recently decided to major in computer science. Originally i planned in majoring for biology and going in to the medical field but didn't like the idea of spending so many years in school and having to start ""life"" in my 30's and 40's. I started working at 18 and making minimum wage and was OK with that since i didn't really need much money to live the life i had. Around the time i turned 19 i got some great opportunities to advance my life financially to what felt to me like leaps and bounds. I was making more money than my parents and siblings, which i never thought i would so early on in life. Throughout the years (i am now 23) school has taken a back seat and i only go to school half time so i am on what some would consider a 6 year plan for college. My hopes with college is to get a job where i don't feel like i could lose it at any moment and to do something I enjoy. The problem I've been facing lately is i feel like i advanced through life too soon and thus ruined my education and personal life. I've gotten use to the life I've been able to afford and wish i could go back and take school more seriously. i don't feel like school is such a pressing issue since i make what some people barely make after graduating college even when meeting with advisors and faculty they make me feel like schooling is pointless because of the position I am in. I don't love the job i have. Its a sales job and i hate the fact that they give no sense of security and always having to worry about everything and having it follow me home is the worse. I know if i were to leave, the chances of me finding another job that comes close to what i make are slim to none. 

I am coming to you all for your thoughts and opinions about my situation. I've been thinking about the future lately relating to my major eventually I'm going to have to take on internships and gain experience within my field but how will i be able to accomplish that with school and a full time job. I also need to move out soon since living with my brother wont be an option always since I'm also in a serious 5 year relationship and have got to the point where moving out and marriage will be soon on the table. I'd love to hear what you guys would recommend."
2ljzq7,7,2014-11-07,I[21 F] need help comforting my fiance [22M] with the loss of his father.,sprucey,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ljzq7/i21_f_need_help_comforting_my_fiance_22m_with_the/,"My fiance (we will call him Joe) and I have been together almost 7 years now, and actually just got engaged (!) about a month ago. 

About 5 months ago, his father passed away very unexpectedly. It was so devastating, and seeing him go through that is the hardest thing I have ever had to go through. He cried a lot that first week, but he has only cried once since then. I think he is handling it well, though, in his own way. 

There have been several complications that occured as a result of his dad passing away. His family had to move into a much smaller house, and Joe has basically lost his entire support system because his mom and brothers are dealing with it in an entirely different way than he is. 

Joe and I moved back to school in August. Over the past few months, I can tell that his father's death is really starting to sink in. He was so busy over the summer with work and an internship I don't think he had time to really comprehend it. We have long talks about it often, but I am running out of things to say to console him. I just feel so helpless. I don't know what to say anymore. I want to help him and just take his pain away. I know this is will be an ongoing process, but it's just so hard to see him this way.


Here are some of the issues he is facing:

1) He is angry. (which is normal, and good.) He feels cheated that this had to happen to him and his family.

2) He feels guilty that his dad didn't get to do all the things he wanted to do.

3) He is really stressed out with school, and doesn't feel motivated because he was always trying to make his dad proud.

4) His mom and his oldest brother are not helping the situation at all. They make him feel guilty for going back to school and trying to move on. They are honestly pretty mean to him.

Joe is not religious, so I can't really give him advice in that sense. I have told him that he should talk to a close family friend who recently lost their mother, but he doesn't want to ""burden"" anyone. I have tried to get him to go talk to a professional, but he doesn't seem interested at all.

I just feel so shitty that I can't help more. I try the best that I can, but I know its not enough. It doesn't help that I'm in the process of applying to grad school, and that I am constantly fighting with my own father. So now we are both stressed out, often leading to arguments that neither of us need.

Do you guys have any advice for me? Like how I can help him, or things I should avoid doing/saying? I'm just so lost and I want to help him as much as I can.

TL;DR My fiance is grieving the loss of his father and I need help knowing what to say/ what to avoid.

All I want to do in my free time is lie down and watch the same tv shows I've downloaded and seen a dozen times a piece already while going to different apps on my phones and waiting till I can eat again. I am constantly delaying all the problems and obstacles that are in my life at a time when I'm meant to make a lot of heavy choices.

I do my best to keep my appearance acceptable but it seems like basic hygiene is as much as I can do. Don't really know what will come of this but thought I should post since it could lead to me feeling better and it sounds like I am typing and actually doing work at my internship, a place where I have been mostly browsing the internet mindlessly, taking excessive bathroom and lunch breaks, waiting until 5 pm. When I walk in the office, I just get lost in the wide open internet, browsing all things that semi-intersest me, and putting off actual work assignments that I've been given ages ago.

I wouldn't say I'm suicidal, but a lot of floating emotions are clouding the way I know I should or could be acting and succeeding. I would hate to let the people in my life that do care about me feel so terrible by wishing they could have done more for me, so I know it's not an option. A quick end won't absolve me from pain but recently been a lousy option that appears in my head as I walk through traffic.

I want to do more meditation to help, more ukulele playing, more socializing and exercising to pull me back out of this. My pattern recently has been have one or two productive, social days followed by one or more indulgent, lethargy-filled awful ones which seem to do more incremental damage than the positive days do good. And the thing is even though I know it's bad for future me, all I care about is appeasing the me that's here and now who wants no strife and all things lazy. It's a painful cycle that I don't know if I should be feeling bad about. I think the only solution is to not feel bad, not indulge, and get on with life with more positivity. Is that it?

Do i need to vocalize more? Write more? Create more? Self-deprecate less?

Yeesh."

I still have not received a response or the proper email address to partake in my interview scheduled tomorrow.

Thank You for the timely response. I can assure you this was a mistake on my part this. I could fwd emails of applications if need be. I seem to have trouble checking the proper box with the corresponding question. As for the interview may I call in, email or live chat. I do not have a phone. What can I do to resolve this? Also is there a set date when my benefits run out? Sorry so many questions. In desperate need.

What is the proper email to send this to? I am scheduled for interview tomorrow.  I do not have a phone can I be contacted by email. Also, will be away from 1-3 for an interview. This will be my 3rd this week. I can provide dates, times, and interviewers. Would you like them? My current finances are dismal. My bank account balance 0, food stamps balance is $40, not to mention 2 months behind on rent (i.e $650 monthly) and possibly facing eviction. I do not want to play the role of a victim thats just how things are for me know. If there is anything to hurry the issuing process please let me know. Was expecting the funds last week and losing credibility with my landlord as I has a set payment plan until things pick up.

All the best,

-------------------------
You know what fuck this. I know I won't get a response anyway. Getting very desperate. So much for that bullshit B.A. degree and my so called white male privilege. Are you guys hiring? Oh ok I understand. This is how you you create a patriotic american into a disenfranchised charity case. I dont want you fucking charity. I just want my to be a to be self sufficient contributing member. Instead of the $596 I recieve monthly I would rather be homeless and have that money go towards helping to find jobs. Cal jobs is horrible by the way compared to others.

Urban camping here I come. Need to mentally prepare for this. At least ill have a free life and treat people empathy. Ill live my life answering only to myself and morals until I choose to end it much later of course. Im not taping out that easy. I'm opting out. no job, no taxes, no family, no possessions. I truly feel like fortunate for the people and things I have experienced but that was another life that I forget a little day by day. At least I got to know what happiness and love felt like. This is the lowest point in my life and will become mentally tougher. Thats what I  have to tell myself. But those bad days are becoming to prevalent. I guess I was a bad investment on californias part. If only I was blessed with social lottery of nepotism or had a real skill. 

I know your just a bureaucrat just doing your job and is probably emotional draining. Just click a box next to my case number and terminate it if you want. Or say I didn't fill out some arbitrary useless form. It will run out soon anyway. Serious question.  What is expected of me. People say why not ask friends or family. I was raised by my grandparents and there dead. I dont have any family to bail me out. As for friends. I cant out of pride I would way I would barrow is in small amounts and a set source and  date I could pay back with interest. 

However desperate people do desperate things. It will likely cost more tax payers money to jail me for stealing food if need be. How about more incentives; more of the carrot not the stick. Attitude reflects leadership. I hope one day to be in a position to help firsthand. Because it is right and economical. But who cares history has shown the haves will maintain there position over the nots through various psychological, social, and political methods. After all we all know that the poor are dumb and lazy. Save you thought stopping cliches to motivatie increasing your social standing within your ingroup and perpetuate your confirmation bias and groupthink. Cognitive dissonance is a bitch ain't it. People are meant to challenge themselves. Where are the truth seekers. You cant fuck with the truth no matter how catchy your conditioned responce is. 

As for my first proposal the benefits of suicide may be the answer. Not assisted cause money don' grow on trees. Hear me out. If done right I can preserve my organs to a commissioned based third party to the highest bidder. This will allow me to pay off my student loans. I know what your thinking the longer I live the more we profit off of the interest. Thats just a loss we wile weighing the benefits of winning the war on poverty. Further more my flesh can be subsidized and utilized in an abundant amount of materials or fed to animals. I do not mean the poor remember we want less of the enemy win the war on poverty. We must adhere to party approved policies aimed to win the war at all cost for the future of our children. Such protocols will make the rich wealthy and the wealthy into gods. The oligarchical elite bring about a land of milk and honey or at least the leftovers which trickle down from their divine generosity. 

I am grateful for the help I have received and that there are some who do really care. I will pay it forward if given the opportunity. Also, does my 6 month free internship count as a job? Or just an idiot probably the later.

She behaved really disrespectful for not telling me and being with this guy in front of me and kissing him after I left.

In some ways, I agree.",howtohelpmylittlebro,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2lko3f/my_little_brother_thinks_hes_failing_at_life_in/,"**TL;DR: I want to be supportive for a little brother who is struggling, but I don’t know how. I feel powerless.**

Caution: this is a long post, as it’s been 4 years of heartache. Appreciate those who read through. Definitely looking for the collective wisdom / personal experiences of reddit (what worked for you?). And please let me know if there is another subreddit better suited for someone seeking advice (nice try, /r/AdviceAnimals)

**Year 1**

My younger brother is one of the smartest people I know (he's also a redditor and even mods a major subreddit). After high school, he landed at an Ivy League university. He left his first semester with a GPA below 2.5. When I looked at his Blackboard (a website that allows students to track grades, submit assignments, etc.), he looks like he was doing OK for about the first half of his semester, some ‘A’s and mostly ‘B’s. Then in the latter half, his grades took a nosedive – ‘C’s, ‘D’s, and even an ‘F’. He spent a shitload of time playing computer games during that time. Steam sales didn’t help. 

I think he was scared – just out of his depth, didn’t know what to do when surrounded by tons of smart people. He’s also low on ‘EQ’ – i.e., he’s not street savvy, doesn’t socialize well with others, sometimes comes off as snarky or mean, etc.. In truth, he just hasn’t had a lot of friends for much of his life and I’ve told him it takes practice to get good at making friends. I’ve burned a LOT of relationships making dumb comments or fucking stuff up. It happens, you learn, you get better. In his case, after he found out people were trying to actively avoid him from his freshman hall, he shut down. Wouldn’t talk to people, walled himself in. I guess he found solace playing games and handled his social aspects through MMOs. 

After a lot of pep talks over winter break, we eventually sent him back out to school again. This time he came back with a 1.9 GPA and an academic probation letter. He did even worse – for example, he didn’t even show up for his physics final.

**Year 2**

He took a year off and lived with me in New York. Spent first 3 months playing computer games nearly non-stop whenever I left for work. Almost got kicked out of the apartment. Took out his hard drive to render him without a working computer in the house. He networked in the city. Found a startup tech job as a long-term intern. Got fired after 4 months (said it was general layoffs, not individual to him, but he wasn't having a lot of success at work; his boss was unwilling to write a recommendation for him). Worked a retail sales job, did well, but hated it and the family encouraged him to go back to school.

During this time, we had him see a therapist, probably around 5 to 10 times (not sure of exact number). It seemed to help a bit, gave him a place to vent and gave us external validation (she saw a lot of the same things we saw). Mad expensive, though, although we're thinking of having him start seeing one again.

**Year 3**

He goes back, this time with one of my parents in tow (helps clean, give him structure, takes care of all the small stuff). He does pretty good – 3.2 GPA or so. Next semester, friction between the parent and my little bro, he’s tired of the discipline, the parent is frustrated he’s not ‘trying hard enough.’ Bro spends more time “studying” in the library away from his apartment, ends up with a 2.5 GPA. Parents have had enough, tell him to call it quits. It’s too expensive and his cumulative GPA is too low to do anything with it.

**Year 4**

My brother is 22. He goes to a number of community colleges back home. My parents have tried everything – have him live with them, live on his own (they paid for an apartment), have him move back in. He rarely wakes up in time to attend class, he’s almost missed mid-terms, has no friends in town, doesn’t talk even to his family unless he’s cornered or if we’re very persistent. There continues to be significant friction between my parents and him. I’ve had to counsel my parents to give him more space, but they are naturally very worried. My dad, who is usually very hands off and stoic, regularly finds himself shouting at my little brother.

He failed another test today, and cannot get the grade up to passing and it’s a critical requirement for his intended major. There is a strong possibility he will not be applying to a 4 year university this year. He will likely stay in his small hometown for a 5th year.

**What needs to get fixed?**

I’m not entirely sure. I think there are at least 4 factors:


**He doesn’t understand what it means to work hard**. Somehow the drive and ambition I saw in my high school little brother has withered away. He was so goddamn smart and good looking. He looks like a shell of himself today – failure at every corner and apparently he’s gotten really fat. Rather than dig in and fight the problem, he seems to turn and try to run from his problems. 

He wakes up really late, seems to have no motivation, spends most of his waking hours glued in front of a computer, even when he should get crackin’ on his books. It feels like he’s not even trying. This is extremely frustrating to my parents, both of whom grew up on farms and still wake up at the crack of dawn to do whatever godforsaken toughass work needs to be done. Whether it’s working at the office or clearing brush, they always roll up their sleeves and get it done. For people who pride themselves on an ironclad work ethic and a simple life (easily the least materialistic people you’ll ever meet), my brother is an alien. They try to be sympathetic and patient, but…you get the idea.

My mother in particular has made it clear that her love for my brother is unconditional. She will stay by his side even if it destroys her. She is also the person my brother gets along with the least. I’ve made it clear to her he probably perceives her as trying to smother him. It’s just an unhealthy dynamic for both of them. I wish he understood it for what it was – someone who desperately loves him and is trying her best to help him succeed (although I’ve pointed out to her how it can easily backfire). She has stepped away from his life a lot, given him tons of space, rarely visits to check on him, but it’s very hard for her and he doesn’t seem to be doing anything with his more independent living.

**His pride and ego**. Ironically, while his self-confidence and esteem are probably at all-time lows, my little bro finds it important to go to a good school and do a comp sci major. We’ve tried telling him it doesn’t matter if he graduates from any Ivy League or any other top tier school (especially if he has a 2.0 GPA!), he just needs to be happy and find a path to being his own man.

That might be a function of who he sees around him. I’m an Ivy League grad. My wife is an Ivy League grad. Her brother (my bro-in-law) is an Ivy League grad and exactly the same age as my bro. I do not draw comparisons to my brother and hers; it’s irrelevant to his life circumstance and can only be a de-motivator. 

That said, my brother isn’t blind or stupid. He has Facebook. He admitted to me how bitter it was that he feels like he’s floundering and everyone he knows is already graduating college. 

**He’s afraid**. I’ve seen what this kid can do, but he’s gotten knocked flat on his ass so many times I worried he’s losing the will to fight. We talk about his plans, where he can go, I try to be helpful, but a lot of times the phone conversations get very one-sided. He gets quiet, doesn’t talk, just nods his head or says yep. I keep telling him I don’t want to chart his future – that’s for him to decide. But that future can’t be nothing and I’m trying to give him good ideas. He quietly agrees. 

**He lies (or at least, he used to)**. He has a very hard time telling the truth, but he is great at telling you what you want to hear. We didn’t know he failed his classes until just a day before the grade report came out. In fact, we usually don’t find out he’s failed until after the fact. I’ve stressed to him several times that it’s much better if he tells us as it happens live – we can help him think of ways to fix the problem, turn things around, etc. 

At first, he would outright lie – everything’s OK! Then it was lying by omission. If you didn’t ask, he wouldn’t say anything. And you had to be very specific with your question – i.e., walk through each class and ask how it was going. Not even how it was going, how did you do on this test or that midterm. I think from tough experience, he has learned this hurts him way more than it helps, so it has mostly been fixed, but it still pops up from time to time and it was a major contributor to the problem. It created significant trust issues within the family and it made it impossible for us to help until well after the fact.

**We're almost at the end...**
Jesus that was a lot to write. I feel bad for those of you who had to wade through all that, but I really appreciate it. I feel powerless to do anything from thousands of miles away. He lives back home with my folks now and I’m here on the other side of the country.

I’m at the point where I’m willing to turn to the anonymous public and ask for suggestions. I’m not smart enough or creative enough to find more ways to help my younger brother. We’re frustrated and tired, and I get so stressed out trying to think of something that will work that it affects my mood, my relationships, and my work. 

Thanks everyone - it means a lot."

I have become capable using the Adobe package of Illustrator, Photoshop, Indesign, the technical drawing in Microstation V8, and Autocad. However what I am lacking in is an ability in a 3d drawing program. Though I have enjoyed using Google SketchUp I would like to gain experience in a more professional program. Would any of you recommend me a certain software? It would of course be easy if it would be similar to programs that I already know but I am also very willing to spend time and effort in learning a completely new type of software. 
I hope this is the right place to ask this question.

I've looked at GlassDoor salaries in the area, they tend to average in the $70k-$80k and for me that seems pretty strong to come to an interview with for an entry level position. 

My major is Computer Science and one of my minors is Mobile Software Technology (essentially Android development).

I'm currently a freshmen studying computer science major at one of CUNY's community college. I'm currently looking for a position (internship, full-time, or part-time) during business hours to gain experience in the FinTech or technology industry.

My most recent experience has been a 6-month internship with Casey Family Programs' investment team, located at 7 World Trade Center. Casey Family Programs is a non-profit aimed to eliminate the need for foster care by attacking the root causes for that need. Their investments team is responsible for handling $2 Billion+ and achieving a return large enough to cover the company's expenses over the long run.

At their NY office, I was in charge of creating audit books, and restructuring their private equity and real estate reports, which I did so successfully by implementing a database system and automating most of the report, reducing the reporting time from ~5 hours to ~45 minutes. They seemed pretty happy about that.

I achieved this by learning a bit of VBA, getting familiar with the inner workings of Microsoft Excel, and applying the knowledge.

I'm just starting out on my degree, so I don't have a lot of programming experience aside from VBA, but I'm willing to learn.

If you or anyone you know of has an opportunity for me, please feel free to PM me for my resume. Thanks!

Also, if you're curious about anything, please don't hesitate to ask.

2llfs9,0,2014-11-07,Your thoughts on getting a Rail internship in NYC,maxverse,rails,https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/2llfs9/your_thoughts_on_getting_a_rail_internship_in_nyc/,"I'm a total beginner when it comes to coding jobs, so pardon the ignorance.

How hard is it to get an internship in Ruby/Rails in NYC? Here's the lowdown on my background:

3.6 honors grad in music and economics with an overachiever-type college resume; worked in finance and IT healthcare consulting for two years. 

Programming experience: one college Java course that really inspired me. Spent a few months learning Ruby through Codeacademy and by reading books. Been trying to learn Rails through the Michael Hartl book for a while, but it's been a slow process moving from a language to a whole framework. Have a basic and solid understanding of CSS, HTML, and OOP concepts. Shaky on SQL.

My absolute idea situation is that I get a coding internship with a a decent startup in NYC where I can learn as much as I can. I'm open to being paid minimally/unpaid if known startup. The idea is to try and code full time to see if I can/want to do it.

Is this reasonable and feasible? How would I go about it?"

I don't have any outside projects listed and the only ""good"" thing on my resume is a web development internship I had this past summer (although I didn't learn as much as I wanted). Right now, I'm looking for internships, but I'm wondering if I should start focusing on building my own projects first (like creating a website for someone, etc). I tried to apply for other web dev/software internships, but I think they wanted someone with better experience. They said they liked my attitude and had potential, but I just lacked experience. I got a call to build websites via wordpress (and i'm thinking this is a good opportunity for me to start my own project and list it on my resume), but would it just be better to get an internship?

I've seen example cover letters/resumes on the internet for engineering internships and they all write about how much projects they did and how they had previous internships where they did important work and acquired technical skills. 

Problem is, I've had one internship so far and I've done mostly stereotypical ""intern work"" there so I don't have much to write about it.

Second I go to a community college and there isn't much opportunities for me to do projects. The school barely has the funding to purchase computers that are less than 10 years old. There is a robotics club, and I joined it,  but no one ever shows up to the club.

I know I probably sound like a little bitch making excuses, but I really don't know what to do.  What did you guys do to get a good internship? Do you think being in a community college diminishes my opportunities for internships?"

Need advice.",pip_daddy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2llvhs/me_22_m_with_my_girlfriend_22_f_we_have_a/,"I'm going to try to make this short.  I will likely fail.  

I started dating my girlfriend junior year of high school - 6 years ago.  Things were mostly good, but like any young relationship between two people who aren't fully matured, there were issues.  Trust seemed to deteriorate over time, and I'm just as much, if not more to blame than she was.  I admit that.

Four years into our relationship, we're both in our sophomore year of college.  We break up.  I think because we had been together so long, and we were just different people with different priorities by then.  The breakup was far from clean though.  It was very back and forth.  We were still immature, and it's hard to let go of someone.  She started hanging out with a bad crowd, partying and seeing other guys, and I wasn't ready to move on just yet, so it was tough on me.  I took some time to work on myself, then started seeing other people as well.  

10 months after, she finds out I'm seeing someone.  All of a sudden, I start getting the late night calls and texts.  When I don't agree to get back with her, she starts showing up at my (parents') house in the middle of the night, usually intoxicated, pounding on my bedroom window trying to get in.  This happened on and off for a few weeks, and I never let her in, until one night I had been drinking with friends, broke things off with the girl I was seeing a few days prior, and I let her in.  A drunken sexual encounter occurs.  Of course I asked if she was still on birth control.  She said yes.  The following morning, I'm sober and realize what a mistake I made and offer to buy her Plan B.  She refuses.  A month goes by.  Surprise.   She's pregnant.

For a long time I resented her.  I knew she did it on purpose.  We were on bad terms throughout the pregnancy, which is something I now regret.  But I guess it's easy for someone without kids to be selfish.  How could she?  I'm in my third of five years of college.  I have a bright future.  I wanted to move away from this depressing town.  But then he was born, and in that moment, my life, and my character, took a turn for the better.  Long story short, despite our differences, we agreed to try to make it work for the sake of our son.  Since starting back up with her over a year ago, I've been completely transparent and honest with her, and until a month ago, things were going surprisingly well.  But now she's reverted back to the person she was when we originally split. 

I never thought people could change, but after becoming a father and making changes myself, I suppose I gave myself hope that it was possible.  But lately she has avoided intimate situations with awful and invalid excuses.  Instead of putting our son to bed and coming out to watch tv with me like we used to, she goes to bed and watches netflix on her computer instead.  If I try to go lay down with her, she shuts the laptop and says she's tired.  It all feels very familiar to how things went the last time we split, when I found out she was sleeping around but instead of having the courage and dignity to tell me how she really felt, she just kept going through the motions.

So this week, we argue Sunday.  I had to miss our son's first time trick-or-treating last Friday because I'm a full-time student and also work part time for a broker-dealer, and I needed to get a project done with a group, and the other guys were either free on Friday night, or on the weekend, and I watch our son on the weekend while she works, so I had no choice.  

We argue Monday.  She accuses me of cheating, and I'm dumbfounded.  I never cheated.  Then things escalate, and eventually I realize that arguing is counterproductive, so I calm down, and then I ask her to tell me everything she's upset with me about so we can talk through it.  She expresses that she's furious that I recently reconnected with a GUY friend of mine that I had a falling out with last year.  I texted him last week to catch up and settle our differences.  But I never told anyone that I did, so I knew that she had to have gone through my phone.  She admits that she did, and I told her I'm not upset that she went through it.  I'm upset that she felt like she had to, because now it feels like this entire last year, all of the effort I invested in trying to build our trust has been a waste.  

So I spend the night at my parents' on Tuesday night. On Wednesday, I continue giving her time to cool down and wait until evening to text her.  I ask how she is, how our son is, and what they're doing.  She doesn't tell me to come home.  So then I tell her that I would like to come home and be with my family, and she doesn't want to hear it.  She keeps giving me terrible excuses.  I tried to talk her into it, but then realized that forcing my way in is only going to cause more resentment, and in truth, I can't stop her from doing what she wants to do.  

Thursday morning, on my way to school for an exam, I call her.  No answer.  I call again.  I call ten times, just trying to check in on her and my son.  Worried that something was wrong, I start heading over there.  I call her mom, who tells me that she had talked to her daughter an hour ago and that she was awake.  So why wasn't she answering?  I walk in unannounced, and she's just getting ready for work.  Tells me she didn't hear the phone ring, which I suspect is a lie, because she ALWAYS has her phone on her.  But I let it go.  I ask her if anyone was over last night.  She says no.  I ask if there's anything I need to know.  Anything that she's hiding.  She rolls her eyes, gets defensive, says no.  Then she says that if I can't trust her, it's because I can't trust myself and I'm just proving that I'm up to something.  So I asked her if I could see her phone.  Not only did she say no, she picked it up immediately and put it in her back pocket.  My heart sunk.  In that moment, I realized it was done.  I look down, and there's my son, standing up, holding on to my leg, looking up and me.  And I just felt shattered. 

She can't be trusted.  She has deep rooted moral issues and character flaws that can't be changed.  

Obviously this situation presents a multidimensional conflict.  First and foremost, I'm upset that I can't tuck my son in at night, read him a Dr. Seuss book, and run in to comfort him when he awakes from a bad dream.  But also, I'm in my last year of college.  I busted my ass to get a good job.  I've had four internships, including one this summer in NYC with a major accounting/consulting firm, and I got a full-time offer in their Chicago office.  We were talking about marriage.  I was excited to move our family to a big city where opportunities exist, and start a life together.  And she ruined it.  Let me remind you that she deliberately got pregnant to get my back, made the life-changing decision to go through with the pregnancy, and now that I've committed and given her exactly what she wanted to begin with, she just threw it away.   

So now, for those of you who have patient enough to read...

---   
**tl;dr**: 
1.  I had a child with my ex at 21.  I'm now 22, in my last year of college, and I've been fully committed to our relationship since he was born.  She has not, despite having gotten pregnant on purpose.  If you've been in a similar situation, how did you deal with it?  How did you decide between forcing it to work despite the emotional trauma so that you could see your kid(s) more often?  

2.  I'm incredibly pessimistic about my financial well-being moving forward.  I borrowed too much for college (~$85k), and now that we're separating, I have no choice but to back out of the job offer I accepted with a really great firm and seek employment in Syracuse, NY.  Opportunities are far and few between here, and I think it's safe to say my  potential for career advancement is considerably less in Syracuse vs Chicago.  When she files for support, I'm going to be financially crippled.  My loan payments will be $1000/month, with maybe $3000/month income after tax.  Having joint custody will prevent me from being able to get a second, part-time job, so what are my options?  Is there anything I can do that I'm not thinking of?

3.  Any other advice from young parents whose relationships didn't work out?  Does it get better?  Does it get worse?  What's the hardest part about raising a child separately?  Furthermore, where do you draw the line between respecting what your ex wants for your child (ie religious beliefs, educational effort, etc), and what I want?  How can I remain civil and not cause tension while simultaneously being able to make important decisions for my son?

**Full story**

I'm a university student doing my internship next year. School allows us to go abroad, and there is a country I have always dreamed of visiting, so I decided to go there for my internship.

I started preparing for this *really* early: almost an entire year ago. After submitting my CV/motivation to a dozen of companies specifically looking for international interns, I was ignored by all of them. Finally, I found someone through Reddit working in this country that told me his company was also doing internships and I should check them out.

My online contact did me a big favor then. He sent my files straight to the director of the branch I would be working in, and I *immediately* received a positive reply, asking me to do some tests and hold an interview.

Everything went fine, my results were good and the interview was a success. But then a misunderstanding occurred: they thought I would be doing my internship this year (even though my files explicitly said next year), so the minute they found out it was still going to be a year until my internship, all communication seized.

I kept messaging my online friend, but even he seemed to ignore me. Finally, after months, he replied, apologizing for his lack or replies due to personal problems and explaining it was still too early for the company and I should wait a little longer.

Now, two months ago, I messaged him again, and finally got in direct touch with the director of my branch. I got a contract, that is to say, one that I had to sign, but have yet to receive their counter-signed version (this has been two weeks now). I explained to him I need settle my visa soon now, because time is running out, and I need their signature to be 100% sure this internship is actually going to happen. I know they told me I was welcome there, but I don't trust it as long as I don't get their signature.

Important detail is that in order to get my visa, I need the company to submit a special paper to their local government. This procedure can take up to two months, and my internship starts in February. That means if I do not get them to submit the request for this paper by the end of this month, there is a chance I will not get my visa in time, rendering all my efforts completely useless.

I sent him a mail last week, telling him any updates would be very much appreciated, but have yet to hear back from them. They say they are restructuring at the moment, so they've been very busy, but I also want them to understand that time is running out and I need guarantees.

How would I go about asking them to hurry up? This is my first experience with a big company, and I'm afraid to mess up and lose this. Thanks for the help."

Recently, I applied to an ""IT internship"" position. They contacted me the next day and asked to talk in person. I went to the place. It is a warehouse. I talked to the person in charge of this company, he told me that they don't have an in-house IT person. Is this a bad sign?

I don't know 100% for a fact, but I'm quite sure that I will be drug tested.  I will probably by urine tested but I'm not discounting a hair test and want to be safe.

I quit smoking about 2-3 months ago.  Before then, I smoked during the summer and between January 1, 2014 and about June 7 2014 I refrained from smoking at all.  I'm a fit male, I go to the gym three times a week, religiously.

If I smoke tomorrow for the last time ever, will I be risking it in terms of a hair test in 6 months, or can I get away with smoking one last time?

Please help an ent on the way out of the forest.

Chris Milkins sat half slumped in his office chair, a device which offered innumerable permutations of slouching at any desired altitude. Despite the eventual strain on his lower back he found himself typically in a 60 degree angle, bum and lower back making stubborn impressions on an already aging foam. Annoyingly in this position, support inbetween these two stress points was too much to ask for and so as a rule every time the BBC flashed yet more ‘Breaking News’ on the office’s plasma (usually every 15 minutes) he would slump further or with a resurgence of flailing energy, use the armrests to hoist his average stature into a more forgiving arrangement. 
He sneered at the very essence of such news. A sensational overview of hot off the press global events which in reality were not so hot after all, more room temperature. Nevertheless the media approach was to thrust it all triumphantly in the face of any half-interested passing spectator. Holidaymakers abroad with nothing but BBC World instead of ""all that foreign shit"", a huddle of roofless citydwellers in front of Comet’s smorgasbord of LCD TVs and in Chris’s case, the underworked employees of a freight airline Ops Department in Leipzig, Germany.
Once upright the digital world clock came into view. With an audible sigh he remarked at the time having passed only 3 minutes since his last fruitless glance. At this rate he would update himself another 30 times before his shift ended. 
Was anyone else in the office counting the minutes? He shot a quick look at Sophie, the office nube. Nube and very much nubile he thought. A freshly printed photo of her in a gown clutching what appeared to be a used kitchen roll being the only company for her coffee mug and pen tidy. From side on he could just about see that she was busying herself with yet another spreadsheet and bar chart combo which would no doubt be the highlight of the group meeting later. He focussed on her ample boobs. Yep, they were still there and still remarkably alluring. They were there for his comfort, Chris thought, letting his daydream cultivate further into ambling over to her and simply cupping her left breast in his palm. After all, was that too much to ask he pondered? The phone rang. Sophie’s boobs would have to wait. It was Dennis, the department’s boss and fanatical ball grinder. Chris had been summoned to his office right away, do not pass go, do not collect 200 quid. Fuck, what have I done now. Such self-questioning was commonplace in Chris’ work life. In fact, if he endured a week without having his balls savagely ground by Dennis either he was very lucky or the boss was on holiday. Before carrying out the seemingly pressing request, Chris made sure he reclined once again, whilst feigning a quick email and then casually got up and made for the door. How uncool it would be for Sophie to discover that he was the subject of yet more bitch slapping…

Three days into her new job as a Flight Ops Intern Sarah was already quizzing herself as to how she ended up here. How was it she left her perfectly comfortable and more importantly wildly lucrative position in Oxford’s leading accountants? How was it she uprooted her colossal shoe collection and turfed it 900 miles east to what was formally East Germany? Would the hotel maid notice the wet blotches on her pillow and the ever decreasing tissue supply? She knew the answers really. Oli Banks, Oli Banks and yes probably but who cares, they see worse. The former was what she now considered to be 4 years of her life wasted. A guy completely inept at concealing his wanton infidelity with Sarah’s sister. The image of Oliver’s thrusting buttocks and her sister’s apparent cum face being a distressing nightly precursor to the aforementioned tears. What made the whole debacle even more distressing was that the guy with whom she now shared an office reminded her of Oli. Not so much his physical appearance, rather his demeanour. Oli was also an avid fan of the idle office chair sprawl and if she wasn’t mistaken, this guy, what was his name again, Craig, Chris or something similar, has now fervently grabbed hold of the boob observation baton. Oh well she thought, creepy though it was to have your chest inspected by the office pervert, it created a welcome haze over the underlying shit in her life right now. Besides, despite his somewhat tainted tendancies towards her, he isn’t actually that bad looking she surmised. If you’re going to have your figure sexually scrutinised every five minutes, better it be by someone easy on the eye than a toothless simpleton. This conclusion lead to the first vague hint of a smile she allowed herself in the last few months."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[You're amazing, Dan! Thanks for doing this! I recently read where you said the best advice you ever got was to do what would change you and improve you the most. What's the most valuable piece of advice you think you can give, or, alternatively, what's the second best piece of advice you've gotten?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lmp1k/im_dan_ariely_duke_professor_of_behavioral/clw9w3r?context=5)|Here is something from my last column in the WSJ --
 |Dear Dan,
 |Many years ago, I was badly burned, and since then, I carry many visible scars. Recently, at a Halloween party, somebody pointed to the scars on my face and told me what a wonderful costume I had. I tried to correct her and explained that I was really very badly burned, but she burst out laughing.
 |At this point, I had two choices: make her feel guilty or let it go. What should I have done? I must admit that it colored the Halloween party for me, and I no longer felt like I belonged.
 |—Dan (Ariely)
 |You should have let it go. The person pointing out your scars clearly had only good intentions, and trying to correct her once was sufficient. This was probably one of hundreds of comments that she made during the party, and while her remark was central for you, if you asked her in 48 hours about her memories from the party, she probably wouldn’t even remember you, your scars or her comment. You had already stopped enjoying the party after her comment; my guess is that having made her feel bad about her remark would only have intensified your negative feelings.
 |P.S. One more lesson from this unfortunate episode: Sometimes, putting yourself in the position of an external advisor and asking yourself what advice you’d give to someone else in the same situation can be a useful way to reason more calmly and make better decisions. Good luck using this approach next time.
[Just DL-ed the app after watching your video on Perils of Procrastination. I'm very guilty of it. What are you tips on avoiding this? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lmp1k/im_dan_ariely_duke_professor_of_behavioral/clw8g5o?context=5)|Procrastination plagues us all, so you're not alone. There are lots of ways to think about it, but one recent interesting study emailed parents to let them know that their kids were facing a deadline or an upcoming exam.
 |By simply emailing them, creating an implicit social pressure and probably some explicit social pressure, the tasks were completed at a higher rate.
 |On top of that, because you don't have any immediate reward for completing the task, I'd recommend looking for one. You can look for positive rewards (praise or a good reputation) or you can think of ""negative rewards"" such as shame or humiliation.
 |For next year, think about the idea of ""precommitment."" With precommitment, you approach students at the beginning of the semester and you tell them to put $10 down. You tell them if they miss the deadline they will lose the money, and if they hit the deadline they will get the money back. This helps the students create a system of motivation for themselves. We've tested it numerous and it's proven to be very effective.  
[, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to listen to my product idea a few months ago. Your comments and questions were insightful and inspired me to go deeper into the idea. I'll let you know if I get funding for the project.  In my experience, recognizing, acknowledging, and evaluating the instances in which I am irrational helps me to buck that irrational behavior. Do you think there is category / type of irrational behavior, though,  that isn't helped by recognizing,  acknowledging, and evaluating it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lmp1k/im_dan_ariely_duke_professor_of_behavioral/clw98fn?context=5)|Think of two extreme categories (and of course there many in the middle). One is big purchases - something we do very rarely that is not urgent. Things like buying a house, a car, getting married, going for a grad degree. These are instances in which understanding our biases can allow us to overcome them. You can simply sit down, think about it, realize where the mistakes are, and try to overcome them.  For example, you might be infatuated with somebody - thinking to yourself that it's going to last a long time. But if you ask your mother what she thinks, your mother is unlikely to take your short term perspective into account. She will think about the long term and might give you solid advice.  On the other hand, if you think about something like attention, or distractions from email and notifications, it's something that happens in the moment. It's very hard to not get distracted by knowing that you have email waiting for you, for example.  Of course you could take email notifications and just turn them off, but that puts you back in the first category of thinking about something for a long time and then overriding the mistakes in principle (but not at the moment).
[What are some of the major lessons or insights from your field that you think could apply to approaching  inter nation conflicts? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lmp1k/im_dan_ariely_duke_professor_of_behavioral/clw8u2m?context=5)|I think one of the things we show is the extent to which people experience the reality they expect to experience.
 |As every sports fan knows, if the referee makes a call that goes against your team, you can't help but think of the referee as blind, stupid, evil, malicious. And this is because our motivation colors our experience. We don't experience reality in an objective way, we experience it in a way that is distorted by our motivation.
 |This of course is very sad for international conflict, because it means that the chance that people from two different sides will sit and agree on the facts is very low. But it does suggest that we need interventions from objective third parties. Sadly, the world is such right now that there are not many unbiased third parties [the UN could have been one]. But I think we need to build those reliable, accountable, objective third parties if we hope to bridge some of the deeper conflicts around the world. 
[What are the most important characteristics of an individual that are prerequisites for good habit forming? Alternatively, will you be doing studies on the effectiveness of your new app?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lmp1k/im_dan_ariely_duke_professor_of_behavioral/clw8nwn?context=5)|Yes, we're going to study inside and outside of the app.  Outside, to bring learning about peoples' behaviors to influence what we do in the application.  And inside, in aggregate to protect privacy, but to ensure that we are helping people live happy, productive and well-balanced lives.
 |So far, we've found that when we make suggestions about how to use your time, people are 150% more likely to act upon them than if people have to motivate themselves to remember and note the items.
 |This relates to habits, because people are not innately wired to take on and follow through with habits because ""tomorrow is that magical day when everything can get done"" and habits are most likely to be pushed off.  If we are suggesting and putting habits in the environment of the person, we can help them keep good habit behaviors.
 |So the things we're finding is habits are about being reminded and committing to time, which is what Timeful is all about.
[What does a behavioral officer do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lmp1k/im_dan_ariely_duke_professor_of_behavioral/clw7w3k?context=5)|It is a very good question, but the truth is that I don't want to tell anyone because then they will be able to hold me accountable to it.
 |Seriously (more seriously) one of the main challanges with thinking about time is the psychology of time and the mistakes we make when we make decisions about time (procrastination, wasting our most productive hours on non productive tasks, etc).  My job as a behavioral officer is to figure out the mistakes people make, and the ways to overcome some of our personal biases.
 |It is a fun job, and it doesn't seem that I am going to run out of mistakes to look at any time soon ;)

[Hi Dan, I love your work.  I seem to continually suffer (or possibly be fueled by\) the notion that the grass is always greener on the other side.  Sometimes i think its a curse -- i never seem to appreciate the moment.  Other times i think its a great motivator to keep on striving for improvement.  Do you have any thoughts on this?  Thanks ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lmp1k/im_dan_ariely_duke_professor_of_behavioral/clw86md?context=5)|Let me use relationships as a metaphor for my answer. I think that looking constantly at other couples and other people and comparing yourself to them is certainly not a good way to find happiness. It is a way to maximize counterfactual thinking (thinking about what could have been).
 |On the other hand, looking at your own partner and focusing on the kinds of things you admire in them and the kinds of things they inspire you to strive to be better at is an incredibly motivating way of living and trying to improve.
 |In essence, I think that comparing yourself to outsiders in a negative light (downward comparison) can be damaging, but comparing yourself to people who are close to you in a positive way can be very beneficial. 
[Hi Dan! I love your books.

We gave some people financial incentives, some social pressure - but the thing that worked the best was creating a physical coin that represented their savings.  That coin more than doubled their savings as compared to a 20% match. The reason i think it worked so well was that we changed the environment in which they lived. We created a tangible representation of their savings and changed the discussion in the household. I also find this incredibly optimistic because it means if we change the environment in which people operate, we can drive better behaviors.

I've been an active reader of this sub, and am making my own post because I feel I'm in a unique position (no debt, free education, high paying job prospects).

Short Term Question: What should I do with Internship money (22K this coming summer, another 22-25K next summer)?

Long Term Question: How to save for business school? Other long term goals? What is the point of life and money?

Short-Term Background: I'm a 2nd year Computer Science major at a top public university. My parents are paying entirely for my education and I have no debt. I want to go to an elite business school, and will have to pay for myself out of pocket at around age 27 $200,000 to attend.  I've secured an internship this summer with a major tech giant that will be paying me 21,000$ for 3 months. Food + Housing + Travel is free during the summer. What should I do with the internship money for the next 8 years? What about future money (another 22-25K the summer after)? Also, I expect to graduate and get a job in a high cost of living area (SF or NYC) but be earning 105,000+ starting (and see myself making 145,000+ at age 26)? How to best save for business school? W

Long term question: What the hell do I do with money now/in the future? If I had debts, loans, etc. I would worry. I don't. My dad is also a Software engineer earning 200,000+ and will have a solid 2-3 million saved up by retirement time. My parents are healthy and my family is stable. My brother is doing well in school as well. I understand the value of saving money but what should I save for? What is the marginal utility of having 4 instead of 2 million dollars? Do I just retire early? Take expensive vacations? Spend it on expensive cars I don't need? I'm just sort of confused because I've been raised in a hard working family that has been short on money. My family, and large parts of my life, are essentially set. What do I do? "
2lnchi,4,2014-11-07,"Is it common to feel like you have few true friends in ""adult"" life?",sailboatsairplanes,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/2lnchi/is_it_common_to_feel_like_you_have_few_true/,"So my title may not be a very good description but here's what I'm getting at.

After college and even the last year or two of college, I started to feel like I had very few true friends. I really just concentrated on getting experience interning, so most of the time it felt like I was working full time while taking classes. I took pride in excelling career wise and really put a lot of my energy climbing the ""internship ladder.""

I have two best friends that I've known since middle school, but we all live in different states and only see each other every so often. I have a few friends from college, but interactions really don't go pass maybe meeting up for dinner once in a blue moon or texting some. I'm very easy to push away people who I don't believe are genuine. I've had friends who, if I make plans with them, often cancel on me and also never take the initiative to invite me to hang out. When this happens, I drop them completely. If they don't want to hang, I won't ask them to. I've always been a believer that there's no point in having friends who aren't actually there for you or being a true friend. Someone I can go to if anything is on my mind for example, instead of someone who just wants to have fun.

My roommate and I were fairly close before, but I feel like we've grown apart and spend more time being roommates than friends. She still lives a different lifestyle than I do. Most of my network are people who are still in college and like to go out and party. I'm honestly super boring; I work a 9-5 job, chill at home and I'm not really a fan of going out. Some weekends I'll drive to my hometown to spend time with family.

I just got a job this summer, and although my coworkers are nice, everyone in my office is at least 20 years older than me.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 1.5 years, but our relationship for the most part has been long distance and he's deployed right now. I've heard of people who basically have their SO, and that's it. How common is that? 

I'm just in one of those moods where I feel a little lonely and I want to know if I'm just the antisocial weird one or if other people have these issues too. 

TL;DR - Is it uncommon to feel like you have few true friends post college? Is this how your twenties are?"

My gf has some mental issues - sudden breakdowns, issues with her mom, hasnt got over her past (that she needs to control), he is egocentric and egoistic at times, but I could handle that so far. Shes been crying on a dayily basisc for a reason unknown to her. She loves me now. She cant forgive herself that she wasnt truthful to me in the very begining of our relationship. But it's okay. Im willing to be as cool for all that as its possible since I truely love her. 
But today. 
Last 2 weeks were tough, she is seeing psychologist, that told her she needs to visit a shirnk for some pills to help sort things out. Shes been crying a lot, feeling depressed, apathic. Now this weeks was hard since I started an internship in a law firm and it takes away much of the time that previously I could spend on being with her. Last two days were off (though I am gonna be working full time from next week and she knows that) I though that we could spent some quality time.

Yesterday I wanted to make dinner for us, and watch some movie. But then she ate at work and wasnt that hungry. No big deal, Ill cook for us tomorrow (today that is). She came to my place, informed me that she has not much time (usually we got less than 2 hours for ourselves - this time it was around 1 hour) and her brother called her that he has time to take care of her car, so without much thinking she agreed to that, spoiling our evening. What is more she wasnt interested in doing anything special. Wanted to cuddle and take a nap. I told her that Im not okay with certain things, that she informed me about the change to our plans at the very last moment, and that I was disappointed. We sorted things out (at least I thought so) on evening phonecall and we agreed that tomorrow (today) we will spend more time together. 

So here it is. 
Today as I could stay at home I gave her most of my time (she loves when we can communicate on skype during her working hours). I cooked a meal for us. She ate a dinner at work but was able to squeeze in my dinner also. Before she left her work, she told me she is sorry but we wont have much time today either - she got invited for a meeting with CEO, board members and other co-workers that were responsible for successful project. The meeting was classic wine and cheese in a classy restaurant. That was fine with me. At my place we had dinner, cuddled, took a nap, had a quicke and off she goes. 

Then she was kind late for the meeting so little contact whatsoever. During the meeting she sent me few pics (she looked like a million dollars). Yet it was okay with me, we agreed that we will see each other as soon as meeting is over. Around 10 pm she msged me that its almost over and she is about to go. 30 mins later she msged me that no no no they are staying longer. They moved to a club (typical corporate/douchebags club, young hot girls and rich old guys). At that point things started to annoy me. It turns out she is not giving a damn about seeing me, wanted to party with all that old rich asses. I msged her that Im going to bed (it was around midnight) that I miss her, I love her, that I hope she is responsible and not-too-drunk. Went to sleep. 

Woke up just now. Got 3 calls from her, 2 voice mails, and few msgs from 1am to 2:30 am. She was drunk (I could her from voice mails), she wanted to visit me (yeah sure), she loves me (ofc), she is deeply sorry if she  disappointed me (ofc she did). I wrote her back, that Im not okay that she went to the club (since we dont usually party on our own), that I dont like how things turned out and If I was her Id call it a day after the cheese and wine meeting and come to my place (have in mind that it was my last day off.

2lnis4,13,2014-11-08,"Graduated college in May, Can't find a job.",Humdinger222,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2lnis4/graduated_college_in_may_cant_find_a_job/,"Hello everyone,

So I graduated from a decent state school back in May with a Finance degree and a 3.0 GPA. Since then I've been applying to jobs as often as they come up on indeed, monster, and careerbuilder, among others, but I'm barely getting interviews.

I've had my resume reviewed by my school numerous times, my peers, and my parents and all said it looks great, and they don't see any issues. 

I have internship experience, and leadership experience (Helped found a club of around 30 members). I was also in a ""Faculty Approval Only"" course that only accepts 10 undergrads a semester. 

The jobs I'm applying to are Financial Analyst, Risk Analyst, and Credit Analyst type jobs, but out of the 70 jobs I've applied to in the last month and a half, I've had about 3 or 4 interviews. A week after I apply I call and ""check on my application."" Typically I get sent to some HR persons voicemail and never hear back.

The interviews I do have are typically 45 minutes long, and in person, and I feel like they go very well, but never hear back. Interviewers will say ""If you have any more questions, please email me."" So I will send a follow up email after about 3 days thanking them for their time, and recapping what we spoke about. I try to include a question, but I've yet to have an interviewer reply with an answer. One interviewer said in the interview that she would show me a report the previous person in the position wrote so I could see, so I asked to see that in the follow up email, but never heard back. 

I've tried reaching out to my professors in the Finance department, but they have ignored my emails. I had a friend ask one of the professors (that professor is terrible with email), and the professor told my friend that he saw the email, but didn't know what to say to me. 

I'm at a complete loss as to what to do now, and it's really starting to weigh on me. Though I'm fortunate enough to have some cash, and am able to live with my parents in a large city.

I feel like I'm starting to get to that point where my unemployment hurts my chances of employment.

What am I doing wrong here? "

2lnjab,0,2014-11-08,TIFU by committing a violent crime (misdemeanor),[deleted],tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2lnjab/tifu_by_committing_a_violent_crime_misdemeanor/,"I'm 30. Before I start with the story, I should mention an oddity about myself. I may have Hyperacusis (hypersensitive hearing) or something. Ever since I can remember, I've always had a *very* difficult time handling certain sounds. An incessantly beeping phone or microwave can practically ruin my day. I've nearly broken down crying before because of electronic noises that I cannot silence for whatever reason. Five car door beeps is too much. It's not usually anger that I feel, it's more like I'm being tortured.

I know I should get this checked out, but I didn't really think about how it was affecting my life until last few years, and I don't have the money to do it until I get a job.

**The Story**

My wife and I have 3 kids. We both used to work, but I was laid off during the recession and used it as an opportunity to get a degree in what I've always been interested in (Computer Science). Halfway through, she was laid off too. Fast forward 5 years, and somehow we made it through my maxing out loans, credit cards, and a bit of family help.

Before college, I was really stuck (but making good money) in a field of expertise that I wasn't interested in. So I made sure that, even though I only went to a state university, my resume would be excellent. I have a high GPA, in some honor societies, taught several full classes, headed the tutoring department, was the president of the club, had a great internship, several good projects up on github, and I was probably one of the top 10 students in the department, skill-wise, etc.  I did absolutely everything I could to make myself as marketable as possible.

Having all that debt and very little income has paid it's toll. This last year has been hard, as what little income and credit we had is basically gone. We're not delinquent on anything, but we're struggling to keep it that way.

I became depressed. My relationship with my wife had never been stellar to begin with, but it had been getting better until this last year. I found myself lying in bed a lot, and not really helping with the kids and things around the house as much as I should. She was fed up, and I can't blame her.

Early-ish one morning, she was very upset that I was going to spend another day lying around depressed. She wanted to argue. I wasn't upset, heck I didn't even say much, but I definitely injected little comments that I shouldn't have. Anyways, she has a very strong tendency to keep an argument going for hours, while I usually just want to drop it.

It was about 10:30 or 11AM, and I was still in bed, and she was *still* railing me for lying around. Then she started *screaming* at the top of her lungs at me, and pounding the bed that I was on. I have to say, that I was not all that mad. I just couldn't handle the screaming, like I can't handle many high pitch noises. This is the part where I fucked up (the most?). It was just for a moment, and I didn't injure her, but I choked her. Oh I know I fucked up big time, I'm not trying to downplay my actions. I simply want to highlight how so many things were destroyed in basically an instant. I was arrested, charged with a misdemeanor, pled guilty, and I'm now in counseling. That was 3 months ago.

Neither of us want to break up our family, and we both know that a lot of our problems arise from all the financial stress and other things that are only temporary. So we're going to marriage counseling as soon as I we the money (read: a job), and I'll go to a doctor, etc. She started seeing a counselor. In my opinion, our marriage is going to be fine, and I think she believes that too. In fact, we hope it will improve significantly, as now we're making a more active effort.

It's been 3 months now. But a lot of damage has been done. For one, she told my entire family. Having them all know what I did has been really humiliating. It's like nothing I've achieved or accomplished even matters, because I'm An Abuser^TM

What's been bothering me the most lately, and what inspired me to write this post, is the effect this is having on my was-just-about-to-start career. I found a killer job, the kind I pushed myself doing everything in my power for 5 years for, the kind I put my family through hell to get. They made me an offer, which I accepted, but I have to go through a security check to obtain clearance. This means that all these people I just got through trying to impress now get to hear about what a piece of shit I am. It's only a misdemeanor, but it was just 3 months ago. I haven't finished my counseling yet, and I'm on probation for 3 years. So now I'm waiting, and hoping that my clearance is granted so that we can get a fresh start on the next part of our lives.

Only, I don't really believe that is going to happen. I'm sure my clearance will be denied any day now. I was even more depressed after the fight than I was before. And then there's this... if I don't get this job, I'm not sure how many fucks I have left to give.


**TL;DR**  I may have Hyperacusis (hypersensitive hearing), as I have a *very* hard time handling certain sounds. Depressed right after graduation and staying in bed a lot. Wife got very frustrated, we argued, she started screaming at me, I put her in a choke hold. I let go right away, but it was too late, and I was arrested. Wife and I are seeking help, and will probably be fine now. My entire family assumes I am a serial abuser and has lost respect for me, and I may not be able to get security clearance to get an excellent job we really needed."

I'm trying to figure out how the industry operates and what I should expect. Writing this from mobile so bear with me...

Early on when programming with people from class, I would really like the idea of working together on a single program to solve problems. It seemed better an every way than working separately. Instead of the communication overhead of having to explain to someone the problem, we would already be on the same page. Pair programming seemed to me the best way to work with code. You can catch bugs that other people miss and vice versa, discuss things as they come up etc.

Then I met people who didn't want to do that. They were rather innately opposed to the idea of doing this, and would prefer to do their portion of the work on their own. More than this, they preferred email/IM communication rather than discussing problems with voice. 

This all seemed very inefficient to me. I felt like every time I has to explain something it required a tremendous amount of effort to articulate and comprehend the back and forth. If we were together when we wrote this we wouldn't even be discussing what the problem is and I could direct you with my hand to the problem area of the code. I felt it was massively inefficient, especially as complexity increased.

I watched a documentary on Linus Torvalds and found out he uses email to discuss the Linux kernel's development. That sounds like utter hell to me. Every time I'm typing out words I feel frustrated.

For pair programming to work well I guess both parties would have to be at a similar skill level. For me, I don't mind bringing the other people up to speed with what I'm working on if we're of comparable skill level. I guess I have this sort of naive optimism about pair programming though, and in reality it probably doesn't go down that well. Or perhaps people had the wrong notion of what I wanted to do. Perhaps they thought it was inefficient or that I was holding them back.

So I guess I'm just wondering: what are the common practices in the industry and how is it working for you?
What would be ideal in your opinion and (this is the crux of this post) where should I work if I like one style more than the others?"

1) Obtain a summer internship for next year. Only took me a few weeks. Expected it to be more difficult. 

2) Stay approximately one chapter ahead of the material (arguably this this still in progress, but I see no difficulty in maintaining it). Have probably a 3.7ish GPA right now. 

3) Discuss with recruiters for a summer internship for 2016. A few are interested and want me to apply. 

4) Get involved deeply with a design team and one engineering organization as well as one non engineering organization. This is complete. I have one leadership role out of the three and intend to increase it to two by next year (first years are not eligible for many things).

2lo2ie,2,2014-11-08,Ios update broke my friend's ipad (please help),[deleted],applehelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/2lo2ie/ios_update_broke_my_friends_ipad_please_help/,"Just made this account.

So my friend asked me to update her ipad 3 about a week ago (shes not a native English speaker) so I agree. Now, I've updated my iPhone quite a few times and I've had a iPhone since the 3g so I figured it would be pretty straight forward. 

Now this is what happened. After itunes finished downloading the ipad IOS file, the apple logo appeared on the ipad and preceded to do its thing. 3/4 of the way finished itunes tells me that the ipad cannot be updated. Now it's stuck in recovery mode and I've tried to restore it through itunes and in DFU mode. Nothing works. I took it to to the genius bar and they couldn't restore it either and said it was a hardware issue and that I would have to pay to have it replaced (out of warranty). 

She doesn't have enough money to replace it and neither do I, but I feel terrible. I can't help but feel that she blames me for bricking her ipad when all I did was try to do what I've done for my iphones. She's pretty reliant on her ipad for both entertainment and translations (she's from another country and is doing a internship here in the U.S and doesn't have a laptop).

I've tried everything. Used two different computers, different cables, disabled security programs, and even the apple geniuses couldn't do anything. 

What are my options?

Long story short, i've suffered of social anxiety disorder and depression since my early teens (I'm 22 now), been on meds for the past three years and they've really made a difference. I'm on the so called ""california rocket fuel"" which is venlafaxine+mirtazapine (300mg+30mg).

Anyhow, lately I've been feeling more anxious and anxious. There are several things that could've caused it but I'm not sure if it's one specific thing or all of them together. Like there's a lot of family drama going on at the moment, i'm writing my final thesis which causes me a lot of stress, i've pretty much locked down an internship which means that i'm leaving university soon which I find a bit scary. 

I'm also dating this girl that I like but she's an exchange student who's leaving in a month. If i'm going to be honest I think she is the main reason for what's happened. Developing feelings for someone has almost always been rather destructive for my well-being but at the same time I know that if I don't push myself to make an effort I'll just make my love life even more miserable. 

Since last week i've been sleeping worse, lost my apetite, not felt like being social at all and avoided the girl. Basically i'm feeling that crippling anxiety again and i'm afraid it's going to start messing things up. 

I don't really know what to do, except that i'm going to take a break from pot since i've been smoking way too much and I heard it can reduce your apetite which isn't helping.

Anyone else gone through something similiar? What do I even say to my doctor? 

Any kind of a advice is appreciated. "
2losd3,0,2014-11-08,Stuck on which 4 of these colleges i should go to,99throw9away,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2losd3/stuck_on_which_4_of_these_colleges_i_should_go_to/,"I'm an 18 year old senior (male) from Southern California.

I plan on majoring in something business related. It's probably going to be either Business Marketing or Business Administration. I'd like to work in the movie industry (business part of it) but still be close to all the cool stuff. Was originally going to major in film or something in the arts category but figured it was too risky and people always complain once they have it and can't get a job. I know these types of jobs are super competitive, but i'd probably try to start out with a non paying internship just to meet people on the inside and work my way up, ya know? 

 I've applied to multiple places that I haven't heard back from yet, but I got my acceptance letters from 4 of the schools I was looking at mostly.

Chico State - Basically an unranked school (really big party school..in california = less $...seems like a blast though and i have a lot of friends that go there &amp; I'd probably end up going with a few of my high school buds too.) 

Washington State -  a pretty dang big school out of state(lots o $). From what I heard it's a party school(which is nice), it'd be a change of weather (which i sorta want)...apart of the Pac-12 and is super spirited (I love being spirited..hate schools that don't give a shit about themselves)...There mascot is the same as my High school mascot, so that's cool. Heard they have a good Business School.

Oregon State - Out of state = more $ i have to give. Change of weather (not as much as WSU)...I think they're apart of pac 12. They're the beavers, which is pretty lame but they're pretty spirited. Not sure about their business school. My second cousin goes there and loves it..but she's apart of a sorority and i'm not really interested in joining a fraternity (I'd still like to party wherever I end up going though). 

Arizona State - I'm sure a lot of you even on the east side know about this school. Easy to get into, huge population. 8,000 enrolled freshman a year. Big party school, would probably meet a lot of new people and destined to find people just like me since it's so big...Pretty sure the dorms are on the outside so i'd imagine it hard to make friends since you can't really always keep your dorm door open since outside would make your room hot af, and from what i've heard keeping your dorm door open is the key to making friends in the beginning. Tons of clubs, etc. Pretty sure I heard some good things about their business school. 

Do any of you know about these colleges? If you go to them, what do you love/hate about them? Any insight? If i go OOS is it going to be hard getting internships back in socal or will I only get scholarships in those states, etc? I want to live in Cali but moving quite a bit away for college would be amazing. "
2loskr,2,2014-11-08,Be Careful What You Say Online,[deleted],leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2loskr/be_careful_what_you_say_online/,"I'm a third year Computer Science student, and I recently applied for an internship position at Riot. It was for a Quality Assurance position, not that it really matters. I'm currently interning at a big name company, my grades are stellar, and I even got a chance to talk to a Riot employee after a game about the internships they offered. I got very excited, spent 2 weeks perfecting my resume and cover letter. To be tailored to Riot. I pushed myself to get Gold and changed my name from DigBickJace to DB Jace, just so my account looked a little better. I thought I had a good chance of getting it, although I had a nagging feeling that this was all going to be for naught. 

I've said some stuff in game that I'm not proud of. I don't think there has been anything too recently, but I can't say for certain. The point is I'm pretty sure the reason I did not get the internship is because of the things I used to say a few months ago, and also the name of a ranked 5's team that I was on and didn't realize until it was too late. ""We're AIDS you're Africa"". I was not the creator of the team, but I did join it. Not because of the name, because I wanted to play some Ranked 5's with friends and just accepted the request without paying too much attention. Looking back, I really wish I hadn't. 

I know it's too late now, but please Summoner's, just think about what you're saying in game. It really sucks to know that I just missed out on an amazing opportunity because of some things I said out of frustration, thinking it would never matter. 

TL;DR: Don't say things you don't mean, it could come back to bite you in the butt. NOTE: I don't know if this is the reason I didn't get the internship, but it most certainly did not help one bit. "

2lpkaa,17,2014-11-08,How would you fix the VA?,mutatron,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/2lpkaa/how_would_you_fix_the_va/,"My daughter's a PGY-1 IM in a large metropolitan area. She does rounds at University Hospital, County Hospital, and VA Hospital.

When she started in July, she did 2 weeks at the VA, and now that she's on her second rotation there she says she sees how much the attendings and more senior residents were shielding the interns from how things work at the VA.

One thing is that the computers are very slow, to the point where it's difficult to enter orders for critical patients in a timely manner, and sometimes impossible, so people have to improvise. This seems like something that could be easily fixed, but apparently there's no way to do that within the system as it now stands.

More crucial is that the nurses in this VA simply don't seem to care much about their work. I can't really go into detail about that, but one example was a patient who had a potassium level of 2.6, an order was placed, but it wasn't filled until 3 and a half hours later.

Not being a doctor myself and only reporting this as second hand information, I may not be conveying the seriousness of the situation. And then my daughter's an intern, so what does she know? But really, she has a pretty high tolerance for difficult situations.

The ED at County Hospital sometimes has patients holding their own IV bags in the sitting room only section, and shower stalls have been converted into ""private rooms"" for patients on gurneys. But still, that's one of the best ED's in the country, it runs well, and the nurses there are very good at what they do. The same is true of the rest of County Hospital and even more so of University Hospital.

Am I being an enabler or a supportive girlfriend?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2lpuxp/my_24f_boyfriend_24m_fucked_up_big_time_am_i/,"I am so sorry for this wall of text. Thank you if you actually spend the time to read it. 

**Back story:** We've been dating for almost two years. We're both cyclists, science nerds, and love to dance. I graduated from college in August and 6 weeks ago moved to California for a dream job. He made some poor decisions his first years of college, failed a bunch of classes, and dropped out. When we met, he wasn't in school but said that after seeing me in school, he was inspired to go back, and he re-enrolled and has been in school ever since. Its been a bit of a struggle financially because he lives at home with his single mom who cant afford the $2,000 per semester tuition and he works 35+ hours a week to pay his car, insurace, and help out his mom with rent, while paying for school, too. He has shitty credit cause his deadbeat Dad fucked up his mom's credit and he never had a credit card up until a few months ago. I, on the other hand, come from a pretty stable family, financially speaking. I have a savings account with a couple thousand I saved up, my college and car was paid by my parents. I worked part-time to pay for my gas &amp; insurance, and just save up money. I didn't have the option of dropping out of school, nor did I ever really want to. It took me some time to finish my degree since I switched majors, but I never took a semester off, except a few summers.


**The relationship:** He's my best friend and there is an abundance of chemistry. I didn't imagine it would turn into anything serious when we started dating, I just loved being around him and with him I was happy. But once he started to show ambition, like going back to school, I was able to start imagining a future with him, and I fell in love hard. I had casually dated my fair share of men in the past, but he was my first official boyfriend, and really my first real love. We fought, obviously, but we always managed to talk this out and work through it. Some fights took longer than others, but rarely did we ever bring up old fights. We're definitely very different in the fact that when I'm upset, I want to talk it out **right now** while he's the type that gets overwhelmed and goes mute and needs space to think things through. This drives me crazy. The more he ignores me, the more upset I get. I feel like if we just calmly talk through it sooner, the sooner we can move on, instead of going to sleep crying and upset. I know that I need to compromise on that, and I've been working on it. He was horrible about talking about his emotions at the beginning, but he's improved tremendously since then, but he still has a lot of work to do. 

We split everything. He doesn't have the money to spoil me or treat me to things, and I'm okay with that because I still love spending time with him and I can afford to pay for myself. Of course I wish we could go on cool trips and do other things that involve having money, but I don't need those things to be happy with him, and I know he's doing his best to get his life together. I'd rather him put that extra money towards a savings account, since he doesn't have one, or finish paying off some medical debts from an accident he had years before we met.

About a year and a half into our relationship, this past June, it was a very bad month for us. I found out that my mom's breast cancer came back and spread to her bones, my mother and I were on pretty bad terms before I found out, and I just started a new job that I hated. I was not well, and was not handling things well. We talk a lot through text throughout the day while we're at work, and sometimes it gives way for miscommunication, and we fought like once a week around this time and broke up twice out of anger. We had never broken up or gone on a ""break"" before this because neither of us believed in that. Then, fourth of July, I found out he had dropped ~$500 on components to build up his road bike in a week. I got pissed because how could he spend all that money on a BIKE when he doesn't have money to pay for classes? I had lent him $700 in January to help pay for his classes, which at that point, he hadn't paid me back for. He technically already had the money to pay me back from a big check he finally got from an internship he did in the summer, but he hadn't actually paid me back yet. It bothered me that instead of doing something nice for me, he spends a huge chunk of money on a BIKE. Side note: for my birthday he bought me a vase and got me a card. That's it. I'm sorry if I sound really vain, but I wouldn't have a problem with it if he didn't spend all that money on a bike. We got into a fight about it, (I did not mention the vase, nor have I ever to him) and he blew up, told me really, really hurtful things like ""I don't love you enough, I don't care about you enough"" and even though I begged him to calm down and not to do this right now, he did. And asked me to get out of the car, and then went out drinking with his friends.


**I was destroyed.** Ungrateful, selfish asshole. I couldn't believe it. After we both calmed down, we decided that we wouldn't talk for about 2 weeks, to give ourselves time to think things through and evaluate our relationship and decide if either of us wanted to continue or not. After a weekend of distractions and much needed time with my girlfriends, I decided fuck two weeks. Of course he's going to want me back in two weeks, cause he's going to forget all the bad stuff and only remember the good. I want him to remember the bad stuff and realize that its gonna happen again. Couples fight, its normal, and its healthy when its done clean. And he's either willing to do it or not. So after a few days, I called him and I told him I already made up my mind and if he wanted to meet up that night. He agreed, and we met, and he apologized and admitted that it was irresponsible and he doesn't want to lose me. Cool. So we'll work on this. I loved him so fucking much, but this break up definitely slapped the rose colored glasses off my face and made me take a step back. I wanted to give it a second chance. He's far from perfect, but everyday *he's improving. I see the effort and I feel the love and this could really be something if I'm patient and understanding, because the universe knows that I have my faults and my problems.

**FAST FORWARD**: I moved to Cali beginning of October. We're both lived in Florida. I wasn't so scared about the long distance because when I was applying to jobs, he said he would move to be with me if there was somewhere that he could go to school, and the city that I live in has a university with his major. I could support him with rent, we would share my car, and he would work full time to save up for tuition in the fall. We had planned for him to move in January, and he was visiting in October, and I would be home for Thanksgiving and Christmas. The past 6 weeks have been surprisingly pretty damn easy with the long distance. We're both so busy, but we manage to make time to talk. I made work friends quickly so I haven't really gotten too homesick. We've barely fought, and he's been very affectionate and just great. I paid for his flight to come visit me two weekends ago and it was a wonderful weekend we both really needed. But then I had a rough week, and he didnt text me that he went to bed and I got annoyed because its the like the fifth time he's done that in the past few weeks. He apologized for the previous times and I brushed it off everytime, but now I'm just annoyed. We were talking through text, I wasn't really feeling resolved about it even though he said he was sorry. ""I'm sorry, but its probably gonna happen again."" And he also tries to turn it around on me and say that I never said goodnight texts to him, which is so far from the truth. It was a stupid fight, and I didn't think it would escalate, and I shouldve known better to just drop it. But instead I told him that I didnt feel resolved about it, I love you but we'll talk later. I was trying to give him space. I didn't hear from him the rest of the day, and I was really bummed about it, but he needs his space. I go for a quick beer after work with a friend, since he wasn't gonna get out of class for another hour probably, but then he calls me. I tell him I can't talk cause I'm at the bar with my friend, and he said he was hoping to talk now because he's going on a ride and out after so he was gonna be out for a while. I got so upset that he made plans and didnt even bother to tell me, after I told him we needed to talk later. Because I happen to not be available in that fifteen minute window, I would not be able to talk to him. So I called him after the bar, and we tried to talk, but he was in public so he didnt feel comfortable, and I was already upset and crying and hurt because I felt like he didnt care about my feelings. He got defensive, and heated, and even after I calmed down and tried my hardest to calm him down and ask him what's wrong, it wasn't working. He was out with his friends and he wasn't going home and there was no way he was going to get into the ""talking"" mode. So we hung up, I cried and cried and tried calling him back but his phone died. I couldn't sleep. I tried calling his phone at 2 AM. 3 AM, and nothing. His phone was still dead. I finally forced myself to sleep. When I woke up, it was already 1PM in Florida, and his phone still was dead. What the fuck. I called his mom to make sure he made it home. She told me yeah but he left early. Then I text his buddy to ask if he's heard from him, and he says he hasnt but he'll ask around. Then twenty minutes later, I get the worst phone call in my life. It was a collect call from a local jail in Florida from him. I burst into tears. He got a DUI. He never made it home, his mom lied so that I wouldn't be mad at him. He refused the breathalyzer, so there's a very slim chance he can fight the charge, but regardless, he can't move to California anymore. He's going to have a record. Finding a job will be so hard for him. He already has shitty credit. His insurance is going to go through the roof. And he doesn't have the money to pay all the fines and legal fees. I fee like everything is ruined. Everything we were working for just took like 5 steps backwards. I'm just about to start a new life in California as a professional, pay all my own bills, get my own place, and I dont even know to describe where he's at. I'm scared he won't change and I'll waste my time standing by someone who loves me but doesn't care enough to get their shit together. 

**TL;DR Boyfriend of two years got a DUI last night. We were already struggling as a couple financially, and I was still building up trust in him from very terrible fight a few months ago. I love him to pieces and I hope this shitty situation will teach him a lesson, but I don't know if I'm making the wrong decision by standing by him.**

2lpwzl,1,2014-11-08,Cheated with my ex. I've never regretted anything more in my life.,[deleted],survivinginfidelity,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/2lpwzl/cheated_with_my_ex_ive_never_regretted_anything/,"Around over two years ago I(20m) was just starting college and began dating my ex Alice (24f). I was in undergrad and she was a grad student who worked for the university as an instructor. She had randomly moved in with some close friends that I knew here and so we started hanging out and eventually dating. I was very happy with her but we had so many issues. She showed me so many new things about what I did and didn't want in a person. She was passionate about her career and family and seemed like she had so much control of her life. She didn't, in reality, because she was a hardcore alcoholic and teeming with insecurities. Even so, I kind of admired her and I feel like this was the main cause of my infatuation with her. 
She started acting very cold to me one day several months in and it just never stopped. She wouldn't kiss me anymore, or want to spend nights together, and eventually even ignored me when I spoke to her or tried to make plans. I couldn't understand what had happened (lack of communication) and just tried relentlessly to win her affection back, all to no avail. It was very difficult and embarrassing because I feel like all my closest friends witnessed my personal moments of distress that I wouldn't want anybody to know. When I was leaving home for winter break that year we didn't even hug or kiss to say bye. We just waved from across the hallway and I left knowing that anything we had was over. 
Alice stayed living with my friends after that, so I eventually realized the cause of all this was that her ex reached out to her and wanted to get back together. Her and this guy went out for 4 years and even went abroad to new zealand together for a year. She once told me the reason they broke up is that after graduation she realized he had no drive and didn't want to end up with someone who couldn't put effort into their own life. Which honestly made sense because she works very hard (grad school and being an instructor, while working 40hr/week at another job, and a part time internship, while constantly visiting and helping her family across the state, and also still finding time to get really drunk.) They broke up 3 months before I met her. She didn't want to break up with me and so she actively tried to be rude and mean to me, to share our secrets with my friends, to start petty arguments with me, to talk about things that she knew would upset me; all to try and get me to break up with her. I didn't want to break up though, I wanted to fix it, and so we just dissolved.
When I came back a month later, her ex (now current boyfriend) had all but moved into that house. I still wanted to hang out with the only people i really consistently hung out with for years, and so I would still come over. But everytime i came over i would have to control myself in regards to them. It hurt so much, to watch this person that i wanted more than anything, be with and kiss another person. There were times I would come over and I could hear them having sex and I'd be like I need to leave right now sorry guys. For 8 months, I was broken. I thought about her literally every day. I cried all the time. My friendships were compromised because I no longer felt comfortable at that house and there's too many random people at my house all the time. I was depressed. My grades dropped and I considered moving back home. My professors were extremely kind and gave me a semester long extention to give in all my assignments (which is unheard of and I am so grateful to them, and ended up getting almost all A's). I couldn't even look at other girls for the better part of a year because I just couldnt imagine being with another person. 
In the late summer is when i met my current girlfriend Sandra(18f). We became good friends. She was very nice and seemed so calm and gentle. She was beautiful, with hazel eyes that turn green on sunny days. She was the purest thing in the world to me when we started dating. I actually waited several months to initiate anything because I wanted to become comfortable with myself and take things slow. I didn't ask her out until after I went back to school because I wanted to see if we could stand the long-distance thing. 

Our relationship was beautiful, and I came to love everything about Sandra. I became close with her family, and she with mine. We do everything together, and are constantly talking any time we're free. I would come visit every other weekend and every holiday, and every now and again she would visit for the day. Her mother is very strict and so she can't spend the night up here. We had great communication because I would try to be open with her about everything, out of fear of losing her or becoming out of touch with her. She knew all about my issues with my ex and completely agreed with my need to be open and honest. We have now been ""officially"" dating for a year and 2 months. 

Over time, we began to experience problems in our relationship in different ways. The main one is that I was feeling very unappreciated.  I feel like I was always the one calling her and making plans. She rarely ever would visit me up here, even though I offer to buy the ticket. She gets lazy about hanging out back home, and insists that most of the time I come over to her house. Then almost every time when I come over she tells me we have to do all this stuff for her parents and pets and friends (mostly chores, but literally all of it is stuff she can easily do during the week). She rarely says thank you for the effort i put into visiting (it's like 5 hours of travel one way and 200 dollars every time i visit). She also constantly begs me to ditch plans with friends and come visit her multiple weeks in a row, which I have done. I feel it's ridiculous because I spend my entire week working very hard and want to relax but then put in a lot of effort and pretty much all my money to come hang out with her, only to do laundry and clean pet cages for a whole weekend. She doesn’t go to college and barely works. Our sex life is a shadow of what it used to be. We used to have sex 3 times a day and now I feel lucky if we do once every 3 weeks. And even then it feels forced. 6 months ago I saw texts on her phone from a name I didn’t recognize. We know everything about each other so I was surprised she had a friend I didn’t know about. Well this guy who lives far away would be constantly flirting with her and even sent her pictures of his dick. She never called him out, as if he wasn’t doing anything, but she wouldn’t send back anything other than pictures of her face or what she was doing. I felt so betrayed because she knew it was wrong and deliberately tried to hide it to let it continue. She said she wouldn’t text him and then did anyway. We decided that she can talk to whoever she wants but if it becomes a shred more than platonic or if there’s “vibes” that she would stop talking to him and tell me immediately. 
The way I viewed my girlfriend changed so much after that, and I began to doubt my love for her. That’s when I began to notice all the things that make me feel unappreciated. I became resentful for it and more prone to argue about whether she even liked me anymore. She always says she does but nothing ever changes. We’ve talked so many times about what she can do to make me feel better but it’s like the conversations never happened the day after. She once asked me if we can “start over” and I didn’t know how to answer because her interpretation of start over meant we should pretend that she just didn’t hurt me, but she wouldn’t change anything to try and avoid a similar situation in the future. I’ve talked about taking a break with her and she gets very upset (understandably) and promises things that I know she won’t fulfill. 
I stayed this weekend to be able to relax and not stress myself because I have 3 exams coming up next week. I have come home for the past 9 weeks in a row. Just about all my friends went home this weekend though, so I decided to go to a bar on my own. I usually don’t go out at all but I was feeling trapped inside my place alone with no plans. After a few drinks I run into my ex Alice, and I felt comfortable enough to talk with her because it’s been so long. At a point in the conversation she tells me that she broke up with her boyfriend a month ago and then went in to kiss me. I could have stopped her. I could have turned my head or stepped aside or just said no. But I let her kiss me. And I kissed her back. It felt so good in the moment. I’m not putting any blame on the alcohol because I made the decision to let it happen. Nobody was at fault but me. I was upset at my girlfriend and lonely while the opportunity was there, and I became weak. But there is no excuse for what I’ve done. We had sex. And while we were doing it I found myself thinking of my girlfriend and couldn’t understand why I was doing this. I didn’t stop myself. I feel wrong and dirty. I feel weak in my will and character and that’s so unlike me. I’d do anything to take it back; to tell myself, “I don’t need this. No matter how much it feels to the contrary.” Out of my own fear and insecurity, I’ve subjected my partner to the very thing that caused these fears in me. I feel like it doesn’t matter that I was thinking about breaking up with my girlfriend anyway, and that this betrayal is not subject to any context. I hate myself. I feel like if I do end up breaking up with her now, it’ll be because I can’t move on from this, rather than the many reasons I’m actually upset with my relationship. But I wanted to give her more time to change, and now I think I’ve forced my own hand. I’m horrible. What if she does change? And then we’d be able to move forward but I’d ruin it with this. I don’t think we could move forward from what I’ve done. I don’t know what I’m seeking here, just advice I suppose. To be honest I just really wanted to get this off my chest because my girlfriend is who I tell everything to. She’s my best friend and it pains me that I even have something I can’t tell her.

Advice needed.,[deleted],askCSEducation,https://www.reddit.com/r/askCSEducation/comments/2lq3vc/how_to_manage_the_shit_show_of_web_devcomp_sci_as/," Basically, I need some real advice and how to spend my time for the next 2 years.  What do I focus on?

I am a Jr at a hippie liberal arts school where you design your own major.  You take classes from any discipline you like . I have a very interdisciplinary  major. It would be impossible to put a name on it. I have taken many courses related to processes of the continually changing social and cultural formations and their implications on people's lives.  I am studying the issue of US/Mexico border right now related to immigration.  

Another big interest is in technology. My major is basically combining the two. Using technology to solve social problems.   

I also lightly study computer science.
I first took an intro to web dev last semester and a class on the privacy in the internet. Now I am taking computer science courses at a top ranking partner university. Currently working with python. Next semester I will be taking another Comp/Sci course in Java, ""The object-oriented programming paradigm will be discussed in detail, including data abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism. Other topics will include linked lists and trees and the use of finite-state machines in algorithm design. "" As well as a Data Structures and Algorithm course.    This is gets me thinking.



I have also been working in web development for a solid 9 months and boy do I feel nauseated. I sat down for the first time today trying to learn bootstrap. What a bloated cluster fuck mess that is.   Making websites seems overcomplicated for something so miniscule. Do bootstrapped actually know how to code? The amount of time I am spending just trying to make a decent personal site on my own without using bootstrap- or coping one is sickening. I could better spend my time on research/practicing my Spanish.

My 4th year, I will be completing a major independent project. A piece of writing, scholarly research. A thesis. I have one year to work on one project in depth. Hopefully writing software to help a specific underprivileged population.  My school also just got a 1million dollar grant to invest in entrepreneurship ventures. They are forced(?) to spend 125,000$ each year. So far, friends of mine have received serious dough for some pretty non substation ideas.  Almost, handing it out. It's really great actually. 

On top of that.. I need to find an internship for the summer. Not related to anything with html/css. I need to stimulate my brain. Possibly writing software ? APIs? In a Spanish speaking country? (I've been studying Spanish for years and i need immersion. 


Do I waste more of my precious time trying to learn the full stack?  I was interested in writing software online but I feel like I can't deal anymore with the html/css/multiple devices/ boot strap/ server side/client side/ shitshow.   I'm wading through so much at this point.   I have a solid understanding of the larger picture. It's putting EVERYTHING together that's drowning me. 

I also need to think about grad school in the future.... my step uncle is a comp sci prof at one of the top 3 comp sci universities. JESUS CHRIST.   

 
Whats going for me?   weed is 10$/G  which I don't have time for anymore.  I also  have a prescription for extended release and instant adderall.  Which I don't take every day. Probably should.  Also, drive an Audi which I'm in love with.

And I have a girlfriend... 
And I'm involved in student government. Of which needs to be more transparent and centralized. I wanted to create an official website for this with many features to make us more transparent.  


What do I focus on? How do I balance it all?  I see myself writing software in the future. In what? idk where, i don't care. How do I land an internship? How do I keep my room clean?

2lqjt7,5,2014-11-08,Opportunities with top companies later in your career?,worriedCSmajor,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2lqjt7/opportunities_with_top_companies_later_in_your/,"Sorry for any mistakes. This is my first post. 

I'm currently a junior CS major at a top 20 university (which probably doesn't matter, just giving some background). Compared to my peers, I definitely still have much to learn and improve on in terms of coding, which I am teaching myself and practicing. I recently was offered an IT internship from a company which I wouldn't consider as the most known for tech/software but they are definitely top 5 in their industry. I accepted this internship as it seemed like a great opportunity for someone who was still learning, but now I am having doubts. 

I've always been told that the internship before your senior year was extremely important as it would most likely lead to your first graduate job, and set you on your career. Don't get me wrong this company seems like a great place to work, but my dream jobs are the top 4 as well as many of the companies in the Valley (Spotify, Yelp, Yahoo). I fear that if I were to stick with this company, I would have a more difficult time getting into dream jobs because I may not have learned the skills that someone who worked at a software focused company might. 

My question is: 
-What advice would you give for someone who may have started out at a company that might not teach as many skills in software development, but wants to chase a software development focused job later in their career? 
-What can I do on my own that will attract recruiters even if I might've come from a company less known for software? 
-Is this a reasonable fear that I have? Maybe my views are skewed because I'm reading about so many people getting these awesome internships on this subreddit.

Any and all advice would be appreciated. I want to know what my options are and how I can best approach building my career. "

Some context might be helpful:

* I'm currently at the end of my first year in an IT degree
* Have been programming / building projects during the year
* Managed to get an internship at a startup over the summer (Nov - Feb) doing backend web development
* Transferring into a CS program next year

I'm looking to take some MOOCs over the summer alongside my internship to catch up on the theory I've missed out on whilst in my IT degree.

What I currently have chosen is the following but I'd like to hear from some more experienced people as to what they'd do in my shoes.

* Mathematics for Computer Science - MIT
* Data Structures &amp; Algorithms CS61B - Berkley

I'm pretty sure I won't be able to handle more than 2 over the break, so I'm even more critical as to the choice.

Any help would be great, thanks.

2lqoil,3,2014-11-09,Will studying abroad fall semester of my senior year hold me back?,acchelp,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2lqoil/will_studying_abroad_fall_semester_of_my_senior/,"I have an internship for the state government for the spring. I went to the job fair this fall and spoke with some firms who were interested in internships for the summer. Well, it's been almost two weeks and I haven't gotten a call back. I had a recruiter that said to have me email him a week after if I still had not received a call (which I am still confused by -- if he was interested, wouldn't he have simply called me by now?). 

Anyway, my main reason for posting is that I plan on studying abroad next year during my senior year, which I know is the recruitment for most accounting firms and they usually have most of their interns chosen by thanksgiving. I have tried getting an internship with a firm this year, but honestly, I think my chances are pretty low since I have not gotten in contact with any of the recruiters since the job fair and they did not give me their contact information. I'm worried about next year since obviously I'll be abroad and not sure if I want to go grad school as I will have 145 hours by the time I graduate. "
2lqvb6,17,2014-11-09,"Anxiety, yo-yos, trains. I met a nerd fighter IRL.",suburiboy,nerdfighters,https://www.reddit.com/r/nerdfighters/comments/2lqvb6/anxiety_yoyos_trains_i_met_a_nerd_fighter_irl/,"I've kinda had a rough week on the mental health front, so I was thinking about a story from over the summer.  I try to be an optimist; I look for the bright side and try to get there if i can.

I have Social Anxiety Disorder. That means that social situations give me panic, and I avoid them to avoid the pain. I've even been in jail for my SAD; when a police officer pulled me over and I could not respond, he put me in jail for the night. I'm fairly high functioning, but it still is a fairly big problem. I've been to see doctors about drugs, but I've never started them, for fear of the side effects.

I'm a rising forth year at a large state university. This summer I've had a government internship, and it went fairly well. I learned a lot, and met a lot of really smart people. I've even (kind of) made some friends of the other interns. When I'm working closely with people for 10 weeks, by the end I'm probably comfortable with some of them enough to call them friends. That is pretty normal, I guess. That is how i make friends most of the time (classmates or friends of friends).


In late June, I noticed my sister playing with a toy yoyo, the kind that doesn't sleep. As a Physics major, I thought that there must be more to this... So I did some googling and some youtubing. I then got a metal yoyo and started learning some tricks.


One Thursday in July, I was staying in town late playing kickball with the other interns. I got onto the metro-train around 8, and it wasn't super crowded. The train had to stop for ""schedule adjustment"" and I did the obvious thing: I got out my yoyo and started practicing brain twister(that is how much of a noob I was/am). I got a loose bind, so one of my throws just dribbled out. The girl sitting across the train from me giggled a bit. A little embarrassed, I put my yoyo away.

...

I don't know what possessed me in that moment. I said to the girl ""looks like I can't even use a yoyo."" She retorted ""You were doing really well until you dropped it."" (totally sounds like the start of a really bad rom-com). We talked for the rest of the train ride. We talked about our internships, school, batman, and more, and I didn't feel anxious. She even laughed at my stupid jokes; she noticed my Superman shirt; she had nuanced opinions about ""Catcher in the Rye"".  As we got off the train, I said something about ""emergency bowties"" and she said something about ""classy zombies"". Once we were up the escalators, I waited for her after the turnstiles while she had some trouble with her fare-card. I knew that this was someone I wanted to be friends with. So I asked her if we could trade phone numbers, or Facebooks or something. She agreed to being Facebook friends.


The next day I sent her a message suggesting that we meet for lunch next week. She said, ""let's do Friday"". We traded phone numbers to make planning easier. That whole week I was shitting bricks. How could a ugly, fat, nervous wreck like me ask a girl like her to go to lunch with me? We met up, got sandwiches and walked around the park. My SAD never even mattered. This girl was exactly the kind I would want to meet. She was kind, generous, curious, and witty: everything I want, everything I'm not.  As we walked around the fountain we speculated as to what the statue might be.  She mentioned that she'd like the statue to have a dooblydoo... I'm not gonna lie here; I completely nerded out.  Like can't-control-your-excitement-nerding-out. When we said good bye, she said ""have a good life."" She had to go back west, and I'll never see her again. When I got back to the office, one of my coworkers revealed that he followed me and took pictures of the ""date."" Kinda creepy, But I'm glad that I have pictures...


In those moments, I felt ""normal."" I thought ""this must be how people without anxiety disorders feel."" In that moment, I felt like someone was finally treating me like a real person, not a freak to be kept at arms length. In a Goethe-esque sense, I wanted that moment to last forever (the condition under which Dr.Faust would be condemned). In that moment I felt okay... I felt happy...

I'm still trying to cope with SA.  I don't know how to make friends or meet people.  But maybe I'm a bit more optimistic now.


Thanks for reading...Thought yall might like it."

2lqzoe,1,2014-11-09,I[20 M] found out the woman [20 F] I love is pregnant with someones child. And I am struggling to move forward.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2lqzoe/i20_m_found_out_the_woman_20_f_i_love_is_pregnant/,"This is my first time in this sub so I hope I'm posting correctly. I'm not really sure what I'm looking for in posting this, I just need somewhere to vent.

I met Jess when I moved to AZ in middle school and I crushed from afar for a while, until my female cousin Bridgette moved here as well. Bridgette became friends with Jess and thats how I started talking to her initially. Throughout 8th grade I talked to J more as we sat next to each other in Math and my fondness grew until I asked my cousin if she knew who Jess liked. She told me she liked this guy Omar and I was crushed but moved on and stayed friends with Jess. The last week of 8th grade we had a school trip to a water park, and it rained the whole time. Jess' towel gets soaked and she asks to use mine which I left in a locker. So I get it and tell her she has to share with me. And she does, by sitting on my lap and wrapping the towel around both of us. So here I am talking to this beautiful girl on my lap just trying not to get a boner and creep her out.  We stay like this for a good while having a great conversation and bringing back those feelings. I tell her I am really struggling not to kiss her right now and she smiles and I get the courage to get kiss her. We make out a little bit and things quickly end when the math teacher sees us and separates us for the rest of the trip. 

Like I said that was the last week of 8th grade and I find out afterwards that we are going to different high schools. Bummer.

We decide to stay friends mostly keeping contact through home phones and online. I'd say she became my best friend freshman year; we would talk almost everyday about the good and bad in both of our lives and give each other advice. All was great until I got my first GF sophomore year. My GF was reasonably jealous of our closeness and we both agreed to cut down contact. In this same time period she gets a BF and we grew apart a bit. While we weren't talking as much we were still very much involved in helping each other when we were in despair. When her favorite uncle passed away, I was the first one she called and I consoled her over the phone the whole night. She did the same for me when my grandpa passed. The rest of high school was pretty much the same. When we both were single we talked a lot and when one of us had a significant other it simmered down. But we always helped each other through the big things like her ex stalking her or my brother becoming an addict.

Graduation Night. She comes to my ceremony and we hang out afterwards. We're both single at this point and after a long night of reminiscing we fool around a bit. We didn't get seriously involved though as we were again going to different schools. I got a scholarship to a state school and she was going to start in community college.  

We both were working part time as well as going to school. We didn't have time to really keep in contact outside of a few messages online as I didn't have a car and my school was 2 hours away. Things were like that throughout the first year and we didn't hang out again until the summer. I spent a month of the summer in My parents home country but when I came back we spent most of the remaining time together. We both agreed that the stress of school and work for both of us along with the distance was too much to make a relationship work. 

So school starts and again we get too busy to really keep in contact. The first semester ends and we hang out during christmas break for the last time. After the second semester starts she meets Axel, and they hit it off. Seemingly anytime I tried to contact her she was with him. I take the hint and back off thinking this would be like any other guy shes been with and wouldn't last. I was wrong. They make it official and enter a relationship in February.  I keep my distance and don't try and contact her again til the end of the semester. We catch up over the phone and I ask about her plans now that she has finished her associates degree. She says her boyfriend's mom is helping her get a job in her company. I make a remark about how she is still with said boyfriend and she notices my tone but changes topics and moves on. We didn't see each other at all this past summer as I had an internship and she spent most of her time with her boyfriend. 

We haven't kept in contact much outside of a few short messages online and then last week I see a picture of her ultrasound was posted online. I looked at it and just couldn't believe it. I stared at it for like 30 minutes and just sobbed a bit. I feel like a fool for thinking that someone wouldn't lock her up while we weren't together. I feel even stupider for not even trying the long distance relationship. We thought it would just lead to resentment but fuck it I'd rather be part of a failed relationship that tried then one that never even got to start.

Since I found out I've had some terrible thoughts.How I hope she has a miscarriage or that her man is actually an asshole and she'll leave him soon.  I've thought over and over again about telling her how I feel. How she should get an abortion and break up with her man to be with me. How I've known she's perfect for me. 

 But thats just selfish. If I was the one in a happy relationship with a child on the way I know the added confusion and stress isn't what I'd want. She didn't do anything wrong and I want her to be happy. From afar it looks like she is happy so I'm just going to keep my mouth shut and suffer in silence. 

I know I have to move on now. Even if they don't work out in the end I can't just wait for her to be single again. But its hard. I haven't been in a relationship since high school. Probably cause I was comparing every girl to her. I'm not sure what I expected by typing this out as it wasn't a question. And most of you are just going to tell me to move on. So hopefully this post let me just get all of my feelings out so that I can move forward.

*the 4 additional cards can be replaced by additional credits in your pool at 2 credits per card. You will need even more cards/credits if the runner has over 5 credits/link.

--Scoring Combo--

Requires: Accelerated Diagnostics, Power Shutdown, Shipment from MirrorMorph, Jackson Howard, 2 3-point agendas (or more Jackson Howards), and 10 credits.

1: Shipment from MirrorMorph: Install at least one Jackson Howard and 2 3-point agendas (or more Jackson Howards)

A bit about myself, 23, programmer. Student &amp; Part time job in programming. Been programming for about 10 years now etc. Here's the thing: I still love programming, I want to keep doing it.    

However, as of the last couple of years I've grown more fond South Korea. I've been learning the language for about 1.5 year maybe longer. I am focussing most if not all my attention towards the language, culture, friends or even internship / job opportunities there. I have been for 2-3 years now.    

In fact. I've been there for 2 holidays equaling to over 2 months in the country. I made lots of friends, experienced lots of great things and in fact managed to land internships with job guarantees if completed succesfully. (I didn't take it because I am still a student).

Now here is the thing: I have 1.5 year of school to wrap up. In total 3 half-year projects, I am working on my first now. And I can not get it done. I think it's a great project, it's engaging and potentially even has real world value. I would also not consider it too easy or boring. But I don't do it. Why?    

I have asked myself why quite a bit and all I can think of is: I'm scared to actually do it. Actually going to Korea, getting what I have been obsessing over for the last years. What if I don't like it? I have been so active about telling people my plans and dreams, fully convinced that it's the final goal.    

As I typed this out I'm now thinking: I still graduated... I guess. Any other things I'm overlooking?"

I have improved myself in a lot of spheres in my life that I didn't have time for due to collegiate obligations such as exercising and eating well. Last February I was 205lbs. :/ I'm happier right now than I ever was while enrolled full time as a student. 

I love to read. The last three books I read were Inside Scientology, Necromancer, and then the first two ASOIAF books (we'll count that as one). I also love to play hotseat Civ. And yes, I have been playiing Beyond Earth. 

Right now I just got back from an exercise and a run. Now I am cleaning my place, and doing homework in between that. What are you up to?"

Carroll School of Management dual majoring in Finance and information systems.  past summer I was an intern at a Middle Market investment bank working on aerospace, defense, and security Mergers and Acquisition deals, and I have my own investment portfolio up 18% YTD.  Now I tend to think I have a pretty good grasp on the market and I have to strongly disagree with your claim that the markets and unemployment are doing better than ever. firstly I will hit on unemployment because it is the easiest to disprove, while the actual unemployment number may be going down the labor participation rate is the lowest it has ever been since the great depression, essentially more and more people are dropping out of the labor market, the effective unemployment rate is more like 37%. secondly the market right now are artificially over inflated by about 10%-15% and will correct soon, obama has not done anything for the market except build a house of cards along with the fed. personally i cleared out my portfolio except energy stocks (GOP senate will cause a bull run in that) and in 1-2 weeks when it comes crashing down I will buy back in.  for reference i have included a labor graph and the DJIA with some indicators, look at the bottom graph on the DJIA,  thats called a full stochastic and when its over 80 it is a strong sell, currently at 99.66/100 which is a crazy sell off coming. last months mini crash only fell from 81...  sorry to bash but these are just my opinions.  http://imgur.com/a/dlmKO"

I do not have any work experience or prior internship experience in the CS/programming field.

I found a position in a small company that I applied to.  It's a .NET developer position and they're looking for someone with BS in Computer Science, at least 2 years of experience with desktop application development, familiarity with C# and WPF, as well as OOP and design patterns.  Pluses include understanding of threading and familiarity with SQL.

A little bit about myself around their preferences, I am proficient with C#.  My experience with WinForms/WPF are not excellent (in my assumption), but to a point where I know what they are and how to develop a basic application.  I've done team and personal projects in WinForm and WPF, but have not done anything more than dragging provided controls and giving them functionality.  I do have solid experience with SQL, but have not done any threading related programming.

I applied for the position and got an invitation for an on-site interview this week.  Knowing what they're looking for and what my experiences provide, should I be concerned about not being a good enough candidate?  How can I prepare myself for the interview, in terms of technical questions relating to C# and .NET?  What about you .NET developers?  What is your experience in the position at the job?  Is there more to using a designer to drag controls onto a window and providing them a functionality?  "
2ls646,197,2014-11-09,"I befriended a disabled kid and now I sort of hate him, but I can't tell anyone about it because he's disabled and everyone would assume I hate him because he's disabled.",captainwednesday,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2ls646/i_befriended_a_disabled_kid_and_now_i_sort_of/,"I am returning from a convention with my school and really need to get this off my chest before I explode. 

A bit of background on the kid, who we'll call C: C has a brain injury that affected his motor controls and writing skills, nothing else personality or empathy-wise. C is in a wheelchair, but can walk for short distances. C is also my editor for the school broadcast program. 

I volunteered to cart him and his wheelchair around for this entire trip and have not received a single thank you. He is extremely rude and self centered, to the point where he actually told a a total stranger off for not moving out of the way (in a completely packed metro) for him. In another instance, the group was walking around and singing and dancing and he told another complete stranger that had joined in that he was a) too smart for them and b) that he was a better dancer. He only talks about four things: Agriculture, Horses, his girlfriend or his ex-boyfriend, and college.

Speaking of his girlfriend, she's in college. He's a senior. He's planning on proposing next week. They've been together for 6 months. She is a whole different brand of insane that I won't get in to, but I've basically had to play therapist for their relationship since day one. He refused to cut ties with his ex-boyfriend for a while and now complains because ex-boyfriend keeps calling him. 

C is also a complete asshole to his staff. He refuses to accept suggestions, because he views it as help. Speaking of which, he views the world as him against literally everyone else. Any help is pity. If you so much as try to assist him with something like opening a door, he'll tell you off for assuming a disabled kid can't do it himself, WHICH HE FUCKING CAN'T. 

He truly and sincerely believes he is the smartest person in the room, always. At the convention, he tried correcting the fucking keynote speaker. He was wrong. Proceeded to grumble about how in x situation, he would be right.

C also inserts himself into every single conversion anyone has, ever. This kid will not let a moment pass when you are unaware of his presence. Oh, you're talking about the time you went horseback riding? Lemme tell you about my farm in the middle of your conversion. Have you ever heard the time my horse did that really funny thing? Let's talk about it for 30 minutes. 

C also won't go a single day without mentioning how he feels like a burden to everyone around him. Well C, you are. But not because you're disabled. You're an emotional burden because of the way you treat other people. 

The last thing he does is the biggie. He constantly devalues your choices. He will ask you, for example, what you're planning to major in. As soon as you answer, he will go through a series of reasons why that's a horrible choice. I'm planning on majoring in biotechnology. He has not stopped bringing up that I'll be working SO MANY internships for SO LITTLE money. 

C, you are majoring in Equine Education because you couldn't get in to the vet school. Grow the fuck up. The world is not against you. 

I want to take this time to say that I consider myself a nice person and I have nothing against anyone with disabilities, it's just that this kid is such a dick and I had to tell someone about it. I have tried for a year and a half to be nice to him and to take his situation into account, but all of this has been boiling under the surface for that year and a half. I want to clearly state that I am not angry because he's disabled, I'm angry because he's an asshole.

And he looks at my phone, reads my texts, swipes when I show him a picture.  

TLDR: Disabled kid believes the world owes him something, and I can't fucking deal with this drama anymore.

Edit: Thank you to all who've given me advice. I'd just like to make a few more things clearer: 

* He's my editor for a class, like the school newspaper. I report to him for basically my grade. For this reason, I can't just cut contact and I can't be totally abrasive towards him. I don't really see him outside of this class, and the frustration recently is coming from a school field trip we went on.

* We're actually okay-ish friends. He can be cool sometimes. It's just that the horribly self-centered and rude times start to weigh on me.

* Finally, we're both in high school.

Again thank you to all and I'm quite honestly overwhelmed by the atmosphere here.

Edit 2: I really suck at phrasing. C doesn't hold control over my grade, but I have to report to him in order to earn a good grade. Teamwork is part of the gig. 

Bottom line is that sometimes, there's going to be people that you gotta work with. C is one of them. Thank you all again for your advice!"

As the title suggest I'm a 22 year old Canadian male who's currently in his 3rd year of computer science (Bachelors), this summer and fall I had the opportunity to have a COOP/internship in my home city as software developer. It is a great experience, however, I feel as though something is lacking.

I really enjoy travelling, experiencing new cultures, and meeting new people. I have travelled/volunteered abroad in the past summers but this summer, like I stated, I stayed in Canada to do my internship. I'm now looking to have the opportunity to find a paid internship for the summer of 2015 abroad, preferably Europe (but I am also interested in Middle Eastern Gulf countries or select South East Asian countries).

I'm essentially trying to kill two birds with one stone: Get to experience all that I listed above abroad while also working professionally.

I'm looking for ideas, suggestions, and any thoughts related to my goal.

If needed I can go more into myself as well as my relevant experience. Language wise, I'm fluent in English and proficient in Arabic and Russian.

Thank you."

I've been with this girl for about six months but we've been entertaining the idea of a relationship for the past several years. We're about six hours apart and so far we've had no issues with the distance. Lately we've been talking about moving in, closing the distance, etc. Currently we both live with our parents.                            

The issue that constantly comes up is that the places she picks out to potentially live (our budget is $550-950 per month for a one room apartment, I can get a better job in the city and can probably afford more on the higher end of that) are either scummy violent areas or just in the middle of nowhere. I can't tell if she's doing this on purpose or she legitimately doesn't know. It's not about saving money, because these places cost the same as the kinds of places I've been sending her and have about the same amount of space and perks.                       

I've tried explaining to her that if we move to an area closer to a major city I'll be able to find work and therefore afford more. I've also tried explaining that my main goal right now is continuing my education so I can find better work in the future, and that it will be much easier to do that in a city. Also, financial aid can help pay rent and I've been looking into areas where students are placed into paid internship programs.                                

Halfway to humor her and halfway because I was serious, I showed her some cheap apartment listings from a small rural town closer to where she lives, where I have some friends who offered me a job, even thought it wasn't in a city and I wouldn't be able to return to school there for several years. She declined, and sent me a few more pictures of listings from small fishing villages and steel mills with bars on the windows. She says I can find work anywhere if I put my mind to it because she always has, but I'm a programmer (mostly embedded C and evolutionary computation) with no people skills whatsoever.                              

Do you think this is a personal preference or is she doing this to spite me in some way? I've asked her if there's a particular reason she prefers these areas and she doesn't know. I don't think she wants to live in an area where I have friends because she wants us both to start fresh, but that's just speculation.                     

Edit: This isn't a huge deal, but we've talked about wanting some kind of place before June, and while we've never had a legitimate argument about it, most of the discussion comes back to her being upset that $900 is ""ridiculously high"" when it's somewhere she wants to live but ""totally fine"" when it's somewhere I want to live, and what it comes down to is that I just can't afford that kind of monthly expense if I'm not going to be either in school or closer to a financial district.

What about your favorite compliments?,[deleted],AsianBeauty,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2lsb9o/ab_is_working_ive_received_two_compliments_in_the/,"I'm just so excited! I started at SCA, which is great in all, but I feel like AB is the one that made the difference. Although I've always been a sunscreen person, before I was barely even washing my face *shudder* My excuse was, 'I only have hormonal acne, its fineee.' So as a result, my face didn't look bad, but it also didn't look amazing...

With the help of BHA/AHA, essences, snails, etc. I feel like I look so much better. The other day I was at my internship (everyone there 18-20) and one of the kids asked me if I was in school. I laughed and said ""Nooo, I'm 25, I haven't been in school for awhile"" and she was amazed and said I didn't look that old. Wooo! I never really thought I looked my age, but I also never had someone agree until now.

Yesterday, my mom came to visit and saw my vast routine and was wondering what it all was. The look on her face when I said, ""It's because I put snail mucus on my face"" was pretty priceless. I explained to her the routine and how its important to have different products to target specific things, etc. And she said that my face did look awesome and that it just 'looked brighter and healthier' And you know moms, they're the first once to tell you when you look bad. I even gave her a MBD Black Pearl Mask in hope of converting her. The funny thing is, she told me she used to put this cream on her face that had placenta in it o.0..I said I don't know if I could go that far. But hey, guess weird stuff on the face runs in the family.

What about you guys? What have been the best compliments? 

EDIT: More just tected me ""Tried the face mask...I want more lol'
Woo, I've converted her!

It wasn't the game that he loved — it was winning.

&amp;nbsp;

Ever wanted to be a Challenger player, a pro player, or a high-profile soloQ streamer? Well, this is your chance .. kinda.


Hi everyone! My name is Aureline. I am a screenwriting post-grad who currently works in online eSports production. The past few months, I have been hard at work writing ""Strange Clouds"" [working title], a story about brothers Aiden and Noah Londale and their journey navigating the powerhouse culture of LoL's pro scene. 



I am proud to say I am at a place where I can share my vision. The story and its characters are really shaping up. What I want to communicate specifically in this post is my need for Summoner names! 


 So far I've been coming up with my own Summoner names for the principle cast, but I'd really like to get some from you guys for the other teams and players in this world. If I can use your name, please just leave a comment below. 


Additionally, if anyone with experience as a player at a live event (LCS, MLG, etc) or as a streamer with a high following would be willing to answer some questions to help me build out this world, I would really appreciate it. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 
&gt; The brothers had grown up playing air-soft and paintball in the woods behind their house until a stray round broke a neighbor's window. Ever since then, their mother mandated that they would have to head to the indoor arena in town if they wanted to play. Since Aiden had come home for the summer, he and Noah had gone once or twice. Tonight was one such night.  
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; Currently, Aiden and Noah were bunked down behind a blown-up multicolored triangle the size of a truck.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; ""So what was it, Aids?"" Noah drawled in his mocking tone. ""Something like a *three-hundred percent* placement rate if you get an internship with this company?""
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; ""Shut it,"" Aiden poked his head out from cover, squeezing off a few rounds.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; ""Qualifiers are next month. If you actually — "" Noah pulled his head back just in time; a few paintballs whizzed by. "" — If you actually ground it out, you could get to diamond no problem.""
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ""I won't have time, once I get the internship,"" Aiden gritted his teeth. He caught his brother's eye, and jerked his head towards a multi-colored blowup tetris block to their left, and up a ways. Noah nodded.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; Aiden tucked and rolled, keeping himself low, fast, and small. With Noah providing cover fire, Aiden made it to their new location. He beckoned for his brother to come, then. Noah made it over in a hail of paint. His larger older brother practically smashed into him; Noah was not great at finesse.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; ""Roster lock is next week. We need an AD carry. We need YOU!"" Noah pressed the issue.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; ""You don't actually need me — "" Aiden hissed and drew back. ""You just want to piss dad off.""
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; *Thwak*. Aiden gave a yell, feeling the hot sting of a paintball striking his shoulder blade. Noah laughed, then cursed as he was picked off as well.  
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; As the brothers walked off the field, Noah elbowed Aiden in the side. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; ""Why can't it be both?"" 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; Later that week, Aiden saw the mail truck pull away from the house. He flew to the entryway, stuffed his feet into a pair of shoes, and shuffled down their long driveway to the mailbox. He had a feeling. He had an inkling. He opened the mailbox, and sure enough, there was a long, thin envelope stamped with MIT red. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; Aiden glanced up at the house. He folded and stuffed the letter into his back pocket. He walked back to the house, blood pounding in his ears. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; The boys' father, Randy Londale, was in the kitchen, drinking a cup of coffee with his iPad. He looked up expectantly as Aiden entered the kitchen. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; ""Anything?"" he asked. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; ""No,"" replied Aiden, stone-faced. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; Randy grunted, and looked back down at his table. ""I'm going to call the school tomorrow. This is ridiculous."" 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; ""Dad .. "" Aiden leaned his body to the side, trying to come across as casual. ""Would it be such a big deal if I didn't get that internship?"" 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; Randy looked up at his younger son, and frowned. ""You worked hard in school. You deserve this."" 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; ""I know. But would it be so bad to take a summer off? Noah and I have never really had a chance to hang out like this."" 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; ""I'm glad you mentioned that,"" Dad lowered his coffee cup with a thunk, and Aiden realized he was going to regret starting this conversation. ""Aiden, you know your mother and I want you to pursue whatever it is that makes you happy. But we're growing concerned about the gaming. We don't want it to consume your life."" 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; *Like Noah*. Those were the unspoken words. Aiden felt a madness come over him. Dad went on. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; ""We've been going easy on Noah, and I regret that. Your mother and I were so focused on you and your education that we've let him slide into this .. state that he's in,"" Dad hesitated. Aiden breathed slowly through his nose. ""When you get your internship and go back to school, we're going to ask Noah to find another place to live."" 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; ""What?"" Aiden said sharply. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; ""He's twenty-two years old. He needs a reality check."" 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; ""Dad, Noah gets thirty-thousand viewers on his stream. Every single night. That's something."" 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; ""It isn't easy for me to do this,"" Randy said. ""Aiden? *Aiden*!"" 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; Aiden left the kitchen. He marched directly downstairs, and into his brother's room. Noah was scooched up close to his screen, clicking madly. A teamfight was blowing out in river in front of dragon. On the other monitor, Aiden saw the white and gathered windows of OBS and Twitter. *He's streaming*, Aiden thought dimly. *Everyone can see me.*
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; ""Noah,"" Aiden called. He felt like he was in a daze. ""NOAH."" 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; The gray death screen came up for Noah. Startled, the elder Londale turned, and pulled his headset off, turning his palms up in the universal ""what?"" expression. 
&gt;
&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; That same madness took Aiden over again. He reached into his pocket, and pulled out the letter from MIT. He dropped it to the floor, and stared his brother in the eye. 
&gt; 
&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&gt;
&gt;""I'm in,"" he said, and Noah's look of confusion turned into a broad smile. "
2lse6g,0,2014-11-09,Today the Church Commemorates: Saint Nectarius the Wonder-Worker of Pentapolis,dolphins3,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/2lse6g/today_the_church_commemorates_saint_nectarius_the/,"Today we commemorate a modern Saint! [Saint Nectarius](http://oca.org/saints/lives/2014/11/09/103251-st-nectarius-kephalas-the-metropolitan-of-pentapolis), who was graced by God with the working of miracles, was bishop of Pentapolis in the 19th century!

&gt;Saint Nectarius, the great wonderworker of modern times, was born Anastasius Kephalas in Selebria, Thrace on October 1, 1846.
&gt; 
&gt; Since his family was poor, Anastasius went to Constantinople when he was fourteen in order to find work. Although he had no money, he asked the captain of a boat to take him. The captain told him to take a walk and then come back. Anastasius understood, and sadly walked away.
&gt; 
&gt; The captain gave the order to start the engines, but nothing happened. After several unsuccessful attempts, he looked up into the eyes of Anastasius who stood on the dock. Taking pity on the boy, the captain told him to come aboard. Immediately, the engines started and the boat began to move.
&gt; 
&gt; Anastasius found a job with a tobacco merchant in Constantinople, who did not pay him very much. In his desire to share useful information with others, Anastasius wrote down short maxims from spiritual books on the paper bags and packages of the tobacco shop. The customers would read them out of curiosity, and might perhaps derive some benefit from them.
&gt; 
&gt; The boy went about barefoot and in ragged clothing, but he trusted in God. Seeing that the merchant received many letters, Anastasius also wanted to write a letter. To whom could he write? Not to his parents, because there were no mail deliveries to his village. Not to his friends, because he had none. Therefore, he decided to write to Christ to tell Him of his needs.
&gt; 
&gt; “My little Christ,” he wrote. “I do not have an apron or shoes. You send them to me. You know how much I love you.”
&gt; 
&gt; Anastasius sealed the letter and wrote on the outside: “To the Lord Jesus Christ in Heaven.” On his way to mail the letter, he ran into the man who owned a shop opposite the one in which he worked. The man asked him where he was going, and Anastasius whispered something in reply. Seeing the letter in his hands, the man offered to mail it for him, since he was on his way to the post office.
&gt; 
&gt; The merchant put the letter in his pocket and assured Anastasius that he would mail it with his own letters. The boy returned to the tobacco shop, filled with happiness. When he took the letter from his pocket to mail it, the merchant happened to notice the address. Astonished and curious, the man could not resist opening the letter to read it. Touched by the boy’s simple faith, the merchant placed some money in an envelope and sent it to him anonymously. Anastasius was filled with joy, and he gave thanks to God.
&gt; 
&gt; A few days later, seeing Anastasius dressed somewhat better than usual, his employer thought he had stolen money from him and began to beat him. Anastasius cried out, “I have never stolen anything. My little Christ sent me the money.”
&gt; 
&gt; Hearing the commotion, the other merchant came and took the tobacco seller aside and explained the situation to him.
&gt; 
&gt; When he was still a young man, Anastasius made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. During the voyage, the ship was in danger of sinking in a storm. Anastasius looked at the raging sea, and then at the captain. He went and stood beside the captain and took the helm, praying for God to save them. Then he took off the cross his grandmother had given him (containing a piece of the Cross of Christ) and tied it to his belt. Leaning over the side, he dipped the cross into the water three times and commanded the sea, “Silence! Be still.” At once, the wind died down and the sea became calm.
&gt; 
&gt; Anastasius was saddened, however, because his cross had fallen into the sea and was lost. As the boat sailed on, sounds of knocking seemed to come from the hull below the water line. When the ship docked, the young man got off and started to walk away.
&gt; 
&gt; Suddenly, the captain began shouting, “Kephalas, Kephalas, come back here.” The captain had ordered some men into a small boat to examine the hull in order to discover the source of the knocking, and they discovered the cross stuck to the hull. Anastasius was elated to receive his “Treasure,” and always wore it from that time forward. There is a photograph taken many years later, showing the saint in his monastic skufia. The cross is clearly visible in the photo.
&gt; 
&gt; On November 7, 1875, Anastasius received monastic tonsure at the Nea Moni Monastery on Chios, and the new name Lazarus. Two years later, he was ordained a deacon. On that occasion, his name was changed to Nectarius.
&gt; 
&gt; Later, when he was a priest, Fr Nectarius left Chios and went to Egypt. There he was elected Metropolitan of Pentapolis. Some of his colleagues became jealous of him because of his great virtues, because of his inspiring sermons, and because of everything else which distinguished St Nectarius from them.
&gt; 
&gt; Other Metropolitans and bishops of the Patriarchate of Alexandria became filled with malice toward the saint, so they told Patriarch Sophronius that Nectarius was plotting to become patriarch himself. They told the patriarch that the Metropolitan of Pentapolis merely made an outward show of piety in order to win favor with the people. So the patriarch and his synod removed St Nectarius from his See. Patriarch Sophronius wrote an ambiguous letter of suspension which provoked scandal and speculation about the true reasons for the saint’s removal from his position.
&gt; 
&gt; St Nectarius was not deposed from his rank, however. He was still allowed to function as a bishop. If anyone invited him to perform a wedding or a baptism he could do so, as long as he obtained permission from the local bishop.
&gt; 
&gt; St Nectarius bore his trials with great patience, but those who loved him began to demand to know why he had been removed. Seeing that this was causing a disturbance in the Church of Alexandria, he decided to go to Greece. He arrived in Athens to find that false rumors about him had already reached that city. His letter of suspension said only that he had been removed “for reasons known to the Patriarchate,” and so all the slanders about him were believed.
&gt; 
&gt; Since the state and ecclesiastical authorities would not give him a position, the former Metropolitan was left with no means of support, and no place to live. Every day he went to the Minister of Religion asking for assistance. They soon tired of him and began to mistreat him.
&gt; 
&gt; One day, as he was leaving the Minister’s office, St Nectarius met a friend whom he had known in Egypt. Surprised to find the beloved bishop in such a condition, the man spoke to the Minister of Religion and Education and asked that something be found for him. So, St Nectarius was appointed to be a humble preacher in the diocese of Vitineia and Euboea. The saint did not regard this as humiliating for him, even though a simple monk could have filled that position. He went to Euboea to preach in the churches, eagerly embracing his duties.
&gt; 
&gt; Yet even here, the rumors of scandal followed him. Sometimes, while he was preaching, people began to laugh and whisper. Therefore, the blameless one resigned his position and returned to Athens. By then some people had begun to realize that the rumors were untrue, because they saw nothing in his life or conversation to suggest that he was guilty of anything. With their help and influence, St Nectarius was appointed Director of the Rizarios Seminary in Athens on March 8, 1894. He was to remain in that position until December of 1908.
&gt; 
&gt; The saint celebrated the services in the seminary church, taught the students, and wrote several edifying and useful books. Since he was a quiet man, St Nectarius did not care for the noise and bustle of Athens. He wanted to retire somewhere where he could pray. On the island of Aegina he found an abandoned monastery dedicated to the Holy Trinity, which he began to repair with his own hands.
&gt; 
&gt; He gathered a community of nuns, appointing the blind nun Xenia as abbess, while he himself served as Father Confessor. Since he had a gift for spiritual direction, many people came to Aegina to confess to him. Eventually, the community grew to thirty nuns. He used to tell them, “I am building a lighthouse for you, and God shall put a light in it that will shine forth to the world. Many will see this light and come to Aegina.” They did not understand what he was telling them, that he himself would be that beacon, and that people would come there to venerate his holy relics.
&gt; 
&gt; On September 20, 1920 the nun Euphemia brought an old man in black robes, who was obviously in pain, to the Aretaieion Hospital in Athens. This was a state hospital for the poor. The intern asked the nun for information about the patient.
&gt; 
&gt; “Is he a monk?” he asked.
&gt; 
&gt; “No, he is a bishop.”
&gt; 
&gt; The intern laughed and said, “Stop joking and tell me his name, Mother, so that I can enter it in the register.”
&gt; 
&gt; “He is indeed a bishop, my child. He is the Most Reverend Metropolitan of Pentapolis.”
&gt; 
&gt; The intern muttered, “For the first time in my life I see a bishop without a panagia or cross, and more significantly, without money.”
&gt; 
&gt; Then the nun showed the saint’s credentials to the astonished intern who then admitted him. For two months St Nectarius suffered from a disease of the bladder. At ten thirty on the evening of November 8, 1920, he surrendered his holy soul to God. He died in peace at the age of seventy-four.
&gt; 
&gt; In the bed next to St Nectarius was a man who was paralyzed. As soon as the saint had breathed his last, the nurse and the nun who sat with him began to dress him in clean clothing to prepare him for burial at Aegina. They removed his sweater and placed it on the paralyzed man’s bed. Immediately, the paralytic got up from his bed, glorifying God.
&gt; 
&gt; St Nectarius was buried at the Holy Trinity Monastery on Aegina. Several years later, his grave was opened to remove his bones (as is the custom in Greece). His body was found whole and incorrupt, as if he had been buried that very day.
&gt; 
&gt; Word was sent to the Archbishop of Athens, who came to see the relics for himself. Archbishop Chrysostomos told the nuns to leave them out in the sun for a few days, then to rebury them so that they would decay. A month or two after this, they opened the grave again and found the saint incorrupt. Then the relics were placed in a marble sarcophagus.
&gt; 
&gt; Several years later, the holy relics dissolved, leaving only the bones. The saint’s head was placed in a bishop’s mitre, and the top was opened to allow people to kiss his head.
&gt; 
&gt; St Nectarius was glorified by God, since his whole life was a continuous doxology to the Lord. Both during his life and after his death, St Nectarius has performed thousands of miracles, especially for those suffering from cancer. There are more churches dedicated to St Nectarius than to any other modern Orthodox saint.

2lsw99,3,2014-11-09,I have no idea what I want to do with my life.,[deleted],careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/2lsw99/i_have_no_idea_what_i_want_to_do_with_my_life/,"I could use some advice. I'm a 22 year old American community college student. I began attending after highschool, just because I had no idea what I really wanted to do. I still don't know, and as a result this is the beginning of my 4th year here, which is longer than a typical CC career.

After a while I kind of thought ""engineering is lucrative and pretty cool. Why not engineering?"" I had changed my mind about a specific major a shit ton of times. Everything from biomedical to industrial engineering...and changing my mind back again, but always with the end means of ""I want to apply this form of engineering to work on environmental sustainability from an industrial standpoint"". But honestly, as I look around...it seems like this is not a major job market for engineers, and it seems like my ambitions are doomed.

Medicine also sounds cool...scientific, helping people, an interesting career and field of study..but the problem is it's a HUGE investment of time to make, and a huge setback if it winds up not being particularly interesting to me, ya know? Undergrad, then med school, then residency, then any specialty training that's desired...and the overbearing debt that would accumulate from med school. And I'm not sure if I've boned myself for med school since I'm not a traditional student.

Climate science research is another area which interests me...but it's a pretty niche area with threats to cut it's research looming overhead, and overall a less lucrative field.

and then I've tossed around the ideas of learning some type of trade or joining the military...but at that point it seems like I'm giving up. Neither of which are bad opportunities...but I just don't know if they are ""me"".

I don't really have any firsthand experience regarding any of these...visits to the doctor's office and short conversations with a couple of engineers is really the most I have. And unfortunately my family and I don't have some massive network of successful friends and family...so making a quick phone call to get a job or internship in some of these areas it pretty null.

Plenty of things are interesting enough, but how can someone know if it's really right for them unless they have the experience to do it?"

Mainly, I'd like some confirmation that I'd not be off the mark wearing a pair of dark jeans, a plain button-down, and a pair of black leather shoes. Is this too casual? Not casual enough? (My last internship, I interviewed over skype and if I recall was wearing a black t-shirt).

2lth1q,3,2014-11-09,The Night Watchman,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2lth1q/the_night_watchman/,"This is a story from way back when I was in graduate school in Nashville. I wasn't one of the fortunate few that got a funded research admission and so I always found myself searching for local part-time opportunities. These were neatly pipelined with other structured internships and life was good for the most part. I lived in a small studio apartment and managed to starve myself into a savings account. The slew of friends around me in class gave me good company, inviting me to movie nights and the odd hiking trips. 

Not every job I worked at was great, obviously. Some paid less than others and some had the worst managers. The deceptive world of sales got me convincing old folks into buying overpriced cameras they never needed. Aside from the guilt I caught myself with, I also couldn't really find time during the day to work at remote consumer electronics stores. I was getting more involved in research around my second year and I primarily lived off of free food that was offered during featured seminars and other meetings on campus. So after a good deal of thought, I realized that I needed to find a part-time overnight job. I wasn't sleeping much as a graduate student and so I might as well get paid for it, right? 

The next morning, I looked through entries on craigslist and found one that said ""Part Time Over Night Weekend Guard Job (Nashville)"" that paid around 15 dollars an hour. Although I was hoping for a longer lasting job, this sounded like a good catch because I wasn't required to carry arms and I'd be getting nearly 400 dollars for just sitting around at night. Hoping to not lose my spot, I immediately replied to the post giving my name, age and phone number. Around lunch time that day, I got a lazy text message saying ""Meet me at 6pm today. brik building by the bus station"". 

Downtown, Nashville is a famously serene place compared to other downtown areas in the United States. Atleast this is the impression I got from mates who used to live there. Excited, I packed up some food and took the bus from campus, reaching just before sunset. I found the apartment building I was looking for, though there was no sign of activity and the front gate was padlocked. It was a humble red brick building that would've probably housed under 10 families. I waited by the stairs, eager to get started. After all, I wanted every dollar I could get. 

Seemingly an hour later, a withered old lady slowly walked up the road to find me drowning in the well of boredom. ""Are ya here for the job?"" she said, almost begging for a response. ""Yeah. What's up with this place?"" I said, trying to hide my anger. Clearly the place was dead and nobody was around. There must have been some reason for ""guarding"" it?. She unlocked the door and pushed her way in. I followed her with patience. 

The hallway in the first floor seemed cramped. A dusty reception desk stood beside a single dark elevator on the left and a rustic staircase directly in front of me. A locked door presented itself next to a row of mail boxes on the right. ""This is your room"", she said, struggling to open it. 

""There was a bad fire accident here a few weeks back. Some kitchen on the second floor. They closed down this place and the people here left. One guy on the third floor said he'd come by this weekend. William...um... Davis! William Davis. His stuff's still around I think. He hasn't been in Nashville this year. Gone to Germany or France or somethin... You gotta wait around for him... Help him move if ya like"", she smirked. 

Fetching a torchlight from her bag, she walked into the dark room. I followed her quiety, reminding myself ""Two nights. 360 dollars"". She opened a creaky wooden cupboard on the far corner to find some clothing. She found me a dark blue shirt, a damaged ID tag, a flashlight and some gloves. Handing me a pair of sealed battery packs, she said ""Use em on that lamp.. You got a book or somethin you could read?"". I nodded, showing her the enthusiasm of a chronically bored cat. Ostensibly drained by all this, she started walking to the front door. Turning one last time, she handed me a spare set of keys and said, ""I'll see ya tomorrow mornin. Oh and... there's a...mart few blocks down the road I think.. If you wanna eat somethin.. Alright.."".

Left alone, I felt an amalgam of emotions. Just thinking about the reception I got made me livid. She made me wait for more than an hour and didn't even ask for my name. ""Well... If you don't like it, leave tomorrow morning and you're still a good 200 dollars better than today"", I said out loud. I switched on the desk lamp and positioned myself slowly on the weakly cushioned chair. I pulled out my phone and noticed a fading, crumbling screen looking back at me. I had no confidence that my phone would last the night with only 24% charge remaining.  

The cluttered room was dark and the heat from the lamp kept me warm. Within minutes, my eyes adjusted to the blackness. The sharp corners of the surrounding furniture grabbed my attention. The broad window sill to my left hosted a conference of files, clips and dead plants. The dirty, smudged glass functioned as a portal to the bustling streets of downtown. ""The night's still young"" I thought. Bathing in the tranquility of solitude, I realized the tiredness in my legs. I pulled out my copy of ""Mistborn: The Final Empire"" and slowly settled down, heaving a sigh of fatigue.

""I need a girlfriend.."", I thought to myself. It was almost 1 AM and my depression was setting in. This always happened when I read books. Characters in the fictional world made me both jealous and sad. Misery loves company and I certainly felt miserable. My friends in grad school were mostly engaged or married and here my life felt like a string of pointless jobs. As I lay there contemplating, an indescribable stench presented itself, almost extolling my train of thought. It was as though my brain couldn't decide if it wanted a commanding sneeze or a nauseating vomit, but I immediately stood up and ran to the door. 

I brashly pushed the flimsy door open, coughing my way out. There was a man standing in front of me, aghast. He was a strapping middle-aged guy, easily 6 feet tall, wearing a brown leather jacket. 

""Ugh.. um... Hi?"", I said, filling the air with confusion. 

""..... Hey... Are you the security.. guard?"", he said. 

""Yeah! Are you... Mr. Davis?"", I said, breathing heavily. 

He nodded firmly. ""so.. Mrs. Colton told you about me? I'm here to get my stuff. I've parked my truck down the road"", he said. 

After a rigid handshake, ""Give me a sec.. this place stinks.."", I said. I walked up to the door and slightly opened it. The repugnant stench was hardly noticeable. Surprised, I turned around and beckoned him to enter. He followed me into the security room. I handed him a flashlight and I picked up the lamp. ""We don't have any electricity here. We've got to use the stairs"", I said, wearing my gloves. 

""That shouldn't be a problem. I only live in the second floor"", he declared. 

""Second Floor?"", I speculated, reviving my memories. ""Alright. Let's go"".

We walked up the apparently archaic staircase. Every step caused an intense creak, squeak and groan. Grating dust filled the air and William let out a jarring sneeze. I could swear he shook the whole building. A few steps later, I was startled by a very distinct and clear *thump* coming from directly above. This was followed soon after by another, much louder *THUMP*. I looked back at William with complete shock. His face was pale. I could hear my heart beating. 

*THUMP*.... *THUMP*... *THUMP*.... *THUD THUD THUD THUD*

Both of us ran back down the stairs, shaking with terror. ""Hello?"", I yelled. The crashing sounds escalated. Both Will and I were pointing our lights at the staircase, breathing heavily. It felt like every *thud* resonated with my thrashing heart. With a sudden crash, a large sofa chair slid down and landed on the side of the stairs. I shrieked with panic and jumped backwards. The crash landing caused a violent dispersion of dust. ""God... Dammit!"", Will cried with annoyance. 

I took a few steps back and tried to calm my senses. I was completely befuddled by the large piece of furniture that fell down the stairs. We waited for the dust to settle. It was almost another 30 minutes before I stopped shaking. I looked at my watch and then at Will. He nodded at me and we decided to walk up. It was getting late and neither of us wanted to be there. We walked up the stairs, one step at a time and reached the second floor. There were 4 doors in front of us. Two to the right and two to the left. ""Which one's yours?"", I asked. ""The last one of the right"", he said. The air on the second floor was oppressively muggy compared to the floor below. 

We walked swiftly to the end of the hallway. The white door on the right had a rusty badge. ""Apartment 204"", I said. Will pulled out his keychain and fiddled around until he found the right key. He opened the large door, revealing a wide living room. We walked in together, scanning the surroundings. I was growing flustered by the smell emanating from the room. ""Let's see what we can take"", Will stated. I walked up to the end of the living room and pulled up the blinds. I was able to see the empty road below. ""Freedom... soon.."", I thought, trying to stay calm. There were a few assorted sofa chairs next to us, all facing a television. A vaccuum cleaner, an ironing board and a shoe stand on the far corner. 

Will walked past the kitchen and into the bedroom. A few seconds later, ""Hah.. I might need two trips.. This mattress still looks good"", he said. I followed his voice and walked in, finding Will staring at a single large king-sized bed. There was a dressing table to my right, filled with perfumes, lotions and kits. Will was searching through drawers trying to find something. I was not amused by the thought that I would have to help him carry all this stuff downstairs. 

That's when I heard a whisper. I turned around immediately and took a few steps forward. I walked towards the bedroom door slowly. As I stood there peeking out into the living room, I felt a hard, thrusting push on my back. I lost my balance and fell forward, damaging the bulb on my lamp. The sudden lack of light blinded my pupils and I tried to quickly stand up. 

I thought Will was trying to assault me for some reason. I looked back into the room. Will was busy looking through stuff in a clearly random trunk. Confused, I wondered if my hunger was causing me to lose stability. I was trying my best to recollect what I last ate. 

I turned around and looked at the living room. There was a woman standing there, barefooted. *LUB DUB LUB DUB LUB DUB*, I heard my heart beating. I felt fear down my spine and I was visibly sweating. The light from the living room window revealed her burnt face. She was wearing a red sleepshirt and she was staring right at me. I froze at my spot, gasping for breath. She started walking towards me. Every step felt heavy. Every step resonated with my heart beat. She never blinked. Her eyes were dead. As she approached me, her silhouette faded. I felt an icy cold touch around my neck and I was blocked by the bathroom door behind me. 

A few seconds later, I heard a whisper. ""Run... ""

Suddenly, I felt liberated. I dropped to my knees and sensed a jolt of pain around my neck. I stood up and turned to the bedroom. Before I could open my mouth, the door shut close. The sudden crash hurt my ears and I fell back. I stood up one last time and started running. I ran out the door and down the stairs. I picked up my bag and ran out the building. I don't know who she was. I don't know what happened to William. I don't care about the money. I just.. wanted... to run...

...they want interns. They want unpaid interns that REQUIRE college credit. Any PAYING job opening is just posted online for ""fairness"" when in reality it's just so the interns can get it. I've had someone who works at a local news station straight-up tell me that's how it works.

I've been thinking non-stop about this for a while but it's really coming in hard right now. I have no money in my retirement, I have zero assets (still live with my VERY generous parents at 23 years old) and I'm in debt. I'm shaking and tearing up and thinking it's just all over.

Next semester, I want to land a internship (not at a big company, but hopefully a small startup). 

I had the chance to go to a Hackathon and meet companies. One of the companies I really liked was Nest. When I was talking to them, it was just me trying to understand what they were saying. They threw around words like ""API, source code, Firebase, etc."" and it was just me nodding my head in agreement so I wouldn't look like an idiot. I felt like I was really behind compared to all my peers at the Hackathon. 

     After the event, I went on Nest's website to check out their API and I honestly don't know what to do. I learned a bit of Python over the summer, but I feel overwhelmed and behind right now. "

I was more prepared this year than ever. I am finishing an 8mo PM internship at a top 10 software company, and will be doing a 4mo Dev internship in January. However, I am quite devastated that I didn't even get an invitation for this year's university campus screening interview.

Is there anything I can do? Thanks."

I've taken financial accounting (B+), and am half way through the semester of taking Intermediate (expecting to get an A). I'm also planning taking on taking finance, the 2nd portion of intermediate accounting, and taxes next semester.

Although I tend to do pretty well in my accounting classes, my biggest problem is that I don't know much about accounting outside of what I learn from class. I only have a general idea on what the big 4 are. I feel that since I am planning on applying to internships soon I really have to start expanding my knowledge about accounting, so I was hoping you guys could help me out. 

What are some of things I should know or should read up on? What are some resources (maybe some good websites) that I can start going on to have a better understanding on whats going on currently in the accounting world? Also I've heard that its important to know if you want to do taxes and audit. Can someone expand on that?

Lastly, I'm worried about my GPA. I'm currently at 3.12 right now because I did poorly during my freshman and part of my sophomore year. Most of these grades are from General ed courses (like philosophy, English 1A, child development, etc.), and I do have a strong major GPA (about a 3.4). The problem is my GPA will never get up to a 3.5+ because I did so poorly in those lower division courses. Will that affect my chances on getting an internship/job in the future? How important is my cumulative GPA if I have a strong major one?

2luhvd,5,2014-11-10,Someone to Watch over Me,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2luhvd/someone_to_watch_over_me/,"**Here's the deal, I found this laptop and a small statue of a dog in a box in the elevator of my apartment complex. The other night the power was out for the whole building, and a few days ago once the power was restored and the elevators were back up and running I called it up and low and behold as I walked in to the elevator this box with a laptop and this dog statue was sitting in the far right corner. The box was labeled, """"junk, do not return to owner"""". I took the laptop and box with me to my car and later when I got home I opened the laptop and running was a notepad software already open and with the following written in it**

- Hello me, I’m just going to be writing this little journal here on the laptop so I don’t get bored, I like to write   and I figure if I type down my thoughts and stuff it’ll help me feel less lonely and give me  something to do.    
  

- I’m awake now yet somehow the sky outside is dark again. For the past few days I have been exhausted due to   finals week at school, but now it is summer and I look forward to resting. I have no classes and did not get an internship like I had hoped so I am stuck home for most of this summer. This past semester left me exhausted and on the last day of finals I came straight to my apartment and collapsed on my bed only to wake up at 11 at night, I’m up now browsing the web reading articles and playing little games, the night sky looks quite peaceful from my window but I feel a bit lonely now that the semester is over. I have a very small amount of friends   because I like to keep my circle small. I have 2 good friends and that’s it, the only problem is that they are out of town back home to their home towns up north while I am stuck here alone.


- I am writing this because I am lonely, I just need to type to myself to get out all these thoughts swirling in my head, I woke up around 11 P.M. so I stayed up until now, it just turned 3 A.M. I made some ramen noodles and now I’m just staring out my   window into the dark sky. I wish I had cable but I cut back on things like cable and eating out to save money. My apartment has a Wi-Fi hotspot for its residents to use so that’s cool.  I’m going to just watch a movie online or something, I don’t even know if I should sleep again or wait until it is night time. The dark sky still makes it seem like night but it’s just very early in the morning.  



- Well, I stayed up until almost 5:00 in the morning and fell asleep, I woke up today at 2:00 in the afternoon to a rainy day. I’m staying in today, it’s pouring out and the lightning is bright and frequent. As I ‘m sitting here at my computer the lightning flashing from outside made something in my peripheral noticeable. To   my left as I type this there sits a statue of a brown dog with big round black eyes, I forgot I even had this statue until the lightning lit up its eyes making it very noticeable. This statue is a small little piggy bank, shaped   like a dog. Oh yes I remember now, it was given to me by my mother and once belonged to my grandfather. The dog sat with its head tilted giving off the creepiest sad puppy dog look I have ever seen, and its eyes were indeed lifeless and a bit disturbing. I’m trying to ignore that it is even here but those big black lifeless eyes are hard to ignore, I feel a bit bad that those eyes were the only pair of eyes besides my own that I have seen since classes ended.



  
- I feel kind of strange, my body aches and I have the chills, I believe I am about to become sick with the flu or something, I really hate being sick, I wanted to get out tomorrow but I feel terrible. I’m also starting to feel even lonelier, I might call my friends later to see what their up to, but for now I’m just going to lay down.
I’m up again and again staring at me from my left is this dog statue. I still feel sick and it’s now 12: 26 midnight. I hate waking up to the dark sky, it feels…wrong. I keep looking up over at this statue and hoping it won’t be staring at me anymore, it is watching me intently as if saying to me  “I am here if no one else is.” The more I think about it, I have spent more time with this statue, fixed in its gaze more than I have with my own friends throughout the year because of how much I stay home rather than go out.  I still feel sick and I could really use some company, this dog statue isn’t really doing it for me.




- I fell asleep in my chair and woke up with this throbbing headache and the power being out, it is 2 a.m. and I feel tired and sick, but most of all I feel lonely. The power is out but my laptop still has a good amount of battery power. I hear faint music from the other side of my wall. There is a really old lady who lives in the apartment next to mine who loves to play these old records on her record player. She is playing a weird old song, I have no idea what the song is called but the dark room and the gleaming eyes of this statue are not a good mix, I need to get out but I feel very sick and have no energy. The song playing through my wall is quite a somber song, I decided to go ask what the name of the song was, mostly because I needed some sort of human attention, ANY human attention, I walked out of my apartment into the dark hallway, it was the first time I have seen the hallway not lit up by lights, it was strange to say the least, it was only lit by the emergency lights above the door leading to the staircase. Anyways,  I went and knocked on her door and she answered it seeming both surprised but strangely happy to see someone, I just told her I was checking to see if her power was out to even though I was well aware the whole building or at least this whole floor was without power. After a bit of chit chat I asked her the name of the song playing, she told me it was a song called “Someone to Watch over Me” by- Gertrude Lawrence, and told me it was her mother’s favorite song. She invited me in but I declined citing that I didn’t feel too well and I wanted to go back to my place and lay down. So now I’m sitting here in the dark again with this damn statue staring a hole through me, I’m not going to move it because once I move it, I will have given in to the fact that an inanimate object has spooked me to the point where I think its eyes are actually “watching” me rather than just being a set of fake eyes with no real function. The moment I move that statue is the moment my fears of it become real and it no longer is just a statue, instead it’s something that can cause me to be uneasy, something that can cause me to become frightened.



- I fell asleep again but this time in my computer chair, I awoke to the same set of lifeless black eyes staring at me and the sound of a record skipping repeatedly, I’m going to wait about 5 more minutes and if it’s still skipping I’m going to go over and check on the old lady next door to see if everything is ok.



- I’m freaked out right now, its 4 A.M. now, last I typed here I said I would wait 5 minutes then go check on the old lady next door. Well 5 minutes went by and I went to go check on her, I went to her door and knocked but there was no answer just a skipping record echoing through the door, feeling as though something were wrong, I decided to try the door and it was unlocked. I looked into the apartment, it was dark with one single candle flickering in the hall way and a skipping record steadily sounding off in the darkness, I walked in and over to the living room area and saw another candle and the silhouette of the old woman sitting in an armchair next to the skipping record. She was sitting straight up in a recliner chair with her arms both resting on the armrests, I could only see her outline and could not make out any other details besides her silhouette in the very dimly lit room. I called out to her and she was unresponsive, I walked up to her and tapped her on the shoulder and realized she was not responding at all no matter how much I tried to get her attention, I rushed over here to my apartment and got my cell phone and called 911, after I called 911 I waited with her in the dark living room. I took the needle off the record to stop it from skipping and sat there alone with her, in the very dimly lit room, I sat for a few minutes then something happened that creeped me out more than I have ever been crept out in my life, the old lady turned her head to her left and said in a voice that I didn’t recognize to be hers and said “Don’t you remember the lonely nights Mortimer?”, after that statement from the calm and deep voice not matching the old ladies voice from when we spoke earlier, the lady’s head turned ever so slowly back straight forward. Miss are you okay I asked, but no response, Miss are you okay I asked again this time placing my hand on hers. Once my hand touched her skin I snapped my hand back because of how ice cold her hand was, I was about to inform her that I called the ambulance to make certain she was okay when I spotted something very unnerving. There sitting on the table next to the record player. Ever so faintly I could now make out the figure to her left, I guess my eyes had adjusted to the dim light of the room enough for me to see it now. This “It” that I could now see was a statue of a brown dog with big black eyes staring at her as she sat in her chair, it was facing her much like the one I owned faced towards me. I thought that this is merely a coincidence that she had the same statue piggy bank of a dog like I have, I even got up and walked over here to my apartment to make sure my statue was still here and sure enough it was and still is. I couldn’t even sit in that living room anymore I stood at the edge of the dim candle lit hallway and waited for the paramedics to arrive, they arrived and after a few cycles of CPR she was pronounced dead at the scene. 




- As I sit here and type this my own “watchdog” or rather “watching dog” sits to my left burning its lifeless gaze right through me, it is 5 A.M. and still dark out and the power is still down. I can’t believe the old lady is gone, I can’t believe she might have died while I was still in the room with her, I feel strange. Maybe, I could have helped her I don’t know…everything is getting to be a bit too much for me right now. I have so many questions that no one will be able to answer, why did she speak to the statue?? Why did her voice sound so strange? Oh lord, did she really die that moment while I was in there with her??? WHY did she have the same eerie dog statue as I do? This is definitely going to keep me guessing for a long time to come. I still refuse to move my statue, I will not give in to silly irrational fears. If I move it, it wins…However, Just the statement “If I move it, it wins” is a sign I have given in to fear already.




- Ok I’m back at it again, I laid down to try to sleep at around 5:15 but was woken up by a strange faint noise from the other side of my wall. The noise turns out to be music, not just any music but the same song from before, the same song the old woman had been listening to before she died. I heard it loud and clear now, it was “Someone to Watch over Me” by- Gertrude Lawrence. I sat up and rolled my eyes at this situation, I’m weird like that, when frightening things happen I kind of get upset that it is happening in the first place, almost like it is an inconvenience to me for something frightening to be happening to me. Then as I turned my head I was frozen stiff, I didn’t want to move because from my bed I could see that dog statue and those big black eyes staring at my computer chair as if it was waiting for me to sit so it could peer straight into my soul like it always does. I finally mustered up the courage to grab my laptop from my desk and bring it to my bed, I’m typing this with that damn dog sitting in its spot while that record plays, well its skipping now and I wish it would stop…Wait it did stop…and now the song is playing again. I’m finished with this journal and I’m getting out of this apartment. I’m done typing and I’m done feeling trapped.




- Ok so my getaway plan was foiled, I was walking and something pulled me back, not something physically pulling me back, just something inside me engrained deep into my psyche that told me I just couldn’t go another second without solving this mystery, I had to go into the apartment, I had to try to get some closure and also I had to stop that music from playing, I just had to! I walked over to the old lady’s door, it was surprisingly still unlocked even after the paramedics left. I walked in there and fumbled in the dark and turned off the music. As I was leaving I felt my hand brush the top of something. I adjusted my hands to the object and felt the coarse and hard object between my fingers, I knew it was her dog statue. I don’t know why but I grabbed it and left the old lady’s apartment and came back here to my own apartment. Now I am here with two of those statues. Her statue however was heavier, like it had something in it. I turned the statue upside down and noticed a round metal cap, I guess a place where any money stored in the statue can be retrieved. I popped open the cap and took out an assortment of old coins and a single picture, a picture of a little girl and a woman, and inside was a note that was scribbled frantically on the back of the picture. The note reads, “I need no friends because you watch over me, now and forever I am in your gaze because now and forever your eyes are the only friends for me.” This was strange, I didn’t understand it, I was now compelled to investigate my own statue, now I must admit what I found in that statue was indeed strange to me but not as strange as what I found inside my own statue. Inside my statue was a picture of me when I was about 5 years old, there I sat smiling and happy, and behind me sat the dog statue staring as it always does. I am confused and frightened, I do not know what any of this means and I don’t ever remember this picture being mentioned to me by my mom, this statue that belonged to my grandfather before he passed on has always been in my possession since as long as I could remember.  This will be my last post, I’m going to head out, I have to get out of here and away from all th

Hello,

- I am back dear journal and I must say I feel silly for being afraid this entire time. I have no need to be afraid, you see Mortimer is my friend. Mortimer watches over me, his eyes are all the friends I need. I’m going to turn off my computer so I can be alone with Mortimer, he enjoys the dark and I will enjoy it with him.

	

**Below is a link to a picture of the dog statue I now have, I don't know what to do with this stuff. Is it a joke?, I do remember the ambulance coming to the building and looking out my window to see someone being carted away in a body bag up on a stretcher, I was kinda freaked that someone had died but didn't worry about it too much, I don't know anyone in this building really so the owner of this stuff is unknown to me, This dog statue does give off a strange vibe though...**

I haven't experienced much anxiety before this, and I'm freaking out.",KaptainKlein,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2lv072/rant_this_is_my_hardest_semester_of_college_yet/,"20, male, undiagnosed (don't know if this is a consistent problem or just a shitty year), USA

I'm a junior at a pretty good college in my state. I'm smart, able to bullshit papers for a good grade, high retention memory, etc. School this semester is being much harder than it has been in the past, and when that is paired with a lot of worrying about social stuff and my future, it feels like too much.

1. My grades are alright for now, but I don't see that continuing. I have huge creative projects for my Stage Directing and Advertising Message strategy classes due as our final grades, and every time I sit down to plan either one or reserve rooms for the Directing scene I just freak out, lose breath, and decide not to do it. This has not been a problem for me before.

2. I hate my roommates. They're other theatre majors and the most petty, passive aggressive, bitchy people I've ever met. I feel like they're always talking about me behind my back, even when I know they're not. I share a house with two girls and another guy, and this experience is making me want to live alone next year, but if I do that I'm terrified of becoming a hermit like my dad and losing all social interaction outside of school. I'm in that awful place between introvert and outgoing and it makes that happy place very small.
3. Speaking of my living situation, I have no idea if I want to live alone or with a roommate. Before all of this went down I was talking to three people in a group I paint up for football games with about sharing a house, but if I decide I want to downsize I have to back out of that, and I don't want to hurt them by telling them I don't want to live with them.
4. That paint line is one of the first real groups of friends I've found in college outside of the theatre department here and I don't want to lose them, but I think I pissed a lot of them off recently. We were tossing around designs for T Shirts and someone suggested as a tagline ""real fans wear spikes."" A few people liked it, but I felt it alienated and belittled people who aren't on our line. When I voiced these opinions it turned into a huge fight and now our group chat has gone fairly silent. Now I'm panicking that they hate me, started a chat without me just because they're pissed off at me, would rather me leave, etc. THis fight was about a week ago.
5. Oh, and let's not forget that I'm trying things again with my ex girlfriend because of mutual lingering feelings and have no idea if I still actually love her and want to be in a relationship or if I just want to drink and have sex with random people and go on Tinder dates when I feel like it. And that at the same time there's a girl who's completely in love with me that I'm hurting terribly with this whole process and feel like a complete ass over. I mean, what the fuck am I supposed to do?
6. Oh, AND I should be looking for advertising internships for next summer, but I just have no free time, and when I do I'm just exhausted from everything else I'm doing and need to just collapse. But I'm a junior and this is the year I *need* an internship to be successful in my field.

I don't know if this stuff falls more in the realm of depression or anxiety, but I know I've felt pretty damn anxious and upset and I don't like this."

The new girlfriend understands that what my ex has to say about me may not be true so I'm not worried about that and she's going to start making a list of what all she has to say about me over the next 2 months so that I can go back to my attorney and have her wrote up for defamation.

2lv7pg,47,2014-11-10,Me [20F] with my boyfriend [20 M] have been dating long distance and now he wants a break,cake-n-stuff,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2lv7pg/me_20f_with_my_boyfriend_20_m_have_been_dating/,"My boyfriend and I met out freshman year of college and have been dating for two years now. We've always been an insanely close, BFF type couple and never seemed to have a single problem. He's a computer scientist and has been spending his summers interning in California (I'm in New York so the complete opposite coast) which wasn't a big deal the first summer, but this past summer I ended up having some issues with his communication. He never seemed to have time to talk on the phone or skype and is a notoriously bad texter and it became an issue with me, one that seemed it would only be resolved once we returned to Campus.

 Well because he did so well at his internship he was offered a year long position out there which he accepted right away. He's admitted to me that he didn't take our relationship into consideration because he didn't want it to affect his decision which I understand. We've seen each other twice since then, the first at the beginning of August and the last time I flew out there about a month ago. The deal was that he had to call or skype me once a week which for the most part he stuck to. Everything seemed to be going surprisingly well considering. 

Well two weeks ago, the communication suddenly started tapering off and I was getting big flashbacks to the summer time and started getting kind of scared and annoyed. This kind of peaked when after days of trying to get him to call or skype me he tells me that he can't because he sat down to start watching V for Vendetta, to which I totally blew up at him. We started talking about communication and he stated that he doesn't like talk on the phone or skyping because he always gets distracted and starts doing other things while we're talking. He also apparently gets too distracted to properly respond to texts and thinks facebook messages would be a better way to talk. 

However that kind of fell off the discussion table when he revealed that apparently he's having this big huge problem with being apart from me. He's the kind of guy who has always had a girlfriend and hasn't spent much time being single. Also when he was here we would spend practically every night together, and when he wasn't with me, he always had a roommate, even over the summers. Currently he lives with 6 other people but he has his own room and apparently sleeping alone every night is giving him anxiety. In his own words he had apparently been weighing his 'need to have someone to sleep next against his desire to be with me'. but later stated that he doesn't actually want anyone else (in his words ""I don't want some shitty half-Jane pretending to be my jane"") just the fact that I can't be there is giving him pain. I suggested that maybe I record the sound of myself sleeping for him to listen to but he rejected it saying it was a ""dirty trick"". 

So It came to this, over this past weekend I told him to think about whether he still wanted to be with me or if he would rather break up because I wasn't going to make that call. He thought about it overnight and at first returned with the verdict that he wanted to be with me. When I asked him why this over that he said he didn't have a reason and just went with his gut feeling. Which left me feeling not really reassured which I told him. Then he announced he wanted to take a break for a week. He said is was so that he can 'realize all the things he takes for granted and better appreciate me'.
 
I asked him point blank if he'd met someone, which he denied and said that wasn't what this was about. I also told that if he should, the decent thing to do would be to break it off with me which he agreed. So we started our break yesterday. I'm not dumb, I know that right after we hung up he and his housemates were throwing a huge party so I don't think it's a coincidence that he'd brings this up right before then. 

I tried talked to my sisters and friends but they were all overwhelmingly negative about both my boyfriend (this is new as they've all really like him until now) and the situation and how this is all basically a ruse so he can still keep me around while searching for a new girlfriend guilt free, and that's kind of what I believe as well. However I also believe this might be because I was stifling him before with my need for him to keep in touch, however, if it is, why didn't he just tell me that? Also if he was using this as an excuse to meet girls, why did he insist on just a week? I know long term couples like us need breaks from each other but we're long distance, there is a huge amount of physical space between us already and we only talk once a week! I know he and I are young and maybe I should just forget about him but I feel like if I can salvage the relationship, I should at least try.

---   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend and I of two years are living across country from each other for a year, he doesn't like being alone, yet decided he doesn't want to break up. Rather he wants to take a break for a week and it's made me nervous and I can't tell if I'm being unresonable"

I knew the guy for 5 years now, he's cute, funny, optimistic, charming, charismatic, my female friends adore him...But i rejected him...I still wanted to be friends, he accepted but after 2 years he told me that he can't see me as a friend and I harshly rejected him (with insults). We ignored each other for a whole year but we spoke again and got closer as friends, he was very respectful...I admired a lot of things about him...He told me one day he is begining a relation with a girl I lost my mind back then, i insulted him (i tought he was lying and playing games with me)...We ignored each other again...some time later, I became an intern in the company he worked on. We ignored each other but I crossed him a lot (stalking me?!)...We had a conversation about it...and insulted each other...He apologised and we ignored each other for 2 months...I was doing bad in that company...he then appeared and assisted me ... i felt bad treating such a nice guy badly...I went to his office one day, draw a silly figure and gave it to him...he was amused and kept it on his desk...he then told me  ""I am not your friend"", I just smiled like an idiot. I asked him out (2/3 times a week), i had a lot of insecurities, he was always by my side, he was the only one i trusted THAT much, even if he was by times a little jealous when he saw me alone with one of my male friends  (I have many male friends), i told him one day that they were like my brothers (we didn't have that problem again). It was great, he asked me out quite a lot too, guys at the company tought we were together...He went on business trips, and each time, he came with a small presents for me, I liked that a lot !...I did miss him too when he was not at the office...One day, I had an interview for a job on another country, I told him about it...He was glad, and he inconditionnaly helped me. I've been accepted, he was proud of me! (he was the only who knew about it)...I was preparing to quit the company, he then came and confessed to me that he liked me. I ONLY saw him as a friend the whole time ! so I told him we're just friends! and insulted him a lot (why is he so weird and persistant ?!)...He then told me that he never saw me as a ""friend"" and that ""I knew that"". I told him that I treated him like all the other male friends i have...He then said : ""You're a player then"" I insulted him a lot more. But 2 days after, he came smiling, and told me :""I wish you luck, and I apologise for everything"", i shooted at him ""stop harassing me!"", i saw dissapointment in his eyes (I cried a lot too, at night). After that, I didn't hear a thing about him...I feel weird...Why?
---   
tl;dr: male ""friend"" confessed to me 3 times (on a 5 years span) but each time i rejected him and then we ignore each other for a long time, this time we were very close, he confessed, i insulted him, he told me i am a ""player"" i insulted him again and asked him to stop harassing me...but i feel weirdly sad now. why ?"

I've done interviews at eBay, Facebook, Palantir, Red Hat so I'm not surprised to be rejected but I am also being rejected by lower-tier companies that I would consider ""safety companies"" like IBM and National Instruments who ask very easy, sophomore level Object-Oriented questions.

I would consider my algorithm skills okay, though I do resort to a somewhat brute-force implementation occasionally. I do not think I'm coming off as arrogant. Is this normal for a job search? Is there any other possible reasons to be concerned?"
2lwj2x,1,2014-11-10,Software engineering to aerospace &amp; electronics,baconsquidz,aerospace,https://www.reddit.com/r/aerospace/comments/2lwj2x/software_engineering_to_aerospace_electronics/,"Looking for some advice, thoughts and wisdom from those who have been through or are in a similar situation.

**TL;DR I have good experience in software engineering and electronics (microprocessor code, PCB design, etc.) along with running a couple of semi-successful businesses that are now closed. Will this experience help with working on aerospace software and electronics and getting a job working on space projects? What positions do this kind of work?**

I'm 23 and have been working in software engineering for the last 6 years professionally. I self-taught all of my skills in this industry and currently hold a senior position in a company where I work from home. It's a very laid back and productive environment and I make about $90k/year at present.

I have worked on a wide range of projects from embedded systems, microprocessors, desktop, mobile and web in a lot of different high and low level languages. The projects range from mapping tools for police forces, remote web-controlled paintball gun robots, 3D games and crash simulators for trains to more ""standard"" web projects like e-commerce.

I have always had a fascination with planes and space and would love to work on things like satellite electronics hardware, flight avionics software, instrument software and maybe RF comms (although I believe this is more specialized).

Would an aerospace engineering degree (with internships) be a good route for me to get involved or would an electronics/software engineering degree be more suitable? I am reluctant to go for an electronics or software engineering degree because I feel that I wouldn't be learning a lot and it would be more for the ""degree ticket"" that some companies require rather than to actually gain knowledge."
2lwj8v,20,2014-11-10,How do I deal with being in a relationship after being alone my whole life?,[deleted],faimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/2lwj8v/how_do_i_deal_with_being_in_a_relationship_after/,"I'm in my first relationship with this girl I have been seeing for about 4 months. I'm 28 and she's 27. She was a bit shocked to find out I was a virgin, and couldn't see why hormones didn't get the best of me as a teenager, or how I couldn't just lower my standards to sleep with someone.   

*Below is the synopsis of my FA experience. Skip to the my current situation if you don't care about my life* :P 

  
**Why I was FA**  
I was really insecure since I was a teenager. Along with not being that great looking (due to: acne, eczema, crooked teeth, and a crooked nose) I also lived with my parents in a shitty house till I was 24. When I was 21 I got braces and plastic surgery to straighten my nose. I had braces till I was 23. At this point I had also cleared up my acne. During this whole time, I had been going to college trying to figure out what I wanted to do. I decided I wanted to be an engineering major at 22. At 24 my parents moved to another town, so I moved in with my brother and his wife, and got an internship that payed pretty decently.   
**The semi-turning point**  
I started doing online dating and got a date once a month. Relationships never got serious because I never made a move. [Any women I was attracted to I assumed wouldn't like me due to my insecurities.](http://i.imgur.com/nEJ2du0.png) Also, I was scared I misrepresented myself online and coming off more creepy in real life. When I was 26, I finally graduated college and started living on my own. Also around this time, I started getting my eczema under control, and clearing up my skin.  
  
At 27 things in my life seemed to have turned around. I had my own place, a car, and a decent paying job. Also at this point I was just worn out. I had done all these things to become successful and more attractive, I had been dating for 4 years and had still never been in a relationship. I was contemplating just hitting the off switch because even though life was better, it wasn't satisfying.   
  
Around this time my family needed my help. I started taking care of my mom and my two little sisters. When you start contemplating death you start wanting to leave a good impression. By the time the holidays rolled around, they had stayed with me a few months.   
**The major turning point**   
Around New Years my cousin mentioned that he was seeing this girl and he wanted me to go on a double date with him. I reluctantly agreed, and even though the picture of my ""date"" was really pretty, I assumed it was a bait and switch (as many of my outings with him had been.) I end up going on the double date, and the girl was real, however she brought her friend. I assumed she didn't want to be there and tried to be as nice as possible. My ""date"" said she didn't have many friends, and wanted more people to hang out with.   
  
New years rolls around, and my cousin wanted me to invite my ""date.""  I do and we all plan to go to this event. A friend of mine also wanted to hang out, along with my sister and her boyfriend. My cousin and his date bailed last minute due to some drama. I pick up my ""date"" from work and we go back to my place (she planned to spend the night after.) I told her I was bringing other people, and she seemed cool with it. We get to the event, and some guys waiting for her there. I was humiliated. This whole time, it just seemed like I was trying to parade her in front of my friends and family, and she brings her own guy to the party. At this point we already paid, and I had already driven everyone there (I was stuck.) I tried to avoid her, she sticks around my group, and after a few awkward hours we finally leave and go back home without her guy friend.   
At my place and everyone wants to party some more. My ""date"" starts talking to my sisters boyfriend, and somehow the conversation turns towards pole dancing. My sister gets mad at her boyfriend flirting with my ""date"" and they fight.  My ""date"" asks for a place to sleep, and I give her my bed while I try to sort the issue out. My ""date"" wants me to sleep in the same bed as her. This was my first time sleeping in the same bed with another girl. I took the small quilt from my covers and huddled on the side of my bed most of the night. She asked if I was cold, but she was wrapped up like a burrito. I asked if we could cuddle, which she thought was odd, so I awkwardly put one arm over her as she slept. I couldn't sleep all night. Every now and then I would turn over and look at her, and it was just surreal that there was this beautiful girl laying next to me. She wanted to hang out again, but people convinced me not to see her again so I didn't.   
  
At this point in my life I started to realize I had a real chance at being in a relationship. I started working out every day, bought a new car, and moved into some luxury apartments.  
  
**My current situation**  
I met my girlfriend about 4 months ago through online dating. I care about her more than I care about anyone else, but its really hard to deal with the fact that she's been in relationships and has slept with other men. She'll start talking about her boyfriend in high school, and I'll just start picturing them fooling around. My girlfriend is gorgeous, and I don't think she would have even talked to me in high school. It makes me feel worthless, like I wasn't allowed to have that experience. I've asked her about her history and she's mentioned that she's slept with people just to have sex. That also makes me feel worthless. I waited till I was 27 to have sex and the person I'm in love with casually had sex with people she didn't care about. I feel like she cheapened her body without caring about anyone else she might fall in love with in the future. She makes up the entirety of my romantic life, and I'm just a fraction of hers. If something went wrong in our relationship, it would be very difficult for me to sleep with someone else and move on, but I don't know that I could say the same for her. "
2lwjis,0,2014-11-10,As a soon-to-be graduate how do I tackle applying to companies which seem to demand working knowledge of a coding language?,Sanuuu,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/2lwjis/as_a_soontobe_graduate_how_do_i_tackle_applying/,"I'm graduating next year with an MEng in Information and Computer engineering. I've worked mostly with MATLAB, Java and low level assembly language in the past (due to classes and a work placement) but I'm aiming for a career in the field of robotics and all the robotics jobs out there require C++. I guess I *could* just read a self-teach C++ book but I feel like that would be a waste of time given that I could spend all that time working on my final year project which is actually practical and exciting.

I feel confident that if I landed a job needing knowledge of virtually any coding language, given several months I could get that knowledge, so maybe even before I commence the job. I mean, at the final day review of my recent internship, my line manager was shocked to find out that I've done no work in MATLAB before the work placement. Based on how fast I got into the project assigned to me he just assumed I knew MATLAB.

Is there a way to demonstrate that readiness to learn to a potential employer? Can I hope for a job using a language I have not worked with before? Am I doomed to huge companies' graduate schemes where I might or might not end up with a job I like?"
2lwjqu,5,2014-11-10,Ambitious recent college grad starting to lose all hope for accomplishing my dreams.,cookielee,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/2lwjqu/ambitious_recent_college_grad_starting_to_lose/,"I just graduated with my marketing degree in May with a 3.5 GPA and a great resume. I worked extremely hard during school, always tried to get the best internships and was the vice president of our entrepreneurial alliance. I've always had big dreams of living in a city, having a great career and being successful. I was extremely determined with my job hunt and had several solid job prospects before graduating and ended up landing what I thought was my dream job in nyc about a month before graduation. 

Once I got the job, I started developing severe anxiety knowing that I was going to be struggling financially with this job. I have $40,000 in school loans, $5,000 car loan, and $1200 in CC debt.  My debt plus the combination of rent in nyc and an entry-level salary was not ideal. Due to this I started rethinking my decision but ended up getting highly pressured into taking the job from my parents. 

Three weeks before I was supposed to move, my anxiety only worsened. I couldn't sleep, could barely eat, and started having constant panic attacks. Due to family pressure, I still made the move to NYC and started my job. My anxiety was so bad that I literally could not even think and was always on the verge of a panic attack. I came home one weekend and my parents saw the state I was in and they realized the severity of it so they decided it would be best to resign. 

Right after this, my anxiety also turned into a deep depression. I was stressing out about not having a job and kept pursuing opportunities, landing 3 great positions, but was not able to take them because mentally I was not in the right place, which was extremely hard for me to accept. 

I have taken the time to get well mentally at home and I now feel ready  to start my career. I never wanted to live at home after graduating for many reasons but mostly because I am from an extremely small town with little to no opportunities. 

I've now been applying to jobs and am having no luck. It's extremely frustrating going from receiving various solid job offers and getting every job I interviewed for to now not even be able to land an interview. 

I'm just not sure what I should do now and what I should say that I have been doing for the past 6 months? I am just starting to feel hopeless and feel like I'm going to be stuck in this small town forever. Any advice would be helpful!!!

I have no doubts that my parents and most of my extended family will accept me based on their reactions to other LGBT family members and friends, I live in the SF area (both home and school), and my school's medical insurance covers most transition-related expenses.

One of the things that's really holding me back is my existing professional presence online. I write mobile apps and other software, including one app that's been moderately successful. However, everything is released under my current name (developer accounts, GitHub, domain name, email, social media, etc). I'm really interested in pursuing software development as a future career and I know that past projects are crucial in getting internships and job offers.

If I decide to transition, does anyone have any advice on managing this?"

[What is the strongest argument you've heard *against* net neutrality?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lvly9/i_am_r_david_edelman_president_obama_just/clykquq?context=5)|Good question.  Like any consequential policy debate, there's passion on all sides -- you've seen a lot of that around the Internet today.  Let me start out by saying that the arguments FOR net neutrality are overwhelming, and the stories that we have heard over the last months and years, in response to the President's leadership on this issue, have meant a lot.  Founder after founder of start-ups have told us that without a free and open Internet, they would have never had a chance to get started, and grow from a garage to a Fortune 1000 company.
 |Any rule on net neutrality has to be carefully designed.  And it's certainly our hope that they won't be needed -- that ISPs won't be engaging in the sorts of practices that would have them collecting tolls from edge providers, or picking winners and losers.  Some have argued that in a truly competitive broadband marketplace, you could see ISPs competing with different prioritization packages -- maybe one specific to gaming, for instance.  But today, broadband markets in the United States aren't competitive enough to support that. There continue to be challenges of broadband competition, but with strong net neutrality rules, we can ensure Internet users in under-served markets are protected. 
[Putting Net Neutrality aside for a moment. What is the President's stance on patent reform? In particular, how does the administration plan to combat the patent troll environment that exists today in the software world? Innovation has been stifled in many ways by broad patents or patents held by non-practicing entities. Is this even on the administration's radar? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lvly9/i_am_r_david_edelman_president_obama_just/clyp5cl?context=5)|You may know that this is not something most people were talking about two years ago.  But us policy-types had actually been looking at it for some time, and on 2/4/13, the President did G+ [hangout](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp_zigxMS-Y) and gave a pretty forward-leaning answer to the patent troll issue.  At his direction, we ran a process that led to some [announcements](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/04/fact-sheet-white-house-task-force-high-tech-patent-issues) about ways the Patent Office would improve the way it did business, and also laid out a set of priorities for Congress to take action.  In December, the House passed a bill addressing the patent troll issue, and while the Senate has yet to act, we [continue](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/02/20/fact-sheet-executive-actions-answering-president-s-call-strengthen-our-p) to find new ways to improve the patent system on our own.
 |But a comprehensive solution requires revisions to law, so we’ll [keep pressing]( http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/01/28/president-barack-obamas-state-union-address) Congress to enact comprehensive patent reform legislation.  This isn’t a partisan issue, and we hope it is really is something that can get done next year, if we continue to echo calls like these.
[Why did he nominate a person to head the FCC with the exact opposite goal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lvly9/i_am_r_david_edelman_president_obama_just/clylkjf?context=5)|That's why the President felt that it was important to outline steps that he believes the FCC should put in place to protect net neutrality as the FCC considers the path forward.  Over the past few months, the President has worked with his policy teams to analyze all the available options and to formulate the strongest possible proposal to protect net neutrality. The President also recognizes that almost 4 million Americans, and dozens of companies large and small, have written to the FCC to express strong views on this issue.
[How does it matter? Since the telecoms can write larger checks than the users of the services, we have no say in this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lvly9/i_am_r_david_edelman_president_obama_just/clynqsv?context=5)|I think this issue has made clear that just isn't the case.  Nearly four million people had their view heard.  And today, the President added his voice further elevating this issue to the very top of the public debate.  That's hard to ignore.
 |Take another issue, like [cell phone unlocking](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/response/its-time-legalize-cell-phone-unlocking).  That wasn't on anyone's radar screens until it broke on We the People -- the White House's petition platform.   And after we outlined a way to fix it, we had FCC action, industry agreements, and ultimately, a bill signed by the President.  All because of voices like yours.
[Is there a plan to Support/Allow/Protect Cooperatives in any municipalities, towns, villages or communities that want to build/own, maintain/control Last Mile &amp; WiFi? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lvly9/i_am_r_david_edelman_president_obama_just/clypama?context=5)|This is [something that Tom Wheeler has actually opened an inquiry into](http://www.fcc.gov/blog/removing-barriers-competitive-community-broadband), and that the FCC is seriously examining.  Having heard from a number of communities where it has made a difference, we have been [looking into the issue as well](http://www.ntia.doc.gov/federal-register-notice/2014/community-broadband-workshop), and while it's clear most of the work here is at the state and local level, we would of course welcome your thoughts about what the Executive Branch might be able to do within our authorities.
[Can you respond to accusations that these proposed regulations are out of date and will actually do more harm than good?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lvly9/i_am_r_david_edelman_president_obama_just/clymsad?context=5)|The telecommunications act empowers the FCC to apply the parts of the law that are appropriate to the technology at the time. As the technologies change, so does the way in which the FCC applies the law.
 |As the President said today, ""if carefully designed, these rules should not create any undue burden for ISPs...If the FCC appropriately forbears from the Title II regulations that are not needed to implement the principles above — principles that most ISPs have followed for years — it will help ensure new rules are consistent with incentives for further investment in the infrastructure of the internet.""
[Hello, i am a student at George Washington University. What can i do to become an intern for your office or, perhaps, a 'better' position?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lvly9/i_am_r_david_edelman_president_obama_just/clysc50?context=5)|Hi, thanks for your interest!  It's always great to see folks interested in public service.  I did some internships myself when I was in college, and it was a great way to check out policy.
 |You can start [here](http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/internships) for more information about the White House internship.  Departments and Agencies like State and Commerce have their own programs as well, so don't forget to check them out as well.  State's where I got my start. 
[I know nothing about politics, but my reaction (being jaded by politics\) is that this is a reaction to the majority republican house/senate. And by being at the front of this movement which is important to so many people, they'll opt to blame the republicans when things don't get done (because nothing gets done at congress (because that's how congress works\).  Can you help me be more optimistic about this wonderful thing? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lvly9/i_am_r_david_edelman_president_obama_just/clys2w6?context=5)|Tall order, but let me try: The election was not a factor in this particular case.  Period.  This was simply the President following through on his call for Net Neutrality, which has been a longstanding priority for him.  As far back as 2007, he made clear that [he “takes a backseat to no one”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j8lP9suvP8) when it comes to protecting online freedoms and innovation in the Internet marketplace.  The plan the President outlined today is another extension of that philosophy and the clearest way to protect Net Neutrality for everyone. 
[Will Net Neutrality be Strongly Enforced and How,  if the Providers violate Censorship or Bandwidth Equal Access rules?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lvly9/i_am_r_david_edelman_president_obama_just/clypem4?context=5)|The enforcement actions themselves are up to the FCC, and are independent.  But I can tell you that the rules the President outlined today would certainly allow for enforcement should they be violated by any ISP, wired or wireless.  That’s why the rules the President is urging the FCC to pass are straightforward, bright-line rules banning practices like blocking or paid prioritization.
[How does President Obama justify having appointed Tom Wheeler, a former telecom lobbyist and obvious conflict of interest with his platform of protecting Internet freedom and Net Neutrality? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lvly9/i_am_r_david_edelman_president_obama_just/clyksq8?context=5)|The FCC is an independent agency with five Commissioners, and ultimately, it's their job to decide on the rule independently.  It's our job to serve the President laying out HIS vision for how to achieve an open internet.  Tom is deeply knowledgeable about these issues, and has a long history of dealing with them.
 |The President has weighed in with his views, and now it’s the Commission’s turn to run their process.
[Why has every FCC net neutrality proposal put forward been misaligned (if not outright contradictory\) with the White House's new/clarified stance on the issue?  Has anyone in the executive branch ever consulted with the Electronic Frontier Foundation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lvly9/i_am_r_david_edelman_president_obama_just/clyq8pt?context=5)|I don't think they have.  In fact, just today, the EFF came out and [said ""The White House Gets It Right On Net Neutrality.""](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/white-house-gets-it-net-neutrality-will-fcc-0).
[Do you like the walking dead?  I don't mean the show.  Would you actually like it if the dead got up and started walking around?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lvly9/i_am_r_david_edelman_president_obama_just/clymkz1?context=5)|No, that sounds awful.
[Regarding Obama's quote of,  *""So the time has come for the FCC to recognize that broadband service is of the same importance and must carry the same obligations as so many of the other vital services do. To do that, I believe the FCC should reclassify consumer broadband service under Title II of the Telecommunications Act — while at the same time forbearing from rate regulation and other provisions less relevant to broadband services.""*  How can one, in good faith, say that the Internet is both a public utility that should get the protection that it deserves under the existing Telecommunications Act and then **also** say that it should have it's own rules that go against the Telecommunications Act?  Is it being suggested that the Telecommunications Act be amended to allow for so-called fast lanes?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lvly9/i_am_r_david_edelman_president_obama_just/clylqy6?context=5)|While the President has made clear that he supports reclassifying broadband service under Title II, as the best fit for the internet service we all use today -- but the statute also grants important flexibility to the FCC to tailor its rules in a way that is most appropriate to the technology.  That's what the President is urging the FCC to do.
[Everyone else is asking political questions so I'm just gonna ask you something else.

2lwngj,1,2014-11-10,Stay with Computer Science / IT or go for Electrical Engineering?,varisforge,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/2lwngj/stay_with_computer_science_it_or_go_for/,"Hi, /r/careeradvice!

I really need some good advice. I have been working towards a mechanical engineering degree for a while and suddenly had to change jobs.

I got myself into this mess by deciding to take my associates in Computer Science (as a backup in case something happened and I couldn't complete a transfer only ME degree, as the prereqs were almost identical) and got my first adult type job in IT. The position gave me time to continue working on my actual degree, albeit at a slower pace.

Then, things got messed up and I decided to quit that job. My pay kept being messed with, my hours were getting messed with, and even though I was either 1st or 2nd rated by our ticket software in the state, I kept getting passed on pay raises and promotions. 

I got a new job with a 50% pay raise, 3 weeks PTO, benefits, the works. It's a great position for anyone at my level. However, the new location is 30+ minutes from my college, my college has no online alternatives for my chosen education path, I had to skip a semester just to get my foot in the door here, and now I'm at the crux of my situation.

My end goal is to become a Patent Agent (and possibly Patent Attorney if I decide I like the legal aspect of things.) This is due to my  direct passion of being an inventor and wanting to know how to patent my own work. I also need a good paying job to support myself and my family while I work on my hobby/hopeful future business. 

Because of the new job, I'll have to go to school online. The only schools that offer ABET accredited [online](http://www.abet.org/online-programs/) Class A [Patent Agent compatible degrees](http://www.uspto.gov/ip/boards/oed/exam/OED_GRB.pdf)  are Arizona State University's [online EE program](http://asuonline.asu.edu/online-degree-programs/undergraduate/bachelor-science-engineering-electrical-engineering) and Regis University's [Online Computer Science program](http://www.regis.edu/CPS/Academics/Degrees-and-Programs/Undergraduate-Programs/BS-Computer-Science.aspx).


Computer Science Pros: 


* The company I work for will pay 90% of my college tuition and books up to $6,000 a year as long as I stay with computer science.  
* Given my transfer credits I would probably only need about 45-50 credit hours to graduate.  
* Total Cost would be (after reimbursements) about $13,000 give or take  
* I already have several years experience built into the career path.  
* Lots of options available within the next 3-5 years for more exciting opportunities.  

Cons:

* I don't know if I want to stay with Computer Science. It pays the bills but it does not excite me.  
* Paying another $13,000 to be bored is terrifying to me.  
* Meh applicability towards Jurisdoctorate
* Not a lot of Patent Agent jobs for Computer Science


Electrical Engineering Pros:


* Close enough to what I want to do.  
* Decent starting salaries  
* Good applicability towards JD (should I go that route)  
* Challenging and interesting  

Cons:

* Expense. I would be OOP for about $26,000 in student loans instead of only $13,000. (Roughly same credits) 
* Employability. Breaking into a new career field from scratch.   
* Internships would be difficult if not impossible because of my current employment.  
* Time. I would need about 6 more months to finish the course work.  


Crap. This was a lot of writing. Thank you in advance to anyone who can slog through the text and give decent advice.

2lwpbm,1,2014-11-10,Need advice! Can't seem to land an internship with big tech companies.,chrismallon23,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2lwpbm/need_advice_cant_seem_to_land_an_internship_with/,"Hello. So I am freaking out a bit and its very frustrating. I am currently a sophomore in college majoring in Computer Science and I am having a bit of trouble getting an internship. I have developed my own Android app which has gotten more than 300k downloads, and I worked at a small startup for the past two years (Full time in the summer, part time during school). At the startup, I do a lot of work ranging from backend work to app development. Last year I applied to Google and got an interview, I did really well on the first one, but got nervous and my school WiFi failed so I did horrible on the second one. This year, I tried applying again, but was rejected right away and didn't even make it to an interview. I also applied to Microsoft, Amazon,Facebook(with referral) and a few other big tech companies, but have yet to hear back. Is it still early or am I doing something wrong? After failing my Google interviews last year, I spent some time practicing algorithms/data structures and feel much more confident for the interviews."
2lwpx9,3,2014-11-10,What should I do?,DGunner,MtF,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/2lwpx9/what_should_i_do/,"For the sake of time I'll attempt to condense this as much as possible, but there are some things you'll need to know to fully understand my problem.

So I'm 26 years old. I'm a transgender woman. I'm 6 feet tall with broad shoulders and im in the early stages of male pattern baldness. Pre-everything.

I haven't tried Finasteride and I briefly tried minoxidil but we ran out and I couldn't afford to buy another bottle for almost a week. After that I wasn't as dedicated with my routine and eventually it just stopped.

I work at a grocery store. The people I work with are great! Some of them are not very intelligent however, and I am certain that while they mean well and I get along with them perfectly, I know that if I stay at this store through my transition there will be issues.

I am also in my junior year of college to become a software engineer. I'm having alot of fun with code so I'm sure I'll be happy.

I'm going to school full time, and working part time. I go to school full time all year round (including summer) because I was in the military and I have the post 9/11 GI Bill. The GI bill is great! I love the benefits, I love the BAH, I love it. Problem is its running out. I have 9 months left. I'm not doing very well in school either. I have always had trouble with school. It's just not very interesting to me. 

The only classes that ever interest me are the ones that are exclusively about programming.

So, up till now the plan has been, go to school full time until gi bill runs out, get loans for the remaining semesters, get a job and quit retail. I was planning on quitting retail when I got an internship if possible, especially since most programming internships are paid.

Well, I was just offered full time and an assistant manager position, which would be almost a 50% raise. 

It makes sense because my gi bill is gonna be gone soon and the extra money will be great if I can't get an internship. On the flip side, if I take it I CAN'T get an internship, because school and 2 jobs is just too much. Also I don't even know if I'll be able to graduate since my grades are getting really bad. I **HATE** school.

**TL; DR** - I have 2 options:

• Stay full time in school, turn down the assistant manager position, and risk dropping out and losing the position to someone else.

• Drop Down to half time in school, take the assistant manager position and risk being harassed at work through my transition."

  **Lore:**
  A young alchemist, Mannik had discovered the ability to manipulate the life energies of plants and insects, using the vitality of a healthy organism to reanimate the life of a weaker, dying one. He used his abilities to transfer life energy back into dying things along the Serpentine River. Mannik enjoyed his abilities but as they matured and he was able to tamper with the energy of small animals, he became more and more dispassionate about them. Controlling life had taken its toll on Mannik and his curiosity for the dying turned into amusement as he began pointlessly syphoning life from any creature he stumbled upon. Mannik quickly developed a fascination for the Shadow Isles. Not just its' gloomy radiance but the ghastly creatures that inhabited it. Mannik was familiar with the effects his abilities had on physical living objects but he was interested in discovering the effects of his manipulation on a spectral being. His passion for commanding life turned into an obsession as Mannik decided he wanted to be able to instruct the very souls of any creature.
  With this new aspiration Mannik began training on bigger and bigger animals in the Howling Marsh until he felt his powers were as refined as attainable. During his quest, Mannik lost interest in expending life energy back into other organisms, storing it instead, and it began to seep out and radiate from his body. Finally journeying out to the Shadow Isles, Mannik wasted no time searching out a soul to syphon. When he began his life transfer his body began to break apart, the life energy that had been stored within him tore seams into his skin, deteriorating his physical frame and birthing a new spectral form. Manniks physical body manifested into gems which held all of his spectral life energy and floated in close proximity to his body. He immediately felt an immense surge of power through his body, as if he was connected to all living things around him. Being fed immense power from his newly acquired Soul Gems, Mannik began effortlessly conjuring spirits and syphoning energy of nearby organisms. Overzealous from his fortified abilities, he began to thirst for stronger souls to consume and dominate. With his new abundance of power and desire for more tenacious opponents, he ventured to a place he heard possessed the most formidable of foes; the League of Legends.

________________________________________________________________________________
  **Appearance:**
  

Imagine Doctor Manhattan (blue guy from Watchmen) but he looks more like a ghost, meaning he's a pale white color and slightly transparent. Is always floating with a straight up torso and loosely hanging legs, wears ripped up pants but they aren't ghostly. Kind of scrawny and has a grayish, white gloomy light radiating from him. Pale, greenish energy seeping from his eyes and the tears in his skin. No hair or facial hair. Has 5 gems floating close behind him similar to Irelias floating blades. Each gem is a very dark grayish color when not filled with energy, but glow a bright pale green when charged up.
________________________________________________________________________________
  **Animations:**

  *Death*- Looks up and pale green energy begins shooting out of his eyes and mouth as his gems fall one-by-one. The tears in his skin illuminate with bright pale green light. After all 5 have fallen, his body dissipates and his pants fall on top of the gems.

  *Attack*- Scratches by swinging his entire arm in an uppercut fashion. Instead of his hand connecting with the target, a ghostly, bigger hand appears as he swings and scratches the target for him.
Soul Tear (Passive)- Marked enemies will have a single spectral wisp strand on-top of their heads. When consumed the strand will quickly ball up and rapidly shrink in size as it moves toward Mannik to heal him.

  *Beyond the Grave (Q)*- Reaches back behind and beneath him. As he lifts up his hand to extend it in front of him towards his target, a spirit is raised from the ground and then shot at the target. As the spirit is raised it spirals around Manniks leg, then chest, and then the arm he has extended forward. When the ghost reaches the end of his arm, it will shoot forward at his target. The animation of him reaching back and the animation of the ghost spiraling around him will begin at the same time.

  *Purgatory (W)*- Slightly balls up while he charges the spell. On activation, the initial zone will glow a very bright white color and then soften to a dull, decrepit, pale greenish land. Enemies snared by the spell will have their feet held onto by ghosts/ghouls.

  *Resolved Perdition (E)*- Mannik raises a hand glowing with energy in the air and the second he begins to bring it down, a screaming, manic ghost will descend from the sky, spiraling as it hastily approaches the ground. It will be trailed by a ghastly afterimage for a split second. The ghost will fly straight through the ground but leave behind a faint white circle mark that will fade over a couple seconds (circle mark equivalent to the cursor to aim the spell).

  *Reanimate Soul (R)*- Pale green rope tethered to the enemies. The pale green energy in Manniks skin turns a much brighter shade during his ultimate.
_______________________________________________________________________________
  **Recommended:**
  

*Play*- Mage/Fighter. Try to poke down enemies as much as possible before having to engage. Always save up enough gems to be able to use Lvl 3 Purgatory for team fights. No real escapes so be weary of hard CC and high burst damage.
  

*Build*- Liandry’s Torment, Sorcerer boots, Spirit Visage, Will of the Ancients, Zhonya’s Hourglass, Rylai’s Crystal Scepter/Void Staff/Rabadons

  Had to make this guy for an internship that I applied for, hope you like him. Feedback would be greatly appreciated! Also, if you are good at art and enjoyed the champion, feel free to post pictures for Mannik himself or his abilities!

2lwxku,1,2014-11-10,Dad keeps borrowing my car...,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2lwxku/dad_keeps_borrowing_my_car/,"I'm currently a full-time college student. My parents got tired of me borrowing their cars to go to school and decided it was time for me to get my own. I found a car, it's not new and it was not expensive, and it was paid for by someone else as a gift to me. I have my own car, my mom has her car back; everyone's happy.

I have no job at the moment. I've applied to dozens, I'm enrolled full-time in school (graduating in about a year), and right now I'm doing an unpaid internship several days a week. My parents pay for the insurance on my car. I would love to be able to pay for it myself, but I just can't right now - at least not until I can get a job.

The problem now: my dad keeps borrowing my car. Now, I'm completely fine with them borrowing it! I mean, they're paying for my (expensive) insurance! His car is old, it's filthy, and it has no air conditioning. I understand why he would rather take my car - if I had a choice between mine and his, I'd take my car too! But he's becoming more and more demanding of it - expecting it, disrespecting it. The first weekend we brought it home, my parents borrowed it and spilled tea on my upholstery. I was upset and frustrated and their response? ""If you hop on it now, you might be able to minimize the staining."" When asked if they could help me clean it up, they responded ""Ugh, (*my name*).""

Since then, my dad has borrowed it every weekend. I told him I'd like to keep it clean and his go-to response is ""yeah, right."" I've had it for over a year and I've kept it impeccable, but thanks to my dad there are two new grease stains, giant sweat stains,  and a huge, brown tea stain as well as mud stains on my floor and a couple brand new dents and scratches on the body. Before each time he takes it, I remind him to please try to minimize the mess and I'm met with ""uh huh."" Very often it comes back just a little worse than when he left.

Recently he's taken to not asking me to borrow it. He'll ask if I'm using it at the moment (usually on evenings and weekends, when I'm obviously not using it). I'll tell him I'm not and he informs me he's taking it. Even *more* recently, he's stopped telling me where he's taking it. (When someone asks to borrow your car, it's normal to ask where they're going with it, right?) I'll ask where he's going and he'll say ""out."" I'll keep pressing and he will only repeat ""out"" or ask again if I'm currently using it and, if not, he's taking it to go *out*.

It's feels relevant to mention here that he has a history of wrecking cars. Just completely totalling them. I think he's totalled four, maybe more.

I've gone to my mother for help and she refuses to get involved. Her revolving responses are ""so?,"" ""well, we pay for it,"" and ""ugh, (*my name*), let it go!""

AAAAAAARGH!!! SO, REDDIT, HELP ME: I feel it's obvious that they don't respect my car or me. At what point is it okay to say enough is enough? Am I allowed to *not* allow my parents to borrow my car if they're the ones paying it off?

Thank you for any and all advice."
2lwzjy,1,2014-11-10,TIFU by ruining my chance of getting an internship,[deleted],tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2lwzjy/tifu_by_ruining_my_chance_of_getting_an_internship/,"This actually happened last Friday, but I just realized this story was worthy of a submission. I'm a senior in high school taking an advanced computer class with a few of my close friends. We took an all day field trip to Progressive last week to tour their IT department and to be scouted for an internship. To determine who they'll choose for the internship, the employees take notes on each of us based on how proactive we are and how well we represent ourselves. 

Anyhow, halfway through the tour they took us in groups for a bathroom break. One of my friends, Andy, was mid piss when he asked, ""Hey Dom, is there a handicap stall?"" Dom, who is another one of our friends, replies, ""Uhh..yeah...why?"" Andy then revealed he had a secret to share with us, and that the handicap stall was the perfect place for a ""team meeting."" Used to his antics, we waited until everyone had cleared the bathroom, and proceeded to cram ourselves into the stall.

Once all four of us we were in the stall (another friend was with us), we urged Andy to hurry up before anyone else came into the bathroom. For safety reasons, I wont divulge the details of the secret, especially since its irrelevant to the story. In an attempt at making a joke, I say loudly, ""Let's cross swords!"" Dom didn't like my joke, and told me he was going to punch me in the dick if we didn't get out of the stall immediately. As I push open the door, I'm greeted by a Progressive employee, who in a concerned voice says, ""uhh...what's going on in here?"" Shocked by his presence, I say, ""Er..just having a team meeting."" A disgusted look spreads across his face and he quickly turns around and makes a bee line for the door without saying another word.

We leave the bathroom in a fit of laughter. Dom, however, is not amused, and (jokingly?) tells us he hates us all. We proceed to join back up with the rest of our classmates. Throughout the rest of the day, the employee was making a visible effort to refrain from making eye contact with any of us. I also caught him whispering into a few of his colleague's ears what I assume was our awkward encounter. Needless to say, I don't think any of us will be getting that internship.

2lx0gs,1,2014-11-10,The Night Watchman,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2lx0gs/the_night_watchman/,"This is a story from way back when I was in graduate school in Nashville. I wasn't one of the fortunate few that got a funded research admission and so I always found myself searching for local part-time opportunities. These were neatly pipelined with other structured internships and life was good for the most part. I lived in a small studio apartment and managed to starve myself into a savings account. The slew of friends around me in class gave me good company, inviting me to movie nights and the odd hiking trips.

Not every job I worked at was great, obviously. Some paid less than others and some had the worst managers. The deceptive world of sales got me convincing old folks into buying overpriced cameras they never needed. Aside from the guilt I caught myself with, I also couldn't really find time during the day to work at remote consumer electronics stores. I was getting more involved in research around my second year and I primarily lived off of free food that was offered during featured seminars and other meetings on campus. So after a good deal of thought, I realized that I needed to find a part-time overnight job. I wasn't sleeping much as a graduate student and so I might as well get paid for it, right?

The next morning, I looked through entries on craigslist and found one that said ""Part Time Over Night Weekend Guard Job (Nashville)"" that paid around fifteen dollars an hour. Although I was hoping for a longer lasting job, this sounded like a good catch because I wasn't required to carry arms and I'd be getting nearly 400 dollars for just sitting around at night. Hoping to not lose my spot, I immediately replied to the post giving my name, age and phone number. Around lunch time that day, I got a lazy text message saying, ""Meet me at 6pm today. brik building by the bus station"".

Downtown, Nashville is a famously serene place compared to other downtown areas in the United States. At least this is the impression I got from mates who used to live there. Excited, I packed up some food and took the bus from campus, reaching just before sunset. I found the apartment building I was looking for, though there was no sign of activity and the front gate was padlocked. It was a humble red brick building that would've probably housed under 10 families. I waited by the stairs, eager to get started. After all, I wanted every dollar I could get.

Seemingly an hour later, a withered old lady slowly walked up the road to find me drowning in the well of boredom. ""Are ya here for the job?"" she said, almost begging for a response. ""Yeah. What's up with this place?"" I said, trying to hide my anger. Clearly the place was dead and nobody was around. There must have been some reason for ""guarding"" it?. She unlocked the door and pushed her way in. I followed her with patience.

The hallway in the first floor seemed cramped. A dusty reception desk stood beside a single dark elevator on the left and a rustic staircase directly in front of me. A locked door presented itself next to a row of mail boxes on the right. ""This is your room,"" she said, struggling to open it.

""There was a bad fire accident here a few weeks back. Some kitchen on the second floor. They closed down this place and the people here left. One guy on the third floor said he'd come by this weekend. William...um... Davis! William Davis. His stuff's still around I think. He hasn't been in Nashville this year. Gone to Germany or France or somethin'... You gotta wait around for him... Help him move if ya like"", she smirked.

Fetching a torchlight from her bag, she walked into the dark room. I followed her quietly, reminding myself ""Two nights. 360 dollars."" She opened a creaky wooden cupboard on the far corner to find some clothing. She found me a dark blue shirt, a damaged ID tag, a flashlight and some gloves. Handing me a pair of sealed battery packs, she said ""Use 'em on that lamp... You got a book or somethin you could read?""

I nodded, showing her the enthusiasm of a chronically bored cat. Ostensibly drained by all this, she started walking to the front door. Turning one last time, she handed me a spare set of keys and said, ""I'll see ya tomorrow mornin. Oh and... there's a... mart few blocks down the road I think.. If you wanna eat somethin.. Alright...""

Left alone, I felt an amalgam of emotions. Just thinking about the reception I got made me livid. She made me wait for more than an hour and didn't even ask for my name. ""Well... If you don't like it, leave tomorrow morning and you're still a good 200 dollars better than today,"" I said out loud. I switched on the desk lamp and positioned myself slowly on the weakly cushioned chair. I pulled out my phone and noticed a fading, crumbling screen looking back at me. I had no confidence that my phone would last the night with only 24% charge remaining.

The cluttered room was dark and the heat from the lamp kept me warm. Within minutes, my eyes adjusted to the blackness. The sharp corners of the surrounding furniture grabbed my attention. The broad window sill to my left hosted a conference of files, clips and dead plants. The dirty, smudged glass functioned as a portal to the bustling streets of downtown. ""The night's still young,"" I thought. Bathing in the tranquility of solitude, I realized the tiredness in my legs. I pulled out my copy of ""Mistborn: The Final Empire"" and slowly settled down, heaving a sigh of fatigue.

""I need a girlfriend.."", I thought to myself. It was almost 1 AM and my depression was setting in. This always happened when I read books. Characters in the fictional world made me both jealous and sad. Misery loves company and I certainly felt miserable. My friends in grad school were mostly engaged or married and here my life felt like a string of pointless jobs. As I lay there contemplating, an indescribable stench presented itself, almost extolling my train of thought. It was as though my brain couldn't decide if it wanted a commanding sneeze or a nauseating vomit, but I immediately stood up and ran to the door.

I brashly pushed the flimsy door open, coughing my way out. There was a man standing in front of me, aghast. He was a strapping middle-aged guy, easily 6 feet tall, wearing a brown leather jacket.

""Ugh.. um... Hi?"" I said, filling the air with confusion.

""Hey... Are you the security.. guard?"" he said.

""Yeah! Are you... Mr. Davis?"", I said, breathing heavily.

He nodded firmly. ""so.. Mrs. Colton told you about me? I'm here to get my stuff. I've parked my truck down the road,"" he said.

After a rigid handshake, ""Give me a sec... this place stinks..."" I said. I walked up to the door and slightly opened it. The repugnant stench was hardly noticeable. Surprised, I turned around and beckoned him to enter. He followed me into the security room. I handed him a flashlight and I picked up the lamp. ""We don't have any electricity here. We've got to use the stairs"", I said, wearing my gloves.

""That shouldn't be a problem. I only live in the second floor,"" he declared.

""Second Floor?"" I speculated, reviving my memories. ""Alright. Let's go.""

We walked up the apparently archaic staircase. Every step caused an intense creak, squeak and groan. Grating dust filled the air and William let out a jarring sneeze. I could swear he shook the whole building. A few steps later, I was startled by a very distinct and clear thump coming from directly above. This was followed soon after by another, much louder THUMP. I looked back at William with complete shock. His face was pale. I could hear my heart beating.

THUMP.... THUMP... THUMP.... THUD THUD THUD THUD

Both of us ran back down the stairs, shaking with terror. ""Hello?"", I yelled. The crashing sounds escalated. Both Will and I were pointing our lights at the staircase, breathing heavily. It felt like every *thud* resonated with my thrashing heart. With a sudden crash, a large sofa chair slid down and landed on the side of the stairs. I shrieked with panic and jumped backwards. The crash landing caused a violent dispersion of dust. ""God... Dammit!"" Will cried with annoyance.

I took a few steps back and tried to calm my senses. I was completely befuddled by the large piece of furniture that fell down the stairs. We waited for the dust to settle. ""Do you really want to get your stuff now?"" I pleaded.

""I'm already here..."" he said. It was almost another twenty minutes before I stopped shaking. I looked at my watch and then at Will. He nodded at me and we decided to walk up. It was getting late and neither of us wanted to be there. We walked up the stairs, one step at a time and reached the second floor. There were four doors in front of us. Two to the right and two to the left. ""Which one's yours?"" I asked. ""The last one on the right,"" he said. The air on the second floor was oppressively muggy compared to the floor below.

We walked swiftly to the end of the hallway. The white door on the right had a rusty badge. ""Apartment 204,"" I said. Will pulled out his key chain and fiddled around until he found the right key. He opened the large door, revealing a wide living room. We walked in together, scanning the surroundings. I was growing flustered by the smell emanating from the room.

""Let's see what we can take"", Will stated. I walked up to the end of the living room and pulled up the blinds. I was able to see the empty road below. ""Freedom... soon..."" I thought, trying to stay calm. There were a few assorted sofa chairs next to us, all facing a television. A vacuum cleaner, an ironing board and a shoe stand stood on the far corner. 

The carpet on the floor felt rough and sticky. I surveyed the room with my lamp, identifying objects around me. I noticed tonal inconsistencies in the walls. The living room seemed alright but the walls by the front door looked heavily damaged. Distinct tears that looked almost like scratch marks, bedecked the wall leading up to the kitchen. ""The accident was just a few weeks back. The walls here seem heavily... damaged... It has to be this apartment..."" I thought.

Will was searching through boxes in the closet next to me. The closet looked pristine in comparison to the rest of the house. I walked up to the kitchen, noticing photo magnets on the fridge. The fridge itself was mostly charred and rusty. The magnets were even less colorful. I was looking for a sign. Anything that would give me clues on Will's life here. My eyes darted towards the cabinet door above the sink. There was something unique about this door. The handle looked predominantly unscathed. I opened the door slowly, trying not to make a sound. My eyes sharpened as I observed a photograph stuck on the inside. It was a picture of William, standing on a cliff. I wanted to inquire about this photo but I stopped myself. I saw Will floating past me and into the bedroom on the right. 

""Hah... I might need two trips... This mattress still looks good,"" he said. I followed his voice and walked in, finding Will staring at a single large king-sized bed. The bed was creamy white with really no sign of use. There was a dressing table to the right, revealing a gathering of perfumes and lotions. Will was searching through drawers trying to find something. I was growing increasingly suspicious. I did not really know who he was and I did not know if someone died here. 

I turned around and walked back into the kitchen. I wanted to find more ""artifacts"". I must have been drunk, or at least critically hungry because the cabinet looked different. The kitchen was structurally the same but the cabinet had no doors. I was stunned by the complete lack of stock presented by the darkness in front of me. I stood there for a minute, convincing myself I was tired. The longer I stayed there, the more dazed I felt. I was breathing heavily now. I strolled past the sofas and towards Will. I spotted a door opposite the bedroom. The door knob looked stale and felt cold. I pushed open the worn slab of wood. I could swear my heart stopped. Standing there in front of me, was a woman. She was wearing a red sleepshirt and staring right at me. The light from my lamp revealed her burnt face. Her head was severely scalded. Her eyes were certainly dead. She was holding what appeared to be a green detergent bottle on one hand and a kitchen torch on the other. 

LUB DUB LUB DUB LUB DUB  

I heard my heart beating. I felt fear down my spine and I was visibly sweating. I fell to my knees and froze, gasping for breath. I started shivering. I felt an icy grip around my neck and I was gawking at the tiled floor. I couldn't move. I felt suffocated. My eyes closed. 

I suddenly felt roused. I was aware of my surroundings and I caught myself standing. I was staring at Will. He was looking through files in a clearly random trunk. I looked at the tall mirror by the dressing table. ""What... am I holding?"" I asked myself, altogether horrified. I was sauntering towards Will. I knew I wasn't controlling myself. My face was gravely stinging but I couldn't scream. I raised my left leg and kicked Will in the head. His forehead slammed against the handle on the trunk and he fell flat. I saw myself clumsily pouring a yellowish green liquid from the bottle I was holding. Utterly frightened, I closed my eyes. 

""Aaahhh..."" I wailed. Sunlight beamed at me from the left. I looked at my watch. ""7:30?!...What the..."" I thought. I hopped up quickly. My head hurt and I was standing in a dusty room, wearing a dark blue shirt. I grabbed my bag and walked out. I noticed the musky reception desk in front of me. I was shaking. I felt cold. I pulled out my phone, with extreme consternation. ""16% charge,"" I gasped. I disrupted my bag trying to find the strips of paper Mrs. Colton gave me. My eyes widened with fear. I found a photograph. "
2lx1dt,48,2014-11-10,Remember when healthcare was run by healthcare professionals? Pepperidge Farm remembers.,khoala374,TalesFromThePharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePharmacy/comments/2lx1dt/remember_when_healthcare_was_run_by_healthcare/,"This isn't much of a rant as much as it is trying to figure out the logic of having retail healthcare being run by economists...


It's a typical Monday. We kick off the week with a bang as the Out Of Stock (OOS) orders from Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night arrive for filling in the morning and we still have warehouse totes from the previous Wednesday and Saturday still needing to be picked up that are piled up in our pharmacy...


I'm working at drop-off and staff start arriving... more techs, and another pharmacist. It's right around mid-day and we are nearly at our peak staffing point during the day before there simply isn't any more stations/computers for anyone to work at (this includes 2 pharmacists, 1 pharmacist intern, and 5 techs). It's so busy that me, the pharmacist intern, AND one of the pharmacists is working drop-off stations. I get ready to resolve all the issues that came up with insurances, folding the hard-copy scripts, and cleaning up my station... and our weekend pharmacist slides an email print out over to me and said ""here, this is for you to read"" and I immediately knew it was a bad sign just based on the way he said it so I stopped everything I did save folding scripts because it folding scripts doesn't need my full attention. The email cites specifically me and him (the pharmacist) in a complaint from Saturday in the early AM. Now I Don't remember much from Saturday morning because as soon as we rolled up the gates, there were already people in line for both pick-up, drop-off, and the phones started blowing up, right at opening hour on the dot. 


The complaint said that somewhere on Friday morning (a day in which I was not working), one of our techs had told the customer that we (the pharmacy) would contact his doctor for more refills on his Rx, which by definition means we send an e-Fax unless otherwise requested by either the doctor or the customer. The complaint also went on to say that our staff said it would be ready by early morning on Saturday (the morning in which I worked). The complaint continued on to say that when he arrived on Saturday morning, the guy at pick up was unfriendly, telling him that his script was not filled because his system already said it was filled on the &lt;date&gt;th of October, even though it was filled on the &lt;recent date&gt;. Typically, I try to help our staff and our pharmacist out by swinging over to another computer to check so they don't have to go down to drop-off to check, but I distinctly remember that we were so slammed on Saturday morning that there was no way in which I could have left the pick-up window to check for him real quick on another computer. So this raises many flags telling me that he may have seen my name tag but doesn't remember any of any other staff names. He cited another tech's name that helped him resolve the issue.. So let's start with the problems with these complaints...


I) When you come to pick up to pick up a script, the screen simply shows me 3 things related to your Rx: Rx number, drug, and price (not quantity, fill date, or who the doctor was, or when the script was even called in or brought in). So there was no way 'the person at pick up telling me it was filled on the 29th was being unfriendly"" was even valid... 


II) The other tech that the customer claimed ""helped him resolve the issue"" was not even working on Saturday. Our cameras and her punch log can even show you that she wasn't working that day.


III) The Rx that he complained about that wasn't ready?... The email stated that it was resolved by him asking us to inactivate it.. So yes... He complained about a script not being ready that he wasn't even taking anymore... 



I helped countless numbers of people on Saturday as we were completely slammed and were struggling to stay on our feet. I only remember one unfavorable customer who seemed irritated that things were taking forever when essentially every script we had that day was a waiter... and that unfavorable interaction that I tried to resolve on Saturday, was with a female. Our current acting PIC even showed me the name of the pt in question and I don't even remember talking to someone with that name on that day or dealing with an irritated male (at least not a male irritated to make a scene big enough for it to stand out in my mind). 


So queue the manager checking the cameras and then calling the pharmacy the split second after I finished reading the email telling our acting PIC that she checked the camera logs and that I did help a male at around the time the complaint was filed at... Now I'd really like to know how our store manager seeing that I helped a male at the time of the complaint in question settles the case that I was the one who irritated this man enough to have him call our corporate office and complain. 


And apparently it was time for our monthly review also so our acting PIC mentioned that since she had me there talking to her about this interaction in question, she pull my review file from the past month to see how I was doing. She and I had already decided that this was all too confusing to really put the blame on anyone since she commented on how she always notices how much I try to help people resolve their issues right at pick-up to avoid having them go to any other line and wait again. She looks at my performance review and is befuddled as to how my performance has been nearly flawless, yet still improving, and yet this guy filed a complaint specifically against me. The two just didn't connect and she still went on to comment on how there really wasn't anything I could improve on (aside from miscellaneous mistakes here and there such as processing scripts (ie: there are both capsules and tablet form of a drug and I accidentally typed it up for the wrong type. sig was wrong for one where the doctor wrote film so I naturally thought it was sub-lingual but it was a patch....) or I typed up an Rx for an ointment instead of a cream since the NDC numbers were slightly off). I do talk slightly fast and so she said I should work on that. 


I'm still trying to make sense of it all and am wondering what will happen since I've never had a complain filed against me when I was working... I did have one complain back at my old store from a customer who complained about my service on a day that I wasn't even working according to my punch log, my school schedule, and the camera.. yet the store manager was still trying to blame me for the complaint... 


I miss the days when healthcare was run by healthcare professionals.....

tl;dr - corporate is lightning fast to act on complaints but will not even acknowledge compliments sent in by customers (yes, I've actually had a few customers come back to ask me if I received anything from corporate for the compliment they sent in about me. And as much as I wanted to tell them ""no, that's not how corporate works. we only get contacted about complaints, not compliments"". I simply smiled and told her that I hadn't)


Also.. for those of you who have not seen this yet...

2lx34b,1,2014-11-10,Overall this article sucks and here are the reasons why and what I think Seventeen got wrong.,[deleted],TaylorSwift,https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/2lx34b/overall_this_article_sucks_and_here_are_the/,"First,  I would like to begin with this article's introduction;

""Up until about two weeks ago, we'd washed away the memory and sort of tried to forget that Harry Styles and Taylor Swift were ever a thing. Then TayTay decided to shove the (admittedly ridiculously amazing) 1989 album down our throats, and it's all ""Haylor"" this and ""Haylor"" that all over again.

Everyone believes that a lot of the lyrics on Swifty's new album are actually about Harry, and we thought we'd take a look at the 10 least subtle hints at him, like, ever.""

I'm sorry, but I do not see anywhere on Seventeen's website or  in their magazines that also advertises as much Taylor hate with choice of words as this article exhibits. Because I don't know about you but this article is not in any way presenting its self as objective from this introduction.

Everyone believes that a lot of the articles on Seventeen's social media accounts are legitimate news about celebrities, so I thought I'd take a look at why this one isn't, like, at all.

1. I don't have any immediate objections to this one because I mean the comparison of the cheesy high school picture day smile picture of Harry versus the most creepy animated psychedelic cheshire cat picture your intern could find on the assigned data base could cough up are legitimate enough all in themselves. 

2. &lt;.&lt; &gt;.&gt; ...........what?
The lyric quoted here is from the song Blank Space ""Saw you there and I thought 'Oh my God look at that face. You look like my next mistake...'"" which is about Taylor picking on how the media picks on her by making up things about her, and twisting little tiny pieces of information into much bigger larger things that dont exist. Also shout out to your intern again on the gifs from the archives.

3. I agree, yes that lyric may or may not be about Harry Styes in that situation right there in that picture. 

4. Could you have maybe cut my favorite ginger a little bit of slack on this one and possibly not have chosen to use a screen shot with such harsh use of language, he's a good lad.

5. I also love fox sweaters Taylor, holla!

6. Wait, you went to Claire's, the young girl's boutique, to get a matching night where you moved the furniture so you could dance? Because that's what the line quoted here is referring to. 

We don't know what the actual necklace is in this lyric here, and if it's someone else's necklace that she is wearing whom she would sing this song about then it would not also make Taylor love you the same way because you're wearing the same necklace. That's weird to think, and now I know why she has to have all the time security now. 

7. I'm assuming that the two separate photos of Taylor and Harry wearing the same necklace is for this number because this picture has absolutely nothing to do with number 6 and if you think it does then refer to number 2. The photos are a good connection to this lyric and it has probability of having to do with it. 

psno7: If the intention was for these photos to be used for both numbers 6 and 7 then I think you need to have a talk with your intern, because that seems lazy, you're Seventeen magazine after all!

8. Apologize to your intern for me, she/he did not try to put one photo for both 6 and 7, your picture placer in articles guy was slacking on his job because this gif was meant to go with the introduction. 

9. There's nothing 'freak' about a snowmobile accident, it's scary and a real world thing that happens. 

10. I think that this is the thought where this entire article's idea came from and this should have just been a tweet instead. "

I'm a pretty green comic, coming up on about a year in December. I go to college in a relatively small city and have done well there. Nothing crazy, but I've been in a few shows and have made a good amount of friends.

Anyway, I'm gonna graduate in December and am lucky enough to have an opportunity to move to either LA or Chicago.

My parents now live in Chicago and I would be able to live with them, rent free, for as long as I want (hopefully not more than a year). If I move home, I could get a, probably unpaid, internship in my field, or a chill job (barista, bagging groceries whatever), and go to open mics at night.

I also have a buddy who lives in Los Angeles and would be willing to rent me a room for really cheap. I can also afford to buy a car. Of course, I know I'd have to get a job and most likely work way more hours than I would in Chicago to support myself (which would probably mean less time for writing). 


Ultimately, I just want to get better at stand up. My LA friends tell me I should come here because, although Chicago has a great comedy scene, I'll be able to network a lot more. However, I've also heard (from a few very experienced comics), that LA is pretty hard on newbies as most places are booking dudes who are already signed.

Of course, then I have a few people who tell me I should just say fuck both places and move to NYC. 

I know hard work trumps location every time, but I'd love input from people who know either city. "

I come here today with nowhere else to turn as one of my greatest fears that I knew would come true someday is now a reality. I am an 18 year old college sophomore, studying computer science at a top tier state university in the U.S. Northeast. I am waiting to hear back from a decently high paying internship in my area for this summer. I don't come from very much at all; my parents are divorced and dad abandoned us. I am on a large scholarship and financial aid to pay my in-state tuition and am borrowing the rest. I should owe around $30,000 in low-interest federal loans once I graduate. School is going great and I love it; I am in a fraternity and getting great grades, have a fantastic girlfriend, that is not the problem. The problem is my family that I love so much. 

My sister who is a senior in highschool is doing just fine and will be likely attending an in-state university on a very good scholarship as well next year, I am not worried about her. My mother who has done everything for me and my family since I was born has fallen terminally ill and sadly will not be around for very much longer. My older brother has had severe bi-polar disorder since he was in his late  teens, he is now 26 years old. He is completely unable to care for himself and lives at home with my mother who caters to his every need. He has severe anxiety and no longer leaves the house for any reason, he also has almost zero friends or connections to the outside world. My mother is a retired mortgage broker, and my brother collects disability. We are not wealthy at all, and live paycheck to paycheck. However, we do own a home in an affluent neighborhood and two cars outright, with absolutely no CC debt; my mother also has absolutely zero savings, though. My mother has talked to me and says that I am outright in charge of everything as I am very responsible and am heading down the right path. My brother's mental illness is quite severe, and he has suffered from horrible addiction to heroin, alcohol, pill, and any other drug you can imagine. I have saved his life twice coming home from school and finding him overdosing. He is currently about a year sober on everything (I am so proud of him), except marijuana. He refuses to stop smoking marijuana, and does so multiple times a day, and claims it is the only think that keeps him sane and prevents him from being suicidal and not want to do hard drugs. I can attest to this as I have seen the difference in his behavior. However, medical marijuana does not exist in my state currently, and my mother is forced to illegally fund his habits. It is extremely expensive, around $500-600 a month to fund his habit, and even though we don't have much money, my mother budgets it to prevent him from going haywire and keep him calm. He says he absolutely cannot work and refuses to do anything around the house. He smokes weed and plays video games all day. My mom has told me he brings in about $1400 a month with his disability but he costs upwards of $2000 a month for all his needs, factoring in a potential rent. My mother has made me promise to not abandon him, and I love my brother more than anything in the world. I do not want to see him suffer and I just wish for him to be as happy as I am. I am just at a total loss at this extremely stressful, painful, frustrating, and sad time in my life. I have engineering final exams, a terminally ill mother, terrible financial status, and a brother who is mentally ill and I just am at my breaking point. I feel as though I could take care of myself with absolutely no problem and live a very happy life, I have a girlfriend and many great friends. I have always been very independent and never required help from anyone; I was raised without a father and have basically been the man of my house since 10-12 years old. However, It is not that simple, and I am responsible for my family and just do not know what to do. I come here to Reddit for advice and just to talk to someone, I have nowhere to turn and just am desperate for some help. Please, any feedback to just make me feel better or any advice on how I can cope or help my brother or set up a living arrangement for him. I just don't know what I can be expected to do. I cannot care for him like my mother does, and I cannot financially support him at all. I fear if I tell him he has to live on his own and take care of himself he will commit suicide, which he has attempted several times and is basically is what he is insisting will happen when my mother passes. With my part-time job at school I am just barely able to support myself at the moment, many times my girlfriend who is very fortunate to have an extremely wealthy family helps me out, not because I ask but just because she loves me so much. Thank you to all those that can respond, just someone to talk with would make me feel so much better; and any advice is beyond appreciated.

TL;DR My brother has bi-polar, mom is terminally Ill, in a bad position fiscally, and I really don't know what to do"

2ly36l,2,2014-11-11,best friend is regularly suicidal and it takes its toll on me,friendmisery,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2ly36l/best_friend_is_regularly_suicidal_and_it_takes/,"My best friend is regularly suicidal. It's really taking it's toll on me. I don't think ""burden"" is the right word, for any depressed folk out there who open up to their close friends. I care about her a lot and I am happier if she talks to me. So telling me about her troubles is not a burden per se. But, she goes through these cycles and she's been in a pretty low one for a while, and there are all these suicide scares where she feels really shitty and tells me about it, and it makes my life really fucking stressful.

She's working on a PhD and she hates her major. Her parents are (in my opinion) assholes. She has hardcore impostor syndrome, and has refused to socialize so far, which does not help matters. Her uni is across the country from me, and she has not made a single new friend since she has been there (at least 4 months). We have one mutual friend who is in the area, but they are not very reliable. That means I have no one to contact if something truly horrible happens, and no one who I can rely on to check up on her. 

There is all this advice about ""how to look for the signs of suicide"". No looking necessary for me; by now I can tell moderately well when she is there, though it is sometimes hard to tell how intense it is. I try to talk her down as best as I can, but I can't always do it. There is lots of advice about ""taking action"", but if I do this even once I will probably alienate her and she will never open up to me in the future. I'm the only one she talks to regularly, and the only one she talks to about her depression/suicidal feelings, so I do not think it is safe to have her cut me out. It would be easier, to hand her off to some professionals and say it's their job, but I'm not convinced it would work unless she was willing and I'm not willing to take that risk. So instead, I stand at the sidelines and hope that nothing goes wrong and that she can be talked down, all the time.

Recently she's started having these breakdowns during work hours (for me), too. I work a pretty demanding full-time professional job and it's not really acceptable for me to be on gchat talking to friends during the day. Today I just gave up and stepped out to talk at her for half an hour, but this can't always be done. I spent a lot of last summer doing something similar (chatting with her all day to try and be Around) and it really fucked with my work life/career. Luckily that was an internship, and so I was able to leave in August, know I had fucked up, and vow to do better next time. Now that it's ""next time"", and it's a full-time job that I can't just leave, I feel like the slippery slope is starting again. On one hand, a person's life should be worth more than job prospects, right? On the other hand, what if this time it wasn't her life, it was just (""just"") her depression, and I am fucking up my own career that I have worked hard for to talk to her. On the other other hand, what if I don't talk to her and she gets more miserable and that triggers a suicidal spell, and I could have helped if I had just taken some time for her earlier. What if? 

I also worry that letting her be dependent on me is bad for her. I'm sure it's bad for me. But for her -- what if I'm not there once and she takes it personally. I like to think that she won't, but you never know. Also, it's generally not good for a human being to be dependent on another one. We're not even romantically involved (anymore, ha). I'm trying to nudge her to find a therapist so that there's another line of defense. And also because she definitely, definitely could use some professional help. This is really hard though because she doesn't trust doctors, and her parents have ingrained in her this massive stigma against mental illness and going to a therapist would ""make it real"" that she has mental illnesses to fight. At this point, I'm basically waiting it out until I don't even know what. Until she makes some real friends in her actual uni, instead of online friends and me, across the country? And possibly goes into an upswing/stabilizes and I can also have some peace for a while. Ideally, until she finds a fucking therapist and then the weight will be truly shifted. 

I have no one to tell. I could tell my other close friend, and she would understand what I'm going through and how hard it is, but I guess... I don't want to ""burden"" her either. I will never tell the friend in question. I kind of want to find a therapist for myself but I don't know how to start. This is kind of a start, maybe.

I'm sure I have my own issues too, which compound the situation. I seem to have picked up some stupid martyr like tendencies from my father, so I am happy to suffer in silence. It sounds awful but I get some weird kick out of her depending on me -- not a sexual kick or anything but an emotional one. Probably filling some insecurities of my own be letting me feel needed and thus wanted/valuable/friend-worthy. I know that's bad for me I don't really know how to fix it. 

Everything is just a mess right now.

EDIT: and yes, I am sure she's going through worse than I am. I am lucky enough not to struggle with depression. I'll survive. I don't make it all about me when I talk to her, but I am now, because I have to sometime."
2lz03n,6,2014-11-11,A different style of RP? Discuss!,Ballom,Netrunner,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netrunner/comments/2lz03n/a_different_style_of_rp_discuss/,"I've played RP for some time now as my #1 deck (I always have 2 of each side). It got me thinking that the current click taxing glacier is powerful. It also won worlds (congratz there by the way)! So it is strong. However, I used to play it a different style when I made my first list. I'm now thinking about testing it out with the addition of some new cards.

My old build was really weird... Don't hate guys! I rand Future Perfect, NAPD, and Fetal as my Agendas. Don't ask why no Nisei, it was my first draft of the deck :D anyhow, the deck had a lot of kill potential in addition to its taxing playstyle.

Anyhow here's a sample list (not final in any way)

Jinteki: Replicating Perfection   45/15


Agendas: 9

* 3x Future Perfect
* 3x Fetal AI
* 3x Nisei Mk II


Assets: 9

* 3x Sundew
* 3x Mental Health Clinic
* 3x Jackson  *   *   * 


Operations: 9

* 3x Hedge Fund
* 3x Celebrity Gift
* 1x Interns
* 2x Enhanced Login Protocol  * *   * * 


Upgrades: 4

* 3x Caprice
* 1x Ash  * * 


ICE: 18

Code Gate: 7

* 3x Lotus Field
* 1x Quandry
* 1x Enigma 
* 2x Tollbooth  * *    * * 

Sentry: 6

* 2x Tsurugi
* 2x Komainu
* 2x Pup


Barrier: 

* 1x Himitsu-Bako
* 1x Wall of Thorns (I run Ashigaru in my standard RP)
* 1x Wall of Static
* 2x Eli 1.0  *    * 



The general idea is to be threatening with net damage kills as well. I'd love to get in some more damage, like maybe get in a Mamba or two and maybe push the Tsurugi count to three. With my very first, no Nisei Mk II, deck I got kills quite often with Komainu -&gt; HQ -&gt; Fetal. So I thought this could be a neat idea. 



Also nice to start some discussion here again! Thoughts, comments or ideas welcome! "

My parents still support me so my income really only goes toward clothes, hobbies, and sometimes food. I work at a family owned comic book store and it SUCKS. I have been working there for 5 months and still make 8 dollars an hour, have no breaks unless I work over 6 hours (which combined with my lunch at 12 and then I don't eat again until 10 is just straight up unhealthy), and I work 5 days out of the week (monday, wednesday, and friday after school) and on the weekends I work pretty much all day. My co workers are also pretty terrible, they are mostly older than me and really don't have future plans like I do. They make fun of me sometimes because I am in college and want to leave that place. A lot of the times they say every job will be this bad (the management here is a complete joke) but I know that is not true. 

I am in the process of getting an internship with the help of my high school track coach who works in the IT sector and my dad who has some connections with hospital and police department IT staff as he has worked for multiple departments. Overall I think my chances of an internship soon are pretty good and I also have a CISCO IT cert. already. 

Should I just quit my job and focus on school and maybe taking some online courses about computer support? I just feel like I am wasting my time with this dead end retail job. I am just worried it will look bad on my resume if I have a month or two gap in employment

EDIT: Probably the biggest reason I want to quit as well is that I have zero free time and its affecting my health (cant run or cycle) and between school and work I have no days off and very little time to sleep. An average day for me is wake up at 6 school until 2:30 work at 3 until 9:30 then no time after really "
2lz6iw,24,2014-11-11,Got fired as a design intern after some gossip got around... but why?,[deleted],talesfromdesigners,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromdesigners/comments/2lz6iw/got_fired_as_a_design_intern_after_some_gossip/,"I just found this sub.  Even though this story is *years* old, I figured this was a good place to get some feedback, out of pure curiosity.  I don't have any hang-ups about how this all went down, but I still wonder sometimes why things panned out this way...

I was an intern with a designer.  I was still in school, getting paid and getting class credit.  My boss was doing a volunteer project, alongside many other designers.  This project was pretty large-scale, time consuming, and costly, but potentially great publicity.  I worked on it almost exclusively during my internship.  

My boss was very casual and candid with me on many things.  She told me how much she made, on average per year, and other pricing structures in her business.  I was writing weekly logs and having twice weekly meetings with my professor for the internship, to round out the class credit requirements.  When he found out the numbers she told me, he said she was *way* under earning for geographical norms and her length of time in business, and that I should prepare to be suddenly let go because it was obvious (to him) she can't afford to keep me on.

Not long after that, my boss speaks to me about my hours, and asks if I have anything secondary lined up.  I tell her I might go grab a retail job, or get back into the restaurants to make ends meet until I graduate.  She encourages me to do so for my own sake, saying she's not able to give me anything additional and doesn't want to lead me on (in terms of job advancement).  Then, she starts calling me off shifts with only 2-3 hours notice, telling me not to come in.  My weekly hours dwindle by about half.  My professor called this with impeccable accuracy.

My boss still lets me come in for certain shifts.  When I am working one day (alone), I run into one of the other designers in the volunteer project.  He starts to ask about my ambitions and if my current boss will keep me long term.  I tell him I'm seeking out a restaurant job to supplement.  He seems appalled and asks why I would do that.  I say my hours have been depleting, and that my boss has already given me a heads up that my hours won't increase.  Plus, I'm not even done with school yet.  He says he thinks my boss should give me more hours and keep me as a junior designer, or something like that.  I clarify that it's not really a problem, because I acknowledge she's a single owner/operator and this volunteer project (in particular) takes a lot of money out of her pocket.  He heartily sympathizes, saying he and his partner have spent upwards of $10k on their piece of the volunteer project.  

Less than a week later, I get an angry call from my boss firing me.  She says that the other designer told her I had said she's too poor to keep me on staff, and that I was too ""toxic"" to keep around and should be cut loose immediately.  I'm shocked and confused.  She does allow me to explain my version of the conversation that took place between myself and the other designer, but then says that our stories don't match and concludes she doesn't have a choice but to let me go.  She asks me why he would lie to her (and I don't have an answer because, she's right... why would he lie?).  Ultimately, she is unapologetic about letting me go.  She was a highly emotional sort, and got really wound up about this.  She even called my school to get my class credit pulled (she didn't succeed).

This event didn't single-handedly put me off of my field of study, but was a major factor in how my career evolved.  I've never worked in design, and this event told me I didn't want to.  Even outside of this event, I found most designers to be catty, backstabbing bitches who do nothing but talk smack and sabotage each other.

But as far as *how* this all happened... I've always wondered if this was a power play by the other designer to get inside my boss's head, a great excuse for my boss to let me go because she clearly couldn't afford to pay me any longer, or just a huge misunderstanding that my overly emotional boss couldn't fully comprehend.  

Again, feedback here is just out of morbid curiosity.  No ""closure"" or vengeance being sought; it was a long time ago.  You folks work in the industry, I don't and never will.  I figure tossing this out there might give me some insight, just for the hell of it.

**TL;DR** I got sacked as an intern when one designer took something I said, twisted it around, and told my boss I was a cancer.  Unsure about reasons."

2lza9j,14,2014-11-11,My Bipolar I story.,dootmore,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/2lza9j/my_bipolar_i_story/,"I have a chemical imbalance.

I inherited it genetically from my father. He inherited it from his mother. In the early 80s he was diagnosed with manic depressive disorder, as it was then called, after my grandmother hung herself while hospitalized for the same condition. She inherited it from her mother who also committed suicide. My father has been hospitalized multiple times for suicidal thoughts. He has never made an attempt to my knowledge.

My parents were open about my father’s condition. We knew he was prone to extreme mood swings and that our college saving were tucked away in stock accounts to keep them away from his spending sprees. Sometimes we wouldn’t see him for days as he laid immobilized by depression. When he did attempt to come out his room his manic tendencies led him into rages of anger expressed towards my mother, my sister, and sometimes my brother and I. He wasn’t present in my childhood, unable to come to my choir concerts and marching band events. I was scared of him and what he was capable of doing.

I took this fear with me everywhere.

I lied to my teachers. I cheated on tests. I forged signatures. I bullied and bossed my peers around. I trusted no one. I started having sex at a young age. I was unable to hold a relationship. I rejected society.

I left for college.

All my savings were lost in the stock crash. I took out $35k+ in loans to support my education. This was my fresh start. To leave it all behind and become a person that no one had known before. I made new friends. I found a new boyfriend, but by my junior year I was puttering out. I began sleeping all day and all night. Only leaving the house for work. I hated getting in my car and going anywhere. Just completely numb. These symptoms started appearing more and more, on and off for the next two years.

I graduated and moved to the city.

I was in love. I had my dream internship. I had my first own apartment. I was a contestant in a nationwide design competition. I moved to New York to start my dream job. I lived in Brooklyn and reveled every day I had in the most beautiful place I had ever lived.

…but every night after work I would go home and sleep for two hours. Wake up, watch tv, and go back to sleep. Every night for six months. Until I decided to find a new apartment, dump the man I was seeing, start exercising, start online dating. Get dumped, go on another date, run, going on another date, run, skip work, run, go on a date, run, write, sleep, write, skip work…

Until I spiraled out of control.

Control; to determine the behavior or supervise the running of.

I lost control of my mind.

Completely.

Hallucinations
Delusions
Paranoia
Increased Energy
Thoughts of conspiracy
Elevated Mood
Emotional lability
Diagnosis: Bipolar Type I with psychotic mania.

One month in the hospital. Five months total off work. I was forced to quit my job and move back in with my parents while I stabilized. Keep in mind I was between the ages of 22-25, 120lbs, 5’3″–I tried many drug cocktails over the beginning months/years:

4 weeks-Depakote + Risperadol – dangerously lowered my blood pressure to the point of fainting and intense sleep

1 week-lamictal + Wellbutrin – sent me back into mania

1 week-Seroquel – dangerously lowered my blood pressure to the point of fainting and intense sleep

1 year- Lithium + Geodon – Finally stabilized me, but caused increased anxiety

1 year- Lithium + Latuda – Best combination I’ve been on, but very expensive

Currently: going through a switch recommended by my doctor for a long-term, one-drug plan (since long-term lithium use can cause a variety of health problems). Tapering off the lithium to only 80mg of Latuda.

Now

While I was in college Seroquel was released and my dad stabilized for the first time in over 20 years. Having the experience of seeing what this illness can do to someone I take my condition very seriously. My day is split into a routine:

Wake up at 7:15am
8am take pills
Eat lunch at noon
Eat dinner at 6pm
Workout every other day for one hour.
8:30pm take pills
In bed by 9pm.
Everyday.

I limit my caffeine and alcohol consumption and smoke marihuana on a social basis only. Losing control of my thoughts was the worst experience I’ve ever felt. I never want to go through that again, ever. I live every day carefully assessing myself and my moods. I work only the hours necessary to perform my job while still making an effort to go above and beyond.

I have now been stable for over two years since my diagnosis. No depression, no mania. I have a solid relationship with my partner and a job that I love dearly. I hope to never go back.

2lzvo6,5,2014-11-11,No one to talk to,WaronDrugs010101,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2lzvo6/no_one_to_talk_to/,"I've always held suicide close as a sort of eject button. It was easy to put it aside when I was 18-23 because I was still in school and had hopes for the future. But over the past two years things just keep slipping downwards. Every job I held fell apart within a month of me getting it, sometimes my own doing sometimes not. I've had less than $100 at a given time for a year and a half. I've recently moved back into my moms house, and my longtime car finally broke down so now I'm stuck. I applied to an internship with my dream company, Fantasy Flight Games, which would require a move to Minnesota. I busted my ass trying to make money for the move, and I knew it was going to be close. Due to a technical issue from elance (my only inflow of money) I lost over a weeks worth of work which put me too far behind to afford the move, so even if I do get the internship (which I think I have a good chance of getting) I wont be able to take it. I'll be stuck at home for who knows how long waiting for the next opportunity.

I'm diagnosed bi-polar with a tendency to cut myself. Cutting myself is weird. I can't explain why it helps. It's like a control thing. Like even if my life is in shambles and I don't have the control to fix it I can at least control this one small part of myself. My physical body. I'm fully medicated which doesn't prevent suicidal tendencies, it just prevents the emotions that lead to suicidal tendencies. I'd love to feel happy or sad, or anything, but I'm left with this numb sterile emotion. I'd give anything to break down and cry. Just to weep openly and uncontrollably would be nice. I've been listening to the Barenaked Ladies 'War on Drugs' on repeat because it gets me the closest to feeling anything. I wanted to share that song on facebook, as kind of a half-way pathetic way of reaching out, but it'd go mostly ignored and anyone that does puzzle out the meaning would just worry.

I want to tell someone in my life but it'd just worry them. They'd demand I'd go to a hospital to get treatment. I've been admitted to a hospital twice, once my own doing once a shitty doctor's doing. There's no help to be found there. At best you get a medicated vacation from work, at worst you get locked up in a prison like atmosphere where the staff couldn't give a shit about you so long as you don't die. I told myself I'd kill myself before I go to a hospital again. So I can't talk about my feelings with my parents cause they'd tell me to go to a hospital. I certainly can't ever trust a doctor again. I've called the suicide hotline and all they did was try to get me in therapy, which eventually just loops back to hospitals.

The shittiest part of it all is I don't think I have the guts to kill myself. I know I can take the pain. The cutting has prepared me for at least that. Its just the permanence Im afraid of. I'd like to imagine that good times are right around the corner, but every small sign of good news is quickly squelched by the brunt reality of losing whatever small thing I might have been able to hold onto.

I just don't know what else to do. I wish I had the courage to die. But I'm weak. I feel like a poorly designed person. Unable to cope with the responsibilities of living, unable to cope with the permanence of dying. So I'm left in this limbo of self-hatred. Saying this outloud helps a little.

I use to smoke weed to cope which absolutely 100% helps me feel better when I'm having particularly dark thoughts. But I can't afford it so I'm taking 3-4 sleeping pills at a time and smoking cigarettes to try and get the distance from my thought cycle that weed provided. I can't go 5 hours without drinking, smoking, taking pills. Sobriety just leaves me with my thoughts which when alone (like I am 14 hours a day) cycle downwards until Im just laying down staring at the ceiling waiting for the day to pass.

Anyways, thanks anonymous ears. Hopefully this will be my last post here. Hopefully something will happen. I'm trying hard enough, but as it turns out life doesn't care how hard you try or want something. It's kind of an asshole like that.

P.S. I almost cried writing this and for that I am thankful.

I've recently received an offer for a software engineering internship in Chicago for this upcoming summer. I'm a junior economics and computer science major, and had always kind of planned to go into a more traditional finance/consulting role out of college. This being said, prop trading strikes me as a very interesting combination of my fields of study, and the people and office environment at impressed me. I'm not sure if this is the best subreddit to post this, but I have two questions for anyone who can help:

1. I've read that the prop trading/algo trading space is becoming over saturated and that firms are not seeing the success that they have in previous years. Is is a bad/risky idea to start out at a prop trading firm out of college? (I would assume software devs will have more job security than traders but that might not be the case.) What do you think the outlook of the industry is?

2. If I decide that I don't like software engineering or proprietary trading in general, how do you think this internship would affect my chances when applying to consulting, financial analyst, or ""pure"" tech jobs during my senior year? I'm confident that through taking their software and trading training courses and project experience that I will have a lot to talk about in interviews.

Thanks in advance for anyone who can provide insight."

I am looking for advice on how to best handle the situation I am in. This is my first post-grad job (I just finished school in August) and it is an entirely different environment then I have worked in previously. Both of my internships were set up in such a way that I was working on a team with at least one other designer, and they already had the workspace &amp; design tools figured out. 

My new job is working for a company that does contract work for the US government. Without giving away too much detail, I will be working at one of the government agencies in DC as a contract graphic designer. The area that is given to my company and team to work in is similar to a large conference room, with a little side room attached. There is no designated work spaces or desks, and most employees are given laptops by their home company and then also a laptop from the government agency that has access to everything they need. 

I'm only on my second day of the job and I know that I'm going to need more than the ""basic"" employee is given - a generic laptop with about a 12 inch screen. I don't think there is much possibility that I will be given a Mac, as it seems the government doesn't really want to fork out that cost. BUT if I can justify it, maybe there is the possibility I can get one.

I know I need Adobe Creative Suite, as that is what I've been using for the past 10 years - but I've never once had to deal with purchasing the professional version. 

I know that working on a desktop is much easier for me as a designer, and to run the programs - but I don't know what to specifically request or how to best go about it. 

Same with monitors, I know I produce at a much quicker rate with two screens - but how do I explain this? Especially when most employees in my circumstances aren't even given desks - how do I got about asking for a permanent set up? 

If you can't tell, I'm lost. I can explain myself somewhat but I'm really trying to cover all of my bases up front with any design tools/ setup I might need and any professional advice on how to best go about this would be very much appreciated. "

Is it me or my doctor?,fluffyx,Dentistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/2m04w3/owwwww_substantial_pain_persists_8_days_after/,"Hey everybody. I just had my first TERRIBLE dental experience (after a lifetime of good experiences), and I'd love some feedback. Am I being a wuss, or is my dentist horrible? I tried to keep this concise, but judging by the length of this, I failed. Please bear with me :). Or just skip to the bottom.

I am a 26-year-old male. I am new to the area, so I visited a new dentist for routine annual teeth cleaning. I also knew that my wisdom teeth would have to be removed soon, so I was expecting to have this taken care of too.

The cleaning was the most cursory cleaning I've had in my life. The hygienist spent little time on me, and I didn't get the fresh feeling I usually enjoy after a cleaning. No biggie, it's just a cleaning.

They wrote a referral to a local university's oral surgery department, as it was one of the only surgeons covered under my crappy dental insurance. They put my name on a waitlist of ""indefinite"" length, and when I called back a month later, they couldn't even find my name on the list. I was frustrated, and called the dentist and asked for a referral to a different surgeon.

""Good news,"" they said! They had recently hired a dentist who could do the extraction. Wary from my prior experience, I asked the receptionist if it would be just as good as going to a third party, and she assured me I was in good hands. I accepted the appointment.

The day of my appointment, I got in the dentist's chair and learned a few things:

* They apply lidocaine topical anesthetic, but no sedation like IV or nitrous oxide. The office is getting sedation soon, but they don't have it yet.

* The doctor to remove my teeth is not an oral surgeon, but he feels he is fully qualified. He had an optional one-year oral-surgery internship.

* My top teeth should be no trouble coming out, but the bottom teeth are a C2 and a B2 on some scale. The way he explained it, this means 4/5 difficulty and 3/5 difficulty, respectfully.

First, he removed my two right wisdom teeth. The top one took about 10 minutes, the bottom took about 40. The bottom was a bony impaction and he had to remove a ""significant"" amount of jawbone to get to the tooth. The tooth came out in multiple pieces and the prying required to extract it was absolutely disgusting (though, at the time, painless).

I was expecting to have the two remaining teeth removed, but it was getting towards closing time, and the dentist thought it'd be best to do them another day. I had been looking forward to getting all this behind me, but I reluctantly agreed.

He prescribed antibiotics, 600 mg ibuprofen every 6 hours, and 30-60 mg codeine (with acetaminophen) every 4 hours.

Ten or fifteen minutes after I left the office, I started to experience pain. It started as bearable, but by the time I finished my thirty-minute drive home, it was a 7 or 8 on the pain scale. The codeine and NSAID did essentially nothing. I could hardly sleep that night; it got up to a 9, and I basically cried myself to (an intermittent) sleep.

""What a wuss,"" you think. For reference, I've had a broken arm before, which was maybe a 6 on the scale at its worst. I've had two (non-dental) surgeries before and the post-op pain was a 1 or maybe a 2 at worst. I promise I don't have a low pain tolerance!

** **

**interesting part starts here**

** **

It's only eight days later, but I've already visited him four additional times after the surgery. He was prescribing two days of codeine at a time which meant I had to go in for new prescriptions every other day. After a long talk with him on the phone about my problems he said he would try a different pain medication (I forget what), but when I got to the office he wrote a prescription for two day's worth of hydrocodone, and that he ""basically doesn't"" prescribe what he told me he would on the phone.

I still have a 5 on the pain scale almost every day. It's still interfering with my sleep. In addition to intense pain at the surgical sites, I have a sore throat that has not gone away since the surgery, intermittent headaches, neck pain, and what is now mild swelling of the cheek and neck. My dentist has said many things:

* The symptoms I report are not consistent with the treatment he provided, so I must be exaggerating my pain

* I should not expect pain to fully subside for 4-6 weeks (he just told me this today; before surgery he said it would be ""a few days"" of ""mild to moderate"" discomfort)

* He is no longer comfortable treating me because of ""a loss of trust between us""
 
I saw him again today and he seems in full defensive mode. I told him I don't want to use this oral irrigator to spray salt water at the surgical sites any more because I think it's doing more harm than good. His reply was that maybe my poor experience has been a result of my failure to follow his post-op instructions. I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO A TEE! I don't think he misunderstood me.

He has suggested I have an oral surgeon give me a second opinion, but they can't see me for about a month. He doesn't think I have an infection, a fracture in an adjacent tooth, or anything like that. He has repeatedly said, upon inspection, that the site looks to be healing ""beautifully.""

I don't think the doctor would appreciate it if HE had constant pain for a week and nobody believed him.

Is all this agony normal after what I thought was a routine operation? I haven't read about anyone still having SUBSTANTIAL pain a week after a wisdom-tooth extraction. What is wrong with me, Reddit?"
2m06vs,73,2014-11-11,[Text] Professor politely rejects students with genuine life advice,hardcoreparadigm,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/2m06vs/text_professor_politely_rejects_students_with/,"Hello reddit, as many of you know, now is the time for college kids to register for classes next semester. This one philosophy class I wanted was closed and so I emailed the professor asking him for a special permission number aka a number that lets you register for closed classes. This was his response:


&gt; Hi everyone. 

&gt;I have already received very many special permission number requests, so I apologize that I cannot reply to you individually. Thank you all for your very polite requests, but I am sorry that I will not be giving you a special permission number. 

&gt;For a longer explanation why, feel free to continue reading further below. 

&gt;As some consolation, here are three simple tips for how to make your courses and, hopefully your life, go better. I hope this will be of some use.



&gt; General advice:

&gt; 1) Get in the habit of making plans.

&gt;""if you fail to plan, you are planning to fail."" - Benjamin Franklin'
      -my Google search (see what I did there?)

&gt;If you plan how your day, week, month etc. will go, then you're more likely to make things happen just as you want them to, no matter what Life throws at you. In contrast, if you don't plan, then Life is going to happen anyway, and it's going to catch you off guard. When you're caught off guard without a plan, you're more likely to respond in a worse way. E.g. if you wait until the last minute to start looking for a job or internship, then even if you find an awesome one, you're not likely to get it unless you have your resume and references ready and you've prepared for the interview. 

&gt;Sure, there can be advantages to not having plans. Sometimes, by not having a plan you happen to stumble on some awesome opportunity, or the love of your life. That might happen. But it might also happen if you have a plan. And, as the job example above illustrated, if you aren't prepared when you stumble on the awesome opportunity, or the love of your life, things might not go well for you. The love of your life, for instance, would probably be more likely to love you back if you had your life together.

&gt;Get in the habit of making plans now and life will be a lot smoother for you. Our ability to plan is one thing that helps set us apart from other animals who can't plan so well, if at all. You've got food in your kitchen, a place to sleep, and you're not worried about getting eaten by whatever is rustling around in those bushes. That's a luxury tons of non-human animals don't quite have. They're scrambling just to survive, day to day. The ability to plan can help you scramble less. Why not make better use of its potential?  


&gt; 2) Reflect on how you spend your time.

&gt;Get in the habit of taking time to regularly reflect on how things are going for you. What are you doing well? What are you doing poorly? What are some better rules you can follow to get yourself to be the best version of yourself you can be? If you failed to accomplish some major goal last week, or failed to start that new diet or exercise regimen, why did that happen? 

&gt;Take time on a regular basis to think about this kind of stuff. Seek to understand yourself. The better you understand yourself, and under what circumstances you do or don't do great things, the more likely you'll be to be a great version of you who lives a fulfilling life. If you don't understand yourself, then you may find yourself in bad situations and less happy with your life than you could be. 

&gt;Here's an analogy. Suppose you have an app on your phone. When you open it up, a bunch of shapes appear, and you can press three in a row before the app closes for the day. Sometimes, depending on what you pressed, you get a text informing you that something good is about to happen: maybe you get a new car, or your parent's get a vacation, or you suddenly find yourself in a better mood, etc. If the app really did have this power, wouldn't it be worth the time to study it, to think about which combination of shapes you should press to make good things happen? 

&gt;You are the app, my friends. You can make good things happen for yourself and those you care about. You can also *fail* to make these things happen by not understanding yourself. And, unfortunately, you can also make bad things happen for yourself and those you care about -- and that's especially likely when you don't understand yourself. So there's no good reason not to take the time to do this. And the best way is to get in the habit of reflecting on your life on a regular basis.


&gt; 3) Plan intelligently. And begin.

&gt;There are a million things you probably want to do. Travel. Eat nachos tonight. Whatever. Focus most on the ones that are most important to you. And spend less time focusing on the non-sense that is just occupying your mind, and preventing you from doing what really matters to you. So, when you plan, prioritize. Set a time when you will start working on some major goal. If the time passes, and you didn't start, don't beat yourself up. Try to understand why you didn't begin working on this priority. And, armed with this new information, try again. Be unstoppable.

&gt;When you plan, break your goals into small pieces and make sure you know *exactly* what to do to get started, and commit to doing that. 

&gt;Maybe you want to start some kind of business one day, but you don't know what. Don't just sit on that dream until it withers away -- until so much time has passed that you have too many responsibilities that you truly cannot sacrifice for this onetime dream of yours. 

&gt;Take action now. Break it into parts: if you don't know anything about business, or anything about what kind of business that interests you, then the first part of your goal is to figure that out. But how do you figure that stuff out? Identify some very specific things to do: (a) talk to your aunt who runs her own small business -- do it this weekend at the family party; (b) set aside 2 hours on Wednesday after work or school to start doing preliminary research through google; (c) text your friends who is in business school -- and meet up with them this weekend to talk about it, and hang out; (d) take an hour tonight, with no distractions, to brainstorm what kind of businesses interest you; etc. 

&gt;Identify a clear first step that will get the ball rolling. And make it super simple, so simple that you feel it's easy enough for you to do even if you are feeling a little lazy or tired. If you couldn't do it even then, then perhaps it's not simple enough: maybe instead of meeting your aunt in person, call her on the phone. Make it ridiculously simple. 

&gt;Hopefully some of that may be of use to you, now or in the future. Better yet: now AND in the future!


&gt;I hope you all have a great semester regardless.

2m0hn4,1,2014-11-11,How do you debug Javascript?,sniperlilly,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/2m0hn4/how_do_you_debug_javascript/,"Hi Devs,

I've just taken over a project that was written by interns and been given a 1300 line js file that does just about everything you can think of. After some simple reformatting to make it legible it came in at just under 2000 lines and in all honesty I can't fathom how on earth it is functioning.

There are two code comments. One says ""Pure js"" under which there is a ton of jQuery and the other is ""jQuery"" under which there is more jQuery but this time inside of the document ready function.
I discovered that it was being called in the header and the footer, the header before any jQuery libraries were called and yet there were no console errors.

I'm not exactly a javascript expert myself and this thing is boggling my mind. I've tried breaking it up into different files (one for ajax, one for form validation etc.) but that broke everything. I've been using jsfiddle to error check and using the (rudimentary) debugging techniques I know but ultimately I'm just working around it until the next sprint is finished.
In the meantime I'm trying to gather some tips on how to proceed. 

So, how do you debug your javascript?

(Also, the js is broken in &lt;ie8 browsers. Could that be because they are less sympathetic to errors?)

Edit: Further question, should I move it all into the document ready function?"
2m0i8f,1,2014-11-11,Should I quit my horrible retail job and be jobless for a while while in college?,Sheehan7,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2m0i8f/should_i_quit_my_horrible_retail_job_and_be/,"I am in my first year of community college majoring in Information Technology. My parents still support me so my income really only goes toward clothes, hobbies, and sometimes food. I work at a family owned comic book store and it SUCKS. I have been working there for 5 months and still make 8 dollars an hour, have no breaks unless I work over 6 hours (which combined with my lunch at 12 and then I don't eat again until 10 is just straight up unhealthy), and I work 5 days out of the week (monday, wednesday, and friday after school) and on the weekends I work pretty much all day. My co workers are also pretty terrible, they are mostly older than me and really don't have future plans like I do. They make fun of me sometimes because I am in college and want to leave that place. A lot of the times they say every job will be this bad (the management here is a complete joke) but I know that is not true.

I am in the process of getting an internship with the help of my high school track coach who works in the IT sector and my dad who has some connections with hospital and police department IT staff as he has worked for multiple departments. Overall I think my chances of an internship soon are pretty good and I also have a CISCO IT cert. already.

Should I just quit my job and focus on school and maybe taking some online courses about computer support? I just feel like I am wasting my time with this dead end retail job. I am just worried it will look bad on my resume if I have a month or two gap in employment

EDIT: Probably the biggest reason I want to quit as well is that I have zero free time and its affecting my health (cant run or cycle) and between school and work I have no days off and very little time to sleep. An average day for me is wake up at 6 school until 2:30 work at 3 until 9:30 then no time after really

Does anyone else have problems with taking timed-tests, such as those given during CS courses in uni?

Has anyone found this not to be an issue after graduation? I can't imagine there will be many 1 hour stretches where I will have to solve problems that I just learned about perfectly. Do I even need to worry about this after I graduate?

I love learning and self-teach really well. I even get good grades on all of the homeworks. It is the exams that always bring me down from my A in the class."

She has a masters degree in fiction and she's smart but I just don't know what else to do to help her.  I've tried pushing her to expand her search, volunteer, intern, work with a job coach and it always just leads to a fight and we both feel worse.

So I'm wondering do I keep trying to push her or do I back off and leave her alone?  Or is it time to admit that we might just not be helping each other and maybe it's time to end this and get on with our lives?  Is my supporting her just making her too comfortable and she's not really motivated to figure out what to do?

2m145w,1,2014-11-11,ORNL (Titan supercomputer) or Rosetta Stone?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2m145w/ornl_titan_supercomputer_or_rosetta_stone/,"Hey guys,

I have two potential interviews lined up for internships next summer. Neither are confirmed yet, but I'm pretty confident where I stand. But I wanted to go ahead and ask before I got too deep in the interview process.

Should I go with Oak Ridge National Laboratory and work on a research project on the Titan supercomputer or should I work as an intern for Rosetta Stone?

Pros:

     ORNL:

          - Only 30 minutes from my house

          - A freaking supercomputer!

          - I can add a proper research project to my resume

          - Get to network with people in my area

          - Structured program specifically for students like me that have not yet started college

     Rosetta Stone:

          - More of a well-known company

          - Actual employment experience as apposed to just research

          - Get to potentially use my Japanese in some way

          - Work done actually has the potential to be used in their products

Cons:

     ORNL:

          - Little pay

          - Lots of hours

          - Less of a known name

          - No experience in a corporate environment

          - My project is assigned to me, so I could potentially be doing research on something that doesn't interest me (this would get weird in an interview down the road)

     Rosetta Stone:

          - Very far away, not sure if they'd pay for relocation yet, that's still to be seen

          - Potentially only mediocre work, coffee runner status

          - Not a structured program so who knows what could happen?

          - Likely unpaid


That being said, what I'd really like to do is work for ORNL on-site, and Rosetta Stone remotely. Do you think I could do those at the same time? How can I bring this up with the RS interviewer? My parents really want me home over the summer, so if I can stay home and work for both places that would be ideal.


Thanks in advance!

I want to hear from people in the know, not some vindictive punk who has a vendetta against Vancouver**

Hi all,

I'm planning on getting my BSc in computing science at SFU. I've applied for the spring 2015 admissions cycle. Unlike BCIT's CIT/CST program, it emphasizes the theory and abstract principles of computing science (e.g. calculus and linear algebra, OOP, data structures and algorithms, automata theory, AI, machine learning, etc). I do have a few questions from those **in the know**.

* If, say, I did want to do an internship in San Francisco or Seattle, would it be so hard it's not worth doing unless you're a supreme rockstar coder?

* What are some ideas on how to make money on the side while I get my degree (yes, I know co-op will do the same thing.). Has anyone had any experience being successful at this kind of thing, and are there any pitfalls to watch out for? 

I thought about many things--tutoring university courses, website building, selling Wordpress themes/web applications/HTML5 games, mobile development--but I'm worried about the cynicism I've been hearing (""don't bother with web development, Indians will do it for $5/hour""). I don't need a lot of money. I have some ideas for networking. Friends, family and neighbours usually know someone who needs a website built, and they'll give me contacts, who will give me contacts, and so on. Similarly, classmates and meetup groups (like vanruby) may give me ideas for personal projects, projects to sell or job opportunities.

2m1v4l,2,2014-11-12,Dealing with repressed thoughts,snooooooooooop,getting_over_it,https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/2m1v4l/dealing_with_repressed_thoughts/,"Hello,

Im 23, have had a few bouts with depression and have always been socially anxious to some degree (ups &amp; downs). My last bout with depression was a few months ago, but that time I consciously made an effort to pull myself out and to learn how - in the process I learnt CBT and started confronting my negative thoughts. I eventually pulled myself out out of that hole (and learnt a lot from it since I actually confronted it - its like the other times have been a waste since they were missed opportunities to grow).

Anyways, recently my SA has been so bad that I was forced to deal with it. I have started seeing a therapist and writing down and working through things. I unknowingly repressed a lot of negative emotions and thoughts during college so I would be able to cope with studies, internships etc. This was a bad idea, glad I know that now.

So a few days ago, i realized a lot about how my childhood affected me and all of the causes as well as symptoms of low self esteem throughout my life that I have been ignoring. Basically, it feels like i have opened a pandoras box of bad shit. Since then, all of it has been on my mind constantly. Now i know i need to face these things, and I am better equipped to face them, but constantly thinking about it and analyzing and trying to tackle negative thoughts and understand everything is draining. Writing things down, i can be objective and avoid emotional thinking. Harder to do if im only thinking about it.

Anyone been through something like this? Like how do i approach resolving a whole torrent of repressed emotion objectively - i dont want to be swayed by my emotions and not really resolve anything if that makes any sense.. Hope that makes sense, at least to some of you!

I just felt like sharing this one:

Lucky you. I like your image, and since it looks like you did your research you don't get just a propt but you get a (mostly) true story.

If you want to roleplay this out in any way I'd be happy. But I'll be honest I'm REALLY picky about my roleplays. Let me know if you want me to keep just telling this story too... Anything past this is obviously fiction though. xD

My name is Sarah. To my friends and family that name means 'innocent', 'cute', 'christian', 'moral', or any of the like. My whole life I've been the one that people come to for moral advice. I'm always the one of those people that are known for being a virgin, but aren't made fun of for it. Not because I'm not sexy or fuckable, but because I'm too innocent and too cute. My parents know me as a good little school/christian girl.

To be perfectly honest, I really like this view of me. I like being shy. People are hard to talk to, and it's easy having people think I'm so good. All and all... I just like the image I've established for myself.

And also... A lot of the image actually does fit. I'm nerdy, quiet, shy, I love to read, and I love to watch anime.

However... Sometimes I just get these cravings. Reading smutty fanfics helps, but really just makes the cravings stronger. There are times where I almost want to be known as a little slut, but I'd risk completely ruining the image I've made for myself.

I've made up a whole fake internet persona. I call her Leslie. This is where I always reveal my true self... Er... Maybe too much of myself at times.

See, I get cravings to fuck, to be dominated, to dress slutty and be admired. When I'm alone I do all these, and so help me God if anyone I know ever found out. I've ordered slutty costumes, cosplay, and lingerie from ebay and I wear them alone in my apartment room. I've ordered toys and I fuck my pussy and ass with them weekly. Sometimes I even get cravings to suck on them to the point where I start choking myself. I feel addicted to sex but I don't want anyone to find out.

That's why I decided to dress up at comicon. See, I live very far away from San Diego where comicon is hosted, and I knew that if I lied about where I was going, nobody would suspect me in the costume I would be in. Especially if I wore a pushup bra, changed my hair color, and actually wore makeup (I usually don't). Plus, I was going into my 3rd year of college and I don't think anybody would question me if I wanted to travel. Hell I could even tell them work wanted to send me on a business trip - which is actually what I ended up doing.

I wanted to show off my body, and I wanted to do it as Leslie, not Sarah. Needless to say... I went prepared. I got a fake ID for comicon and even ordered drinks with it. I got a fake business statement so my parents would believe it was a business trip for my internship... I did it all... I was committed. I just wanted to know what it was like.

I wanted to know how it felt to not wear baggy clothes and for once dress a bit slutty. I wanted to wear skimpy clothing and be catcalled. I wanted to pose for pictures and hell... maybe even hook up with a guy.

At least, that's what half of my brain was saying. The other half wanted to revert back to my shy, quiet, innocent self. I wasn't sure if I could follow through.

I flew out and had a hotel room all to myself. Just like I liked it. I unpacked and prepared my costume. It was perfect I decided to go as Motoko Kusanagi. I spent weeks perfecting the costume and was all ready to put it on.

I may have been a bit too 'cute' or 'innocent' to pull of the costume, but with the push-up bra and makeup... I think I pulled it off.

Everyone wanted pictures... It was such a success.... Such a high....I needed more...."
2m1zdi,10,2014-11-12,Starting Lamictal today. Your experiences?,notsarahnz,Epilepsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/2m1zdi/starting_lamictal_today_your_experiences/,"I saw my neuro again today, after a cluster of 3 tonic clonics on the weekend. I also see him for migraines, which I have a fairly bad case of (5-20 migraines per month, with massive auras which knock me out for hours). The meds I'm on at the moment don't seem to be helping the migraines so much, and especially not with the seizures; and thus he wants to start me on Lamictal.

He admitted that he wasn't entirely happy with this course of action, and that he wasn't sure how the epilepsy could have evaded all the tests thus far (I've had a zillion EEGs, including a week long inpatient EEG, as well as a 3T MRI -- all negative). So I think I'll be getting some more telemetry once I'm stably on the Lamictal.

Anyway, how have other people found this medication? Am I insane for starting it during exam season at my university? I have exams and reports/assignments/etc due over the next 2-3 weeks, followed by starting full time work at a large software company, who I'm hoping to get a full time job with once I graduate, if I impress them enough during this internship -- so there isn't really a ""good time"" to hold off starting the meds until.

So far I've had one 25mg dose and I feel a bit ""funny"", but nothing intolerable. Just a bit different inside my head.

I've also got bipolar, and I've heard that this is pretty much the best med there is for bipolar depression (as opposed to mania), which is something I suffer from pretty badly.

I've been on Topamax in the past, and the cognitive side effects were really getting to me, even at 75mg; so I'm hoping the Lamictal ""stupids"" won't be as bad."
2m261x,9,2014-11-12,What certs should I get to join netsec with money from severance package?,vrek86,AskNetsec,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/2m261x/what_certs_should_i_get_to_join_netsec_with_money/,"Ok, so a bit of background here. I went to a technical/high school and majored in electrical engineering. Through the school I got a job initially stated as computer repair but the company also had contracts for business network administration , it was supposed to be basically a paid internship. Unfortunately a few weeks after I got hired the guy who was supposed to be training me(and the only employee other than owner and wife who did the accountant) got fired. The owner then went through another 5 employees(never more than me and one other guy) within a year. After the year I graduated from High School and went to work full time. My boss suggested that since I graduated and was now full time and he liked my work he gave me a raise and basically put me in charge of computer repair and the corporate contracts, the main of which was a credit union with 125 employees. I was there for 3 more years(total of 4; from early 2004 to late 2008), usually alone taking care of all contracts and regular customers although sometimes with an assistant for a few weeks until my boss fired them again. 

Long story short the main contract dropped our contract because I was in the hospital and they got audited by the NCUA and my boss knew nothing about computers(Got a masters in CS in 92, started business same year, and basically stopped learning new stuff) tried to cover the audit but failed and without the contract the company went out of business. I really liked my job, even dealing with my bosses stupidity(really stupid stuff like buying all 125 windows licenses at staples at retail price) and me not getting paid anywhere near my worth($12 an hour with no benefits or pto when I got laid off) I liked my job. My current job pays better, with benefits, improves lives of thousands of people, less stress, and generally seen as better. The only problem is it is so simple, basic, and easy I am bored out of my mind. There is no challenge and I turn off my brain for 10 hours everyday with my greatest challenge being date and initial about 200 times a day(not exaggerating). I liked being challenged at the computers(I picked stuff up quickly but new problems which actually made me think and research and learn stuff was where I excelled)

I was unemployed for a few months and got a phone call from a recruiter for a electronics manufacturing . Thats what I have been doing since 2008. Most of the time working with lasers doing FDA regulated manufacturing. Now they are closing my location but I am getting a nice severance package. 

I want to get back into computers and especially network security; preferably doing pen test and the like but would also enjoy standard sys-admin stuff. Between savings and my severance I figure I will have about 40k to survive and pay for any certification(Rent and utils ~$600 a month + $200 for car insurance and cell phone). I was thinking of going Network+, Security+ and OSCP. I was also thinking maybe MSCE or CCENT. Am I being too ambitious? Is there any pitfalls I don't envision? I am planning on not doing classes(except for OSCP), just buy books, study, take tests. Is there anything I can do until I get the money to prepare(possibly up to 18 months till they close my facility)?

TL;DR: I have 40k, some experience from last job in network administration and want to get into NetSec. What certs should I get to make myself more employable? "

The CEO is something of a mentor and understood when I asked to travel for a year before committing to a job.

Fast forward 3 months and I am a kindergarten and middle school teacher in South Korea. I am writing from my phone ( sorry for errors ) so I will try to be brief.

I fucking hate half of my job. In the morning I work with the same kindergarteners everyday and in the afternoon I alternate with different classes. The afternoon is fine, even enjoyable perhaps. However, the mornings are a complete nightmare. The teacher before me was awful with the kids. He never did work and let them play all the time. He didn't give a fuck and then left his contract 6 months early. Now they are stuck with me and expect to do no work at all. They also fight about everything and are known around the school as the nightmare class ( I'm their third teacher). Today I lost it a little when they were chanting the old teacher's name in an attempt to persuade me to let them play instead of doing their work. I basically shut down until a Korean teacher came in and scolded them in their native tongue. 

I have worked with kids my whole life and this is by no means my first rodeo but between the last teacher's shortcomings and the truly unfortunate consolidation of terrible children, I am doubting my stay here.

What's the issue? Why not go back to New York and work finance? Well, I was secretly hoping this experience would lead me away from finance. I hoped South Korea would open my world and change my life. The sad thing is, it has. Korea is unbelievable and I love its language and culture. I can't stay here though if I bail on my job. They will not sign a letter of release and I won't be able to work here. I have a sweet gig in New York and it's not like I hate finance... I was just looking for something more. 

Right now my thoughts are suck it up at my job for a year and enjoy Korea the best I can or bail and totally fuck my school and the networks I've made here in order to be a ""real"" person. "

For more than 3 years I have been a Software Test Engineer. I love working in software development, and like test automation and product management.  I really dislike writing and manually executing test cases, and would like to move into a software development role. 

**My Question**
I am currently halfway through a 3 year, part time (night school) M.S in Computer Science. Should I:

1. Go full time as a masters student for spring semester and apply to   software development internship programs?

2. Carry on as a part time student, apply for developer jobs?

3. Continue to work in test while finishing masters part time, then  apply for developer jobs?

Any additional advice on leveraging my current experience and transitioning is appreciated.



**Additional Info on my Technical Experience**
I've done some automation and built tools using python and HP Quick Test Pro (VB script). I write the test plans, test cases, and implement/manage the testing, and release the software.  I've worked on the following:

* embedded Linux application

* HTML5 and Javascript web app

* C# (.NET Framework) desktop application

* C++ desktop application with QTP front end


I work with small team and always work very closely with the developers.  I have good knowledge of the code bases, and can often tell where in the code a bug is occurring. 

For school or personal projects I've programmed a lot in C on Linux or the STM32 microcontroller (with various peripherals), and also created a website + form + database using HTML5, Javascript/Jquery, PHP, MySQL.  I also have my own wordpress website and I've been customizing the template and plan to experiment with a plugin."

I am a student in my last year of High-School (Y13). I am studying under the CIE Curriculum in an British International School.


I have excellent portfolio overall ('A's across the board in my AS Examinations, internships, leadership programs in school and outside school, volunteering to help the school's network administrator, great reference letters), and I am looking for top universities in the UK to study Computing.

I am looking towards working as a System Analyst after University. Keeping this in mind, I was wondering if you might know where I can find the best learning experience, environment (cities that are highly CS Oriented and I could have big opportunities) and student life. I have looked at lots of University Rankings, but I am looking for a more personal opinion.


Currently I am looking at Imperial College London, University of Bristol, University of Birmingham, University of Manchester.

Also, could you tell me whether Computer Science, Computer Engineering or Software Engineering courses would be more suitable for moving on to working as a System Analyst.

Thanks!"

I'm in my last year of uni and have been thinking about my financial situation seriously for the first time.

I'm quite lucky as a student in that my dad has paid for my accommodation throughout uni meaning my student loan just goes towards living costs such as food, bills (elec, water etc) and day to day living. As a consequence, (and request from my dad who didnt want to 'complicate' things) my bank account is still the same as the one my dad opened for me when i was ~14. 

But now I have considered my finances seriously, I have realised how many benefits i have missed out on not opening a student account. Now I'm in my final year, most banks wont allow me to open one since a requirement is to be confirmed for 2+ years of study. This leads me to a couple of questions:

* Is it too late to open a student account with an overdraft for my final ~half year of uni?

* Will the fact that I have never had an overdraft effect my credit scores for when I graduate and possibly apply for credit?

* Will not having a student account stop me for getting a graduate bank account next year?


Finally, again I am lucky, I have a job offer already from an internship I did this summer with a starting salary of just over 21k (in a northern city). Do you have any advice as to what I should be doing now and over the next year to prepare for being a proper grown up with a full time job?

2m2vbo,4,2014-11-12,My [25 F] stepfather's [60's M] birthday party is in a few weeks and his son and son's wife [30's M/F] are going to be there. I hate them both but my mom [50's F] is trying to make me feel guilty about taking my stepdad out separately. Could use some advice. [very long],AlicexEve,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2m2vbo/my_25_f_stepfathers_60s_m_birthday_party_is_in_a/,"Sorry in advance for how long this is going to be, there is a lot of back story here.

I guess I should start off by saying that my stepfather and my mom have been married for about 15 years, together a bit longer.  I am my mom's only child and my stepdad has three kids, all significantly older than I am [40 F, late 30's M, early 30's M].  As a result I was never *close* close with his kids, all of who have had some current/ongoing mental issues.  Things were pretty rocky with my step-siblings when my mom and stepdad first married but things have been smooth sailing since then.

The stepbrother in question [early 30's M], who I'll refer to as Dick, has always been a self absorbed, lazy twat.  He hasn't had a job in about five years, he just collects disability that he doesn't deserve because he doesn't have an actual disability.  The closest thing he has to a disability is weighing almost 400 pounds, but that is a result of laziness, not an actual medical condition.  At almost 35 years old, he sits at home all day and plays with video games and remote control cars while his wife works.

His wife (Mrs. Dick) requires more explanation.  My mom is a nurse, and until a couple of years ago, she had worked at the same family practice since before she was pregnant with me.  A few doctors had come and gone, but my mom had always stayed as the head nurse and office manager, because she's good at what she does.  The current doctor had been there for about 15ish and he and my mom had a great relationship.  He understood that she was a single mom and he let her adjust her schedule when I was off/late to school/I was sick/she needed to do something for me, etc.  So about five years ago, they decided to open up the office to nursing students, they would shadow my mom and get their intern hours (or however it works) and then be on their way.  A lot of the cycled through there.  Enter Mrs. Dick.  When she started interning, she was great with the patients and my mom decided to recommend to the doctor that he hire her on, so he did.  Shortly after that, my mom set her up on a blind date with my stepbrother.  Between that time and their eventual marriage later, it becomes evident to all that Mrs. Dick is clownfuck insane.  She's done so much shit that I've forgotten now, but I remember some highlights.  She told my other stepbrother's wife that I said their kid was a ""fucking brat,"" which I never said.  When said stepbrother passed away suddenly and unexpectedly, she took his chart home from the office (my mom's boss was his doctor).  She called in prescriptions for herself under the doctor's name, he found out about it and did nothing.  When the doctor went on vacation to Pakistan, he left his work phone with my mom so she could communicate with patients and during that time, Mrs. Dick sent the doctor very questionable text messages and emails that revealed a long line of communication between them that was unprofessional at best and adulterous at worst (but whatever, that's their business).  She's done so much more that I don't even remember anymore, but it all culminated in my mom deciding to leave her job because of this crazy person.

I don't remember the last time I spoke to Dick, but the last time I spoke to Mrs. Dick was about ~2 years ago when she was harassing my mom via text, so I texted her and told her in so many words to fuck off (because she was too cowardly to answer the phone when I called).

I mentioned my other stepbrother's (Will) passing earlier.  When he died, it was unexpected it absolutely shattered my stepdad and his family.  Will called my stepdad every day, and they had their issues but they were close.  He passed two years ago and there still isn't even a concrete answer why, but strong evidence points to a hospital mix-up.  My stepdad was inconsolable for months, and even now when I talk to him there's a part of him that just isn't there anymore, and never will be again.  When Will died, Dick started treating my stepdad like absolute shit.  He talked to him like he was garbage, ignored his calls, argued with him, threw tantrums like a kid, was just 100% hateful to my stepdad for no reason.  Things are ""better"" between them according to my stepdad, but he had blinders on.  This is his last son and he is going to put himself out there time and again because he emotionally cannot afford to give up on the relationship with his only surviving son.  I don't agree with it, for my stepdad's own good because he deserves better, but I get it.

So, cut to now.  I've hated Mr. and Mrs. Dick for years, but they haven't been part of my life so I haven't really had to care.  A bit ago, my mom called me and told me about my stepdad's birthday shindig at a local restaurant.  I asked if Dick was going to be there, and she said probably, and Mrs. Dick as well.  I told her no way, that my boyfriend and I would take him out with just us.  She gets all quiet and is trying to guilt me over not wanting to come.  I told her that things are how they are because of them and it's not my fault, she doesn't care.  My mom's siblings are all combative assholes too, and my mom thinks everyone should just make nice for ""family,"" and she doesn't get that the concept of cutting someone out of your life because said person is toxic.  She's always been the peacemaker and she doesn't understand that sometimes you can't make peace, or just don't want to.  If we went, the Dicks would try to talk to me, and I'd be forced to talk back because if I made a scene, it would ruin my stepdad's birthday dinner.  I don't want to see these people, I don't want to talk to them, I don't want to hear their voices.

Am I being selfish?  It is wrong of me to refuse to go so I don't have to see the only two people on the face of the earth that I hate?  What should I do?

tl;dr: Stepbrother and his wife are going to be at my stepdad's birthday get-together, and I hate them and don't want to go.  What do?"
2m2wmy,4,2014-11-12,Critique my letter of intent?,[deleted],gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/2m2wmy/critique_my_letter_of_intent/,"I'm considering applying to a grad program for my masters in entomology. I don't have access to my normal support system and critics at the moment, so I'm reaching out to you guys for any suggestions! I'm still tying up the ending as well. Thank you :) 








I am writing this letter to express my sincere and serious interest in furthering my studies at the graduate level at         X.      I would like to pursue my master’s degree in entomology, focusing on the topic of native plants supporting beneficial insects. In December, I graduated from   X  with my bachelor of science in zoology focusing on ecology, with additional degree in German. My time at    X  was pivotal in my decision to apply to the graduate department, as it not only awakened my interest in the field of pollination ecology, but also was essential in helping me to gain valuable research experience. Furthermore, I saw firsthand the high quality research and education that  X       offered, largely impacting my decision to pursue my masters at    X        . 

After assisting with the      CCC          project for two field seasons, I gained valuable research skills in insect and plant identification, crop pollination, field research, and data collection. Working with Vaccinium corymbosum and pollinators piqued my interested in ecological restoration, and how landscape management could be used to optimize crop productivity. Not only did I learn valuable skills that would be highly beneficial in working on this project, I also became impassioned to gain further experience interculturally in this field. This decision brought me to the                   , as I am currently participating in a fellowship program promoting cross-cultural exchange. I’m using this time to further my research experience in the field of agricultural ecology, as well as to gain skill sets that I hope to apply to future research. Currently I’m working on gaining experience in pollen identification and analysis. How pollen analysis can be incorporated into pollination ecology and contribute to research is a question I hope to delve into further this year. Beginning in February I will be assisting with the Garden project             , and I intend to conduct independent research as well. This project looks at the  relationship between pollinators, predators, and urban green spaces. In contrast to my previous research experience, I will be able to gain research experience with arthropods in an non-agricultural setting.  

The graduate assistantship position opening working with native plants and beneficial insects will also seize upon my skills that I have developed over the years. My strong verbal and written skills will be extremely helpful in this position, not only in terms of publishing research, but also for grant and fellowship applications. To balance my strong written and verbal skills, I would plan to focusing on building up my quantitative skills in my graduate studies, something that I look forward to. The ability to communicate research effectively and concisely to growers is not only a skill I have, but also something I believe I can excel at. Leading grower workshops and educating the public about current research is something I hope to do in the future. Looking at the research aspect of the position, my previous experience working with             X      flora and fauna will be especially advantageous in this position. Being able to identify which species are present and how they are impacted by different management styles is an area of study I feel comfortable in and would hope to research more in-depth. Landscape management to promote ecosystem services and incorporating natural ecosystem processes into agricultural is a research interest of mine. Perhaps of utmost interest to me is the focus of this project on selecting native plants that are suitable not only for a specific soil type, but also that make sense ecologically and economically. 

Although pursuing a graduate degree can be a serious endeavour, in terms of both stress and time management, my undergraduate experience prepared adeptly to excel in such situations. While attending     X             , I managed my time between 2-3 jobs, numerous internships, and classes, often simultaneously. While doing this, I was able to maintain a 3.48 GPA, and during my last 4 semesters at MSU, a 3.72. Although my initial undergraduate performance may have been hindered by my overly full-schedule, over the years I developed the skills that allowed me succeed in the face of adversity. These skills I developed will help me to excel in the graduate program in"
2m2zyf,1,2014-11-12,I fell in love with an infatuated ex who then created on her current boyfriend with me. He's one of my best friends.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2m2zyf/i_fell_in_love_with_an_infatuated_ex_who_then/,"This whole experience has shaken me very badly and I'll try to make sure I put all the facts on the table. Names have been changed, and this account is a throwaway.

I met Jill 4 years ago when I was working a crappy job, before I started going to law school (third year now). Apparently to her it was a love a first sight sort of thing but I never saw it that way and she was always seeing other people. After my first semester of law school we tried to go on a date and had sex afterwards but apparently I wasn't being a great companion. Over the next year and a half we began to have on and off sexual relationships. It was never emotional for me--she would come back each time and tell me how much she missed me and how much she missed the sex and so on, but I never dated her because I had been left by an ex during my first year of law school and never recovered enough to love someone by that point. Jill would keep coming back and I would keep throwing her out because I couldn't make a commitment and I thought Jill was crazy.

Earlier this year I got involved with her and another woman Mary. Mary was fun but she was a party girl and only liked me for my body.  Jill and Mary finally met at a big show we had downtown, for which there was an afterparty.  I left with Jill from the afterparty and we went back to my apartment and had sex.  The next day Mary told me that, against the one thing I asked Jill not to do, Jill had been rude to Mary, saying that ""Mary was stealing away the boy that she loved"" and talking about the sexual things Jill and I would do.  Jill told me that Mary was the one being a problem and that she had been nice to Mary throughout the night.  At that point, I believed Mary and I purged Jill from my life -- phone, facebook, everything.

In late July, while finishing up my second year internship with a biglaw firm, my best friend Chris (and the bassist in the band) told me that Mary miscarried a child back in June, the child was mine, and that all of the common friends between Mary and I knew about it.  The same day my friend John (the lead guitarist of our band) showed up with Jill 20 minutes after Chris told me about the kid. Three days later, the biglaw firm chose not to offer me post-graduation employment. I started drinking heavily, went back to soft drugs, and neglected my body incredibly, moving from 155 lbs back up to 200. I've been able to subside the bender because I need to be able to work, but its not completely gone.

I was mad at Mary, incredibly so - so much that I cut her out of my life and told her not to speak to me again. Then I began to blame her for not letting me get on with Jill and the fact that I could have actually started a relationship with Jill, and Jill began to talk to me about what happened. We started talking even more and things began to come to a line of ""what ifs,"" which trigger the two of us to started talking about the past and how things would be different this time.  This led to us then meeting up and seeing each other again--at first only talking, but then cuddling, and recently kissing.  Jill told me that she was in love with me and she wanted to leave our City and move somewhere else that we could get a fresh start.  For the first time I actually felt like I loved her and I agreed to go along, even though John was also in love with her and she was living at John's at the time (Jill's father kicked her out of the house for not going back to college).  

Monday night she came over because she wanted to see me. I let her stay while I went to my night class and she helped clean up my apartment, which had fallen into squalor during the bender. When I got back we started cuddling and then she grabbed my penis. Both of us said that it felt like cheating and that we shouldn't do it, but then she started taking off my pants. I went along with it and began to finger her, at which point we said we had come too far to go back. We had sex twice and I sent her home. When she got back to John's, John proposed to her.

Since Monday night she's now said that she wants to stay with John because she thinks that she'll be happier with him in the long run. Meanwhile I am a total mess because I actually love the girl, despite all of these terrible things and she's playing with my emotions. I can't talk to anyone else around here because she's within my circle of friends and everyone likes her. All I can do right now is cry on the floor--I don't understand why Jill chose to do this to me. She claims that she wants to stay with John because he loves her selflessly.  

Last night I finished my work and tried to get high to forget about everything, but it made it worse and I had a panic attack.  Were it not for a good friend of mine--who was well enough removed from the situation such that no one in my City would know about it--I probably would have gotten no sleep and began to miss classes today.  I feel like a human wreck because

(1) I went behind John's back and slept with Jill, who he wants to consider a fiancee -- after 3 months of John and Jill barely dating. I should note that John was a law student a year ahead of me and recently failed the State's bar examination, forcing him to work as a law clerk for a shoddy lawyer and a night food delivery person.  John lost his job with the law firm after his computer crashed with vital evidence for a malpractice lawsuit. He is unable to sustain rent and is becoming reliant on handouts from Jill, who comes from a rich family.
(2) I loved Jill and she wouldn't believe that I was serious about making things work this time because I had used her before; we were making plans for what I would do after graduating
(3) all of the good friends I have in this City right now know all parties involved and the previous history between Jill and I
(4) the last time I had this much stress in my life I focused on my work and lost a number of friends in the process, engulfing myself in law school
(5) things have now become a Mexican standoff. If Jill tells John, I'll probably lose everyone I have close here. If I tell John, I'm afraid that Jill will attempt to accuse me of rape even though the sex was consensual, placing a mark on me for State Bar Examination purposes.

Reddit, I've done a lot of bad things in my life but I think this is the worst. Right now I just feel numb inside because I feel Jill played on my emotions and used me for sexual gratification -- I believe that the ""proposal"" does not actually exist at this point. I also think Jill lied to me about her interaction with Mary before. At the same time, Jill told me she wanted to spend the rest of her life with me and I was looking forward to it. Can anyone help me make sense of this? I'm losing my mind and I have no one else to talk to.

TL;DR -- kicked an on/off girl out of my life when another woman said she had been rude; the other woman miscarried a child and didnt tell me, girl started dating my guitarist. feel in love with girl after seeing what i could have had, emotions hit a flare and we had sex again. guitarist proposed, girl says she'll stay with him because he loves her selflessly, won't talk to me now. i am current at a state of depression i've only reached once in my life before and its effecting my body, work, and mind.

2m393x,90,2014-11-12,"Sent a message to my Senator about net neutrality, got a reply, wasn't pleased.",bj_waters,Stand,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stand/comments/2m393x/sent_a_message_to_my_senator_about_net_neutrality/,"I hope posting this here isn't too horribly out of place, but I feel like it would be worth looking at what the US leaders are saying about net neutrality at the moment.

When President Obama made his statement about net neutrality, I decided to send a message to my Congressman and Senators (all Republicans) about supporting the President in establishing net neutrality.  (FWIW, this is a bit strange for me to do.  I don't hate Obama, but I didn't vote for him either.)  In any case, one of my senators emailed me back and was disappointed by what I saw.  Now, I acknowledge that this is probably a canned response sent by one of his interns, but it still represents his opinions on the issue.  Here is his response in full.

&gt; Thank you for writing me and sharing your comments about net neutrality. Your thoughts are important to me as I continue to work on this issue, and I appreciate the opportunity to explain why I generally oppose the FCC’s net neutrality rules.

&gt; In my view, the courts have been correct in repeatedly striking down FCC attempts to advance its net neutrality agenda. Yet the FCC continues to overstep its statutory authority by seeking alternative legal justifications to impose the same burdensome regulations. I agree with Judge Silberman’s opinion striking down the FCC’s latest net neutrality rules warning that these continued attempts to broadly interpret the FCC’s authority under Section 706 of the Communications Act will “virtually free the Commission from its congressional tether.” This ""tether"" is part of the important Congressional oversight responsibility that is essential to the Constitution’s separation of powers.

&gt; Net neutrality may sound like fairness but it is actually the opposite. Bandwidth is finite—like the limited number of lanes on a highway—and network providers must innovate in order to accommodate the burgeoning traffic. As they invest billions of private dollars in new and improved networks, they should rightly expect to set prices and manage those networks as they see fit. Despite network providers’ investment in building a state-of-the-art broadband network from scratch, content providers can create profits for themselves by using this network toll-free while at the same time creating bottlenecks that the network providers have to fix with costly infrastructure upgrades and improvements.

&gt; Limiting the ability of the FCC to regulate the Internet is actually good for the Internet’s future prosperity because it incentivizes network providers to make necessary upgrades and improvements. The Internet’s tremendous growth has been made possible not through increased government involvement, but from opening the Internet to commerce and innovation. Rather than adding additional regulation, we should incentivize development of additional capacity, thus benefitting consumers and our economy.

&gt; Thank you, again, for contacting me with your comments.  If you would like to have regular updates on my work in the U.S. Senate, I encourage you to subscribe to my E-newsletter, visit my Facebook page, and follow me on Twitter.

My thoughts: 

First of all, this is the first time I've heard of the idea that bandwidth is limited.  Doing a wee bit of googling shows that this is generally true, but I'm not buying it as a good enough reason to allow corporations to discriminate their consumers' data usage.  Perhaps those of you who know more about this can enlighten me (and potentially others) as to how relevant this is to the net neutrality issue.

Second of all, it seems like he's confused net neutrality with government control of the internet, which is unfortunate.  Though to be honest, out of context I wouldn't support the government controlling my internet, but I speculate one of the main reasons so many are pushing for making the internet a Title II common carrier is because it would at least force the corporations to keep things neutral.  At this point, I think I'd rather trust the government than the corporations.  ([One notion that I do seem to be getting from the Republicans](http://www.hatch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2014/11/senator-hatch-responds-to-president-obama-s-net-neutrality-statement) is that Title II is too ""old fashioned"" for the internet, which may be true.  If we could establish new, 21st-century laws on maintaining the neutrality of the internet, I'd love the hear them.)

Third of all, perhaps I shouldn't be surprised.  I live in a very Red state, and while that doesn't generally bother me, it can make things frustrating when leaders make decisions based on political lines rather than what best serves the people.  It's the main reason I generally don't bother with politics as a whole (way too much [Us and Them](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pinkfloyd/usandthem.html), if you catch my drift).

In any case, I decided to share this with you all so that you can discuss its finer points/pick it apart/laugh at it/circlejerk/etc.  I am planning on sending at most one more message to this Senator discussing my issues with his opinion (though I anticipate probably I'll get the same email back), but for some reason his contact page is down! (Grrrr.)

I hope this has been useful on some level and I wish you all a good day.

2m3cxh,1,2014-11-12,25M just got broken up via text by 22F from 2.5 yr relationship. Need some clarity,EmotionalThrowaway11,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2m3cxh/25m_just_got_broken_up_via_text_by_22f_from_25_yr/,"Background Info: She hasn't been single in her life, mainly going through an abusive relationship, and someone that provided for her before me. I helped her get her life straight in order by transferring from a JC to Uni, paying for a lot of things, and introducing her to a hobby that she prioritizes over her future. (Psych major w/ no experience, instead of internship she focuses on the hobby)

Started two weeks ago when she said she liked a guy from a school club she was involved in and felt confused about her emotions, but told me they only talked. What I felt like I should've done was broken up with her then and there because how she felt. What I did instead was offer to work on things with us and accept her back because she was honest and upfront about it.

Later that night she hangs outs out with her club at the school bar and doesn't want me to come. Nothing happens, but she essentially stays out late while I'm waiting for her at her place and comes home and initiates sex, and it doesn't sit right with me.

We hang out the next day and she tells me she doesn't really know what she wants because she has never been single and I proceed to say things I don't mean. (Compared her to her mom who she hates)

This leads to a break between us where the rules were to be honest with each other after we meet up.
I don't give her the space she needs until we hash the things out we swept under the rug, and she admits to understanding why I compared her to her mom.

After giving her that space, I assumed she was going to work things out with us (Figuring out if she wants to be with someone else or me), but she goes against her friends advice (Settle things with me and not talk to new guy) and becomes influenced to break up with me for him.

Yesterday she sent me a text that she can't forgive what I did, and wants to break up plus understands if I don't want to be friends, finally wants me to pick up my stuff when she is out of town with her club this weekend.

I've been talking to her friends for closure of my own and revealed my side of the story, and they see her in a different light as she withheld information such as admitting to being her mom, instead focused mainly on how I was overbearing in the relationship.

I understand I made mistakes by acting like a teacher too much and not allowing her to grow herself, having a temper and saying things in the heat of the moment, but now feel emotionally cheated on and kind of foolish for not breaking things up from the beginning. Although I dragged things on longer than they should've, was there anything I could've done? I feel regretful and sadness that I tried to change her for the better, and in the end she acted like her mom even if it wasn't malicious.

Let me know if you have any questions regarding our relationship, her past, anything. Thank you for reading my story!

**tl;dr**: Girlfriend breaks off relationship via text because it's easier, her friends lose respect for her. I'm trying to find clarity for myself. "

2m3kqw,294,2014-11-12,Only Pat Ryan can save the Bears.,Sks44,CHIBears,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/2m3kqw/only_pat_ryan_can_save_the_bears/,"For those that don't know, Pat Ryan is an executive of Aon Corp. He owns almost 20% of the Bears and, if the McCaskeys ever decide to sell, they contractually have to offer to him first. Until this happens, the Bears are screwed. 

The Bears are dysfunctional as an organization. They have been since the 1980's. While the NFL grew and became more corporate, the Bears have remained a small time organization. I'm not kicking them for being a ""Family-owned"" organization since the Giants and Steelers both have had tremendous success as such. But the Bears, behind the McCaskeys, have not. They have the second largest media market, a rabid fan base and the tradition of being arguably the original NFL team. And they are awful at everything. According to Forbes, the Bears should be worth 800 million than they are. Almost a billion dollars left on the table via incompetence.

Forbes magazine printed an article a few years ago about how the Bears are the most poorly utilized brand in professional sports. Forbes blamed the ownership. And they have a point. Virginia McCaskey is the nominal head of the team but it has been run by her son Michael until he was replaced by Ted Philips and then George McCaskey joined Philips. According to Forbes and other observers, they have collectively done little to expand on the Bears brand and more often than not have, at best, limited it. A more accusatory tone would relay that they piss away every advantage. From the market to the fans.

Let's look at the stadium. For years, the Bears played in Soldier Field and, as people who watched games at old Soldier could tell you, it sucked. It looked nice on TV but it was not fun to experience as a venue. Bad food, lack of bathrooms, dirty, bad seating,etc... The Bears, led by Mike McCaskey, often yelled about how they would move to the suburbs and open their own stadium unless the city helped them with SF.  The Bears purchased options to buy atleast 3 pieces of land for a stadium. They ended up backing down because of ineptitude or cowardice. 

The Bears should have forged ahead. Instead, they rolled over and agreed to help fund a revamp of Soldier Field. At the time, people railed on Mayor Daley for agreeing to it but he played the Bears. As a place to see a game, Its a 200% upgrade from old Soldier Field but it was not what the Bears needed. The McCaskeys were often accused in the 1980s and 1990s of being penny-pinchers. They responded that they did everything they could with the revenue they generated. A stadium is a giant revenue producer. Instead of moving ahead privately like other NFL teams, the Bears bent over for the city. They now have the worst stadium deal in the NFL and that contract runs until 2033. Its the smallest stadium in the NFL, the Park District owns it and the Bears are a tenant again. The SF stuff and the Dave McGinnis fiasco are hallmarks of the Mike McCaskey tenure.

The Bears ponied up 200 Million for the 600 million renovation. The city provided the rest with a hotel tax.Compare this to the Pats and the Cowboys owners who spent more of their own money,borrowed money and built their own stadiums. They receive all the revenue from their stadiums,concessions,parking,naming rights,advertising,etc... 

What does this have to do with the play on the field? To smash an old metaphor, the fish rots from the head. The Bears football organization is just as mickey mouse. George Halas was an innovator in this area as well. The first coach to have scouts, watch film, bring in college coaches to consult,etc... I was buddies with a former Bears scout. He often told me the Bears had the smallest scouting department and, even then, Jerry Angelo and Co. didn't listen even when the scouts did things like send a file on David Terrell to Angelo with a big ""DO NOT DRAFT"" at the top of it. 

Phil Emery is a different cat than Angelo but he's still a square peg in a dilapidated hole. From what I've read, the Bears have joined the rest of the league in adding more scouts but look at the results in the last few years. As recently as 2011, the Bears had around 10-12 Scouts. The Patriots had over 20. Now, scouting isn't perfect. The Pats have struck out on guys,too. But look at the Bears track record compared to theirs. The day after the NFL draft, the Patriots begin writing reports on up to 4,000 college players. Think the Bears have the manpower for that? 

Since Ditka, the Bears coaches have been Wannstedt, Jauron, Lovie and Trestman. All of them were lower tier assistants or, in the case of Trestman, not in the NFL at that point. The high point amongst that group was Lovie getting to the Superbowl. Even then, the Bears failed from the top down. Lovie was a great D coach and we assembled a nifty defense. It relied on the front four generating pressure. When Tommie Harris went down, we lost our interior pressure. Even then, the D was good enough to get us through New Orleans and into the SB. In the SB, we needed the offense to help the D. It needed to keep Peyton off the field. We all remember what happened. Ron Rivera made a telling comment a few years after the SB. He said teams knew Rex was afraid to get hit and that he never had to experience that at Florida. The Bears didn't know that. An inability to generate an offense doomed Lovie. Lovie hired bad OCs and Angelo tried to fill slots in those offenses. Again, Mom and Pop style management reveals the lack of a plan. The Bears lucked into a HoF dynamic MLB and several exceptional defensive players and wasted them. 

I say ""lucked"" because, remember, the Bears drafted Urlacher not knowing what to do with him position wise. They started his career as a SLB. A guy who was used to roaming the field from a deep mike drop, shallow safety was put over the TE by the Bears originally. If the MLB doesn't get injured and Urlacher was forced to move over, Urlacher may have ended up Shea McClellin Sr.

In comes Emery and he brings in Trestman. The question I originally asked was ""Why don't big name coaches want this gig?"" You'd think they'd line up for it. They don't. Guys like Jon Gruden will not come to the Bears because they know the Bears are a mom and pop group. Bruce Arians interviewed for the Bears job and walked away not wanting it. He said in an interview that they wanted him to do things like perform a fake news conference so they could see how he'd handle it. This is the reigning NFL coach of the year and they acted as if he was asking for an internship. No big name ""football guys"" want to work for the Bears. The risk isn't worth the potential reward.

So, it comes back to the McCaskeys. When Virginia passes, they will have to figure out ownership details. Depending on what occurs, they may have to sell. Pat Ryan,Andy McKenna and Co. could easily put together a group to buy the team. They'd not view it as the family business. They'd expect results. And, until that happens, we Bears fans are destined for mediocrity."

I just interviewed for (and was offered) a position for the summer that sounds like much more fun, within my specialization, which is computer security (and also in the same city where I currently reside!).

The offer is for $24/hour. 

It's less than my brother, a sophomore in college, was making last summer interning in CS. I could TA for my university's CS department for the summer and make more.

Is there any way to negotiate the offer up at least slightly at this stage? Everyone I've met there seems like they'd be good people to work with.

I told the HR guy exactly what I'm currently making... would it make sense to accept the offer and continue to look or should I flat out reject it? (In that vein, is anyone looking for extremely motivated grad student interns and willing to pay me at least what I'm currently making? PM me if so?)

Having put some (not insignificant) effort into *trying* to get a job there, I'm kind of half surprised, considering they asked what I was currently making about three times during the interview process,  and half disappointed.

2m4cas,89,2014-11-12,How many RAID?,YZBot,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2m4cas/how_many_raid/,"I am often 'blessed' with having interns. I'm very hands-off and tend to find projects that I think they can figure out on their own without causing any damage to normal operation. When they have questions, I point them in the right direction. Seems to work out for both me and the intern. I keep my sanity, and the intern learns IT and self direction. 

All of my interns have had some training. Either they've done something like A+, or they are enrolled in school learning something IT related. They should know basics, at least I assume they do.

For one intern, I suggested setting up a server as a lab machine. They could use it to practice installs, configuration, backups, etc. Anything they might wish to understand better. Also a decent means for demonstrating to me they can do certain tasks before I let them touch anything that might somehow connect to a live machine. 

I pointed out a spare server that was nearly ready to go. Quad core, plenty of RAM, and 4 sas drives.

&gt; yzbot ""There is a good server. Set it up over on that corner tech bench.""

I dig through some software disks and find burned copies of XenServer, random Linux distros, and Windows Server evaluations. I hand them to the intern.

&gt; yzbot ""These should get you started. Oh, you'll have to configure the disk array. I see it has 4 drives, how about trying a RAID 10 setup to help disk IO if you run VM's""

I could sense a minor bit of confusion as my intern looked over at the server, and then back at me. I left to attend to my normal duties. He'll figure it out. 

About an hour and a half later I'm greeted by my intern. My first thought is that he's up and running already and looking for more work. Nope.

&gt; intern ""Do you have any more hard drives? I can't find any more.""

&gt; yzbot ""Oh, check the storage shelves.""

Bad disks? I guess that's possible. I checked the hardware out before hand though. Shouldn't be any bad hardware around. Meh, back to my emails. 

Another hour and half later.

&gt; intern ""Is there a different server I can use? I can't make RAID 10 with that server.""

&gt; yzbot ""Really? Let's go see what we have.""

We wander back to the tech lab and I see what my intern has been working on for the last 3 hours. He's packed his server with hard drives. He has 8 drives in it, as many as it will take. Way more space than he could ever use. I look the drives over, they are all identical. It should work. Two more drives are sitting just to the side of the server.

&gt; yzbot ""Bad drives?""

&gt; intern ""I don't think so. They all light up green when I put them in the server. But, I need...""

I cut off his sentence as I turned to the shelves and spot an identical server.

&gt; yzbot ""There, try that one. It's the same model.""

&gt; intern ""No, that won't work either.""

&gt; yzbot ""Oh? You tried?""

&gt; intern ""No, but it will only do RAID 8, just like this one.""

My brain attempted to process RAID level 8 but short circuited instead. I kind of just stared back at him.

&gt; intern ""I need a server that can hold 10 drives for RAID 10""

It took a little more questioning at what he was trying to accomplish. I learned that my intern associated RAID levels with the number of disks you use. He had been setting up RAID 5 with 5 disks, and RAID 6 with 6 disks, and just connected the dots right to RAID 10. I made sure he got a little more hardware tech time after that.

2m4ozx,11,2014-11-12,I worked in prisons/forensic hospitals to eliminate seclusion (solitary confinement) and restraint (tying people down) through trauma informed care - AMA!,[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2m4ozx/i_worked_in_prisonsforensic_hospitals_to/,"Hello all! I wrote a comment on another thread about prison, and several people asked me to do an AMA. 

I did an internship in college for the [National Center for Trauma Informed Care](http://www.nasmhpd.org/TA/nctic.aspx), going to prisons around the country to eliminate seclusion and restraint. In a lot of prisons, they tie people down or put them in solitary confinement as a way to control the prisoners. This is a huge issue, because many prisoners have had previous traumatic experiences in their lives, and doing this to them is basically re-traumatizing them.

What we did is to teach the prison guards and administrators to eliminate seclusion and restraint, by identifying the triggers for each prisoner and avoiding them. Some examples include:

Eliminating level systems, where you have to behave well to get rewards that would help you behave well. A typical example: if you're good, you can go outside. Believe it or not, it's easier to help people be good if you let them go outside to decompress; the people who don't behave well are the ones who need to go outside the most.

Treating the prisoners more humanely: one example is a women's prison we went to, where they'd have takedowns every morning. A takedown is when they tackle someone because they are too dangerous to control (getting into fights). When we asked to see the place of the takedowns, we found out the women were being tackled during shower time in the mornings. We went to see the showers, and saw that they all had to shower completely naked in front of both male and female guards. When we asked why, we were told someone had committed suicide 15 years ago with a shower curtain + rod, and all the shower curtains were removed. After our training, the staff came up with the idea to implement velcro curtains: the women would get their privacy, and no one could commit suicide. The instance of takedowns *completely disappeared*.

Another example was in a forensic hospital (mostly people who are deemed not guilty by reason of insanity), where there was a man who had dementia and kept getting out of his chair. He would fall, and there wasn't enough staff to keep an eye on him...so they tied him to the chair. After our training, a staff member came up with the idea to buy him a baby doll. The man believed it was a real baby, and didn't want to drop the baby when he wanted to get up, so he would call a staff member over to take the baby from him...and the staff member could then assist him when he would get up.

I remember one children's juvenile facility, where they eventually got rid of seclusion and restraint. The children had the idea to turn the benches they were tied onto into healing benches, that were placed around the facility. It was so beautiful. Many of these places turned their seclusion/restraint rooms into sensory rooms, so that people could decompress with music or other things when they felt stressed.

At another facility, there was a boy who flipped over a table, and the staff came over to restrain him. Before doing so, my mentor went over to them and said ""STOP!"" She knelt down next to the boy, and looked him in the face, asking him, ""What happens right before you get upset and throw the table?"" Without missing a beat, he said, ""I shake my leg up and down really fast."" Although this wasn't a trigger, it was a behavioral sign staff could look for in the future. When asked why he threw it, he said he wanted to write his mommy a letter. It was visiting day for the families, and his mother never showed up. The staff initially said he would use a pen as a weapon, but they found large markers that he could use safely.

This is an instance where identifying the trigger also helped staff understand the behavior - which enabled them to help the child cope with something. So, the big event (throwing a table) ended up leading to help for the child on an issue he was upset about, instead of seclusion...which would be a place where his anger and shame would continually build.

A major component of all this is that many inmates who have been traumatized have PTSD; they don't go 0 to 50 mph..they're idling at 40mph already. It's all about identifying the triggers to prevent them from becoming upset. 50% of prison staff also have had their own trauma, so it's important for staff to communicate about their triggers to help each other out. 

Lastly, we would set up programs for ""lifers"" (people in prison for life) to mentor the other inmates who would be leaving the prison. Sometimes they would produce gardens together, to see life being creating and take care of it. Giving people a sense of purpose, even when they are in prison for life, can actually help things quite a bit.

Basically our prison system in the USA is extremely focused on retribution, and doesn't really work on the rehabilitation component. Although it's one prison at a time, our organization worked to flip this on its head. Another example is a drug court in NYC that has a recidivism rate of only 5%, because the judge was trained in how to help the people recover instead of punishing them. 

Our focus isn't on what's wrong with a person, but rather what's happened to a person in the past to get them where they are.

The organization is National Center for Trauma Informed Care, run through a grant by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Agency - any institution can request a free training. Just check out their website: http://www.nasmhpd.org/TA/nctic.aspx

Feel free to ask me anything! Please note: I do not represent these organizations; my answers are only derived from what I learned during my internship. It changed my life, and I hope I can provide some insight into a model of incarceration that focuses on rehabilitation instead of retribution!

When nobody was willing to give me the time of day for even an interview, this guy gave me confidence, told me I was great at what I did, patient with my many questions regarding finance, etc.

And I love working for this school. Besides going to class and work I was pretty much a shut-in as an undergrad thanks to social anxiety. Due to the nature of my work I've gotten to know a lot of the other staff quite well, it's really like having an extended family, or at least it feels that way to this formerly hikikomori neckbeard.

Yet, there is so much pressure to succeed, everyone I know from high school is doing better than me. And now, one and a half years later, all the internships I've been working on the side and at night have finally paid off and I have a job interview next week for a much higher paying permanent position at a private company with full benefits.

Over and over again, these speakers are the executives from the firm. The programs are frequently developed to lessen employee turnover, build candidate pipelines, and /or make a more varied workforce. Specialized networks exist in numerous companies to support particular audiences, like women.

**One-on-one mentorship.** You don’t have to partake in a company sponsored program to mentor one or even many. Think about a professional association’s potential programs, a local nonprofit, or even your specific network of friends and relatives.

Remarkably, studies demonstrate that women have a tougher time finding a mentor. A LinkedIn survey discovered that while 82% of women say having a mentor is significant, only one in five in fact had one.

On the other hand, several in the financial industry really aspire to mentor others. And the impact can be deep. 

**Social Mentoring via LinkedIn.** Lastly, for the millions of people and the 300,000+ financial professionals on LinkedIn, there’s the chance to bid help by joining student groups as well.

Replying to a question or posting a comment is a technique to mentor many. Consider it as delivering top-tier advice to those who can’t afford it. But be wary of scams on the internet since you might be talking to a fraud."

I'm also going to post a screenshot of the job posting to hopefully prevent anyone from Googling part of it and having this thread come up.  I have good intentions posting this, though.

That being said, here's the job posting in question, identifying details removed: http://i.imgur.com/kHqE1QV.png

In essence, for $15/hour (Canadian), I would be expected to be the all-encompassing computer guru responsible for reprogramming their base system, managing their java website, fixing their computers, running tests all their other software, and knowing high-level C++, or high enough to write VoIP/DSP applications.  That set aside, I would love to work in ""a small group"" to learn these things from actual professionals who know what they're doing.  It's the ""independant"" part that is scaring me.

Some of these things I can understand, like the basic sysadmin stuff, knowledge of OSs, communication, etc.  For such a low wage, I can't believe I am expected to know all these other things.  I thought IT generally had high-paying salaries.

Is this type of thing really expected from somebody just starting out in IT, or are these insane requirements?  If this is normal, or expected, I may be on the wrong career path :("

2m5jli,7,2014-11-13,"I am 19 and obsessed with escorts, femdom, porn and masturbation and it's ruining my life. How can I fix this?",IamDepresed,askpsychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/askpsychology/comments/2m5jli/i_am_19_and_obsessed_with_escorts_femdom_porn_and/,"I have been masturbating obsessively since I was 12. At first, it was just pictures of women. Then it turned into videos of girls dominating guys, mainly foot worship. Even more, now I'm obsessed with cuckolding videos. 

At first, I would just watch these videos on my computer and masturbate. Then when I turned 18, I started seeing escorts. My first encounter with an escort involved me watching her have sex with her boyfriend (pimp) whilst she dominated and humiliated me. She spat on me, called me all sorts of names and made me eat her boyfriends cum. She also peed on me. 

After the session, I felt so humiliated I thought I would never see an escort ever again. Not to mention it cost me upwards of $400 for only 20 mins. Although, I had paid for an hour, she kicked me out after only 20 mins.

Unfortunately, that was only the start. I have seen 20+ other escorts after this for similar scenarios. I feel humiliated, ugly and depressed. It's not that I particularly enjoy these fetishes. I feel as if I am too ugly and fucked up in the head to enjoy normal relationships. To add to this, I've never had a girlfriend.

After seeing all these femdom  escorts, I thought maybe I should just try and have normal sex. I saw another escort who said I was cute. She was similar age to me and we had a great time. She even let me stay longer than normal because we had a ""connection"". In fact, we went out to get coffee after the session. I have never felt that way before. It was amazing to see that someone of her stature (she was a babe) found me attractive and enjoyed my company. 

It was clear we could never have a relationship due to the circumstance in which we met. She ducked my calls and ignored me when I asked her if we could go on a normal date. I began feeling rejected, lonely and ugly once again. The cycle started all over again. I began seeing femdom escorts once again.

In total, I have spent $6000 in the past year just on escorts. It wouldn't be bad if I had a well paying job but the truth is that I am a university student. I pay for these bizarre fantasies using the money I earn during internships and student loans. Had I refrained from doing this, I would be graduating debt free. 

In addition to me being broke, I am also on the verge of failing school. I constantly skip class, assignments and labs to indulge in my addiction. I went from being top of the class to barely passing. I'm at the best engineering school in my country. Just so you can understand the severity, I once skipped a midterm (worth 30%) to go see an escort in another city. I ended up getting a zero on it and my final mark was 65. Had I written the midterm, I would have managed to score a 90+ overall. 

When my parents ask me about my marks, I tell them I studied but the test was just too hard. They think I'm always studying when in reality I'm just jerking off or seeing escorts

I tried to stop masturbating as well. The maximum I have gone is 4 days. I'm afraid I'm starting to lose my hair because of this as I started to notice some thinning on the side.

I'm at a total loss and I don't know what to do. This addiction is going to destroy me if I don't stop. I can't talk to any of my family member as a they are very religious and would shun me. Although I have some friends (more like associates), I can't share this with them as that would definitely ruin our friendship. 

I figured it may be helpful to share my problem with the folks on reddit to see if they have any advice. I'll probably get banned for posting inappropriate material but I seriously need help. I'm depressed all the time and I hate my self. I'm a fucking loser.

It didn't always used to be this way. Although I was still watching femdom porn in high school, I was very athletic and what some may consider to be decently attractive. However, I have ruined all that and I'm sure I'll never be able to return to how I was. Unfortunately, their isn't a time machine or I would have used it a long time ago :(

Please help. I am on the brink of giving up on life. I'm not looking for pity as I damn well know this is all my fault. I just need a guiding hand.

2m6hgj,13,2014-11-13,I just quit my CFY after 3 days. Please help. How to choose specialty/know this is the career for me?,quitterslp,slp,https://www.reddit.com/r/slp/comments/2m6hgj/i_just_quit_my_cfy_after_3_days_please_help_how/,"Hi everyone.  Please help.  I just quit my CFY last night after only 3 days of being overwhelmed to the point at which I couldn't eat or do anything but cry before/after work.  I know I sound dramatic right now, but I'm truly re-evaluating my life and some insight or advice would be really appreciated.  I just finished my grad program at a competitive school and accepted the first job I was offered at a nursing home/subacute rehab (SNF).  It was a full-time position close to my home with a great supervisor, working for a company that contracts out to nursing homes in the surrounding areas.  I thought this was absolutely perfect, and I spent 2 months waiting on approval for the temp licensing paperwork.  


Well, I started Monday, and immediately became overwhelmed by the 90% productivity standards and the nature of the work.  I wasn't prepared for a setting in which I was thrown into things so quickly (they also fired the other SLP on my second day, giving me the whole caseload).  I have such conflicting feelings about whether I should have stuck it out, whether I should look for another job in the field, or whether to find a new career completely.  My supervisor was helpful and reassured me I'd be OK, but the other therapists in the building were giving me suggestions such as ""Work as many hours as you need (at least 12 at this point) and when you clock out just say that you spent 7-8 hours of patient care time and add the rest of those hours as unpaid lunch.""  I know that there is time you need to spend off the clock completing things, but I wasn't prepared for Medicare RUGS or this type of deal at all (not given ANY time to plan, prepare, check the chart, write the notes or reports).  On top of that there were other issues as well (was barely given an orientation on the building procedures, or documentation software, which is horrendous btw; was asked to make decisions I wasn't comfortable with about patients on my first-second day; lack of resources; sharing the tiny space to document/prepare with the PT/OT ""gym"", etc etc).


Okay so here's the deal.  I went into this field very unsure of my decision.  I found grad school to be a nightmare and I even took off a year in between to re-evaluate my life, because I always felt like something was wrong.  I LOVE the elderly and LOVE working with patients with disabilities and have worked/volunteered in nursing homes before.  However, although speech therapy generally interested me, I was never in love with it - I never took the time to read research articles on my own and usually avoided anything that went beyond the minimum to get by in grad school (completely confusing for me since at every other point in my life I've been an excellent and conscientious student).  


I HATED every single clinical experience and internship that I've had, except the acute care hospital setting, in which I saw mostly dysphagia patients for evals.  The work was repetitive in nature but the patients and their diagnoses were varied which kept things interesting.  I love the hospital setting and I loved working there.  As a student at this place, the productivity standard wasn't unreasonably high, and I was able to take a comfortable amount of time to check the chart/talk to the nurses/write the eval.  I also liked ONE of my clients at the university clinic; he was an autistic teenager who I had to work with to perform basic ADL's, and every session was repetitive and slow-paced (exactly what he needed).  


I should also note that the other main reason I feel inadequate for this job as an SLP is because I despise lesson planning or creating a plan of care/goals for anyone.  I feel like I can't even organize my own cognitive goals, let alone someone else's!  I liked the idea of diagnosing, looking at objective data and observing the patient, determining a general plan/goals to keep them stable enough to leave the hospital, and DCing them to rehab/home.  I am not super organized like most SLPs are, and the fact that this field is so subjective is causing me to crash and burn hard.  I am a slow and steady worker, and although I KNOW my time management has to improve, I have found my quality of life to significantly drop when I feel ultra-pressured to provide this type of care that I'm not comfortable with.  I'm not a great problem solver, and in this field I have found it REALLY hard to create goals that project into the future beyond a patient's hospital stay.  


My personality is causing conflict in all of this, and I am finding it really hard to be flexible.  Can anyone else relate to this at all?  Did anyone quit their CF and find satisfaction elsewhere (in this field or another?)  I just need some kind of hope right now because I don't know where to go from here.  I have a back-up part-time receptionist job, but my loans are beginning to pile up and I need to find my path, and fast. :(


Edit: **TL;DR:** I feel trapped and I don't know whether to change my career completely or to struggle to find a niche that I fit into in SLP.  Also looking for advice from people who have resigned from their CFs."

Where am I? What time is it? It's extremely dark but I can still see structures. Wait, I recognize this place... It's my room. I looked at the window. It's dark outside. I am sleeping, or at least I was.
Where's my phone? I reached to my nightstand, I grabbed my phone and turned it on. The bright light from it blinded me for a few seconds. It's 5:02, I am not supposed to wake up until 7 o'clock. I just got an internship in a bank for the summer, and today is my first day. I should probably go back to sleep.

5:34

I am still awake. I hate it when this happens. I always end up falling asleep just before 7 o'clock. It's fucking frustrating. Not today, today I am going to get out of bed right now and do something, I don't care what it is. I turned on the light in my room. It's quite messy. I should tidy up a little bit.
 I opened the door. My father is still asleep, which is strange since he always wakes up at 5 o'clock. I have been living with him ever since him and my mother got a divorce five years ago. I hated my life ever since, but I have learned to live with it. He sometimes brings his girlfriend to the house, I always find things missing every time they get busy in his bedroom, mostly money, occasionally a watch... my fucking watch.

5: 37

I noticed that I had an erection. I smirked, comforting myself about the size of my genitals like every other teenage boy. I had to go to the bathroom. Where are my flip flops? Ah Fuck it.
I walked barefoot to the bathroom. I looked down, I could barely see my feet, it was really dark but I knew my way around the house. As I opened the bathroom door, I rose my head only to be confronted by my own reflection on the mirror. It scared me for a second. I shook my head smiling, I have watched so much horror movies that I am not easily scared, and being scared by my own reflection has always been a comical to me... I was wrong.

5:39

I looked at myself in the mirror. I had a stubble. I wonder if I will be able to grow a full beard one day. I still had to go to the bathroom. I lifted the toilet seat and sat down. I left my phone on the night stand. Shit. I had no means of entertainment, so I took one square of toilet paper and started messing with it. I was constipated. This is going to be a long one.
My parents had to split everything, the house where we all lived for almost 10 years, and their children too. My sister, who's 5 years older than me, moved in with my mother. My father and I moved into a house that belonged to his father, the first days weren't easy, but then again, I learned to live with it. 

And now, a year later, It's a place I can call home.

5:52

Finally, I am done. Note to self: never eat Fava Bean Puree right before sleeping. I cleaned up and pulled my pants up. I looked at myself in the mirror again. I had a stubble. I am doing an internship at a bank today. I better shave. I grabbed my shaving gel and razor. Wait, this isn't my razor, this is dad's. Where's mine? I couldn't find it. I went to the cupboard. There is was. I don't remember leaving it there. It smelled weird, some kind of perfume. I went back to the sink, put the gel on my face and started shaving.

5:54

Ouch, I cut myself. I usually have very steady hands. It's not a big deal. as the blood ran down my neck, I looked at my reflection. I don't know what was so appealing, but I couldn't stop looking. It just looked... alive. I know it was my face, but my reflection looked like a stranger I just met. It was looking at me. He was looking at me. It looked like it was about to speak. I don't really know how to explain it but it wasn't me. And that's when it happened.
He winked at me.

5:55

I froze. What the fuck? Am I hallucinating? What the fuck? I am sure I didn't wink, I think I would know if I did.
The silence of the situation made it worst. My heart pounded, I could hear it and feel it in my ears. I was afraid, I didn't move.
But my reflection did. He raised his arm, razor in hand. He didn't blink, he didn't break eye contact. 
I was terrified, paralyzed by my own fear.
I couldn't feel my limbs
He then proceeded to open his mouth, and slowly ran the razor down his tongue...
Slowly ran the razor down my tongue, again and again and again and again and again.
I blacked out. Never have I felt this much pain. I wanted to scream but I couldn't. I felt a liquid, a mixture of blood, tears and saliva run down my chin, my neck and on the inside of my shirt, I could feel it on my torso and stomach like a water fall. I could hear the drops hitting the sink. I could hear every drop as if it was a church bell. I was not controlling my body. Why was this happening to me? What have I done to deserve it?

5:59

I felt weak. I had lost so much blood. My hand was still making the same movement. Those few minutes of torture felt like days. My tongue was no more, I was sure of it.
I could hear the blade hitting by bottom teeth.
Suddenly, the sound of the blade breaking echoed through the room. You can not imagine the relief I felt through all of the pain.
Now, I was digging through my bottom jaw with whatever piece of plastic I still had in my hand. I gave up, I guess deep down I didn't want to fight it. I hated my life anyway. I never had the courage to end my own life.
I felt my body give in to it's own weight. I fell to the ground. My face landed in a puddle of thick liquid. I was certain death was coming for me.

6:00

I was loosing consciousness. I heard the muffled sound of a door opening.
*I want to die.*
Noises, faint sounds. That was all I could hear.
*I just want to die.*
My name. I could hear it.
*Please let me die...*

Later, much later.

I woke up in a hospital. I couldn't talk. A nurse came in, checked the monitors next to my bed. She quickly left the room, I tried to call out to her but my mouth was full, and I was drugged up. I slowly closed my eyes.
Suddenly, two people rushed into my room. A man I assumed was a doctor since he was wearing a white coat, and... my father.
I was glad he was there, unlike other days before. The doctor told me not to try to talk until the surgery to replace my tongue and fix the damage I had done to my lower jaw. 
My father had tears in his eyes. He apologized to me for not being there for me when I needed him.
I never told anyone what I saw. I pretended it was a suicide attempt, because actually telling the truth would've probably landed me in the loony bin.
A year later, here we are. Everything went back to normal, my father never told anyone about what happened except my mother and my sister.
I was talking to my sister about the incident, and she said that mom couldn't handle another tragedy like this. When I asked her what she was talking about, she looked at me with a look of grief.

In 1994, my mother had premature labor. Upon her arrival at the hospital, the doctors did everything they could.
She was pregnant with twins. Only one survived."

Two years ago, I started at my first internship  at a startup in Silicon Valley as a software engineer. This was the first time I wrote production code that was affecting real customers. Like many of you here, my mind was flooded with self-doubt and fear. I felt that I wasn’t good enough, and was very nervous about everything I wrote. It had to be perfect; it had to stand up to the scrutiny of the other “real” engineers.

My first few months were rewarding, but also excruciating. I was endlessly obsessing over my work and worrying about tiny, inconsequential details. Each day, I worried that I would be discovered and fired because I wasn’t good enough.

In other words, I had the Imposter Syndrome. It drove me crazy.

A few days ago, I suddenly realized that I no longer feel that way anymore. Certainly, I cared about the quality of my work, but I am no longer obsessed, crazy, about minute details and afraid of criticism. Looking back, I credit this change to one mindset shift: I compared myself to myself, instead of watching the success of others.

I made it a habit to review code that I wrote two weeks ago and identify areas where I can improve. I collected a list of things to learn, articles to read, and set time aside to study these every day. While I was not following any specific metrics, I was tracking my productivity, code quality, and kept an eye on number of production issues to monitor my progress.

Each day was a small success. I stopped comparing my day-to-day reality with the highlight reel of the rockstars in the industry. I watched/shadowed/pestered other engineers in the company, and made sure that I was getting better each day.

I stopped comparing my beginning to other’s prime.

You are supposed to cringe at code you wrote many months ago. If you don’t, you are not growing. Now go out there and code your ass off."
2m6ted,2,2014-11-13,Advice for a graduate student with a very real possibility of flunking out,DomPerignon24,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2m6ted/advice_for_a_graduate_student_with_a_very_real/,"Hi everyone,

Just as a bit of background, I'm a 26 year old with a BA in political science who took some CS courses towards the end of my undergraduate years and felt that software development was a much better fit for me than going into law school. All the advice I received at the time was not to double major or change my major, but to go for a master's degree in CS instead. So I applied for the graduate program after graduation and was accepted since I already had all the prerequisites.

My first semester was last fall and unfortunately I stumbled and ended up on academic probation. I did far better this past spring semester,  but my GPA is still below the program's 3.0 minimum and I was told this was the last semester I could bring it up to a 3.0 before facing possible expulsion. Which I wasn't too concerned about until earlier this semester. Some miscommunication with the school about whether I was still going to be registered for classes this semester (it was over financial aid issues) lead to me falling a good deal behind in my two courses.

Long story short, there's a very real chance I don't get the minimum A and B needed to get off probation and I'll be expelled from the program after this semester.

Any advice on what my next steps should be if that comes to pass? Should I try going to another school (is that even possible after flunking out somewhere else)? I've been working on some personal projects, mostly some mobile apps I've written for my convenience. Though because of my job's policies towards employees writing software, I can't actually publish it to GitHub or anywhere else, so I figure it's a good idea to simply let employers know in my cover letter that I have projects I'd gladly show them. Even with a portfolio, I also know without a CS or similar degree, it's much harder to get my foot in the door career-wise. I've also been applying for internships, though if I flunk out, I don't see how I'd even have a chance at getting one since they're mostly aimed at students from what I've been seeing.

Thanks for any advice."

I have bounced between 30xrs and 20 instants. All of college has been Adderall for me. Last night I broke up with my girlfriend of two years and I think that was what I needed. Adderall has ruined has slowly been ruining my life and last night made me realize I just threw away my biggest supporter and best friend because of who I am when I use. 

I have a problem with substance abuse. I drink almost every night and smoke pot while use Adderall. While I will have to deal with those problems at some point, I seem to use those substances more while I have Adderall in my system. Especially the drinking, it seems to take that edge off the come down from Adderall. On top of that, I don’t eat and when I do it’s binge eating which has destroyed my once great body. I chain smoke like a chimney and don’t drink enough water. Mentally, it changes me so much. I have such an increased sex drive that has made me cheat on my said girlfriend and a very apathetic mood towards other people’s emotions.

On the plus side, I have almost graduated college with great grades and have gotten the internships and connections I wanted because of it. It makes me a more social and energetic person. 

I guess why I am stopping is because what is the point in having a great career if you go home and don’t have anyone there to share your success with? I’d rather have healthy relationships with friends, family, and girls while be mediocre at my job as opposed to having a great career but not relationships. I know I cannot blame Adderall for all of these problems, but I believe it is responsible for a majority of them. I am not the person I want to be or was while I use and don’t want to be this forever. 

Today is my first day of a long, long journey of adjusting to this life I have made for myself without Adderall. I have decided to tell my mom and my psychiatrist about my struggles with the drug and tell them I don’t care how much I may need it, I am tired of fucking up with it. One day I hope to be clean and see if I can pick up that relationship with my now ex-girlfriend again when I have control of my substance abuse problem. We still love each other a lot, but understood we both had issue we had to deal with by ourselves. I want her more than anything besides wanting to be clean for myself from this wicked drug.

I apologize for this long and cluttered post. You can probably see how spacey my mind is without it today. I need this and am willing to fight this battle for as long as I need. I can’t live with throwing away things that mean a lot to me because of a drug that makes me not me. Thank you for listening to me and any advice or insights would be awesome. Also, is there a sub to help with people beating this addiction?

I mean, yes, he was born in Washington, D.C., so it would seem logical for him to wind up working for the government in some form or another.

But working for the President of the United States? Being employed at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue?

C’mon.

Most people think jobs at the White House are exclusively reserved for Ivy Leaguers, geniuses, or people with privileged upbringings or “special connections.” Despite not falling into either one of those categories, John was able to land a full-time job as a White House Staffer by the time he was twenty-three years old.

Officially, John worked as a Writer in the White House Office of Presidential Letters and Messages during the Clinton Administration.

Unofficially, he was a speechwriter for Bill Clinton…

For those of you who watched The West Wing, Rob Lowe essentially played John’s character for an episode (if you don’t think that’s cool, we’ll never be friends).

What was it like for John to work in the Clinton Administration at the White House? Intoxicating. Demanding. Frustrating at times.

But that’s a story for another day.

Today, we’re going to analyze the biggest question of all: how was he able to land one of the most competitive and coveted jobs in the world?

To find out, we reached out to John via telephone to ask him questions like, “How did you think it was possible to work at the White House?” and, “How did you beat the most qualified candidates in the world for your first job?”


**How John Corcoran got a job at the White House**

John was twenty-one years old when he began working as an unpaid intern in the Speechwriting Office at the White House.

He got the internship by going through the run-of-the-mill application process.

“I had no connections to leverage when I landed my internship.” He told me.

“No professor reached out on my behalf. I learned that it was a realistic possibility to work there due to the sheer number of interns they were taking in those days, so I applied and got it.”

About halfway through the summer, John became completely enchanted by his surroundings. There was no doubt he wanted a full-time gig at the White House. But where do you even begin strategizing about how to land one of the most competitive jobs on the planet?

For the next few months, he basically moved into the Presidential Library – scouring old, historic speeches from the likes of Kennedy, Roosevelt, Reagan, Lincoln, and Washington, often just looking for one quote that he could give to another writer.

Eventually, he started to gain the trust and respect from several senior staffers, but he struggled to prove himself as a writer. His big break came to him when he was asked to write a speech for the President to be delivered at a ceremony honoring the mens and womens NCAA basketball champions of the previous year.

It was the kind of opportunity that has your stomach twisting into knots – especially when you consider that John had little knowledge about college basketball and Bill Clinton could have rattled off team stats like The Schwab. 

But without a hitch, John delivered. He handed his boss the speech. After the speech was approved, it was delivered by the President. It was a big success. John was starting to make a name for himself.

There were no available full-time jobs at the White House when John graduated from college so he opted to take a job for Dreamworks. Dreamworks was a blazing-hot company located in Hollywood and founded by Steven Spielberg. John recounted the company being, “Like the Tesla Motors of its time.” He worked at Dreamworks for a few months before the call came.

One of his contacts at the White House, who John stayed in close touch with, called to tell him that there was an open speechwriting position. John’s friend informed him that he had put in a good word for him and to expect a call from the hiring director the following week.

John spent the entire rest of the week preparing for the forthcoming discussion like a madman, analyzing the current Administrative policy and whiteboarding his thoughts like John Nash in A Beautiful Mind.


When the hiring director called, she introduced herself, asked a few basic questions, and requested John to mail her some writing samples (it was 1997). John obliged and said he would get them to her ASAP.

Then he paused and asked, “Do you happen to have today’s edition of the New York Times?”

“I do,” She replied.

“Well, I submitted a Letter to the Editor that you can find on the back page of today’s edition if you’d like to take a look.”

She opened the paper, read the piece while they were on the phone, and shortly thereafter told him to fly to D.C. for an interview the following week.

Son of a gun, I thought. How did he know? The day the hiring manager calls from the White House is the day his Letter to the Editor got posted in the NYT? Truly amazing.

“I bet the interview was cake,” I said, not withholding my arrogance.

He proved he was a top performer to the hiring director. His network was working hard for him. The interview was hotter than two goats in a pepper patch. THIS IS WHAT WE TEACH.

He laughed. “The interview was not cake. No interview in the White House is ever cake – it’s the White House.”

The interviews, which that took place over the span of a day, were conducted by some seriously influential people. Talk about pressure.

Like he imagined, the interviews were very challenging.

But as you know, he got the job. He was hired to work for the 42nd President of the United States.

John Corcoran will tell you that he’s not a genius, he doesn’t have an Ivy League background, and he didn’t have a strong connection with the hiring director. He never had an “in.” He just made one for himself.


**Behind the curtain: The Inner Workings of getting a job at the White House**

I’m beyond ecstatic sitting here writing this. It’s not often you get the chance to tell such a cool story.

But what’s so fascinating about John’s story is that it offers a blueprint for getting any ultra-competitive job you’ve ever dreamed of having.

Google, Facebook, ESPN, a bank in Zurich (am I the only one?) – it doesn’t matter. The subtle secrets he uncovered are repeatable when searching for a job in any industry and at any company.

To show you, I’ve prepared a Robert Greene style analysis for you (Robert Greene). That’s right, we’re going to take an in-depth look at the specific strategies and tactics John used to beat the job search process and land his White House gig. Some strategies might be more obvious than others but each played a crucial role in the ultimate outcome.

Let’s dive in.

**5 strategies John used to land a job at the White House**

**1) Get your foot in the door.**


&gt; “I wouldn’t have gotten a job at the White House if I wasn’t an intern first.” – John Corcoran

If you want to punch me in the face for writing this tip, I don’t blame you. I used to hate this cliche as much as you do.

But hear me out for a second.

If you want to get a job at your dream company, starting at an entry level position can be a very effective way to get your foot in the door. Why? Because it’s immensely easier to get in at the ground level than it is to compete for a mid-level position. By volunteering your time for free (or virtually free), the company has a very low stake in you. You might not be in your dream role yet, but…it gives you an opportunity to prove your worth and use that as leverage when seeking other positions.

Entitled people will scoff at this recommendation. They’ll think, I’m too overqualified to be an intern or to take an entry-level position.

If you are gunning for a particular job that’s highly coveted and you are looking for a way to create an unfair advantage over others competing for the same job, taking an entry-level job can create long-term benefits that far outweigh the obvious short-term drawbacks associated with it.

There’s also another subtle advantage of coming in at an entry level position: because the expectations of your work are lower (you are just an unproven intern working at a low cost), imagine the opportunity this situation offers to wow an employer. I call this “The Contrasting Effect,” where the contrast between the employer’s expectations and the employee’s actual performance is so vastly different that the employer is blown away and immediately views the employee as indispensable.

**2) Do exceptional work**


Let’s be brutally honest here: even when you get your foot in the door at your dream company through an internship, chances are very slim that you’ll convert the internship into a full-time offer if you’re not really good at something. It’s just the nature of high competition.

Most people will freak out and spiral downward into a pit of depression after reading this because they’re not an “expert” at anything. Take a deep breath. Most people in their 20s and 30s aren’t experts.

What I want you to know is this: you can develop in-demand skills quicker than you might think.

I’m not going to tell you to pull all-nighters, to sacrifice your social life, netflix shows, etc. That’s like trying to bench 245 pounds without having lifted in a year. It’s unhealthy and unrealistic.

Instead, the answer is to focus on building a habit. You do this not by overextending yourself, but by starting small, being consistent, and taking your focus off of short-term results.

When John started as an intern he slowly replaced the default menial behaviors associated with the job such as fetching coffee and answering phones with studying, writing, and editing speeches. By the end of the summer, his new habit had built up a ton of momentum and he actually looked forward to his late-night library sessions at the White House. In the process, he developed a habit, which helped him become an exceptional writer.


**3) Build relationships, not connections**


Imagine you walk into a party and you see a family friend.

It’s been years since the last time you’ve spoken, but as soon as you see him/her, you talk as if no time has passed. The conversation flows; there’s no agenda. You know if you needed something (like an introduction for a job), he or she would help you. This is a healthy relationship.

Now you walk into the same party and see a high school friend. It’s been years since you’ve seen him or her. You haven’t done a good job keeping in touch. You begin to talk and you’re already bored. The conversation feels like you’re pulling not one, but all of your teeth out. This is a connection.

Somewhere along the way, someone dropped the ball. Maybe there was no follow up. Maybe there was never mutual interest. The momentum of this initial connection never built up enough strength to form a relationship.

So, how did John build relationships in the White House?

He added value to the other person without asking anything in return. When he would browse the newspaper or different magazine articles, he would keep in mind some of his contacts. Anytime he came across something interesting or helpful, he’d mail them out. This showed a genuine, unconditional interest in the other person.

&gt; Bar story: Bill Clinton apparently does the same thing with crossword puzzles. He’ll see a clue that reminds him of a connection and then he’ll send them the puzzle. Imagine receiving a crossword clue saying, “Made me think of you…” from Bill Clinton. Yeah.

He stayed in touch and followed up frequently. So few people follow-up, yet is a crucial piece to building and maintaining relationships. If you’re not sure what to say, then you’re focusing too much on the outcome. Offer a personal message, ask them how their last quarter went, give them an update on you, or sprinkle in an article they might like.


**4) Play a different game (be unique)**


Differentiating yourself doesn’t mean you have to speak ten languages or have a triple major in college, it just means you have to strategically think about how you’re positioning yourself to your dream company.

John went to work at Dreamworks instead of working on Capitol Hill. He explained, “I could’ve gone and worked on the Hill. That’s what everyone was doing. But I didn’t. I wanted to be different so I took a chance.”

Some people might view pursuing a job in an industry might move him further away from his ultimate goal. But by playing it safe, especially in a competitive landscape, you are evening the playing field.

In the dating world, a guy choosing to go to a bar/club to meet attractive girls is evening the playing field. That’s where every guy goes to meet girls.

In your job search, submitting your resume through a company’s website AKA “the front door” is evening the playing field. That’s how the entire world hunts for jobs.

What is everyone else doing? How can you be different? Find an advantage. Take a risk. Play a different game…


**5)Beat inexperience by doing the work upfront**


Once you get in front of a VIP, you have the chance to eliminate inexperience as a reason for them not to hire you. In other words, you have the chance to PROVE that you are experienced.

The rule is: The more time you spend preparing upfront, the greater the odds you’ll get hired.

The people who don’t want to do the work offer platitudes like they’re “A natural interviewer”  or they’ll complain, “I don’t have enough time.” These people are either lazy, disillusioned, making excuses (or all of the above).

John did the nitty-gritty work. He did deep research, internalizing the small details of the Policies of the Clinton Administration. When it came time for the job interview, he investigated his interviewers like the Secret Service investigated him. He used this knowledge to quickly build rapport.

And he even went the extra mile by writing a letter to the NYT.

“The day the piece appeared and the day she called, that was serendipity. There was definitely some luck involved but I knew she was calling that week. I had a one in five chance. I took a risk but it was calculated.”

The point is: 90 percent of the work was done before he walked into the interview room.

The interview may not have been cake (c’mon, it’s the White House), but his preparation won them over."

2m783n,3,2014-11-13,"Me [23 M] with my girlfriend [22 F] of 1 year, her anxiety/self-destructive habits are making me resent her",johnnytakeaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2m783n/me_23_m_with_my_girlfriend_22_f_of_1_year_her/,"Let me say first off that I understand mental illness. I know it's an illness, not a personality trait, and I understand that it's serious and needs medication and professionals. Both of which we have gotten for her and this is something she has been dealing with ever since high school(she's been on all sorts of anti-depressants, etc.) so I know it's not our relationship or something recent that is causing all of this.

She also recognizes her problem and is extremely clear-headed and rational when discussing it. However when it comes time for her to have a mental breakdown (about once a week or more) things get out of hand pretty quickly. It will always been some random trigger. Either I will make an off hand comment that a person on game of thrones is attractive, or she had a bad exam that day, or she had a dream where I broke up with her, etc. and she will quickly turn into this self-destructive monster. 

She will say nasty awful racist/homophobic things about my friends, or she will start drinking, or when she gets blackout drunk she will sometimes take pills and say she wants to die. She misinterprets things I say or do as the worst possible thing I could've said and it just escalates. You get the picture...

Granted she is under a lot of stress, and things weren't always like this (or they were she just hid them very well) she works a lot, is a full time student and has an internship. She has a lot of hope for the future and wants to do great things but feels tons of pressure from everyone to be perfect. So when I ask for her to try to work on these issues that cause huge rifts in our relationship she freaks out and says she can't take the pressure and it's her mental illness. So I usually just don't talk to her about our issues and let things slide. I'm basically the perfect boyfriend to her, I do everything she asks, am always available to talk, I go out of my way to help her constantly.

But she also does things for me. She's very generous and understands her situation and tries to make up for it. I love her and it's breaking my heart that we no longer can have fun together. We have this growing resentment towards each other because the other person can't fulfill the other's needs. She can't be normal and calm and easy going for me, and I can't make her feel better when she has an anxiety attack.

Then a few weeks ago I tried to break up with her. I couldn't go through with it because she was so hurt and begged me to stay and that she would work harder on herself and her problems. She started guilt-tripping me into things such as 'I won't be able to succeed without you' and basically makes me think she's going to start heavily drinking or kill herself if I'm not around.

Now we're stuck in limbo because we both miss each other but can't be around each other. It's a huge mess and I really just want out of this without hurting her or making her life horrible but I'm fed up with being in a relationship where she can't even get dressed without her anxiety making her freak out or start crying.

---   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend has huge self-esteem/anxiety issues that are ruining our relationship. I feel as if she needs me around or she's going to go down a dark path. Do I stay or do I go?

Thank you anyone who reads my post and tries to help out, I appreciate your time and concern."

So I guess we'll see if I actually click submit for once...

Recently, my parents put our dog--whom we've had for 10.5 years--down. This was really tough on me, but because I'm currently a (university) student, I felt like I didn't have any time to deal with that and just had to bury myself in schoolwork. So I did that for several days, as best I could, but then I guess I reached my limit and lost virtually any motivation I had had previously.

I'm a third year computer science major, and one of my courses is very programming heavy. We have a project due at the end of today, but I'm currently looking at getting less than 20% on it. I started working on it over a week ago, but I couldn't make much progress at all for about the past week because I felt so unmotivated. I couldn't focus on the task at hand, and for whatever reason, I felt like I couldn't ask for help (not just with the assignment, but also with dealing with stress and the loss of my dog).

So now I'm worried about failing my class. Unfortunately, due to poor planning/time management, I already received a bad grade on one of the other projects. (I did well on the first one, at least, and decently well on the midterm exam...). I feel stupid for not being able to do this task. It's been making me really anxious for the past couple of days, though I didn't feel particularly worried about it for several days prior (like, I didn't care at all, though I wanted to). Moreover, I don't really enjoy this particular class. The thing is, I don't think I'm an absolutely terrible programmer or that I should even change my major--I truly enjoy computer science and programming.

We have one more project in this class, along with a final exam. I keep telling myself that if I do well (~85% at a minimum) on the project and score 50% or higher on the final--both of which should be doable--then it'll all be fine. I'm not 100% sure about that, though, to be honest... I feel like it's really bad to have failed two projects. I emailed my professor yesterday evening and told him a bit about my situation, but he hasn't responded yet.

Moreover, as a third year student, I'm worried about finding an internship. I feel like I'm not good enough to do anything in the real world. It also seems like I'm being forced into a software development position, but that isn't really what I see myself doing. Although I'm not exactly sure what I want to do, I know I'm interested in things like web development and databases right now. Except internships like that seem to be very few in number. And even then, I feel like I'm just really unqualified right now...

I'm not usually so down in the dumps about my major and career/internship prospects, but these days, I feel like I can't even compare to the other people in my major. I'm one of those people in the bottom of the class, which has never happened before. Also, I feel like a dog dying is so insignificant compared to your mom, sibling, friend, etc., that it seems almost stupid/trivial to me.

**TLDR - my dog died, putting me in a major slump for the past week or so, which interfered with my ability to get work done. As a result, I'm about to fail a project, which could cause me to fail a class for the first time in my life. Feeling really bad about everything, overall...**

**Edit:** thought I should add that I've been starting to feel better for the past couple of days, but my project and anxiety relating to it have been sort of counteracting that"

The only worthwhile project I can put on my resume is [this](https://www.freelancer.com/projects/PHP-HTML.1/HTML-Template-Generator-Utility.html). The only project I've done for a programming class is simple command line utility with a lot of classes/polymorphism/object oriented stuff.

On an unrelated note I need idea for projects and want to know what kind of projects people who have landed good internships have got on their resume. Right now I'm working on a website and learning django+python while making it but I don't really want to go into web-dev.

Also how on earth to I find a github desktop application that I can contribute to? Everything on github is some sort of abstract framework or too massive and complex for me."

A bit of background:

I recently graduated with my Bachelors in Information Technology from an accredited school with one of the better IT programs in the South East. With some help, I was able to work my way into an internship spot with a Fortune 500 company that you all know, and a lucky coincidence allowed me to land a paid contracted position where I am currently working on a SharePoint project for the Network Engineering team. I am currently studying for a CCENT, and ultimately a CCNA. I've taken the test once and failed, but hope to pass it next time around.

I find I'm not particularly interested in routing and switching, but believe my interests lay more in the Information Systems area and with VMware. I haven't applied for any positions yet as I am studying for these certs while my contract runs through.

----------------------------------------
My question, what sort of jobs would a VCP5-DCV open up for me? I actually took an official course for this cert in college and am kicking myself for not even sitting for the exam (late 2013), but I feel I have a pretty good grip on the technologies involved and could likely pick it up a lot easier given that I have already done it before. We also used this software in nearly every course I took. For someone starting out in IT, would spending the cash to go and sit through the course again and take the exam be worth it? What sort of job titles should I be looking for if I have a cert like this? I'm having difficulty quantifying which positions I should actually be looking at when doing a job search online. All searches turn up senior level spots that seem to require 5+ years of experience in field X,Y, and Z. However, maybe I am not searching for the right things.

Any advice you guys can give me would be incredibly valuable. 

Thanks!"

Hey all, I'm hoping some of you can give you input regarding our current situation. First, the stats:

**Us**: South Indianapolis, Married filing jointly, ~$200/mn groceries, ~$100/mn gas, planning to be in the area for at least the next 5-10 years, potentially indefinitely.

**Me**: 25, $60k salary (~$3500/mn take-home), $100k student loans from grad school (~$300/mn loan repayment), no other debt, probably not able to do full reno work but can fix most things

**Her**: 26, Grad student w/ 2 years before making money and end of deferral, will end with ~$120k student loans, no other debt, negligible income currently, will make ~$30-60k after graduation and internship.

**Current Apartment**: $600/mn rent, $75/mn utilities, 1 bedroom (just us), 700-sq ft, neighbors are fine (but we're not friends)

**Prospective House**: Looking for houses in ~$75k-150k range, can probably get preapproval for $200k if desired (but don't want that much), will have 20% down (ie, no PMI)

We're looking to potentially move into a starter-type house in Greenwood, IN (south of Indianapolis). I see little reason to continue renting when we're planning on staying here and have most other expenses figured out (student loan repayment plan being the primary concern). Rent vs buy calculators tend to agree with that assessment. It really doesn't make much sense to me to continue paying into a rent instead of paying into home equity. The better half is concerned we're overlooking things however and wanted more input.
That's where I'm hoping some of you fine folks (Fedora wearing or not) can lend some input. Based on the above stats (and anything else you might need me to add), which way seems better given the circumstance?

Thanks!"

Need advice,faust_1706,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2m7g94/have_an_interview_in_a_week_need_advice/,"I'm a freshman a MST studying computer science and physics with hopefully an emphasis on computational physics. I say hopefully because I'm only a freshman. 

Some background: I was the only programmer on my schools robotics team all 4 years. I had never programmed before. When I said I'd program I figured I'd have a mentor holding my hand. Anyways. After the 3 weeks it took to go through a c++ textbook, I was able to write a crappy program that worked. I got the robot to move based off joystick input. Then that summer and fall I dove in. I rewrote my first robotics program about 3 different times, applying new knowledge I acruded each time. 

Then I got into computer vision. I've actually co authored 2 papers with a mentor from boeing. The content of the paper was all his, I simply coded it all up to be honest. Then he left me to my own devices my senior year, and I'm trying to get my work from then published. 

A problem I have is that I have zero app development knowledge and that's what this company does. Nearly all my programming is mathematical (after you get the image from a camera, all it is is matrix manipulation and dfts.). 

I know c++ and a little python. 

So, I need advice. I know they aren't expecting a fantastic developer for the internship, but I feel like I'm extremely under qualified for it."

Instead of applying for an internship I just went to summer classes non stop to make up for a year I lost.

I have no idea where to go with my degree, I feel like it's wasting away, I feel so guilty not having a job after this long especially living in Houston the oil business capital and other tons of jobs. I really enjoyed network architecture when I took it that I felt like this was one of my strongest skill that I started studying to be CISCO certified but man its taking me so long, and I know Rome wasn't built in a day but I keep asking myself if me learning all this CCNA stuff from almost the beginning really worth it? should I rather be improving my coding skills like learning C# which is totally new to me, or web development (Java Script).

I look at these job posts and I look at the requirements which say things like C#, Visual Basic, and Oracle, J2EE/EJB Application Server, and other jargon. I hardly see things I know I always feel like I wont measure up to what companies expect lacking the confidence and knowledge. Even for a IT, CCNA certification will help but I'm really thinking if that would be enough.

I would say I really wish I could do something with database management, yet what do I study or do to get a shot working with databases? 

Having said all of this... what's the word? for those in the CS field what words of wisdom or advice can you share to me. What should be my play? go back to school? learn C# advance what I know if so, how? Buy text books and study different languages? By the way how is it working as a software developer, software engineering was my last class before I graduated, really enjoyed it made a 5 by 5 by 4 tic tac toe game with my group using java. I'm curious what is a normal day for someone working on computer development or IT.

I have only been active on here for a day or so and it has been enjoyable so far. Anyway, I enjoy drinking much more than I should. I just figured I would vent something positive here since most people tend to only bring up negatives from what I have seen.

I have plenty of negative things in my life, but right now things are going pretty good. I have had a good number of beers, my neighbor above me has made so many false noise complaints that I can now just listen to music at whatever volume I please (its less than quiet), and I have a wife that I look forward to seeing every day.

Additionally I was able to put in my two week notice at my shit job yesterday, so that mess will be over very soon and I am beyond happy about that. I am able to do that because I was approved for an internship that I have been interested in for a number of years. Although it is unpaid, it will be more than worthwhile later down the road. 

In the end, life is generally pretty good. There are a lot of shitty random hang ups, or other piles of bullshit, but it’s still good stuff in general. Try to be happy and focus on the positives, I have a large handful of serious problems that are worthy of this sub, but they are not worth my focus. Focus on what is going good and work on that. I hope everyone can do the same, if not , simply do what I do. Buy a stupid amount of beer and make things become good.

I have bounced between 30xrs and 20 instants. All of college has been Adderall for me. Last night I broke up with my girlfriend of two years and I think that was what I needed. Adderall has ruined has slowly been ruining my life and last night made me realize I just threw away my biggest supporter and best friend because of who I am when I use.


I have a problem with substance abuse. I drink almost every night and smoke pot while use Adderall. While I will have to deal with those problems at some point, I seem to use those substances more while I have Adderall in my system. Especially the drinking, it seems to take that edge off the come down from Adderall. On top of that, I don’t eat and when I do it’s binge eating which has destroyed my once great body. I chain smoke like a chimney and don’t drink enough water. Mentally, it changes me so much. I have such an increased sex drive that has made me cheat on my said girlfriend and a very apathetic mood towards other people’s emotions.


On the plus side, I have almost graduated college with great grades and have gotten the internships and connections I wanted because of it. It makes me a more social and energetic person. I guess why I am stopping is because what is the point in having a great career if you go home and don’t have anyone there to share your success with? I’d rather have healthy relationships with friends, family, and girls while be mediocre at my job as opposed to having a great career but not relationships. I know I cannot blame Adderall for all of these problems, but I believe it is responsible for a majority of them. I am not the person I want to be or was while I use and don’t want to be this forever. Today is my first day of a long, long journey of adjusting to this life I have made for myself without Adderall. I have decided to tell my mom and my psychiatrist about my struggles with the drug and tell them I don’t care how much I may need it, I am tired of fucking up with it. One day I hope to be clean and see if I can pick up that relationship with my now ex-girlfriend again when I have control of my substance abuse problem. We still love each other a lot, but understood we both had issue we had to deal with by ourselves. I want her more than anything besides wanting to be clean for myself from this wicked drug. At the same time, I understand this may never happen so I am not doing this for her, but for whoever I have a serious relationship with. I need to love myself and I can't do that with adderall.


I apologize for this long and cluttered post. You can probably see how spacey my mind is without it today. I need this and am willing to fight this battle for as long as I need. I can’t live with throwing away things that mean a lot to me because of a drug that makes me not me. Thank you for listening to me and any advice or insights would be awesome. "
2m82st,41,2014-11-13,[Guide] Welcome to your first BB Internship,[deleted],finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/2m82st/guide_welcome_to_your_first_bb_internship/,"
Friends, every month, many people on this fine subreddit post asking what on earth they need to do to get that good internship, and most importantly, how to act when they're on it.  In this post, I'd like to cover some of the basics, having introduced and dealt with interns for the past few years, and being our team's representative on the committee that decides who gets hired.  I'd also like to invite anyone with experience, especially those with more time than myself, to share their advice and experience.   

First, a bit about myself.   I am a VP (more on what tiers actually mean later) in a corporate finance team at a BB in London.   for some more background for other UK redditors I attended St Pauls school boarding, and went to Oxford University in the very early 2000s.  I have been in this industry for about 11 years, and am 32.   


Now, onto some basic advice

--- 


**Getting an internship** 


Transitioning into high finance (which we will consider to be corporate finance/investment banking, wealth management, PE and Hedge Funds, generally front office, high salary stuff) *after* you leave college or university is almost impossible in London or New York.  It is imperative to get an internship or work placement (where you do a year in a bank in between your studies) BEFORE you graduate.  Around 90% of new hires are hired straight out college/uni internships.    

So, how do you get an internship?  You apply online.  Make sure you're a member (preferably a board or committee member) of your university or college finance society/club.  Make sure your high school grades are excellent, your SATs (if you're American) are above the 95th percentile all round, and in your first year at university, make sure you are on track for honours or a 1st class degree.   Then, in your second year, apply for an internship in the Summer.  You'll still have quite a low chance of getting in though, unless you're an outstanding candidate.   

BUT WAIT.   

There is another way to get a fast track into banking. The 'Spring Week' internships, available at pretty much every BB and many other banks, offer a week of bullshit presentations and group work for students in their first year at university.  You will learn very little useful things at these events, but they look great in your CV or résumé and most importantly, can be a fast track to an internship in the summer of your *first year* in higher education, which gives you a tremendous advantage over your fellow students who don't decide what to do with their lives until later.    These internships often pay salaries that work out to around £38,000/$60,000 annualised, so you can make very good money for a summer of work.   

Spring Week applications open in early November, and they are a lot easier to get into than summer internships, so if you just started at University or College, **apply now**, as in literally within the next few days.     

Another important thing is your choice of University and Course/Major.  It used to be that university mattered a lot and course didn't matter at all, which is why you see many MDs with degrees in Japanese or History.  Today, that is much less the case.  Studying finance, accounting, maths/statistics and some hard sciences like physics is key.   You can still make it with a degree in liberal arts, but it's a lot harder than it used to be for people like me.   It also used to be that you had to go to a super elite university to get in (Harvard and Wharton in the US, and Oxford and Cambridge in the UK).  Today, you can easily get in at any ivy league + Wharton and NYU, and in the UK the top ones are Oxford, UCL, LSE, City (Cass), Durham, Warwick, and maybe Cambridge, though Cambridge is often looked down upon if you study something economics or finance related for some reason.  It is also possible to get into high finance going to other schools too, as long as your grades are good.  

In addition, the most successful candidates are often those who interned or did 'work experience' while still at school, at the age of 16 or 17. Doing this requires contacts or family members in banks, but if you have connections, USE THEM, because just a couple weeks in BoA on the trading floor or at UBS doing debt stuff as a pimply faced seventeen year old can forever change your career for the better.  Make contacts, and add them all on LinkedIn.  Build a network, and start young.     

So, to recap, the ideal flow that will almost guarantee a decently intelligent person a good chance at a grad position in IB is:  


* Short internships/work experience in IB while in high school.   

* Spring Week in year one of uni/college 

* Summer internship year one 

* Some more quick weeks in different areas (ie. private equity, hedge fund, asset management) while in year two 

* More prestigious summer internship year two (some people prefer to go back to the same bank to secure a job, others want a variety of experience).  If you can get an internship at a good fund or PE firm, you are golden at this point.   

* Secure grad job at end of year 2 internship 

* Do well in your third year of Uni 

* Graduate into job  

Once inside the bank in a full time job, career progression is extremely simple:  Analyst-Associate-Vice President (Also called Associate Director in some banks)-Director-Managing Director.  Above MD there are a whole slew of jobs floating around in a nebulous mix, and so once you reach that level it's more about getting on bank management committees and executive teams and so on.  

This is not for everyone- some people do an internship for a full year in-between years 2 and 3.   Others do things differently yet again.  But if you don't have a solid plan, I offer mine as the easy route.

[By the way, and I won't say much about this, if you have an interview it's usually just going to be a chat, with a few questions about recent events in the financial sector, a bit about your history/interest in banking, a big about the bank in question (the ""any questions"" section) and so on.  There will possibly also be some kind of logic puzzle/non-verbal reasoning test to do online or (I have heard in some banks) in person which essentially requires decent spatial skills, maths knowledge, and reasoning ability.  But this is far from the most important part, so don't sweat it.]

**Being A Successful Intern**  


So, whether by hard work or your Dad's buddy at JP Morgan, you've gotten that first summer internship, and you want to make a great first impression.  Here are some dos and don'ts. 


**DO** 


* Always show up on time.  This seems obvious, but after a year of college, it can be hard to realise that even 15 minutes of lateness twice a week will be noticed by that one chap in the office, and will be brought up in the evaluation meeting.   


* Take your older co-workers out for lunch.  This isn't about paying (in all likelihood they'll pay for you), but about developing a rapport.  There are guys in the cohort who I feel are almost friends by the end of the Summer, and guys who I barely know the name of.  If the guys in your team remember your name, they are obviously way more likely to take you.  (And for female interns who don't want to look like they're 'coming on' to a male boss, don't worry.  Doing anything remotely flirtatious with an intern is practically grounds for immediate dismissal, HR sends about 10 email reminders about this every May, and most bankers are not, in fact, arrogant macho sexual harassers, but *relatively* decent family men who will likely have no interest in you in that way.) 


* Say Hi to the senior guys in the elevator.  Familiarise yourself with your regional (or if you're at HQ, global) executive team.  If you bump into the CEO in the lift, which is far from impossible, SAY Hello.  Often, the senior guys love hearing from people just starting out, and will be happy to share their own stories.  One intern we had a few years ago began a regular email correspondence with our country head over the summer.  When he joined the bank full time a couple of years later, he was invited as a junior representative to several senior committees, and rose through the ranks like a bullet.  I think he made VP in four years.  By comparison, for me, a relatively slow ascender, it took eight. 


**DON'T** 


* Pointlessly overwork yourself.  Every year, I find interns sitting at their desks until one in the morning, browsing the news, because they think they shouldn't leave until we go.  This is bullshit.  Come into the office, work hard, and leave at 6 or 7, unless specifically asked not to.  I have sat in a fuckton of meetings in which HR complains that they received anonymous complaints about 'having' to stay in the office for 20 hour days.  Every time, EVERY senior banker in room sighs, because no one is encouraging it in the slightest. Junior Analysts? Sure, welcome to the land of no weekend for the next three years.  But interns?  HR forces us to structure all programs so that there is no potential for overworking.  And no senior banker thinks worse of am intern who leaves at 7 instead of 12 in my experience.  On a personal note, I tend to believe the former is more intelligent and capable, and thus a better potential hire.   


* Be a super-competitive jerk.  Every year I have to suffer the indignity of hearing intelligent 18 year olds badmouth each other to management as if I'm a primary school teacher.  We get it- you watched Wall Street and think you're Gordon Gecko.  Thing is, trying to step over your fellow summer interns as if this is the Hunger Games just makes you look like an asshole.  Be competitive, be hardworking, but let us decide who did the best job.   Most banking teams are flexible.  They might hire two great interns one year, but hire none the next because they are all substandard.

I'll try and update when I have time for more, does anyone else have more advice (or disagree with anything I've said)?

2m8dak,10,2014-11-13,My job odyssey..,jobthroaway786,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2m8dak/my_job_odyssey/,"This is the very real story of how I landed a job at an extremely prominent law firm as a patent administrator. 

It's something I've wanted to get off my chest, and at the same time perhaps someone can benefit from it. By no means is the job that I have landed a super-high paying job, but is def a step in the right direction. 

About 5 years ago I dropped out of a top 10 engineering school where I was studying electrical engineering. The reasons why I dropped are irrelevant, but what is important that I had 3 years of credits. 

After dropping out I worked at a civil engineering firm. I mostly did QA/QC (quality assurance and quality control) on engineering and CAD drawings, at $17 an hour on contract. 

Whats important to realize is that the reason there were jobs in civil engineering at the time, was partially due to the American Re-investments Act. This is where billions of dollars were poured into public infrastructure projects. This is why a number of companies popped up. 

After doing this for 3 years, the public money dried up. My hours were reduced, and I had months of no work. I realized that this was the ceiling of my so called career. I was never going to move up. I needed to find a different path, and going back to school was not really an option. 

I asked around. People mentioned IT, SAP, real estate. But nothing grabbed my attention. I didn't want to be part of a boom bust career. I heard of guys making $50 an hour doing SAP. But it all was under really shady circumstances. (Something like, they apply for the job using someone elses resume, and you would do the work, and they take off the top). 

After looking for a few months, I got in touch with an old college friend who was now a patent examiner. I didn't know much about patent law, but I was intrigued. It seemed like a niche field, something people weren't flocking too, and overall stable. After a brief search I found out that senior patent paralegals were making anywhere between 60-70k/year. 

Initially I couldn't find anything. But eventually I got an unpaid internship, with my university working as a legal assistant. To survive on this, I got an overnight job working at a gym. I would be talking to lawyers and inventors by day, to wiping sweaty gym equipment and mopping vomit by night. 

After the internship ended, I worked as a patent searcher. Again this paid about $9 an hour. But I had learned alot, and I was desperately applying for patent paralegal positions, and patent secretary positions, even IP docketing jobs. 

Nothing. For 6 months I was barely surviving. I must have sent 1000s of applications. Barely any call backs. Rarely any interviews. Absolutely no offers. 

Depression set it. I became un motivated. Put on some weight. Cigarettes, weed, and occasional hard drugs. Everyone told me that patent law was not for me. During that time, I tried doing Uber. But I had too many tickets. Every door seemed to slam shut. 

I had a choice to make. Either double down on patent law, or forget about it. I doubled down. 

I expanded my job search. I was in the mid-west, so I started applying to california, and seattle, and DC. Surprisingly, I was getting call backs. People were taking interest. But no one was willing to interview/much less offer over a video conference. I had to be there in person. 

Moving out without a job seemed impossible. I would need atleast 3 months to get something. I started searching for places to live where it would be ridiculously cheap. And then, I came across a reddit post on r/sandiego. 

A kid was commuting to San Diego State University, from Tijuana. wtf..
I looked into it more. And yea, a shyt ton of people were doing it. Stupid low rent. Make money in dollars, spend in pesos. 

I was desperate, so I packed my bags, grabbed my balls and got on a stupid cheap southwest flight for $116. I landed in San Diego airport, with bare essentials and a few dress clothes, and crossed the border. I speak no spanish. But I roamed around and asked for places to rent. I told them my budget was under $200.

In a matter of hours I found a dirt cheap place, four walls no wider than a queen sized bed in a hacienda owned by an ex-porn producer. Hookers, acloholics, drugs, were the daily routine in the place. I locked myself in the room, and fired away job applications with a california address. 

The interviews started coming in within the first week. I was applying to postings, and cold calling every law firm in the area. If there was an email I sent my resume, if there was a fax number, I faxed my resume, if there was a number, I called and begged for an email or a fax number. I was relentless. I had to land a job quick. 

One interview I had was 4 hours away. I went. 3 hours at the border. 4 hours up, 1 hour interview, 4 hours down. I had to do this twice. 

But, I got the job. Close to double than I had ever made in my life before. I was ecstatic. The gamble had paid off. It was a small law firm with no benefits, but who cares. A sense of relief overtook me. I wasnt crazy, I wasn't reaching for something that was too far. I gave a mental and emotional middle finger to all the nay sayers. And I called all the people who supported me with the good news. 

I worked that job for a year. Learned the ropes, took on additional responsibilities. Made myself invaluable. And after a year, started applying to the large law firms. 

Now I had too many interviews. And finally landed a top 10 firm job. 

As I transition to this infinitely well paying job that Ive ever had. Here are some valuable lessons that I've learned:

1) Never doubt yourself. EVER. Think about a plan, think again, think again, think again. But once you've made a plan, stick with it, and dont ever give up. ever. 

2) COLD FUCKING CALL: Most jobs exist in the mind of managers and partners, way before they make it onto job boards. Google map search all the businesses that could hire you, and go down the list. 

3) Revise, revise, revise: I cant stress this enough. Re-do your resume a thousand times. Find someone who is doing the job you want and beg and if you can pay them to take a look at your resume. This made a huge difference in my job search. 

4) Take risks: Where I was before california had a stupid high unemployment rate. Moving with very limited cash was a risk. But a calculated one. I had three months of survival. I got a job in three weeks. 

5) BE PERSISTANT: Interviewing is not enough. Follow up. Ask. Call. Email. Send actual mail. Yes the fucking postal kind. Trust me it works. 

6) High Energy: Think apple employees. Talk Like them, be like them. Smile during the interview. Even if its on the phone. Its the perfect mask for being desperate.

7) Believe: Fake it till you make it. Tell yourself that you will make it. Believe it. I told myself i will become a Patent attorney. Im a fucking high school graduate, college drop out. But based on where I am now, my employers are asking me to go back to school. 

TL;DR: I fucked up college, worked shitty jobs, but busted my ass, and now have a good job.

2m8hnz,3,2014-11-13,"Can we stop pointing the finger at 343? Maybe we should consider who sets release dates, and hold then responsible for MCC's launch.",ABCsofsucking,halo,https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/2m8hnz/can_we_stop_pointing_the_finger_at_343_maybe_we/,"TLDR: Developers don't set release dates, publishers do. Microsoft is responsible for the failed launch of MCC, not 343.
 

In the past couple of days, I have never wanted to pull my hair out as much as I have reading this sub. We get it, 343 released MCC broken, they are so amateur, and you're disappointed in 343.

Are you done yet? 

Well I have news for you, 343 doesn't have a choice when they want to release the game. When you see a release date *anywhere*, 99% of the time, that release date is set by the *publisher*. And it is very hard for that date to be changed. We need to stop acting like 343 is trying to screw us out of money, that 343 is responsible for this broken state that the game shipped. They are not responsible.

A publisher may ask a developer for an estimated completion date **a year and a half before it is expected to ship**, and then will turn around and use that very rough estimate to come up with a date. If a game has been marketed for months with a date advertised on it, it will ship no matter what the state of the game is. Especially with MCC, where the game supposed to launch on Halo 2's 10th anniversary. This happens way more than I think people on this sub understand. Developers are very much slaves to publishers. They don't have choice, they don't have a say...

Developers are as much a fan of games as you are, and they want their games to ship as flawless and fun as possible. After all, they want to play their own games too. However money does not grow on trees, it all needs to come from somewhere, and this is why many games release blatantly unfinished.

With EA shutting down Dawngate despite having thousands of active players daily, and Activision messing with Destiny's original plot, you would think that people would start realizing that *developers are not free anymore*. Developers are puppets, and EA, Activision, Microsoft, and Ubisoft are the puppet masters, yet they still take all of the shit from clueless, angry fans. I assure you, 343 feels like shit already, in fact they've probably felt like shit for the past couple of months. I think we and many other online communities have addressed our concerns for the game, and the franchise. **Now let's change our focus to the the multi-billion dollar publishers that are really at fault here instead of pointing our fingers at the wrong people**. Let's not forget that some of the same people that made you fall in love with Halo were responsible for MCC. They are just as amateur and evil as any other AAA developer (which is not even a bit). Sometimes shit happens, and sometimes things are out of our control. Sometimes we have to cut content, and sometimes we have to ship games with glaring issues. That is how the industry works now, and it's horrible. But *we* cannot take all the time in the world that we need to make a game. That would be glorious, but it won't happen, not with the way the industry is. Publishers have all the power, and we have nothing. So can we stop blaming 343 and maybe consider that Microsoft is the one shoving the game out of the door when it's not finished?

I am currently studying game development, and am an intern at a development studio. I've basically dug myself so far into the industry that I can't turn back, but god, sometimes reddit makes me want to give it all up, because you guys are impossible to please and *clueless* about the shit state of the industry. One day I'm going to be the guy taking all of your shit, and going to hate every second of it because I can't do anything about it. Because you guys are so clueless about the industry and constantly point fingers at the wrong people. Publishers can do wrong, and they *are* doing wrong. They are the one's shipping unfinished games. Any studio who loves games knows how much a bad release kills the spirits of gamers, and they will do everything they can to push the release date back so that they can provide the best game ever, but ultimately that is not our decision. And to think that Microsoft would push back the game just so 343 could fix something that is slated to take less than a week? Please. Tell me that Microsoft would want to spend another couple million dollars to move the game back a week, and in turn, ruining their marketing ploy of releasing the game within the same week as Halo 2, ten years ago. It just wasn't going to happen... 

Nobody wants their game to flop, fail, or crash, however it really isn't our choice anymore. So next time a game releases in a broken state, look to see how long ago the release date was announced, and ask yourself if it's really fair for developers to have to hit that date in an industry as random and chaotic as game development. Ask yourself who is really in power, and who's really trying to screw you out of your money. The puppet, or the puppet master?

That's it.

What kind of skills should I be able to provide the VC I work for?
I've heard a lot about cap tables and cohort analysis, I personally don't know much about it and am dying to learn more.. 

What else is there? 

Thanks a lot in advance guys"

In advance, thank you for reading my post.

Ever since I gained the ability to retain episodic memories as a child, I've always been unfairly socially ostracized from my peers, scarring me throughout my entire life in public schooling as well as my young adult life. I'm already shedding tears of sadness in the dark from all the years of injustice and hardships I've experienced. You see, as the title has clearly indicated, I am, and always have been, a stutterer as well as an aspie, and although I am absolutely proud to be, what neurotypicals love to say, weird and having an entirely different perspective on numerous aspects of life, my inability to fluently communicate and innate social ineptness have always resulted in lost opportunities, and given my current circumstances, I have ended up in the equivalent of a dead-end road in the midst of a forest, with no sense of direction to determine where and how to continue the next journey.

To provide further context, I have been working as an intern in an IT department for over four years, now, with no hope of ever being hired as a full-time employee with benefits. I started this particular internship by winning a scholarship from my current employer, and seeked their human resources department for potential job offerings in their IT department. Within just a couple of months after this event, I received two interviews and was eventually hired as a mere intern. Originally, I was only supposed to remain at my current employer for about two months, but somehow, as the months kept passing me by, I was still finding myself employed at the same internship, and eventually, I started to gain a sense of hopefulness and wondered if, maybe... just maybe... management would, one day, hire me as a full-timer.

However, from the years of rejection and ridicule, I developed such an overwhelming fear of speaking over a telephone and cannot, under any circumstances, utilize one to save my life. In addition, due to the years of social ostracization, I never had the opportunity to develop the necessary interpersonal skills to function in an office environment consisting of extroverted individuals. Unfortunately, as my department is primarily a help desk department, utilizing a telephone is a core requirement, but in addition, management highly values interpersonal skills. All throughout the day, my coworkers will engage in the usual small talk and gossip, while I quietly continue about my work. As a result of my circumstances verses the desires of management, after my third year as an intern, as they kept hiring help desk representatives who clearly were, in my opinion, technically illiterate, but also fluent, neurotypical, and extroverted, I started to become hopeless about ever gaining a position to call my own and developed fears in regards to my future, as I've always felt I am too unqualified to gain any sort of sysadmin position, due to my noticeable weaknesses.

As of today, I eavesdropped on a conversation my manager had with one of my nearby coworkers, and as they began to whisper to one another, from the corner of my eye, I noticed my manager pointing towards me with his manila folders as he was mentioning an imminent interview with a potential help desk representative, shamelessly mentioning that he was going to have me move over to a nearby empty cubicle further away from him, so the new hire could remain closer to everyone else. Upon that statement, I caught them quietly giggling, and that, for me, was the very straw that broke the camel's back. All these years, I was just a mere tool and cheap labor to management. That very conversation was the exact confirmation I needed, in order to continue about my life elsewhere: Management has never considered, and will never consider, hiring me solely for my strengths.

As of now, I am beginning to create a resume and LinkedIn account to hopefully receive some calls back from potential employers for a junior sysadmin/devops position, with a concentration in Linux and/or Windows, out here in Boston, but I am incredibly afraid of being rejected by numerous employers, with no hope of ever gaining a full-time position with benefits. To make matters slightly more challenging, I have also discontinued college, as I feel as though I am incapable of handling the demands of higher education and disapprove of debt of any kind. I solely rely on freelance programming and system administration from my homelab to gain the necessary skills to attain my dream. Computers are my passion. It's quite noticeable within my post history here on Reddit, but to continue about said passion in the form of a career seems, sadly, unattainable. I am no longer optimistic about the future, but only pessimistic and misanthropical. I am only in my early twenties, and this is my story.

All I want in life is my own apartment, decent pay, and a sense of peace. That's all I want in life. Why is it so hard to attain a lifestyle that, to me, seems so simple? I'll move out of Boston and pop the balloon containing my dream of attaining a sysadmin position, just to make a decent, living wage elsewhere. I just want peace, and peace away from other people who only seek to hurt me and use me as a tool.

Life shouldn't be this complicated."

Last week, I was hired as a consulting intern at a local church office for multiple things, the biggest project being a network make over. We'll get to that later though, this post is just for day 2.

My first task was to setup the Mac Mini on the rack with OS X server. No problem. I was rolling smoothly until I needed to reboot the gateway and apply some remote connection stuff so I could remove the monitor and manage it from Starbucks or, hell, an airplane with WiFi. Since it was midday, I couldn't restart the gateway, so I made me some coffee and set about fixing meager problems, one of which being updating iPhones from iOS 6 to 8 WITHOUT deleting anything. Easy task, just had to update from the computers instead. Since I setup an Apple Caching server on the Mac mini, I could download  it to multiple computers with ease. After some droll tasks, I went home with a broken LACIE G-Drive and a rack mount monitor with a bad panel. I disassembled the G-Drive, formatted the Dual 1TB HDDs and verified them. Then I diagnosed the problem, a shorted SATA power connector. Easy fix, clip it, solder a molex and pop a molex -&gt; SATA power in there. Reassemble, viola done! Then I removed the panel from the monitor and replaced it with a crap panel. According to the IT guy on site, I completed more work than he had done the last month."

So much traveling.,falloutforari,Frozenfriends,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frozenfriends/comments/2m91ow/traveling_so_much_traveling/,"Over the winter break, I will be traveling across country for the first time without my family- in fact it will be my first time leaving Florida in almost 5 years! I am going to Pittsburgh with my boyfriend's family. It's going to be fun but I have no idea what to expect of the weather! It might seem silly to have anxiety over snow/low temperatures...but if you were to live in a place where 60 is considered ""cold""...you'd understand.

After this, I will be going on my first big road trip possibly over spring break...maybe summer break; destination is Colorado. I will be going with my boyfriend and our best pals...to meet his internet best buddy.

And then...perhaps the most elaborate getaway for me in the near future...I may be studying abroad. I have never been out of country; in fact I don't even have a passport. Regardless, my dream is to see the world and I hope my slightly smaller steps to Pittsburgh and Colorado will ease my way into traveling across the planet. I will either be studying Theatre History in London/Paris in May or I will be studying the impact of the Holocaust in Germany/Poland in late June. 

Then, in two years time...if I feel ready...I will have an opportunity to teach elementary children in Cambridge for my second Education internship. It will be a month long adventure.

I'm starting to feel like my life is really moving; like my dreams can come true. I am full of anxiety but also full of excitement.

Where would you like to travel? Where have you been? Any tips on how to get over the pre-flight jitters? How's the weather over by you?"
2m942z,7,2014-11-13,"My mother always said our family put the ""fun"" in dysfunctional--an update to a semi-recent r/relationships post",gingercup,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2m942z/my_mother_always_said_our_family_put_the_fun_in/,"Hi RBN, I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2jmr85/my_20f_mother_50f_has_widely_overstepped_her/) (TW: Everything) almost a month ago and quite a bit has happened since! Users who commented on the post suggested I come to you guys for support; I've been lurking ever since.


**TL;DR**: Brothers abused me, mother didn't do anything to help. I moved out at a young age but moved back after a year. Now I'm in college and try to keep her at a friendly distance, she oversteps her boundaries by calling my counselor to tell him I need to drop out and move back home because she believes I was drugged and gang raped and that's why I'm depressed. She makes things up in her head and I believe it's her way of deflecting any self-guilt for why I'm sad, and I also suspect she knows I live with my bf and doesn't want that to happen. She's very pushy and tries to control my life. Please tell me how to approach our boundary issues with her.

The update: I mentioned in the comments of my first post that my parents support me with a car and a phone. Everyone said that I should work on becoming completely independent of my toxic mother. An ill (or well?) timed car accident solved the car issue for me, so I guess the positive is that now they can't use that as leverage against me. However, because I wrecked his car, I had to be in contact with my stepfather quite a few times so OF COURSE the fact that I was ignoring my mother was immediately addressed. I don't remember exact details of the conversation, but I had resolved to use him as a mediator and give him as few details as possible. He became pushy in the first conversation and I told him more than I originally wanted to because he *needed* an explanation. I told him that although I still loved my mother and wanted to have a relationship with her, she crossed the line and I had to have boundaries. I asked for some space while I worked things out. In a later phone conversation, he pressed for more information, and I told him I was severely neglected as a child and needed the space to work things out, that I wasn't trying to punish my mother, etc. 

Last wednesday he called and told me my mother would be coming that friday to where I live (an hour away) to ""help"" me take the car to the service station. I immediately panicked and asked if there was any way I could do it myself, that I didn't feel comfortable seeing her. Queue an exasperated sigh, he told me it had to happen and to treat it like business if I had to. Friday came and I was a ball of anxiety. I drove the car to the service station myself and was there on time and had everything handled before she showed up, late. The whole process took about 20 minutes, so why did she **have** to come down if I could, in fact, handle it myself? So she could deliver her disparaging letters in person, of course!


The letter from July expressed how truly disgusted she was with my financial decisions in general, and how I shouldn't be trying to stay in my college town over the summer to work an internship. As she put it ""Rich people have the luxury to work internships. You however, do not."" I'd be dishonest if I said the only reason I got an internship to stay here over the past two summers was to network. I genuinely HATE going ""home"" and am just now realizing that it's **not** because I'm a horrible daughter! She also expressed her disapproval of my ""dabbling with drugs and drinking"" (I smoke weed and drink rarely but she has BARELY any basis for this) and claimed I used gifts they gave me to do things they don't approve of. Half of the ""gifts"" they gave me were things I bought with my savings. 

The recent letter said she believes I'm trying to punish her with the silent treatment but that it isn't really a punishment to her because I've ""been self-bent for much longer than this current crisis and mostly silent except when (I) needed something or wanted something."" Keep in mind that I opened up to her about my depression in the first place because she guilts me for us not being close enough, and she overreacted and called my counselor with a made up story. She continues to run over what little boundaries I put up with ""where were these boundaries when I was trying to protect and save you from yourself?"" There are four pages of this BPDmom logic with the worst being that I need to look at my own failures and realize that why I'm sad is because of that coupled with my drug addiction (lol I smoke weed) I use to numb my pain. 

Yes, those letters reaffirm my concern that she is dysfunctional in her thinking. However, even though I consider myself to be more successful than I ever believed possible, it's hard not to believe her when she says such disparaging things. It's taken a week for me to realize this is just another way she's going to deflect any blame in the situation, even though I wasn't exactly trying to confront her with the blame in the first place. 

To end on a happy note: I feel I am progressing in moving on just by typing this all out and seeking support. So many of your posts have inspired me to have the courage to set up boundaries to protect myself; I hope my own post helps someone else out struggling with similar issues. Please feel free to comment or PM me with your own stories, support, or advice!

My roommate (let's call her Claire) and I moved into small 2-bedroom basement apartment together last June (although she worked in another city all summer and wasn't around much). Seniors now, we've been close friends since our freshman year in the dorms along with two other classmates, Matt and Kira. Claire was always the type of girl looking for a boyfriend and having her heart broken, but had decided to quit that a few months prior to moving in and focus more on her friends and family, something we all thought made a huge improvement in her happiness.

Then along came Nate, whom she met back in July at a friend's party. They hit it off instantly - he was everything she always said she never wanted (not very tall, not very ""big"", younger, dark hair, blah blah) but things just work out that way sometimes, you know? Unlike all the other guys she dated, I could tell that this one was special and I was so happy for her to finally find something so real. One snafu: he lives in Sweden.

---

Once the summer ended along with his US internship, he headed home but they decided to continue their relationship because they felt so strongly about each other. Claire would constantly say how busy they would both be during the semester and oh-my-gosh how they had to schedule times to talk to each other on Skype. I didn't realize this somehow meant she would schedule to spend every waking moment in the apartment talking to him. She works some days at big financial firm and some nights as a bartender in addition to studying for a full courseload. There is a six hour time difference between us and Sweden but I shit you not, they Skype when she gets home from the bar at 3 AM for a couple hours, she wakes up early to talk to him from 6-8AM, goes to work, then calls him again when she gets home at 5:30 and they talk until he goes to bed. 

There is so much fake-sounding giggling that I've started wearing earplugs while I study so I don't have to listen to the inane conversation (who can have real shit to say for that many hours a day?). She even leaves him on Skype to go shower then runs back right after. We took her out for her 21st birthday last week and she spent half the time standing in the corner texting Nate CAME HOME EARLY from the bars to Skype him. We then went to Atlantic City to celebrate her birthday over the weekend and SHE BROUGHT HER LAPTOP and kept asking about WiFi access because she thought it would be ""funny"" to Skype him. Meanwhile we're all gathered specifically to celebrate her birthday with her.

---

My boyfriend is an officer in the Marine Corps so I'm no stranger to distance. Although I understand every relationship is different (I personally would go insane talking to anyone on a computer that much), does this behavior sound unhealthy and excessive? Additionally, she seems to have no interest in anything else - apparently she's quit the student organizations she was heavily involved with, gives no fucks if the trash piles up and reeks while I'm away for a week, hasn't cleaned her room/the bathroom/the kitchen in... ever, and constantly complains about being so busy that she has no time to hang out with us then spends it all sitting at her desk because her boyfriend effectively lives inside her laptop.

My boyfriend wonders if she's unable to emotionally cope with this relationship and getting depressed and apathetic. They just didn't have the time to build a solid foundation on which a long-distance relationship could work. I don't know how her grades are, but I don't see how she has time to do work because she's constantly talking on Skype. Matt, Kira, and I want to talk to her but should we? And what should we say? We want our friend to be happy, but we don't think this is emotionally healthy behavior.

**tl;dr**: Roommate/best friend spends every waking moment Skyping her new long-distance beau. My friends and I are concerned, but what should we do?"

2m9yeu,1,2014-11-14,Critique my letter of intent/letter of interest,[deleted],gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/2m9yeu/critique_my_letter_of_intentletter_of_interest/,"So I am supposed to send a letter of interest. I'm used to hearing letter of intent, so I don't know if they're one in the same. Anyways, any suggestions on how to improve mine would be greatly appreciated!!!! 



I am writing this letter to express my sincere and serious interest in furthering my studies at the graduate level at XYZ State University. In December, I graduated from XYZ State University with a bachelor of science in zoology, focusing on ecology, as well as an additional degree in German. My experience both working at XYZ State and as a student led me to develop an interest in pollination ecology and ecosystem management. There I saw firsthand the high quality research and education that XYZ State offers, which has largely impacting my decision to pursue my masters here. For this reason, I hope to be able to conduct further research as a graduate assistant at XYZ State working with native plants and beneficial insects.

While attending XYZ State University, I took advantage of numerous opportunities to gain experience working with both research and agricultural systems. Working at the Student Organic Farm at XYZ State University was an integral part of my undergraduate experience, and where I first became interested in working with agricultural systems. There, I learned necessary tools for plant propagation and cultivation, skills that would be highly useful in working with this project. I gained research experience assisting with the ABC (ABC) project in the A Lab for two field seasons. Working with highbush blueberry, wildflowers, and pollinators piqued my interested in ecological restoration as well, and how landscape management could be used to optimize crop productivity. Although this project allowed me to become familiar with the pollinators of southwest XYZ’s agricultural systems, it also allowed me to see some of my theoretical classwork come to life. While studying environmental ethics and policy, my final project looked at ecosystem services with a focus on managed and unmanaged pollination services. This project encouraged me to critically think about some of the issues facing growers today and how economic and environmental factors must be ultimately considered when making management decisions. All of these experiences and opportunities ultimately led me to become impassioned to gain intercultural experience in this field, something I set out to achieve.

My decision to gain intercultural experience brought me to the BBB-Universität in BBB, where I am currently participating in a fellowship program promoting cross-cultural exchange. I’m using this time to further my research experience and knowledge in the field of agricultural ecology. In addition to studying agricultural science at the university, I’m also working on gaining experience in pollen identification and analysis. How pollen analysis can be incorporated into pollination ecology and contribute to research is a question I hope to delve further into this year. To further build upon my research experiences, beginning in February I will be assisting with the Garden project of the Agroecology institute for the University of BBB, where I intend to conduct independent research as well. This project will look at the relationship between pollinators, predators, and urban green spaces while also assessing community structure and richness. I look forward to working with arthropods in a non-agricultural setting and gaining additional perspective on arthropod communities. Additionally, I plan to focus on broadening my quantitative and statistical knowledge, something that I also hope to be able to do while in the graduate program at XYZ State. 

 Part of my desire to work with native plants and beneficial insects stems from my desire to call upon and hone some of the tools I have developed over the years. Being able to identify insect and plants in agricultural systems of Midwestern XYZ, effectively conduct field research, communicate scientific information to a broad spectrum of individuals, and collect data responsibly are all personal skills I believe would help me to excel as a graduate assistant. Although pursuing a graduate degree is a serious endeavor, both in terms of time management and research, my undergraduate experience adeptly prepared me to excel in such situations. While attending XYZ State University, I balanced my time between 2-3 jobs, numerous internships, and classwork. While doing this, I was able to maintain a 3.xx GPA, and during my last 4 semesters a 3.xx. Although my initial undergraduate performance may have been hindered by my overly full-schedule, over the years I developed the skills that allowed me succeed in the face of adversity. These skills I developed will help me to excel in the graduate program in XYZ State University. I hope that you will seriously consider me as a candidate for this graduate assistantship and I would be eager to further discuss my research interests with you. You will find my CV attached with reference information and GRE scores. Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.

2m9yp7,146,2014-11-14,My dad never had to look for a job,deerleader1,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2m9yp7/my_dad_never_had_to_look_for_a_job/,"My dad never looked for a job in his life.  He never made any elaborate career plans, never saw a career counselor, never went to a job fair, never even wrote a resume!

Yet he had a fantastic career. He had a total of about 20 jobs in his life. He started as a technician, then became a product manager, and finally moved into senior management of a large company.

He never actively looked for any of those jobs. All of those jobs found him.

When he graduated from a technical college he heard from a friend that a local factory was looking for technicians. That was in 1964. So he simply knocked on their door. They said to him ""Let me see your diploma. Great! So can you start tomorrow?"". That is how simple it used to be! 

And from there, one job lead to another. 

When I ask him about his secret to his career success, he answers ""I did something I enjoyed doing. I always made sure I did an excellent job. I always made sure I got noticed.""  When I ask him ""Is that it? But didn't you need to actively work on building a career?"" he answers, ""No I was too busy doing my job! And I was constantly offered the opportunity to do a more challenging job. That was good enough for me.""

I feel like I live in a completely different universe. Life used to be so much more simple and intuitive. Everything has become soooo bureaucratic these days. 

Even the interview process for a low level position as a glorified data entry clerk has become a 3-month marathon. 

Sometimes I despair when I add up the number of hours, months, YEARS that I have spent on writing cover letters, filling out web forms, traveling to job fairs, devising career strategies, researching employers, attending resume writing classes, doing internships, going on self-discovery missions, going to networking events, getting certifications,  keeping my LinkedIn profile up to date, ...

And all for what? A series of underpaid, mediocre temporary jobs interspersed by bouts of unemployment.  Sometimes I feel like a such a loser compared to my dad.  He had achieved so much more at my age. Maybe because he didn't have to waste so much of his precious time on all that career bullshit. 

But I try not to blame myself too much for my job search woes. Neither should you. The job market has become fundamentally, chronically broken. The job search process, which used to be a simple matchmaking exercise (as it should be) has become an arms race of ridiculous proportions. We have taken it for granted. But we should remind ourselves what a heroic effort even the simplest job search is, when compared to the experience of older generations.

2ma0mt,6,2014-11-14,Professional video editing on Mac OS or Windows? (no fanboys allowed),Jeemdee,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/2ma0mt/professional_video_editing_on_mac_os_or_windows/,"Hey guys!

At the moment I'm interning at an awesome small video production company (with big ambitions) and I'm loving it. The more experience and responsibility I get there, the more I'm aching to get working on my own small company.

Now there's one question that has been bothering me: *is starting a video business with Windows as your base platform a viable option?*

I've always worked with Windows myself, and know all the in's and out's. I already have a decent machine which will suffice for any work I'll be doing on it soon. Since I started my internship I've been using Mac's and came to like those as well. I will be using the Adobe kit and filming on DSLR's &amp; C100's.


**Cost**
A Mac with the same specs is more expensive than a Windows PC. Now I realize you pay more for the quality and looks (I LOVE their sleek designs), but for my company I want the most bang for my buck and rather not the full ammount at once - especially when I'm just starting out.

**Stability**
I've seen no difference in stability.

**Upgrade-ability**
I'm a geek and I like tinkering with machines. I'd rather buy a new graphics card and throw €500,- at my PC and have it up to date than throw €2500,- at it every 2 years to get a totally new machine.

**Co-operation**
95% of the business uses macs. If I don't, I won't have any in-house problems. But when it comes to cooperation's with other companies who do use OSX, I might run into troubles?


TL;DR: Apparently the world of video tells me to use the Mac OS while I personally lean to Windows. 
I'd like to hear your views on this! What system do you use, and why?"

Advice??,jhc387,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2ma0si/korean_citizen_with_no_real_job_experience_and/,"I graduated from NYU in 2012 and because of obligations to my country I served in the Korean Army from 2012 to 2014.  I was premed but ended up deciding that medicine isn't for me and barely graduated with a degree in economics.  Because of my premed pursuits and the fact I had to leave the country immediately for military service I wasn't able to pursue internships and to top it off my gpa took a pretty huge hit making it difficult to apply for a lot of positions.

I'm unhappy here in Korea because of cultural differences (I lived in the united states for over 20 years) and I'm looking to make my way back to New York for personal reasons.  I'm basically looking for any opportunity whether job or internship that will allow me to return.

The most obvious conclusion I suppose would be to return to school and raise my gpa/find internships that way but I don't have the financial stability to pay for more school.

Is there anyone with similar experiences or that might have some insight on ways to find internships or job opportunities that provide sponsorship?  Are there any programs for non-u.s citizens that I might be able to look into for obtaining a work visa or green card?

I'd appreciate any advice!

2manwv,14,2014-11-14,Bellevue,dootmore,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/2manwv/bellevue/,"As a follow up to my overall story... http://www.reddit.com/tb/2lza9j
I thought it would be interesting to share my very first hospital experience and diagnosis, which took place at Bellevue in NYC, 2012. 

I was 22 at the time and had spent an entire week in my basement apartment, manic, writing in a notebook attempting to ""cure"" cancer and reading wikipedia. I hadn't slept or eaten in over four days and by the time my roommate found me I was truly lost to the world. 

The closest hospital to us was Bellevue. During the admission process the nurses attempted to take my phone away with no explanation. This led me into a frenzy.  I didn’t understand why and I didn’t want to give it up. Soon they had my phone and in my frustration I decided to meet the people in the admission ward. I tried to shake hands with a man in handcuffs and was soon being pulled away by five men who forcefully held me down on a stretcher and injected me with a sedative without any warning.

The next thing I remember was waking up in a dark room in clothes that weren’t mine, no underwear on, holding my teddy bear. I had no idea who I was or what was going on. I immediately thought that I had been taken and would be killed. Death felt imminent. The nurses wouldn’t talk to me and I didn’t know what questions to ask. I tried to learn their names but they started playing a game where they would flip their name tags over so I couldn't read them. There were no light switches. Nothing to drink and I was so thirsty. No one would speak to me. I talked with my roommates who were both as delusional as I was so I didn’t find any answers from them. They did show me how to work the light fixtures with a comb.  I soon found that I could have a pen, which was just a plastic tube of ink with a ballpoint on the end and looseleaf paper. So I began to write. I had to find a way out of there. I was warned about the cameras and about people watching me, also that the nurses would take anything you set down. So in the dark of the bathroom I ripped a hole in the back of my teddy bear and placed a comb, a pen, and a series of notes outlining what I would have to do to escape (since I could barely hold on to one thought for more than a second). 

Time passed more slowly than I could have possibly imagined. I believed I saw a doctor in a series of events where he came in and talked to me and I remember refusing wanting to say anything to him at all. I then hallucinated that he got up from his chair and went the the tv and started yelling at it asking me questions. I was left in confusion and distress. I was realizing more and more how little I had to eat and that I wasn’t going to the bathroom because of it and couldn’t remember the last time I had. This was causing me distress because of the malnutrition signs my body was showing that I didn't understand and couldn't find an explanation for. I felt extreme cramping like I was constipated and a bowel movement was coming on, but nothing would come out and I was just leaking fluids. After arriving in the ward in the state I was in the pain my nether-regions were in I came to the delusional conclusion that I had been raped. 

No one had provided me with any basic hygienic necessities such as a toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, soap, or shampoo for the first entire week I was there. The process of obtaining any of these was so complex to me (only during certain hours, in a certain part of the ward, that wasn't advertised in any way...this was the hospital's way of saving money. One of my roommates obviously hadn't showered for months and smelled of rotten garbage.) I was in no state to know how to ask or remember to. I spent four more days sleepless and anxiety ridden. 

It really wasn’t until a WEEK of me being there that they told ME what was going on. I’m not sure if I was on drugs at the point because my mom had been calling me on the payphone telling me to refuse Lithium if they offered it to me and they were having trouble getting me to take anything because I didn't understand. And finally someone told me. You’re bipolar. You’re having a Psychotic Manic episode. 

The next two weeks were spent meeting criminals, drug addicts, and people off the NYC streets. Never can you have such and eye-opening experience until you’re the one crazier than they are. I was convinced that the lady in the room next to me was my long-dead grandmother who I’ve never met and that she was a part of the doctor’s (who I was now convinced was a Nazi Freud running experiments on everyone who was in there) evil plan somehow. Finally after I disturbed my roommates sleeping too much I was moved to a room with an Eastern European lady who was convinced that she was engaged to a Turkish dignitary. We got along quite well. Then during my second week a new guy came in and we got along great and I finally had someone to talk to even if we did cause a lot of trouble. My amazing friends came to visit me bringing me real food, underwear, and more books for me to write in. Too bad there was only one pay-phone for the entire floor and you couldn’t call out, except to have people call back right away.

One of my most distinct memories was when I was lying in my bed one night and I started to smell that sterile hospital smell. Then I realized the smell was coming out the the vents. I felt like I was going to choke and die. I gathered all my belongings and went to the hallway. The guard wouldn't let me go past my door. So I sat up all night, shaking, scared for my life believing that the vapor would kill me. I also remember a day another patient convinced me to wash my eyes with soap, and said to me after my eyes were red and burning, ""see, now it looks like you’re crying and they'll think you're getting better.""

During my last days at Bellevue after I had started to stabilize on large doses of Depakote and Risperdol that made me EXTREMELY tired I was granted privileges to go outside and go to AA meetings. Bellevue offered other classes like painting, makeup 1on1 with the interns, karoke, yoga, all of which I tried to attend which aided in my early release (even if I was only ready because I was so doped up).

I remember on my last day there I was sleeping about 18 hours a day. One of the head nurses came in and sat down next to my bed, asked me how I was feeling and said, “do you feel like you’re getting back to normal? Your alter ego sure was a slut.” (apparently I was too friendly and talked to much to the men on the ward) I just stared at her in shock, too doped up to think of a witty comeback. My hospital experience was horrible and dramatic and the PTSD it caused lasted for months. The most I was able to do after I left was fill out a survey outlining what I could within the confines of their multiple-choice questions.

A short time later I was admitted to a different hospital in Michigan. The experience was definitely different and better."
2mb2n1,8,2014-11-14,"My program is horrible, and I don't know what to do. I'd be very grateful for advice.",IOPsychThrowaway,IOPsychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/2mb2n1/my_program_is_horrible_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,"I'm coming to the realization that my grad program is absolutely horrible, and I don't know what to do with the time I have left. I'm graduating this spring, and it's just now sinking in how absolutely awful my program is. I really don't want to say which program it is, because I fear this will somehow get back to my program director/advisor, and he'll take it out on my grades or references. 

Here are the primary issues with the program: 

- Absolutely no faculty support. They never tell you anything about anything; mind you, I fully and completely understand that grad school is not about hand-holding, but there is absolutely zero interest in helping us/guiding us to finding internships or jobs. Zero alumni network- nobody in our field even seems to know we exist

- The coursework is absolutely awful. We have three core faculty; one of them (the head of the program) has us lead every single class. . . and then he interrupts every time the presenters are talking, belabouring the same points over and over and over again. He's so incredibly inconsistent, it makes life miserable. He spent three weeks psyching us up about how difficult our midterm for Selection would be, and giving us a few points to study in depth. He clearly wrote our midterm the morning of our exam. There were typos all over the place, and the questions were completely inconsistent (the original prompt said the organization distributed an assessment to 75 people, then the second sub-question referenced that 150 people were tested. . . ). Any time we EVER question him in the slightest, even just for clarification, we get a 10-minute go-around of him talking in circles making excuses as to why his instructions weren't unclear, we're just not reading them appropriately. I'm sorry, but when 22 students all have the same issue, this is a delivery issue. Not to mention this same faculty member is constantly implying that just having a Masters degree will condemn us to a life of working shit jobs in HR, and how being a PhD is so much more advantageous. . . our school doesn't even offer a PhD program. He's just such an actively de-motivating person to be around. He claims he values a social environment and his ""goal"" is to hold a monthly social that the faculty attend as well, and that literally happens twice a year. Once during orientation weekend, and on Halloween. 

The second faculty member is painfully introverted and obviously absolutely hates teaching and having to interact with grad students. He is an exceptionally, actively horrible educator, and he's not even useful as a researcher. He has six million half-started projects floating around that he's always doing tiny pieces of and never finishing. His style of ""teaching"" is to throw a book at you and let you struggle through data analysis, and refuse to answer questions completely. We do things over and over and over, and we never finish anything before moving on to another topic without ever confirming if what we're doing is on track or completely wrong. 

The third guy is as close to fine as any of these people get - he only teaches 3 of our courses, and he just had a baby in the past year. Baby brain 100%. Incredibly frustrating. He's supposed to be in charge of our alumni relations. The few I knew from my first year who I've kept in contact with claim they've never heard a peep from him. Every time we mention our lack of alumni network, the claim is that our program is too young to have much of a network. . . I'm sorry, but while a 12 year old program might not be stacked with top-level employees, there's absolutely no fucking excuse for this complete and utter lack of connection. 

These are just the issues that are on the top of my head that I can spit out right now. There are plenty more. Several of my classmates have been discussing writing a letter to the dean to express how sickened we are with this program, but as mentioned earlier, we are all genuinely terrified that our professors will take it out on our grades or references. We  have repeatedly brought up concerns with the program, and the head of the program just spends an hour telling you why you're wrong rather than taking ownership and trying to improve things. 

I am so incredibly embarrassed to say that I feel like I have learned next to nothing in this program. I fully understand that I am responsible for taking my education into my own hands, and yes, I absolutely could have done more  on my own to overcome  the program weaknesses, but the fact is that this program is awful, and when it's such horrible environment, it's incredibly difficult to motivate oneself to go above and beyond for something that doesn't seem to ever pay off. 

I'm going to be graduating in May. I've been looking for job postings, and everything I've always pictured myself doing seems completely out of my reach. I don't feel prepared for anything. I don't know what to do, and I'm in an incredibly difficult spot right now.

2mbd4y,8,2014-11-14,May have just low-balled myself through a recruiter. Company will be contacting me today. What to do?,CSGuy6,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2mbd4y/may_have_just_lowballed_myself_through_a/,"A recruiter called me several weeks ago and asked for a bunch of information including my expected salary for my next job.

Apparently, I told her $65-70k, but I don't remember that. Anyway, some time goes by and I do well in a phone interview as well as an in-person interview with the company. The company calls me directly and mentions that my salary is $70k; I stumble a bit because I was actually expecting 90-100k. This is due to the fact that my expectations have changed a bit since I first had contact with recruiters after research.

So I call the recruiter and tell her that the number $65-70k is wrong. She says she will call the company and ask for and update or something.

I'm expecting a call in about an hour. What can I do to prevent myself from being low-balled?

Some notes: I'm a new college grad with two internship experiences and the area I live in is in East Bay California, near San Francisco.

Edit: The recruiter called back to say $85k is the best they can do, but after that there are no more negotiations. I still plan on negotiating for more. I agreed and said I'll consider it. Thoughts? My planned speech to the company: ""I know the market and I know the average pay for a software engineer in this area. I am asking to be paid fairly, nothing more nothing less. There are plenty of opportunities and even more to come. If $85k is the best you can offer... I cannot make any guarantees as to how long I will stay, as I know there are plenty of choices for me out there."" This might be a bit harsh, but I'm really trying to push for more.

More info: the company is a child company of a bigger parent company that is VERY big. Glassdoor lists the average salary of the child company to be around $80k, but the average salary of the parent company is $100k+. How much should I REALISTICALLY ask for?

Edit 2: It looks like my last counter-offer ($97k if you're curious) was approved! I actually didn't have to use my planned speech. They (through the recruiter) asked for a number that I would be willing to sign, no questions asked. I stated $97k; the third party recruiter said ""Wow that's a lot... that's more than what they allocated for this position and that's what they pay the senior developers. This will require them to write a letter to management and the VP for approval."" However, I was firm in my tone, even though I was very afraid at this point after hearing this. About an hour or two later, I get a call from the company saying they will approve the number, but the paperwork/offer is still being processed and will be ready on Monday. Cheers to a happy ending.

Thanks for reading!"
2mbdsw,106,2014-11-14,The vacuum cleaner that didn't suck,dennisthetiger,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2mbdsw/the_vacuum_cleaner_that_didnt_suck/,"During my period of education that happened not long ago (from 2011-2013), I would occasionally do a sort of intern thing at other locations.  I noted one such tale [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1c6sp4/of_todays_work_foggystate/).  The other...well, sometimes, in IT, we have to deal with dust bunnies.

There are, here in the greater Seattle area, these used computer shops.  They take in old computers that are donated to them, clean them up, refurbish them, install software (Win7 Home Premium at the time, among other things), and sell them at discount prices.  Many such computers are handed off by a certain ""small and squishy"" company across the lake from one such shop, many of them come from the end user.

Most of the EU boxes get partsed out, separated, and disposed of for recycling.  The ones that survive a quick hardware probe^1, however, go through refurbishment - and the first part of that process is to crack it open, exterminate dust bunnies, and do a physical inspection for damage such as blown capacitors.

During my internship at this one location in Seattle, I was on dust bunny duty.^2

Mitigation, fortunately, was pretty easy - thanks to the use of an air compressor with a blower nozzle and a ShopVac attached to this box.  It was sort of like a combination of a paint box and an exhaust hood, had those clear vinyl strip-curtains in the front to prevent blowback.  On the back of this was a louvre that attached to the intake hose for the ShopVac, which dropped all of the dust into a clamped-on plastic bag and filtered for air out.

Or at least, that's what the assembly was *supposed* to do.  

My first time using this, I got a lung full of dust.  As I was an active smoker at the time, it didn't bother me *too* much, but that's an awful lot of dust.  OK, get the dust mask.

The next times using this, ti was easier breathing, but I came out looking like I'd been in a battlefield, minus the wounds.  So it was time to... troubleshoot!  

Quick observation of the blow-out hood indicated that dust was not suctioning out as fast as it could, which indicated either an obstruction in the intake, or a loss of suction somewhere.  Path traces are not dissimilar in scope to a layer one cable trace, so check the line to the plastic bag.

...which was not fully clamped on.  and boy oh boy, was that filter a mess!  

I took a few extra minutes.  Tapped out the filter, reinstalled it, clamped the bag properly, and blew out my next computer (one that was good and coated in dust) - and kicked on suction after I started the blowout.

You could hear the anguished squeaks of the dust bunnies as they got pulled into the black hole. 

tl;dr: Vacuums should suck, so as to exterminate dust bunnies - lest they become vorpal dust bunnies.

^1 in which we find out a) if they power on and b) what's inside.

^2 Gee, I don't know where my flair comes from.... =D"

I have worked as an intern at this company for 1.5 years.

They are a large international telecom.

I am located in the Midwest.

They want me to do development work.

They have said that they want to hire me(my manager has said so and I have recently spoken with HR where they told me about benefits).

My question is about where to start when it comes to salary negotiations.  I have no idea what number to even throw out there.  I've looked on the company's glassdoor page and for my area and it is ranging from $62k-$122k.  I have looked on Indeed and the average salary for a developer in my area(large metro) is $86k-$88k. Even the $62k sounds way too high to me.
  

Thanks for the help!"

2mc9r3,31,2014-11-14,Discussion with TBM mom about 19 year old son and his mission plans,[deleted],exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/2mc9r3/discussion_with_tbm_mom_about_19_year_old_son_and/,"So I have a son who will be 19 in a few weeks. He attends a very good Big 12 University and is majoring in Computer Science. He is one of those Robotic's types nerds who high school team competed in two worlds tournaments.  So my mom calls and in the midst of the conversation says ""so is SON#2 going to serve a mission"" to which I quickly said ""nope"" he is not.  So she started going on about how important an mission is and what not.  My oldest son served one year and came home cause the mission and his mission president were so fucked up, I told my mom that I would in no way support SON#2 going out on a mission. Plus getting the Big 12 University to hold his scholarship is a total pain in the you know what.  Well then the guilt trip of well school will always be there and SON#2 would be a phenomenal missionary so I told my mom,  ""mom, ya know what why don't you call him and talk to him about it cause I am fine with him not going"". So she did. 

A bit of back ground. SON#2 is the type of kid who once his mind is made up, no amount of bribing, guilt tripping etc on earth will work.  He is almost cold in his approach when he decides he won't do something. Apparently according to SON#2 the call went something like this. 

Grandma ""Hey honey, how are you and how is school
SON#2: ""It's going really well and I love it here.  I am getting straight A's in all my classes and going to apply for an internship next summer with one of the top premier tech companies in the USA"" I have made a ton of friends and really enjoy it here.....except for the cold. 
Grandma.  ""Well that is great, is there any plans to serve a mission""
SON#2 ""Absolutely none. I don't believe the church and would not go out and teach people about it, and will not give up my education for it""
Grandma ""oh ok. Well I love you""
SON#2 ""Love you too. Bye""

I'm still pissed that I had to talk to her for 30 minutes and he can shut her down in 3.  WTF?

Just a quick side note. I love my mom dearly, she is one of the sweetest people I know and bless her TBM heart she tries, and it must suck knowing that your kids and their spouses and grandkids are all going to hell. "
2mcj88,46,2014-11-14,Facing sexual harassment from a recruiter. I'm not sure how to proceed.,gradthrowaway01,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/2mcj88/facing_sexual_harassment_from_a_recruiter_im_not/,"For background, I'm a female PhD student in a STEM program. At my department a lot of major companies recruit for summer internships and jobs in my field and the internships are very important for future employment opportunities in the industry. This past September, a recruiter--I'll call him Jim--from one of the companies called me on my personal cell phone (which he got from resume) and asked me out on a date and said some inappropriate things to me after my interview. I said no, of course, and told him that I was happily in a long term relationship of 5 years and asked him to leave me alone. I was never explicitly promised an internship with the company, but he hinted that he would put in a good word anyway, even when I told him not to. 'Jim' texted me for a few weeks, but I didn't respond and I thought that was the end of it. I did end up getting an internship with 'Jim's' company, but I turned it down and went with another  company that also offered me a place because the whole situation felt very weird. 'Jim' stopped trying to contact me and I thought that was the end of it. I didn't report the situation to anyone because I thought I had taken care of it.

This past week, the same company 'Jim' works for invited about 15 people from my department (professors and students) for dinner. I went because one of my advisors asked me to go and I didn't think it would matter much as I doubted 'Jim' would be there. Well, I was wrong. He cornered me while I was coming back from the restroom and said some really inappropriate (sexual) things to me along with telling me that I had been invited because he had pulled strings and he really wanted to see me again, that I should be thankful to him, that he'd talked to his bosses and they would still give me a placement, etc. I tried to be civil, but I was incredibly angry at this point and I just left the dinner. 'Jim' has been texting me and has tried to call me a few times since then. Right now, I'm ignoring it until I can figure out what my next step should be.

I've never returned any of these advances nor have I given 'Jim' reason to think that I would return his feelings. The company is one of the largest in the world and fund quite a bit of research in my department (luckily not mine). My department relies on them and the recruiters are important to the departmental relationship with the companies as they're alumni from the school (usually). They give the department quite a bit of money for a lot of things, actually. I'm also in my first semester and just came to this school so I'm worried about being seen as a trouble maker, I suppose. There aren't that many other females in my field and I've had to face things like this before, but it's usually been from peers. There's never been this huge power differential and I feel exploited. I've talked to my boyfriend and a few close friends about it and they believe I should first talk to my advisors (who I do trust very much) and then possibly the department chair, but I'm not sure. Has anyone out there been in a situation like this? I'm just not sure if I should report this or exactly how to navigate the situation. Any advice you could give would be really, really appreciated.

Edit: Thank you guys so much for responding to this. I know I haven't responded to everyone, but I have read each comment and I thought I would post an edit with what happened today. I called my advisor today and met with him about it after waking up this morning to some other lewd and pushy text messages. I decided it was the last straw as obviously this man is not taking ""no"" for an answer. My boyfriend was able to get back all of the text messages I had deleted from when this first started in September and I showed them to my advisor. He was absolutely livid, but luckily *not* as over-reactive as I was afraid he would be--and called the department chair who then contacted people within the company as well as a few administrators on campus. Even the department chair--who is friends with 'Jim'--was angry and very supportive, especially since I had documented proof. I'm having to file a formal complaint to the company right now and on Monday I also have to meet with my school's Affirmative Action Office (and possibly Student Affairs) to file another complaint. The people at the company with whom I spoke were also supportive so my fears were hopefully unfounded. I'm not sure what the end result of this will be, but hopefully it will stop 'Jim' from doing this to anyone else. If anyone  ever has anything happen to them  like this (or are going through something similar) my best advice is to document everything and speak up ASAP. I wish I would have told someone what was going on sooner. Get familar with your university's sexual harassment policies, even if you don't think you will ever need them. I also learned a lot about university wide sexual harassment policies and there are always people on campus who can help which I honestly wasn't that aware of before. "
2mcocz,9,2014-11-14,"A brief discourse on misanthropy, pain, nihilism, and isolation; perhaps you can shed some insight",_libertine_,misanthropy,https://www.reddit.com/r/misanthropy/comments/2mcocz/a_brief_discourse_on_misanthropy_pain_nihilism/,"This subreddit was actually the impetus to my account creation.  For your reading pleasure. Vous amuse!

A brief bit of background--I'll get to the people-hating part soon:

I came into consciousness in a place that is actually quite conducive to misanthropy: dark, cold, remote Alaska.  Conservative christian, republican, ethnically homogeneous for the most part, population quite small.  My mother was a weak and pathetic example of a woman, servile, tragically uneducated (one quarter of cheesecake courses at a party university, then a year of modeling school, which is actually conducive to mental atrophy), easily offended and scared, emotionally remote and saccharine in her politeness.  My father was a sociopathic, manic-depressive, violent, racist, misogynistic asshole who abused us all, hailing from a line of marines, career mercenaries, and the kind of people who intentionally shoot their own kids.  I can't even make this shit up.  He taught me to construct bombs in the garage at the tender age of 12, and is currently rotting away in federal detention following a failed suicide by 20-lb bomb (he survived the blast as it wasn't shrapnel-packed properly, then drove to a hospital that later had to be fully evacuated as there was an even larger bomb in the vehicle with him).  The house was filled with Thomas Kincade prints, picture books featuring fabrege eggs and gardens, stacks of NASCAR and gardening magazines, and various loaded weapons tucked into the drawers and under beds in an otherwise attractive, upper middle class house on the waterfront.  The TV was always on FOX news.  There were no books, there was no intellectual discourse, no sarcasm was allowed in the house, nor any form of media featuring sex (Christian values; though violence was fine) such as a PG-13 rated film.  My sibling and I were not allowed to date people until we left the house.  Until I found out from other kids and the internet (obvs), I grew up believing that condom packets were filled with face-melting acid and that 'blue movies' consisted of men violently killing children--I asked, he answered.  

Fast-forward.

I got out of there as soon as possible, after an incredibly depressing 18 years, punctuated by 2.5 months studying abroad in Europe, ending with a pre-college senate internship.  I got into a good university, got my science degree, met exactly three friends I'd take a bullet for, got to speak with the Dalai Lama in front of 14k people, traveled abroad for study for another 2.5 months, meeting all sorts of  people along the way.  For extra cash (and because my parents refused to pay for college after telling me it was a waste of money) I bartended and acted in some fairly bizarre fetish porn.  I was still recovering from a hellacious past, and trying to figure out my gender identity and sexual orientation.  I pass as either a man or a woman, and have dated men, women and couples.  I don't do monogamy.  Obviously this is exactly what any god-fearing, FOX-watching parent wants to hear when a guilt-stricken kid answers the phone after months of ignored calls, so I kept my mouth shut. 

Now comes the misanthropy part.  My angry elementary/middle/high school/college self hated most people: I construed them as idiot cattle, blindly stumbling through life, devoid of critical thought, ambition, intelligence or self-awareness.  My experiences of domestic violence, psychological abuse, and years of living in a distorted reality at the hands of a sadist (supported by my mother, as a ‘good wife’, even as her eyes were blackened and her extended family threatened with death) made other peoples’ problems seem petty, meager, inconsequential; their reactions seemed maudlin, childish and melodramatic.  Your grandpa is having heart surgery?  You missed out on concert tickets?  Your 30-year old brother still lives with your parents?  It was all sort of hilarious to me at the time.  As I watched a friend overreact, in my opinion, to a small cut, I’d recall the time I saw the bone in my thumb upon letting a heavy knife slip while bartending.  I’d wrapped it in multiple bandages, threw a glove on, and joked without even blinking about how my career as a hand model was ruined.  Darker yet, I recalled slicing designs into my wrists with a razor, the only available release to the hell of an abusive childhood, wishing the adrenaline would last until I was 18 and free.  On the way to class on a summer day, I'd recall Celine's Journey to the End of the Night as a I watched bleach-blond sorority girls festooned in Greek letters ambling to classes: well fed, well rested, and well lied to.  It was painful, depressing, and underlined the meaninglessness of our tiny human lives.  I sat on the edge of the Void, looking in, feeling like a ghost drifting through space.

""What the hell is water?”

As I've gotten older, the nihilism and misanthropy have been easier to live with more of the time.  It's not quite as painful as walking through the world of Idiocracy (this is how it used to feel) or Stephenson's modern society from Anathem (the by and large who visit the monks).  I realize that *many* people are indeed cattle, and that a great number simply do not possess the depth to examine the state of being into which their little psyches were shat.  That many do not consider the ways in which genetics, culture, and accumulated experience shape their lives, taking their successes for granted and blaming their failures on external circumstances. That yes, these people are fuckers, but this is only attributable to ignorance, dearth of opportunity or appropriate stimulus, mind-numbing conditions like disease, poverty and inequality, and/or absent capacity.  

I minored in ethics (ha! a kind of performance art between myself and the universe?), and although I am in favor of whatever is best for the masses, I am also not necessarily against genetic modification, widely available contraception, or selective abortion with the goal of creating a less burdened humanity and fewer unwanted kids.  Ethics I consider to be a kind of best practice skinned of religion and quaint morals, being rationally, politically and scientifically informed.  Where I was nauseated by my religious upbringing, ethics gave me the opportunity to stop blaming or (trying but failing to) lauding the individual.  I threw away my toxic guilt for not being empathetic and picked up a new tolerance for the masses as products of a macrosystem.  I found peace in that detachment.

Years after leaving AK, a very experienced therapist who specialized in trauma, mindfulness meditation, and family dynamics told me that it was unsurprising that I was so miserable--not only was the early situation a fucking disaster, but my parents were uneducated hicks who somehow gave birth to an intellectually gifted child (there were brilliant people on both sides but that brilliance was not always used for good or channeled into academia). Sure, it sounds narcissistic, but considering the immense damage that sort of statement could have on a client, it's unlikely that a therapist would throw it out there so lightly.  And it made sense that most people would seem like glue-eating mouth-breathing dullards to someone who started reading Nietzche before they hit their teen years.  I’m not going to engage in any sort of psychic masturbation here, so don’t worry: my credentials are quite robust.  

Having accepted all of this, disinfected myself of guilt, and become more comfortable with the sort of creature I am, where does that leave me?  I’ve accepted that I won’t be compatible with 95% of the population.  Having low expectations is actually quite a relief.  But it’s an isolated place.  I was painfully reminded of this recently when a couple of friends started discussing Infinite Jest, a book I love and of which I consider myself a dilettante scholar, and I began discussing it with them, as a few other people chimed in with banal comments consisting of “oooh, I haven’t read it--it’s so long!”.  The discussion was fine, but then I realized that I was the only female-identified person I know who has read it--in my rarified circle of a certain major city’s 200-300 older, extremely well-educated, unconventional, successful, hedonistic, monogamy-eschewing, enlightened, godless dirt-worshipping liberals.  I mean, I get that there aren’t a lot of cerebral, robotic INTJ women running around (perhaps less than 1% of women, from what I’ve read), but it made me take a look at why I have exactly one female friend and find the rest to be somewhat insipid.  I wish I didn’t perceive this to be so, as it really limits things, but alas.  I cannot even imagine being condemned as a straight man to a gender that is societally dissuaged from science, philosophy, math, etc. and encouraged to put a heinous amount of energy into its appearance, only to become, in so many (but not all) sad cases, breeder livestock at the end of it all. But I digress.

With the above monologue being stated, I’m interested in your own experiences of isolation, misanthropy and nihilism.  Feel free to comment on any or all.  Some of my questions for you:

When did it start?

Have you done anything to augment or ameliorate it?

If you have friends, confidantes, partners in crime, what are they like in relation to you?

Do you think misanthropy and career success are compatible?

Do you consider it an affliction, an orientation, a personality trait?

How does misanthropy affect your family or personal relationships?

What is your hypothesized pathology of misanthropy?

I am a 27 year old male, originally from Michigan. I have lived in Nevada, Colorado, Colombia, Korea, and the Philippines before. I was in Manila in 2011-12 for a short-term internship, and am finally looking to return!

I absolutely loved it there and I never felt more comfortable or at home than I did there. 

So I am basically looking to find a person or two who wants to join. I would be looking for an apartment in Makati or the Fort Bonifacio areas. Both are fairly central to nightlife and different event centers. 

I am an avid soccer player/enthusiast, a gamer, a traveler, and I enjoy music and film as well. I am super easy to get along with and take care of what is mine. Looking to find someone who won't struggle to pay their part of the apartment. Working remotely would be sweet, but not a requirement. I do a lot of freelance work. Writing and some web dev stuff. I also would be looking to potentially gain employment in Manila in the tech industry. 

I will be definitely traveling throughout the islands in my free time, as well as playing soccer with some old friends on a regular basis. 

If you think you'd be interested, let me know! xD"

I also try to be a good Christians, I go to church, I even joined this Christian mental illness support group. Not to mention, the driving I have to do over the week, it is an absolute nightmare. I know it might not seem like that much, but I don't think I handle stress well. By the weekend I'm so exhausted, especially mentally, I have no motivation to do my homework or study.

The thing is, I'm bipolar 1. Lately, I've been going through the hypomanic stage quickly and straight into mania. I do love my manias though. I know I'm young but I've never done something I regretted, maybe something shameful, but I don't regret anything. Honestly, I think my manias are mild, they just come with some psychosis. It's no big deal. My first hypomanic episode was wonderful and I fantasize about having it back. The best part was how happy and productive I was, I tried to make friends with everyone. I really need the little boost to get some of this work accomplished and make my work and internship far easier. It would be so helpful.

I understand it will probably lead to a depression, but I'm trying to trigger a hypomania right now. I'm willing to be depressed later if it means being hypomanic for a few months, which is usually how long my manias last. I'm stable now, which I love, but I feel desperate and this seems like my last option. What do you think some of my other options are?

I stopped taking my anti psychotic about a week ago because the side effects became unreasonable, of course I'm making no effort to contact my doctor. I actually should find a new one but I'm too busy to bother, and when I do get free time, I don't have the energy to have a conversation with a secretary about my insurance, or usually it's too late. Even if I can get an appointment, it'll probably be in a month or two. This sounds like a mess.

Since, I've stopped taking it, I have hardly slept. At first I went four days without sleeping, now I'm up to three hours a night. My god, that' only 9 hours in a week. I'm not tired but I'm not manicy either. I've heard a lack of sleep can trigger it, but it's not really working. I've heard caffeine is bad for bipolar disorder, I drink coffee and lately I've been drinking twice as much, plus soda. I'm terribly stressed out too. Despite this, nothing is working, I'm still at baseline. I take lamictal also, but that's never done anything for my manias.

At the christian support group, these women talked about taking diet pills or saint johns wort to trigger a hypomania, but they're bipolar 2. Someone even told me they're taking extra ADs to trigger a hypomania. These women are retired too and were diagnosed about 30 years ago. Honestly, that seems a little immature to me but I'm thinking about doing this too, but I'm going to feel sneaky and dirty if I do. What type of diet pills are they talking about? Is that really true? I'm trying to trigger it 'naturally' and it's not working. Is it really as easy as taking some diet pills? Are they exaggerating? What else can I do to trigger this?

I feel fairly safe, if I do experience a high mood, I doubt I'm going to hurt myself or someone else, I haven't before. That's honestly how I feel about this. I know it must sound like I'm stupid and I'm kind of embarrassed with how I've been treating my illness. But I need help and hypomania sounds like the appropriate answer."

So I'm coming off of a disappointing 156 September score. I was still PTing only around 163 under strict conditions, but I wasn't mentally prepared on test day, and that penalized me pretty hard. My GPA is a 3.87, so I shouldn't have a problem there. I'm also getting my applications in next week to beat the seasonal rush, and hopefully be able to fit into the lower parts of the 25th%iles. No URM status, unfortunately.

I also will not be able to retake December since I have had zero time to study for the test with a big class load, internships, student groups, etc. So my first question is, are my chances pretty much nil at places like W&amp;M, UMN, GWU, UWashington(Seattle), Emory, and BU Law? I plugged my numbers into a few different sites, but I couldn't get a super good estimator of my chances so I wanted to see what you all thought.

Secondarily, if I were to get into one or more of those schools by some miracle, would be worth paying sticker, which I probably would be at this point?

Thirdly, if I get denied by these schools, would retaking the LSAT next June, and hypothetically doing better, say mid 160s, and applying again next fall to the same schools hurt my chances, since I already applied to them once before?

Any and all input is appreciated. Thanks!"

It's both thrilling, exciting, amazing and terrifying at the same time, but I cannot wait to get there!

Also, I've been relaxing most of today by doing some writing on my first original work. Some of you may know about the Frozen fanfic Mou Ichido that I still have to finish, and I promise that will happen, but there was another story that's been boiling in my head for too long, so I needed to get that on paper, and I'll publish it as soon as it's done. Yes, this one will actually be a one-shot with original characters and everything. I'm also trying some new stuff in it, so I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of reception it gets. Fair warning, though, it might be a tad more sad than Mou Ichido.

Oh, yeah, and I met a girl I like, and we've been flirting a bit, but it's nothing serious yet.

Hey all, been kind of questioning my sexual orientation and gender for awhile, ever since I called ""cute"" in grade school and not quite sure about how to feel about it.

Anyway, I told an online friend about it via pm, and ironically.. she was transgender (MtF) as well. We talked for awhile, and I finally got the inspiration to come out the /r MtF (been lurking for about half a year now), and get some information and resources. I have not told anyone offline, and don't intend to until I'm fully committed to the responsibility of my choices.

Anyway, I'm 22 and graduated with a degree in East Asian Languages (Korean and Japanese) so I'm not in a good place careerwise. That being said, I have 0 debt and am contemplating going back to college for computer science, where my aunt works and can refer me for an internship. My questions are:

1- Is it better to get my career together first and attempt the transition later? 

Keep in mind that I don't feel comfortable telling my parents or relying on them after I begin the transition.

I also worry about transitioning really late-am done with High School and College drama, but would still like to date in my younger years.

Also, what can help me plan the transition financially if I assume that I'd be supporting myself, prioritizing effectiveness first and cost second?

2- Is it difficult to keep a job mid-transition?

I imagination that the workplace would be extremely awkward once the more physical changes and clothing choices start to change. 

3- What paperwork needs to be done? 

I've heard of driver's license changes and passport changes, but I'm not too clear of what the law's perspective on transgenders is. I live in California, USA for perspective.

4- Do you keep in touch with your old self? i.e. Phone numbers, telltale email addresses, computer files, social media, etc. I'm considering changing all of these before starting transition, but would like to hear from experience.

5- What are the steps between coming out to myself, and then seeing a counselor about GRT? I don't often go to my family doctor, and I'm not currently enrolled in school, although I may be returning in the spring.

Wall of text, sorry.
Am open to PM if you want to chat, or if you have questions."
2me2hf,3,2014-11-15,[THEORY] What if Hide was behind Aogiri's doings?,[deleted],TokyoGhoul,https://www.reddit.com/r/TokyoGhoul/comments/2me2hf/theory_what_if_hide_was_behind_aogiris_doings/,"**SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS DONT READ IF YOU HAVENT FINISH TG**
  
  
  
Just came to mind, so take this with a grain of salt(ofc). So the thought just came to me when I re-read tokyo ghoul and saw Shachi once again and on the raid of Kanou's lab arc while he was fighting Kaneki and it *thumped* my head when he called someone and said ""I ran into the group I was talking about again"", and after the call he said they should go since they have what they wanted, which was Kanou(but not Rize?) So why does this make me think about Hide being with Aogiri? Well basically I thought ""who was that on the other side of the call?"" first it made me think about Tatara-chi(since he's the ""leader""), but I doubt he'd let Kaneki go just like that, secondly I thought it was Arima(because I speculate the CCG as a more corrupt group than Aogiri, but Arima came to mind since you know, maybe he knows whats up on CCG and helping these rouge ghouls, but yea, this is just my opinion/speculation) and lastly it made me ask ""What if it was someone that really wanted Kaneki to be alive?"" since on that time Kaneki, with all his rage and willpower, he could only go Half-Kakujya and even with that Shachi could still kick his ass. He's like one hit away from getting killed by Shachi, but the call kind've ""changed"" his decision, like maybe that person said ""no dont kill him yet, just get Kanou and go"". Well Hide comes into mind since he's the only dude that literally cares for Kaneki so much and along with that he's mysterious as fuck, and basically I've theory crafted why he's behind(**POSSIBLY**)on all Aogiri's doings.  
  
After Nishio Nishiki's arc, he hasn't had that much screen time, IIRC like until 1-2 arcs after the Aogiri tree arc he had screentime, and on that time I think it was he was suddenly an intern on CCG, during that time he leaked some info on Yamori/Jason, he knew him and pursued him 6 months before the CCG's raid. Curiously, I doubt Hide could hide(no pun intended) away from a ghoul, since their senses(smelling to be exact) are more keen than humans. So I call bullshit on that, if I remember correctly on the Manga, Hinami said that even from miles away a ghoul could tell if they were humans or not, so just makes it a little bit suspicious of him dont you think? Or maybe he just lied to gain the CCG's trust?
  
  Either way my hunch is that, if Hide truly is behind some of the stuffs going on Aogiri, then he probably wanted Kaneki to get caught solely just by him and not because he smells like Rize. Maybe that was an excuse Hide told them just so Kaneki wasn't gonna be too curious. Might I add that Yamori said during their capture for Kaneki(ch 52 page 5) once Kaneki lost the eyepatch and they saw he only had one Kagugan, Yamori:*It's just as HE said..* now who would tell them about Kaneki's one-eyed Kagugan other than those who are around him in Anteiku?(I doubt those Pierrots have any relation to Aogiri). Also, note that after that(ch 52 p14) Yamori said that they found ""the one with Parts of Rize"", again, I doubt they'd know who has Rize's parts just by looking at Kaneki's Kagugan. Ch 54 seems interesting as well, Kaneki mentioned that Aogiri's goal were firstly about to just capture Rize, but he also mentioned that they also wanted ""the guy who smells like Rize"" after that when he meets Tatara-chi, he gets gutted, and confirms that Rize is indeed ""dead"" like confirming a gossip from someone, after that he asks Ayato to get rid of him saying he doesnt have a use for him and mentions his ""eyes"" are no good and like that he cant be use, like he's waiting for him to get stronger, he even mentions indirectly to the members not to kill him but use him as a toy or whatever, directly getting Yamori's attention.
  
  Now on with Yamori, the group(Aogiri) must've planted him to really want Kaneki since they should know about his twisted fetishes and nature. Someone must've wanted him to make Kaneki suffer and go bonkers just to make him go strong and accept the ghoul that he is. There's also this teeny bit of detail on the part where Suzuya kills him and finds a device(sound recorder?) on Jason's shoe like someone was on the look out on what was happening with Kaneki(possibly Jason).
  
  **NOTES**:Phew I am pooped, will edit this tomorrow, will add more about the theory. But I hope you guys enjoyed, this isnt meant to be like I'm a know-it-all on the story(really Its not, its mere speculations based on my opinions on the story) but something like a topic that I want others that could go into debating, I intentionally had the idea to not get posted but I thought maybe the tokyo ghoul fandom community might want to hear it. Anyways, have a good day/night(whichever place you are lol) I'm going to sleep. SEEEE YAAAAAA!!"

I worked for them as an intern during summer 2013, and within a few weeks of the completion of the internship, I was offered a full time, salaried position upon my completion of school.  

I started in July, and was just recently laid off, along with 20% of the workforce due to a company downsizing.  I was offered roughly 4 months of severance pay, if I accept the agreement, and waive them of all liabilities. 

The reason I am curious about implied contracts though, is and while I was working full time, I was considered a ""New Grad"" and they talked quite a bit about their rotation program. (The rotation program was where we would rotate and do 3 different jobs (with different titles) and work on 3 different teams over the course of 3 years).  Nothing official was ever laid out or signed, but there were many emails referencing it, power point presentations that described the benefits of it, mentions of it during goal setting, and countless conversations about it between recruiters, other new grads, managers, etc.  There were old files on their intranet that laid out the possible options for each rotation, how to get the most out of each rotation, how the process would work, etc.  Additionally, while I was an intern, there was a lot of mention of it, and they used it as a selling point of their company. 

I'm curious if I have a case.  Unfortunately, I no longer have access to most of the ""evidence"", since I was laid off unexpectedly and the day I was informed of my termination was my last day.  I have to decide fairly quickly since I either have to accept my severance, or give up my right to press charges against them. 

Finally, if I did press charges, how public would this become.  I work in a fairly tight nit industry, and the last thing I would want is to be unable to be hired again or discriminated against because I brought forward this case.

Now, I know that trying to get my foot in an internship this coming summer would be the best move I could make towards a successful career.

I guess my question is, will I still have a shot at a job (or postgrad internship) after graduation if I don't utilize my last summer as a student in some kind of marketable way? How much would I be setting myself back? What else could I do to pad my resume as an alternative?"

2mexca,24,2014-11-15,My Job hunting experience,ajh1717,StudentNurse,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentNurse/comments/2mexca/my_job_hunting_experience/,"Just as a disclaimer, this is (obviously) based on my personal experience. I'm going to lay out everything I can to give you the best picture I can. 

I applied for jobs in the Pa/NJ/NY/De area. I received two offers in NJ (ER/med surg), one in NY (cardiac step down), and one in Delaware (Cardiovascular SICU).

* **My school background**

I graduated from a decently well known school with my BSN. I participated in a couple of nursing related organizations for a little while. I didn’t really participate at all during my senior year. When I was participating I wasn't super involved, but enough to be a regular member and I was selected as a delegate to represent my school at our state student nursing convention. I was also inducted into Sigma Theta Tau (the national nursing honor society). 

During my junior year I landed an internship position in the Emergency Department in a community hospital system. This was a full time internship for *only* the summer. I could have applied to be a CNA or tech after the position was over, but due to location it wasn't possible.

* **My clinical rotation background**

This is something that I know **strongly** helped me land the positions I did. If it wasn't for my clinical rotations, I know for a fact I would not have landed the CVSICU position. Having rotations in high acuity units and ICUs was the only reason they hired me as a new grad. I’m actually the first new grad they have ever hired on the unit, so without the clinical rotations, it would not have happened. 

 Unfortunately, this is usually 'luck of the draw' or something that students don't really have control over. I'm going to post a scrubbed version of my resume, the specific units will be listed there. 

* **The Job Hunt/interviews**

 The hardest part in my experience is getting the initial interview. If you can get that, you can open up a lot of opportunities for the unit you are interviewing for and units that you aren't. 

Once I passed the NCLEX, I started to apply. You can apply before hand, but a lot of hospitals (at least around here) will not really consider you until you have a license.  

Once you do start to apply, you need to follow up with HR or the recruiter (if their contact information is on the website).  Be aggressive, but not creepy aggressive. If I applied to a position on Monday, come Thursday I would call HR asking if they got my application and ask if I could have the recruiters email to contact them directly. They may or may not give you their email, but contacting HR shows you have serious interest in applying and can make a difference. 

I also immediately registered for a BLS refresher course and an ACLS initial certification course. The ACLS course in my experience was something that the managers seemed to notice.

Hospitals will pay for you to take the ACLS course or do the training as an in-service. However, by already having it, you can save them time and money. Yes, you will have to pay for it, but if it helps you land a job, then it is completely worth it. 

In addition to saving the hospital time/money, which helps you look more marketable, you can use it to your advantage in the interview.

All of my interviews have pretty much started with ‘so tell me a little bit about yourself’.  I used the ACLS certification as an example when I said something along the lines of:

&gt;”I’m very eager to start working and learning. I’ve always been very active and involved in many organizations so I don’t like to sit around without doing anything. After the NCLEX, I registered for the ACLS course as it was a certification I’ve always wanted and it was something I could accomplish in the meantime while I look for a job”

That isn’t verbatim, but you get the picture. I was able to use this certification to paint myself as someone who is eager, and willing, to learn and advance myself as a person and a nurse. This is something I’ve seen every manager or recruiter over at /r/nurse say is something they actively look for in new graduates. 

 Eventually they will always ask a question about a hard time you’ve had in clinical or a weakness you have. For a hard time, always end your answer with what you learned from the experience and how you can/will use it further throughout your career. It shows you can analyze the situation and apply it in the future, rather than just ‘ugh that was annoying’. 

As for the weakness, I use the same answer every single time. Literally. I do enjoy learning and ‘mastering’ the things I learn. I like to go into a lot of detail on the things I spend time looking up. When I get asked about my weakness, I usually respond with something like:

&gt; I like to learn as much as I can about whatever it is I need to do. Sometimes, I spend too much time looking into the very minute details when I don’t necessarily need to. It never affects my time management or has significantly hindered me, but I have realized in school I find myself reading far too deep into the minute details. For example when I look up a medication and its effects, I sometimes find myself reading into what specific receptors it binds to. It gives me more knowledge about the medication, but those specific details sometimes aren’t always needed. 

Basically, always end these kind of questions with something positive about it. My ‘weakness’ in this scenario is trying to learn too much. It may be a ‘weakness’, but it is a relatively ‘good’ weakness to have in the grand scheme. 

It is hard for me to really give specific insight into my interviews, as they have all been rather different. One was a panel interview with multiple managers, who just took turning asking the generic questions (hard time, weakness, most memorable patient and why ect), two have just been a one on one with a manager, and the SVSICU one was a one on one with the manager followed up with a panel interview by the staff nurses. 

The only other advice I could give is be prepared for clinical applications questions based on the unit you are interviewing for. Some of my interviews asked them, some didn’t. Surprisingly, the med surg ones asked most of the clinical specific questions whereas the CVSICU didn’t lol

Also, dress nice. I’m a guy, all of my interviews I wore a suit. I saw a couple people in very casual clothes. This is your one chance to impress, make it count, dress as professional as possible. 

•	**Post interview**

Once the interview is over, you need to send thank you emails to anyone you had contact with for the interview process. 

If HR set you up with a manager, you email both the HR representative and the manager. If it was a panel interview, email each member of the panel. Always be specific, don’t send a generic email to 5 managers on the panel. They can say pretty much the same exact thing, but send individual emails, not a large chain one to all 5.

I only emailed, never called or hand wrote anything. I have seen some people saying those can have more weight than an email, so it is something to consider. 

This is a long post so I’m going to post it and then edit it to slightly fix the formatting, typos and such. Below is my resume. I removed personal information obviously but it can give you an idea of the units I did my clinical rotations on and how I formatted it. 

[Here is my resume](http://imgur.com/QfUFmCF). The blacked out area on the top is just my name/contact info. 

I'm pretty exhausted, so I have definitely missed some stuff. Please feel free to ask any questions you want in the comments and I'll answer as best I can. 

I think the job hunt is a mix of marketing yourself and luck. I applied for the CVSICU position this past Tuesday, got a call on Thursday to interview on Friday. At the end of the interview yesterday they offered me the job on the spot. This is obviously not common, but it shows that it can be done, so don't let anyone discourage you.

So last week I got an internship offer from a fairly well-known company in San Francisco. The friends I have told about the offer think I'd be crazy not to take it: they're offering $40+/hr plus a housing stipend/

However, my parents want me stay home this summer. This is because it's my only my freshman year and since I have CS experience they think it's only a matter of time before I get sucked into the San Fran rabbit hole and they want to see me. Since I'm from the East Coast and go to college in California, I sorta promised I'd go home summer after freshman year as one last summer at home. Plus, I'm from Boston, so it's not like there's nothing to do there during the summer there.

The problem is I have until Tuesday to accept or decline the offer. While I would love to spend potentially a last summer home with my family, the SF offer is so sweet. And, at the moment, I have nothing else lined up. I had a Google Eng Practicum interview last week, and they have interns in Boston, but I have no idea how that went.

Thanks."

I was first diagnosed with depression when I was 12, prior to that it was ADHD. I've had so many diagnoses, though the only fitting ones were GAD, Social Phobia, PTSD and Dysthymia. I've been hospitalized on multiple occasions for cutting and suicide attempts. I haven't acted on anything in about 9 years, but I've come very close, the most recent being back in September.

I have a very volatile relationship with my mother. A lot has gone wrong in my life because of her poor decisions- I was in a very abusive residential treatment center as a teenager for 8 months, and it has really fucked me up. I haven't trusted her since and I don't think I will ever be able to trust anything from her. She even recently sent me some money as a gift and I freaked out because I didn't understand why she was doing this- there had to be some reason behind it and I still don't trust it because yesterday she sent me an email trying to offer some suggestions and I didn't even want to answer it because I don't want to talk to her. I almost entirely cut her out of my life back in the spring, because we got into a huge argument that brought up suicidal thoughts for me and made me absolutely miserable. I didn't speak with her for two months. Yesterday made me freak out in the same way.

Every time something goes wrong, something bad happens (like a break up), or I get stressed out because of my mother, my mind resorts back to the same standing plan I have had for years as a way out. I am going to be seeing my mother at Thanksgiving and the thought is making me absolutely sick. I just wish I could fade from existence without anyone noticing so I wouldn't have to hurt other people. I have so very few friends in my life, and I've just connected with a guy that I really like but I get so scared when he doesn't answer texts or something. I can force myself to go to classes and my internship, but besides that I barely ever leave the house because dealing with other people is too exhausting. I'm afraid of getting those thoughts again."

Currently trying to decide between two companies. 

Company A: Older company, known throughout the 80s-90s as a massive player, but has since lost it's footing to the likes of the 'New age' companies. They're an International company that may or may not specialize in Business Machines.   
The job: Developing server side Java applets for existing infrastructure on one of their large products.   
The language: Java

Company B: THE Silicon Valley electric car company. Enough said.   
The job: Developing tools to improve existing software on the cars.   
The language: Python

I'm weary of company B because I'd be paid about the same, but have to live in the bay area. Also, I've heard they work you quite hard, which I'm fine with if I enjoy the work. Finally, it sounds a lot more like Data Analytics than software development. Haven't received the official offer, but I assume my title is Software Engineering Intern.

Any thoughts?

EDIT: My girlfriend points out that I've already conditionally accepted Company A's offer, but in their official offer email they say 'The decline offer button is available throughout'. Thought I might as well add that."

My high school had a medical health academy program for students interested in going into the medical field. It prepared you for college and kind of gave you a head start on things like medical terminology and skills such as taking vital signs. Our senior year, we get internships at medical sites and I was placed at an internist's office and basically roomed patients, took vital signs, did injections, EKGs and urinalysis tests. I worked on average 5 days/week for about 3hrs/day. I accumulated almost 400 hours and have documentation of those hours from the health academy program coordinator. 

I was wondering if medical schools would accept these as clinical volunteer hours despite the fact the fact they were from high school days? I am a second year undergrad and still plan on doing more clinical and non-clinical volunteering but want to know if hours from high school still count. 

Thanks so much for any help!"

I've been writing songs on guitar since I was sixteen and playing in coffee houses and at open mics since I got out of high school. 

Right now, I'm struggling to make ends meet trying to work a minimum wage job and still chase my dream. I have an EP of songs out, but no record labels seem to be biting. I should also mention that my singing voice is very unconventional. When I sing, my pitch rises and I'm sometimes mistaken for a female vocalist.

One night during an open mic, one of your interns sees my set and grabs a copy of my self-produced EP. 

You're a powerful record exec who has turned out one pop diva after the next. With the decline of the record business, it's been tough to find that next hit maker and your label is struggling to stay afloat.

You hear a demo of me signing, not realizing the naturally high voice you hear belongs to a guy and that's when you come up with a plan. 

""Let's say we want you and your music and your voice. But we want you to play a character on stage. A persona. Different dress style to how you would normally do it. Different actions. A whole new character - and we'd let you modify it to some extent. The sticking point is that... we want that character to be a girl.""

Could I afford to say no?"
2mfm2y,3,2014-11-15,Life changes - need some advice,delicateglow,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2mfm2y/life_changes_need_some_advice/,"Sorry if this is all over the place. I just feel the need to post it all.

I'm 22 years old now. I have only gotten my first part time job about a month ago. You may be thinking ""Seriously? 22 and you barely got a job?"" Well let me elaborate. During my 4 years in a community college, I spent my time doing my GEs. Aside from that, I did this technical theatre program that took 1.5 years to complete. During that time and another year, I was the stage manager for theatrical productions in the college. As a stage manager, you're pretty much spending loads of hours and hours there. It wasn't a paying position because I was a student. However, the experience was absolutely spectacular. 

After I ""retired"" from being a stage manager, I took up an internship to a company that provides production design, a stage, and a few minor other things for people who wish to film commercials. The internship wasn't as great. I spent essentially 90% of the time cleaning and organizing rather than learning. But it's still something I can put in resumes.

After I completed that, I received my two A.As for Fine and Performing Arts and Theatre Arts. I applied to a university to transfer to get my B.A in TV, Film, and Media. I don't start until Spring.

My parents have sheltered me a lot more than I have realized. I couldn't ever go out before College. I couldn't see friends, I couldn't stay longer than when school ends. I had to go straight home. When I opened up my own personal bank account a couple of years back, my parents said no to me getting a credit card. It wasn't until I start receiving my paychecks from this part time job that I decided to get a credit card. So basically I'm 22 now with no credit score and I believe it takes 2 years minimum to establish credit?

Because of my parents' parenting style, I had nothing to do at home but play online games, one in particular. I played this game so much I opened a site for the game and everything. The site wasn't popular but I enjoyed working on it. Any free time I had, I would play. It was my escape from my family. However it became more harmful than good. I've became addicted to it.

I've decided to completely stop gaming as of yesterday. I've deleted everything in regards to gaming. To me, this was a huge step. I've always said to my friends ""I'm quitting"" but I would still update my site with latest news of the game. But I would come back a month later. It may be a little overboard but I at this point, I'd rather have it completely gone than to moderate. Once I get my life in order, I'll think of moderating. Until then, I won't be thinking of that. As regards to my site, yeah, I'm closing it too. It's sad because I've loved this site so much. I've met many wonderful people but I can't continue it.

To add onto my parents sheltering me - I feel like the step in life I need now is to move out. It'll teach me a lot about finances and independent living. Though living in LA, it's tough to move out but I do have friends that would be willing to be roommates (one with a credit score).

Not only this but my job..isn't even a job. I'm getting less than 10 hours a week. I can't live with that pay. Nobody can. So I'm currently looking for another job but it's just so hard during this season. Majority of places aren't looking for people - they already have seasonals.

But the issue again is looking for a job. I want to move out. I know I wont be able to move out within next week - I know the whole save 3 months advance in rent, etc. But I want to start. It's just so stressful. Before landing my current job, I had applied to practically over 50 places. Got about only 4 interviews, all which I did not get a follow up or anything.

I don't know what to do reddit. I'm just so tired of everything. Any advice would be great."
2mfvbi,5,2014-11-15,Three months post breakup and I still miss him :(,idunnonono,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/2mfvbi/three_months_post_breakup_and_i_still_miss_him/,"My ex broke up with me nearly three months ago after dating for about one year. We didn't have a nasty argument, we didn't cheat on each other, we didn't abuse each other, and he didn't leave me for someone else.

Before we broke up he had just moved to the city and was starting a new job. Me, feeling left behind, was stuck in a crappy part-time retail job that I hated going to. I felt I was going nowhere in life, I was trying to apply to full time jobs and internships but going nowhere. My ex started his new job and was extremely busy during his first week of work, understandably. But foolish me didn't understand how demanding a 8-5 job is (now of course I understand since I intern full time 40 hours a week). I didn't hear from my ex at all when he worked, nine hours would go in between texts and I was feeling neglected. I now realize I was being ridiculously unfair, as I now endure the 8 hour work day and can understand how exhausting it is.

Ironically, two days before we broke up I sat in bed crying telling myself I couldn't do it; I needed more from him, but he wasn't able to give it to me. On top of all this, we were only able to see each other once or twice a week due to the distance. It sounds ridiculous, I know, but after being spoiled from living three minutes away from each other in college, we were both unhappy with our limited time together.

I feel like I knew things were going slightly downhill; I didn't want to admit that it would be the end of our relationship. Despite the new job stuff, despite me stressing over not having a real job and my crappy living situation with my parents, despite the transition to post grad life, everything else seemed to be perfectly fine. When we saw each other regularly at school it was perfectly fine. But this new life after college, I guess things changed... 

So now I'm here, three months later after the breakup, and I still miss him. I went no contact two weeks after the breakup, with the exception of me wishing him a happy birthday a couple weeks ago (he responded and said it meant a lot to him, but I refused to reply). I'm trying my hardest to maintain no contact, and I do feel myself in a better place than I was before when the breakup was fresh. But I also feel factors beyond our control ended the relationship. And that's what frustrates me. I thought these months would pass and I would realize why we didn't work. But I still don't realize it, except for the fact that we are at different stages in life. I guess that IS the reason why it ended. I still dream about my ex, I have my days when I get really sad and miss having him by my side as both a friend and companion. He told me he still loves me when we broke up, he told me he would be open to trying again and reconciling at a later point in life. That makes it even harder to completely forget about him...

In the meantime I see my friends, I go to work, I've been on several dates, I'm meeting new people, and I enjoy my time alone. I even had an interview for a full time job and they want me to come in for a trial period to see if I'm a good fit for them. I'm in a much better place than I was, even before the breakup happened. I know my life is, very slowly, moving forward. I have a good feeling I'll have a full time job in a few weeks or months. Basically, I know I'm doing what it takes to make me happy and work on myself. 

Unfortunately, I still miss him. I experienced love before I met him, I had plenty of dating experiences, but everything with him felt different in such a deep, meaningful way. I can't even find myself feeling bitter or resentment from the breakup, however I still feel sadness at times. 

I was considering breaking no contact.. not yet, but maybe when I get myself established and when I'm out on my own with a job, with my own apartment in the city, etc. Who knows, maybe by the time that happens I'll forget all about him. In the meantime, I'm not sure what else I can do to move on. It takes time to heal and I realize that, but like I said before I seem to be having a hard time doing that due to the circumstances behind our breakup. Or maybe I'm just deluding myself from the real reasons why he broke up with me, and if that were the case I'd have no idea what those reasons would be. 

Today is just one of those low days when I feel all my progress has done nothing. I'm sure tomorrow I'll snap out of it, I just want to stop feeling this way :(

###Preface

I would like to stand before you, alone and apologetic. Just me, /u/_depression and you, the faceless reddit mob hiding conspicuously pitchfork-shaped objects amongst your ranks. And I would like to say, I'm sorry. The Create a Franchise is starting nearly a full week late because...

umm...

^^Can ^^we ^^blame ^^it ^^on ^^the ^^Yankees? ^^Yeah, ^^let's ^^do ^^that.

Really though, it was an issue of timing. It's incredible how content-packed this offseason schedule is, with almost every day of the week already being delegated to something or other (and really, I didn't want to steal any more thunder from the Rangers than they already had taken away from them with injury this year). So after much adjustment, I just decided I would run this thing every Saturday night going into Sunday. Any future deadlines - like voting and submitting - will be at 12:00 EST.

___

###SO ANYWAY

Welcome to the first round of the 2014 /r/baseball Let's Create a Franchise bidding! This week we will be **BIDDING FOR UNIVERSE/LOCATION**. For those of you in the know, get to it! For those of you new, I'll be including a more detailed rundown of what's going on, what to do, and what's still to come in a section below using

___

###UNNECESSARY LINE BREAKS

You get the gist, line breaks denote the different segments of information you're going to get in a post like this, except where they don't. This is all kinda informal anyway, just meant to be something that's terrifically tons of fun and lasts like 2 months of the offseason.

Back to business (and the narrative)!

___

###BIDDING FOR LOCATION

Last week, you were each given a form to fill out in order to enter your particular location into this contest, and now it's time to collect! If you happened to misplace/burn/eat your form, additional ones will be available below. Remember that while your entry does not *have* to follow the form's ... err ... *form*, it still has to include all the required information.

So once you've filled out your form, you may submit them in the comments below! Then, a terribly underpaid and overworked intern will save each entry form as a Word document, format them to the very specific requirements of His Lord and Majesty, Queen of Baseball, Sir Bud ""Don't Call Me Maybe"" Selig, print them out, scan them in as a pdf file, attach them individually to emails to the Queen's office, and then print them out (from the office) to be read and reviewed by His Majesty. After which, the intern will collect each reviewed form separately, fax them to their own personal office, scan them in as pdf files, and email them to me. I will then collect and prepare each one for redistribution on reddit as png files for you all to vote on next week, as well as transcribe each one (and the reviewed notes) for all you who don't have access to computers with image viewing capabilities.

If you do so choose, I can also mail copies of each reviewed form to individual users when voting commences, each sent in separate envelopes with His Majesty's seal.

**ALL ENTRIES MUST BE POSTED TO REDDIT BY 12:00 EST ON SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 22ND, EARTH YEAR 2014**

___

###HOW VOTING WORKS

Next Saturday evening, I will post Part 2 of the series which will include a link to a Google Forms page in which you can vote on your top 3 favorite entries. Of the entries, the 2 that receive the most votes will be chosen to move on to the next round, Naming the Team.

Naming the Team will work in the same way as Location does, though voting for that will allow you to choose your top 2 choices *per team*, and only the top choice for each will be accepted and move on to Stadium, then Logos. I haven't decided where we'll go from there, but we'll figure that out when we get closer!

___

###ENTRY FORMS

**Item 1: Location**

* ""Location"", as stated in the Form, shall unless otherwise explicitly explained be considered to be of the current prevailing universe, in which Earth is the third planet from the Sun and no alien contact or supernatural/superhuman powers exist except those allegedly possessed by Giancarlo Stanton.
 * **TL;DR** - If your location isn't from this world and reality, explain where it is located (like what book/tv/movie it's from)
* ""Location"" shall include a succinct synopsis of the peoples expected to both participate in the sport and participate in the fandom of the sport.
 * **TL;DR** - Describe the type of people that live there, and if they're not of this world, explain what type of being would play baseball and how they'd do it.

**Item 2: Unique Features and Benefits**

* This is a more interpretive section, where the bidder is asked to list or explain what their particular location offers that would be unique from any location currently hosting a Major League Baseball team, as well as what benefits the teams (both home and away) and MLB themselves would gain from the location being chosen.

**Item 3: Bribes and/or Gifts**

* In this section, bidders offer a token of appreciation to The Stupendous and Frabjous Mr. Bud ""Just Call Me ""Bond"""" Selig, a necessary part of the application process. While all gifts are accepted, for those offering monetary considerations, please PM /u/_depression for where to send your most gracious gift.

**Item 4: Anything Else Not Covered in the Application**

* Or ""AENCitA"" for short. It really rolls off the tongue!

2mfyk1,24,2014-11-16,A MN wife needs help finding a career opportunity for her husband.,AliMae83,Minneapolis,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/2mfyk1/a_mn_wife_needs_help_finding_a_career_opportunity/,"So this is my first post on reddit, and honestly it's a cry for help.

Reddit has so many users that I was hoping at least one of you could help a fellow reddit member out, whether it's helpful hints, local contacts, info, or maybe criticism, either way I'm here to listen.

So here's my situation...

My husband and I have been married for going on 8 years, some years rough, some years great, but lately our luck has gone down the drain.

Before we were married my husband decided to go to college to become a graphic designer, which at the time was not a super competitive career field, no TV commercials badgering you every 15 mins about going to school for graphic design, video game production, web design, etc., etc.  But he soon decided after a year of college that he would join the Air Force, which was great and everything, so after living in Germany and California and having our own apartment to call home, he decided to join the Air Force Reserves.  So we made our way back to Minneapolis, MN, to live and for him to go back to school for the remaining three years needed to complete his college degree, which the three years would be payed for by the Air Force.  So we were able to get our own apartment as long as he was a full time student.  

Three years go by and it's time for him to go out in the world and get that great career job that was going to get us the house we wanted, the income to start a family, and finally settle down for the long haul.  Well that never came and soon it was on me to find a job, you know the one without the college degree or military background, which meant we were not even going to come close to the money needed to keep the apartment.  

Soon I found a full time job, with benefits, but it was to late, we were already living with my husbands parents, our independence slowly fading away.  

My husbands want for a career slowly faded away also, as did his time spent being creative and his want for something better for us.  Application after application was filled, resume sent to this website and that website.  He got a contract job, finally some extra income!  But soon that came to an end, and never turned into anything long term.  He was able to gain a internship at a game company, yes! finally he was in the door to a company that created what he enjoyed, GAMES!  Maybe the internship didn't pay but they would see his work and maybe just maybe they would hire him full time...well no such luck, once again income was based on my $11 an hour job.

Living with his parents turned from months into years, we're now past 3 years of living with them. Also were coming up to 8 years of marriage and no children, no home of our own, a husband with no career, and our stress level is to the max.  Has it been hard on us, yes! Has our marriage weakened from it, yes!

Have I asked for advice from family and friends?  Of course!  I get the same answer over and over... ""well he has to want a career, he has to try, he needs to network, he needs to apply"" and I say to them all that after 3 years of being in his shoes the motivation to do something, anything, has been drained out of him.  Now I would honestly have to say he needs some social upgrading, he's shy and finds happiness sitting in front of a computer screen for hours playing PC games, but that doesn't mean that somewhere in those eyes there is no longer the motivation to keep going to keep trying to better our lives.  It just needs a good swift kick in the right direction. 

So I ask you, fellow reddit members from the Twin Cites, or afar, do you know of any contacts, or networks that could help us find a job for him.  Now I know most of you will say ""well why doesn't he come on here and ask for help, why is the wife doing all the work"" it's because I care deeply for him and I want to see him succeed, I want to see him creating art again, being creative, not sitting upstairs for hours playing a PC game that will never get us out of this hole we're in.  

Our luck has got to change, I'm just asking for help in making this luck show up a little faster. :-)

I'm all eyes (in this case) and ready to read your replies. Please I'm trying to boost his self esteem, so please keep the replies positive to a degree, intelligent criticism will be allowed.

2mg0p2,1,2014-11-16,I'm so lost right now,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2mg0p2/im_so_lost_right_now/,"I think In just need to talk to someone...

My life is in tatters right now; I've bitten off more than I can chew in college, I can't get over the girl I dated 4 months ago her and I can't seem to so much as land an interview for my junior internship. I woke up at 3:30 today- I spend an inordinate amount of time procrastinating, I sleep late and I'm running out of motivation. I don't have any drive, every second of my existence is forced. I'm not enthusiastic about anything anymore, I don't want to attend class, I don't want to learn anything new and stuff is just a means to an end. Everything I do is an attempt to get somewhere that isn't here, I've never felt satisfied in the moment.

I don't know what to call it. Was it naivety? Did the enthusiasm from my younger years stem from being oblivious to the fact that the world is a shitty place. Or is motivation like a fuel that starts to run out after x number of failures. I went from failure to failure with relative enthusiasm. I used to enjoy swimming. Nobody really encouraged me, I just liked it so I did it. I spent 10 rigorous hours in the pool every week and I loved every second of it. I wasn't in it to win, but that changed. People's expectations fucked me up. I was enthusiastic about my school work, I loved learning and I used to spend hours of my free time just reading stuff. It all started to go downhill after the depression set in.

But it wasn't just the depression it was circumstance. I fell for two girls, and god it hurt when it didn't work out. The second time it really hit me hard. Her parents made her to get married to someone at 19, while she was still dating me. The reason it really struck me much was that I realized that there really isn't anything worth standing up for in life. I thought we had something, I thought human connections held more meaning, that notions like 'love' are real, but life just seems so superficial. I've never had any real meaningful connections with anyone in life, I've never even kissed a girl. I don't know what she felt when her parents told her she has to get married to this guy, but she eventually agreed. She had known him for 4 days, he's shorter than her, he can't speak English properly and is 9 years older than her. Oh and who the fuck gets married at 19? Just my luck.

I always have something to prove to myself and others. I've always been really passionate about economics and everyone I spoke to said it was a challenging and interesting major. But then in college I discovered that Engineering was harder, so fuck it. Despite the fact that I enjoy stuff like political science I decided to minor in Industrial Engineering and also Computer Science. Don't get me wrong, I like math, but I made this transition at a time where I wasn't exactly right in the head. I needed to be focused and I've just being coming undone as time passed.

There were so many failures. I never really lived up to my parents expectations and they continuously compared me to other kids. I was never as smart as some kid or as fast as some other guy at swimming. I never received any from of validation at any point in my life. It doesn't matter that I did well because there was always someone doing better. I don't know what could possible be wrong with my qualifications that precludes even the possibility of an interview. My grades aren't bad by any standards (3.45 GPA), I have high standardized test scores, I attend a college ranked in the top 10 America and the World, I interned at places relevant to my career every summer and I try my best at networking. It's true Investment banking is difficult to break into but I can't seem to catch a break. Besides IBanking, trading and consulting I can't think of a job that I can get with a degree in economics and a minor in Industrial Engineering. I'm not a US citizen so most corporate positions aren't open to me. 

So all I have to show for a lifetime of pushing myself and going out of my comfort zone is depression and a general hatred towards my self and others. I've turned into a disillusioned, bitter, self-hating individual at 20. I don't know how to adapt to this world. If I let my self become hopeful again I risk getting hurt. But if I don't allow hope into my system I'll just become more and more damaged inside. I don't know what to to. I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but my home life was fucked up to. My mum used to cut herself, sometimes in front of me. My dad was regularly abusive and the only reason they're still together is because of cultural pressures.  My brother has tried to kill me with a knife and I got bullied a lot in school. I come from an overall dysfunctional background.

I want to commit suicide, but I can't. I can barely get out bed every morning. Each day gets harder and harder. I don't know what to do. I'm so confused."

A lot of my peers seems to get their first internships doing either web developing or app developing. However, I am afraid that if I start off my career with either app or web development, my future career will limited to either web or app developing, while I might want to explore more on the managing data with tools like Hadoop or Spark. 

So would making apps or websites put my career toward those fields, and if so, should I resist putting them on my resume and start developing stuff with MapReduce paradigm? "

Some background: 
I am a freshman at a well known private college in my area. I graduated high school early at 17 and moved across the country to get started with my life. I am a finance major and I not only dream big, but I act it as well. I would like to see myself with a good job, and good connections within the next year. I feel like if I am not successful in my life than to me it is a waste. I only want to be financially free and happy, and I see money as the gateway to that. My entire life I have seen my family members dream without acting, I have been held back by my age and family limitations. My family has ""failed"" all around me and I want to break free from their cycle. I am the first person in my family to go to college right out of high school and I want to be different. Now that I am on my own and free I want to achieve what I've always wanted. 

Now:
Recently I have become more and more fed up with how things are going in my life. I live in a dormitory and I am not like everyone around me who just wants to party and smoke all day. I want to go and grind. Which I have been. In my city there are multiple car dealerships owned by the same family, I have for some reason been extremely interested in them and wanted to work in these dealerships in some way (hopefully finance related). Recently I went into a high end clothing store just to look originally and I started talking to the person working at the time for a while. She could tell I was interested in the store and brand (I really am!) and we ended up talking about how it is like to work there and she told me that the owners of the car dealerships that I am interested in own the store. She suggested I email her supervisor about openings, so I did. I mentioned my interest in an internship or position and my interest in the store in general. She emailed back a few days later and said that the owner of the store(and local luxury car dealership) was on a vacation and that she would ask him about internships when he returned(early next week). She also said she would like to meet me in person and that there are no positions now, but that the future is always open. This got me extremely motivated and thinking about the future. This is where I have been recently thinking about how I do not want to do the typical college life recently. I want to have a kickstarted career and also finish my degree at the same time. 
Another connection I had recently was when I was taking lyft recently to an event I was talking with the driver and she was extremely nice. On the way back my girlfriend and I ended up requesting her again and we were talking about careers and I said I was looking for internships pretty hard, especially at car dealerships. She said that she worked with the owner of a very successful parent company who happens to own a bunch of car dealerships in this area as well and she said she would mention what we talked about to her the next time she saw her and I gave her my name and email to pass on as she requested. 

Part of me feels like I have some opportunities of a lifetime that I cannot pass up, and another part of me feels like I am overreacting everything because I am pretty fed up with how things are going in my life right now. I have always been high energy and about getting things done. 

I didn't just come here to rant/brag/or tell a story. I came here because I want to know if any other college students feel the same way as I do, if anyone has had any opportunities like this and what they did with them, and if you guys even think this is really anything. I really need other peoples input even though there isn't one direct question. I feel this is personal finance related because a big part of being successful and having a career is loving what you do and making connections. I feel like I have these connections that could open doors to doing something that I love. So mods, please let this stay or point me in another direction. If you made it this far thank you for sticking with my as I frantically wrote this out on the spot. 

TL:DR; What do I do with my possible networking connections?
Do/did you feel held back in college?
Were any of you fairly successful before you got into your 20's?"
2mgem9,39,2014-11-16,Getting the Quarter System to Suck Your Dick: A Guide,Anteater_Girl,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/2mgem9/getting_the_quarter_system_to_suck_your_dick_a/,"**TL;DR** This post is long as shit so here's some main points for students who probably don't read for class either. Break social norms, read the textbook, social scene is poppin' but you need balance.

 
On with it.

It's 12:30am, I just studied all day for midterms, and I feel like rambling some things I wish people had told me before I transferred here. Before I start, I would like to invite Downvote Fairy to fuck off; this is for the children.

I first want to bring up my social experience here, because that has heavily dictated my ability to be a successful student. After I reminisce about my drunken nights of fucking random dudes from the track team (I’m kidding. Am I? I don't know.), I'll get to the main point: getting the fast-paced quarter system to lovingly and gently fellate you.

I was initially excited to have been accepted into UCI's School of Criminology, and then was quickly discouraged after conversations I had about my future educational endeavors. 

When I told someone ""HAY OMG IM GOING TO UCI TOTES SMART LOLZ"", the bastard would respond not with “Congratulations,” but with ""Ha. Have fun with all the Asians."" Okay, what in the actual fuck. Why does the heavy Asian influence---Okay, heavy isn't even the right word. The whole fucking school is Asian, but anyways...---- Why do the demographics of UCI have to dictate my college experience? That response from people never made sense to me, and the negative stigmata was kind of a buzzkill. I come from an affluent town north of Sacramento; everyone is rich, white, and rude, so I shouldn’t have been surprised that they would turn their noses up to my school of choice. It's not you, Asians, I swear. 
 
I was accepted early in May to UCI, graduated from my community college that same month, and then had a six month long summer packed of partying, sex, and anxiety. I drowned my nerves in so much alcohol that I cried tears of Vodka. I was scared shitless about moving to an unfamiliar area, especially to a far away town with a reputation of being dull. I wanted to know what I was walking into, so I started to investigate what the future would hold.

I started my research here on reddit; what I gathered was that UCI supposedly has *no*, and I mean *no*, social scene. I am a social butterfly, I need close interpersonal relationships with people to breath. I party. I meet people. Having a close connection to people is ancillary to my success in any environment. I was scared that I wouldn't have a single contact here in Irvine.  

I searched r/UCI for more information and found that this community was proving to be as cold and unwelcoming as the dickheads in my hometown said Irvine would be. If you click [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/2d1fl5/uci_meet_and_greet_right_here_right_now/), you can see one of my first attempts to make a contact here, and it was met with surprising success. I decided to put myself out there, and low and behold I actually made a friend from that thread. There began my social life. My determination to disprove that Irvine is boring as fuck, was steadfast and unwavering. 

That one contact made here on reddit birthed an intricate social network including people from various walks of life. In a month I was invited to three fraternity venue parties, partied at the sorority houses, went to five different night clubs, partied in three different towns adjacent to Irvine, and met a group of people that I was quickly able to call family. Simply put, I chose to be open to what Irvine has to offer, and was able to find my life-source: friendships. 

For those of you who have asked “What’s the social scene like at UCI?” the answer is simple. It is what you make of it, it exists. Put yourself out there, don’t be afraid to break a social norms. (Saturday night of week 1, I was feeling particularly lonely, so I stuffed my purse full of beer and wandered around Camino Del Sol. I followed a trail of noise that led me to a party, and let myself in. I actually don’t recommend *this* tactic, because let’s be honest…that’s weird as fuck…but nobody is going to turn away a decently attractive college girl who is passing out beers indiscriminately. That’s how I met my best friend here in Irvine…by crashing a party and passing out alcohol.) 

That brings me to the main point: College isn’t all about having fun. A lot of parts are supposed to suck and be difficult. Having people to connect with can make it a hell of a lot easier, but there must be a balance. And to be perfectly honest, I was so focused on making my social life happen that I soon realized I wasn’t giving enough attention to school. A few academic fuckups, misaligned priorities, and social faux pas have taught me the following things.

1.	Read the fucking text book. This isn’t community college, and it’s definitely not high school. You need to spend hours outside of class studying. Is it boring? Too bad. Fucking read it. Every bit of knowledge you gain is powerful. How beautiful is it that we are creatures of independent will, and can think abstractly beyond instinctual action? Nurture your brain. Read that boring fucking textbook, it’s full of seriously cool shit. 

2.	TURN OFF YOUR FUCKING PHONE IN THE LECTURE HALLS. I did the math. If you go to one class twice a week for 10 weeks, you are paying $67 to attend that lecture. Don’t be a dickhead. Turn off your phone and listen to what the professor is saying. They might be shitty, the topic might be boring, but lecture are the same as textbooks. It’s an opportunity to learn something incredible.

3.	You don’t have to party every weekend. I really had a hard time wrapping my brain around staying in on a Friday night. My first thought every weekend was “It’s Friday. I’m home. I’m a fucking loser. Better wander around and find a party.” Welp, because I did that, I got a D- on my first university-level paper, and a 78% on my first midterm. 

4.	D’s (might) get Degrees, but they sure as fuck don’t open doors. Future scholarships, internships, fuck even some jobs, may all be dependent on your work ethic here at UCI. Make that transcript look more inviting than Kate Upton’s tits. 

5.	Getting dressed up for school is fucking pointless. This is just my opinion. But seriously, no way in fuck am I spending more than 20 minutes on myself to impress any of you. Sleep. For the love of god, just sleep in instead of spending 45 minutes on your hair. It’s fucking college. I wear what I slept in the night before to school all the time. So what if I look like ass. Sorry bout it.

6.	When you’re trying to study, leave your phone in another country. I go to Peete’s Coffee to study and I leave my phone in my car. That way I’m not tempted to text whichever dude I’m boning that week, and I actually retain the information from my textbook. The phone can wait. You're not that important, nobody needs to reach you 24/7. 

7.	Read the syllabus. Just read it. 

8.	If you’re struggling with a class, ask for help. This isn’t high school; a professor will not hunt you down to tell you “Hey, you’re sucking ass lately and this is how to fix it.” Be a proactive student. Is your shit lame? Then go to office hours and get some additional assistance. If you follow tip #7, you'll know when the best time to contact a TA/Professor to get the help you need.

9.	Make friends with your professors whenever possible. Kiss that ass. Make your presence known in that lecture hall of 360+ students. Rarely do professors actually grade your assignments, usually it’s the TA’s. So kiss their asses too! They’ll be more inviting and helpful if they know who you are.

10.	Feeling lonely, sad, depressed, stressed, etc? Decide to fix it. Accept that you feel like X, and actively change it to Y. Mental health is a slippery slope for students undergoing transition and academic/financial distress. If you’re feeling shitty, open up and talk to someone. Take care of yourself in every aspect. When you feel good, you do good, the world does good for you too. 

11. If you've just moved here, make your residence feel like *home*. I completely moved all of my furniture around and decorated my apartment. It's my space, I feel comfortable here, and having a place that feels like home helped me assimilate more easily. 

12. If you're fresh out of high school and this is your first time living on your own, be courteous to your roommates. Nobody wants to clean up your mess or deal with your shit laying everywhere. Think of other people besides yourself.

13. Know your limits with alcohol. Don't pregame too hard before a venue party. (Venue parties are usually hosted by Frats/Sororities at a *venue* like a nightclub or a bar. You pregame at the frat house, get piss drunk, then hop on a bus and ride to the destination). I've watched so many first/second years puking their fucking guts out before the party has even started. Bro, slow your roll. You don't need to get that hammered to have a blast.

14. Try to get as far ahead on readings as possible. Read chapters BEFORE class. This is common sense, but seriously. It's everything.

15. Fucking. Smile. Have inviting energy, be friendly, help people. For whatever reason, this is essential to getting through a full day of school. No resting bitch face. Be nice and the world will be nice to you. 

This concludes my midnight ramblings. I hope this helps at least one student.

**EDIT** I've received a few PM's, (mostly cool, one creepy as shit), so I would like to extend to anyone interested my hand in friendship. My name is Kaylan Jackson, you can find me on Facebook. Maybe I'll see you on campus.

And if you're anti-social media, then I guess you're fucked aren't chya.

Maybe those two things aren't related, but I still feel like I've won."

I'm not suicidal or anything. Just extremely stuck in life and can't seem to find the energy or drive to get myself out of this mess. Last year, I graduated with a degree in Business. I had struggled immensely with social anxiety, bouts of depression and general lingering low self-confidence throughout my time in uni, which ultimately led to me wasting a lot of amazing opportunities to join clubs, network, study abroad, intern and such. Wasted a really important part of my life. Hell, I totally avoided submitting applications to ANYTHING because I felt I just wasn't good enough and felt I wasn't smart enough. I couldn't even sit down and finish a resume. Hell, I still don't have a resume template or anything.

I thought graduating would at least give me a little confidence boost, enough to propel myself to start looking for a job. Decided I deserved a little break after college (dumb) and settled into my part time job, enjoying my free time, and all the congratulations my co-workers were sending my way.

A year later, I'm still here. At the same job. With a great cloud of shame hanging over my head. I get stressed every time I go to work now, for fear that everyone around me is thinking ""What's she still doing here? She graduated, why hasn't she found a better job yet?""

I don't even like my major. I was pushed into accounting then switched to something else in business. If I had pursued any of my other passions (art, animation, foreign language/culture, psychology) I think I would have been braver in college and be able to talk to like-minded people who share my interests. It's no one's fault but my own.

Each passing day, I feel bad for everything I do. I should be doing something, anything to move forward, anything to raise my confidence. I haven't sent a single resume to anyone because I don't know what the hell to do with my life now, and I'm always doubting that I can even DO anything. I've done so many career/personality tests now. I was trying to find a book, a test, a website, anything that would trigger a moment of clarity where I can say ""This is what I'm going/want to do, and this is how I'll do it.""

Nothing has clicked yet. I'm still in the same spot. Always too afraid of everything and giving excuses. Now I'm completely lost, and feeling like a total failure. I feel like nothing has gotten better for me, and as each day goes by, I'm reminded of how much I haven't done.

I just... don't know what to do anymore.

**TL;DR:** **I have low confidence, social anxiety and am depressed. Because of these reasons, I haven't even been able to send out resumes much less THINK about writing one. Everyday I remember how much time I wasted, and it makes me feel worse and worse and the cycle just goes on. I don't even know what to pursue now.**

**Please help me. Any advice on building self-confidence, finding a career, networking when shy, keeping positive, etc. would be so appreciated.**

To anyone in a similar situation...my best of luck to you, and I hope you find your way."

I have been taking French for two quarters now, and I keep getting Bs and Cs in my French classes. I had never received a C in my life until this happened, and it's really fucked my overall GPA. I am getting a 75% in the class, even though I study, I go to conversation club, I watch movies in French, and I am constantly in office hours. 

I was going to go to Washington DC in the winter to do an internship. But noooo, my diabetes had to get in the way, and now I have to stay here so that they can figure out what to do about my insulin allergy. I have nerve damage because these fuckers can't figure out why this is happening to me. I can't do anything about it, and it's killing me to sit here and watch my body fall apart. 

Now, my iphone is being a piece of shit and so is my computer. Both of them were gifts from my family. My phone won't charge half the time, my computer is slowing down, and both are overheating quite a bit. I'm trying to baby them along, but the fact of the matter is I can't afford $1000 for a new computer and $300 for a new phone. I don't have a free phone upgrade until december of NEXT YEAR. So, I either have to make this work for an entire year or I have to shell out a ton of cash that I just don't have. 

I am a college student living off of loans. I am trying to get through college as fast as I can, taking 18-21 units at a time. I don't have the schedule to work anywhere, because my classes are all over the place. I am a double major, and my schedule is really weird. I am trying to do work online, but I can't do it enough to support me. 

I live in a college town where I pay upwards of $500 a month to live in a shitty one bedroom apartment with two other girls. One girl is coming back from studying abroad, so I have to find a new place to live. So far, everything is $1,000 a month or more and that's just for a studio.

I don't have a permit/license, and I sure as hell can't afford a car. I have to have a car to take the DMV test, so that's killing me. I'm almost 21 years old, and I am so in debt and depressed it's not even funny. 

I am bipolar, and I rapid cycle. So, when I get manic I spend money recklessly (money I don't have) which isn't helping my situation. I don't know how to budget. I don't know how to do taxes. I am scared out of my mind.

The idea of getting older gives my panic attacks, and I don't know what to do. I just don't know what to do.  "
2mgqg4,1,2014-11-16,What to look for when looking for a job??,[deleted],AskPhotography,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhotography/comments/2mgqg4/what_to_look_for_when_looking_for_a_job/,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but there's a lack of photographers I know IRL to ask, so here I go. (If there's a better place to ask, please direct me, thanks!) 


So basically, I (tried) going to college for photography. My plan was after high school to take a year off, work, and save up money for school. My mom flipped out, insisting that I HAD to go to college RIGHT THEN AND THERE or else I'll never go back to school. I really wanted to go to school. I LOVE school. The problem was my lack of real world experience (homeschooled for high school, no job experience, etc) and wanting to save up a bit first, which I thought was reasonable. I also had no idea what I wanted to do, but with her nagging, I decided art was the right way to go. Art had always been a big part of my life, so why not do something I enjoy for the last few years before I have to become an adult? RIGHT? Even though my sisters went to community college and she was fine with it, I was forced to pick a private school. I chose the Art Institute (hold your laughs, I know it was a huge mistake and I 100% regret this school). She assured me that at the time we had the money to pay for this, but every step of the way we were taking money out of my savings my grandmother left on a CD for me to pay for it and I couldn't even afford to go to the ground school and had to take online classes. YAY MORE HOMESCHOOLING. Skipping a lot of details here, I never finished the school because of bullying/discouraging teachers, cost, stress, etc and am super in debt with no degree to show for it. I moved out of state from my family and am working a 3rd shift retail job. The job itself is fine, I don't mind it. It's hard work and I like keeping busy so it's a good fit. The people and the pay on the other hand...Rent is more than an entire paycheck, then I have two different student loans, car insurance, cell phone (which I'll be downgrading to help make more affordable, but with no house phone and a need to call loan companies constantly, I kinda need it) and then I like eating so that's more money that I don't have. I can't even imagine upgrading my photography gear like I'd like to, and since moving I've taken a few pictures of my boyfriend's cat and that's it. I moved away from my models and amazing locations and don't know where to start fresh. 


The issue is that I have too many bills, make not enough money, and am miserable. The logical thing to do is to try and continue and expand my art in hopes to at least get some extra money from it. I know I'm not the greatest photographer, but I think I can at least do *SOMETHING* worthwhile with my camera. 


My initial plan, which I don't know if it's a good plan or not, is to contact local news/newspaper companies and ask if they need anyone. I'm willing to do photojournalism if they would take me. I live right outside a big city, so I think as far as news articles go, I could get at least some generic shots for an article. Growing up pretty much in the woods, I never had the chance to to street photography before, and though I'm confident I could learn, I don't have any under my belt. I mostly did fantasy portraits and nature, which I don't know outside of natura magazines would really be helpful. How do I go about offering myself to a news company (or is there a better 'place' to go for this)? Even if I can do something unpaid, I'll let my sleep and bills suffer to get experience at this point. 


I also have an idea I'd like to pitch to someone, but I don't know if they would take it seriously because of my lack of (job)experience and also being so new here. It would involve writing, photography, and studying of the local history which are all things I'm confident I could do if I could get someone willing to pay me for it on board. 


So TL;DR - I'm trying to figure out how I could get a job (or 'internship') for my photography but since I haven't had a photography job before, I have very little experience, especially in the style photography I think I woul dhave the best chance at getting a job for. How do I go about asking companies if they're open for hire and how do I build up a resume when I have nothing but dropping out of school to put on it? How do I build up a portfolio when all I have are things of a completely different genre than the job I'm seeking out? "

2mgzdn,4,2014-11-16,Smart Cards,creamersrealm,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/2mgzdn/smart_cards/,"Im curious as to what everyone's opinion are towards smart cards no days.

My company is considering some sort of two factor authentication for our Domain Admins which may go out to all of IT if the VP likes the idea. So far I have a working setup with enrollment certificates and logon certificates, the biggest problem I have discovered is how much physical security is needed for a Smart Card. For example if we had a rouge intern that went and took a admin's smart card he could go reset the pin and in less then 3 minutes have full domain access. I have some demo cards that are prox cards as well so we have a lesser chance of leaving them behind but the risk seems very high.

My question is how can I better protect the cards by not allowing pin resets if this is possible? One option was using biometrics such as a fingerprint instead of the pin code.

Has anyone implemented a two factor solution with 1 time codes such as using a smart phone or a RSA id? I thought if we could have a two factor solution such as RSA it would be more secure and still requires something you know plus something you have. If you left the something you have behind it would be 100% useless unlike the smart cards which would still be a risk."

So I'm only in town for a couple of months on an internship and I knew it was stupid to go looking for a relationship but hey, I didn't know anyone here and I was lonely. So met this guy on a dating website and I immediately really liked him, he's into the same kind of music, movies, TV shows, etc., he's funny, he loves food, and he's super talkative where I'm not. Now, we've been seeing each other for about two months and I know its stupid to expect anything to come out of it  (my internship is over in about a month and he's very against long-distance dating) but that doesn't change the fact that I really like him and am gonna be really sad when its over.

Here comes the real issue... I've had a feeling he doesn't feel for me the same way I do and I suspected he might be sleeping with other girls. Well, just last night I found out he is. Please don't ask me how I found out, I just know there's at least one other girl and they've met up recently. He even texted her while he was with me (c'mon dude!).

Am I stupid to be upset? I didn't say anything because he probably assumes we're on the same page, that we're just ""having fun"" while I'm in town. I really really like this guy and I'd be really sad to stop seeing him now, but I'm realizing that I don't think he has any feelings for me.

Should I break it off and stop seeing him? Should I ignore it and try to get on his same page? Please let me know what you think.

To your guy's knowledge, how true is it that you can get a job without a degree? This leads me to my next question: what kind of programming do you guys even do? I am fluent in all of the web languages, Java, and Python. Python is definitely my favorite. I have a very good grasp on everything, and  making classes interact with each other.

2mhis8,1,2014-11-16,Tough decision..,sirhc1357,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2mhis8/tough_decision/,"Hi everyone,

I ended up getting an offer for both EY (Orlando) and PwC (Atlanta). Until a few days ago I was leaning towards PwC, but the EY recruiter ended up finding out I was interested in Atlanta and extended me an offer for the Atlanta office as well.. Originally he was going to try to get me into FSO audit, but the spring only had non-FSO slots open. 

I know EY pretty much owns the Atlanta market, but I'm a little bummed I can't get into FSO. I really enjoyed the PwC office visit and I haven't gotten a chance to visit the EY office. Also, the PwC hourly is $2 less than the EY offer. Yeah, so there's just a lot of factors in play. So I have a few questions:

1. If I do my internship with EY working on non-FSO clients is there any chance once I start full time I could switch to FSO?

2. Has anyone worked for EY in Atlanta? Can you shed some light on some of the non-FSO clients? I know the big names like Coke, TBS, and Delta.


Thanks everyone!"

Long story short: one and half month ago we moved in the new office (I'm working in IT), more eventful than before. And there's an intern, 10 years younger than me, the one for which I would say «she's too young». Despite this, her eyes and her smile fool me every day when I see her, often in the morning before work or during breaks, while for the rest of the time she's ""away"" from me.

She used to be a lot quiet before, a bit solitary maybe, when she joined us. Can't say the reason, once we moved she's really different: talks a lot and spends time with us. Often we can have a little time alone talking, before work. Anyway she's really nice to me, couldn't say if she feels something or not. Maybe all this time alone is just getting me in the wrong way.

TL;DR I still think of her too young for me, but my heart says ""go on and try anyway"". What should I do?"

2mhzyt,2,2014-11-16,Clean(ish) slate: where to go from here?,preposthumous,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2mhzyt/cleanish_slate_where_to_go_from_here/,"I'm 22 with a BA in Philosophy. No debt, no savings, no expenses, no job. I drive a cheap, reliable car. Currently living with my parents, who are doing me a favor and charging me absolutely nothing for rent or food. They are fine with me continuing to live with them in the same arrangement for at least another full year. I live in a rural area, about a 25 minute commute to the nearest town.

I know I have an interest in software engineering and, while I might not ever be a savant and it's not a passion of mine, I'm capable of doing and enjoying the work. This, along with the solid pay of software jobs, is why I'm planning on heading in this direction.

- An MS program in CS would require me to take bridge courses, but is doable and I would be able to sell it as a ""step forward"" to employers. I would have to complete it online or move to another city and lose my living arrangement. I could finish in roughly 3 years. Cost $40k + living expenses.

- Oregon State University offers an online post-bacc BS in Computer Science. This would mean I could continue to live at home, focusing entirely on finishing school as efficiently as possible. It's possible to complete it in a year without working, or longer if it's spread out and I get internships or work part-time. Cost $27k + no expenses.

- The third option is using my free time to ramp up my personal education to get to an employable position ASAP

My parents are great people, but they will not co-sign on a loan, which I don't blame them at all for. So any amount borrowed for school would be on me. I can likely find a job in town, but it won't pay much above minimum wage. The commute is also rough as far as money, time, and weather this time of year. Still, not impossible, just not sure it's the best plan.

**TLDR; Is it worth taking out a loan for a second Bachelor's?**


Does PF have any advice? Thanks!

How did you handle it?,trisk85,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/2midmb/are_there_others_like_me_how_did_you_handle_it/,"So, I'm a cognitive psychology student, who's on the brink of getting his Masters done. Throughout my studies, I've become more and more fascinated by programming. I always was to some extent, but now it's different. It started with programming little bits and bobs inspired by literature on neural networks and such. Then I got involved in a quite complex thesis project where I once again programmed a certain algorithm. Now I'm doing my internship and lo and behold, I'm writing programs to help me get my experiment done. 

I'm starting to feel more interested by programming, than I am about cognitive psychology in general. At first it felt kind of dumb, but now I'm seriously debating with myself whether I should persue courses in information technology and change career paths. I just can't not program, and it's driving me nuts.

Has anyone here been in the same situation? How did you deal with it? Did you change careers or where you able to find a nice midway, combining your current path and programming?

The problem I'm facing is that I really enjoy web design/development, but I absolutely hate my computer science classes.

I really want to drop out or take a gap year and see if I can find work in web design/dev. but I'm scared of the consequences, as in, what if I don't find a job etc..

Over the summer I had a great internship at a small company (40 employees) working on their website and I got paid well ($22/hour) and that is my fantasy, I just want to do web stuff...

Would it be a realistic idea to drop out/take a gap year and find a full time job doing web design/dev and maybe do some freelance on the side? What would the future (5 - 10 years from now) look like in comparison had I finished my degree..."
2minqe,2,2014-11-16,Junior in CS getting a late start: Couple of questions,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2minqe/junior_in_cs_getting_a_late_start_couple_of/,"OK so to make a long story short, I bounced around from major to major my freshman and sophomore years until I finally settled on CS, and I absolutely love it. So I am kind of behind other juniors in my school in CS courses just because I didn't start taking them my sophomore year. 

Would it be crazy to apply to internships for this summer? For context here are the classes that I have finished that are required for my major so far:

* Two intro courses to programming on Java
* A discrete mathematics course
* Calc I and II
* A data structures course that uses C++
* A course that gives a brief overview of several different languages. (Officially called ""Software Engineering and Programming Languages"")

And by the end of the spring semester I will have finished
* Computational Models
* Software Engineering
* Calc III

Basically pretty much every internship I am interested in says knowledge of languages that I have not been exposed to yet would be good. Do you think I would have enough time to learn these languages well enough for the internship by the time applications are due. (Most are due by the end of Feb)

Also any tips for someone in my position? Thanks!"
2mir48,0,2014-11-16,Likelihood of a second year engineering student getting an internship?,[deleted],india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2mir48/likelihood_of_a_second_year_engineering_student/,"Hey all,

So I am currently a first year electronics/ computer engineering (bachelors) student at a reasonably reputable university in Canada.

As a part of my graduation requirements, I must complete a couple of co-op terms (**paid** internships). The first of these terms is next year. **I must work approximately 400 hours over the span of 4 months.**

My program does not enable me to have free summers, so I cannot visit my family in India. I have been thinking of getting an internship at MS in Hyderabad or somewhere in Bangalore (NVidia, whatever), so that I can both fulfill my requirements and also visit my family. I have relatives in both companies, if that helps.

However, I am wondering if it is plausible. I have heard of third or fourth years getting internships in India, but never second years. In Canada, it is common.

Any insight is appreciated. Missing home like crazy :( ...

Thanks"

2mixwz,0,2014-11-16,"Questions about West Point, from a Sophomore in HS",[deleted],army,https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/2mixwz/questions_about_west_point_from_a_sophomore_in_hs/,"So, here's the deal. I've been pretty interested in attending West Point, because I decided that I want my future to be within the US Army. More precisely, I'm pretty sure that I want to be a part of the Special Forces. I know that may be kind of an outrageous goal, but I think that it's good for me to have a clear cut goal for my life.

So, that's where my questions come in. First off, I'm not even sure if my standards pair up with the requirements. My current GPA is 3.82, and I'm in all honors and AP classes. 

 As for extracurricular activities, I've been volunteering within my school's IT department for 2 years, and I've been recently promoted to a paid internship. I volunteered at our local library for about a year as well. 

When it comes to sports, I'm one of the most active members at my martial arts academy, coming there every day for around 2 hours for practice. I've been a part of their community for just about 3 years, practicing both Taekwondo and Hapkido. My instructor served in the Korean army for a large part of his life, teaching martial arts to the Korean Special Forces.

And here comes the questions, I suppose.

Am I active enough in my community to stack up to what West Point expects? I'm thinking about going out for our school's tennis team this year but I'm not sure if I'll be able to keep up with two sports as well as my schoolwork. 

Should I begin making contact with my local senators? I understand that I'll need a recommendation.

And my last question, is there any possible transition from graduation to being a member of the Special Forces? I read that after you graduate you are commissioned as a second lieutenant and required to serve 5 years. Would it even be possible to be a part of the Special Forces?

Thank you all for taking the time to read this wall of text. I appreciate any answers. Thank you again."
2mj0v2,1,2014-11-16,Co-worker (30m) is a bully who talks shit about me (31f) and other co-workers behind our backs. How can I stop his manipulation?,jennytulls,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2mj0v2/coworker_30m_is_a_bully_who_talks_shit_about_me/,"I (31f)work in a small office. We do social work and I'm one of four case workers. I've been there a year. It's the first social work job I've had and I'm doing pretty good.

A fellow case worker, we'll call him Brian (30m), has worked there for 3 years, talks about everyone in the office behind their backs all the time. He's the type that thrives on drama. Another case worker (Sam 30m), who is new (6 months) let me know he tells our interns and anyone else that will listen that I shouldn't be working here, I'm lost, and in general a horrible case manager.

I'm not perfect but this isn't the case. I have an open dialog with my boss and I know I'm doing just fine. Now Brian talks bad about everyone, not just me. My first day he told me how horrible another case worker was and how he hated the company. My boss knows this. 

There's not much I can do. If I bring this info up to my boss its he said she said and even more middle school drama. I don't want to give him anymore attention. Brian and I have had words about things he has tried to pull. I don't talk to him unless I have to and never go to him for help anymore, he just complains and manipulates the situation. 

Ever since I've heard he tells others how dumb I am, I can't help that it hurts my feelings. I've decided all I can do is be an even better case manager and if the folks he tries to poison against me believe him, well there is nothing I can do.

The thing is, I'm not very good at intra personal relationships like this. I have to see his smug fat face every day. I don't understand how people can be this mean. It's like middle school all over again. He's just a bully.

Anyone have any advice to beat him at his own game (without talking about him behind other people's backs)? I'm sure someone has been in this situation before.

TL;DR Co worker my age talks shit behind everyone's backs at work. How do I deal?"

I'm graduated in May, recently got a full-time offer from Amazon, and was a Microsoft intern last summer.  Here's how I study for coding interviews:

EDIT: Here is a link to my CS review onenote:
https://onedrive.live.com/redir?page=view&amp;resid=698BA9C208A5B31D!32719&amp;authkey=!AP1TevOlacebRns

I. Technical knowledge

A. Data structures - know internal implementation, classes for your chosen language, advantages/disadvantages, and Big O complexity for common operations for each of the following:

-Hash tables

-Binary search trees

-Linked lists

-Arrays

-ArrayLists

-Tries

-Queues

-Stacks

-Heaps

B. Algorithms

-Big O

-Quick sort, merge sort, heap sort

-Tree/graph transversal 

-Greedy algorithms

-Recursion

-Dynamic programming

-Divide and conquer

-String Builder class for your chosen language

-Proof by induction

-P vs. NP

C. Operating Systems

-Stack vs. heap

-Memory management (Garbage collector or manual malloc/free)

-Processes vs. threads

-Caching

-Call stack

-Kernel vs. user space

-Basics of internet stack

Data structures, algorithms, and operating systems were by far the most useful classes you took in school!


II. Coding practice

-You HAVE to code on a whiteboard!  It is very different from coding in an IDE or even in Notepad.  I spend a week and a half doing whiteboard coding questions out of ""Cracking the Coding Interview"".  Don't just memorize the answers.

-Make a good faith effort to solve each problem as you practice.  Also, think about the Big O complexity and where you can optimize.

-Finally, this is a great opportunities to memorize libraries/common data structure classes for your chosen language!  You don't get documentation or Stack Overflow during your interview.


III. Behavioral

-Come up with responses to common behavioral questions in advance: i.e., ""What is your biggest weakness?"" or ""Tell me about a time you had a conflict on a team"" or ""What is the most difficult technical challenge you have faced?""


IV. Experience

-If you put a technology on your resume, you may be asked about it!

-Review all your previous projects/work experience, so you can quickly and knowledgeably answer any questions that may be asked.

-Don't talk negatively about your previous/current job unless specifically asked.

-Cast everything in a positive light.  That project/job/coworker they just asked about might have sucked, but you look like an ass if you say that.


V. General tips

-You want to click with the interviewers.  In the back of their minds, they're asking themselves ""Would I have a beer with this guy/girl?"" or something similar.

-Dress appropriately.  I wore jeans and a button down for my last interview.  It's not good to show up in a suit if the dress code is casual.  Take a shower, comb your hair!

-Ask questions!  This is a two way street, both for the company to see if you're a good fit, and if it's a good fit for you.  Ask technical questions (what IDE/version control/languages/technologies does your team use?) and general company culture questions (what'd your favorite part of working here/how is the life/work balance?).

-Relax.  The interviewers aren't out to get you, and you can't think straight if you're nervous.

-If you get rejected, don't give up!  There will be another chance in the future."

I have a Computer Science and IT Cert. as well, but (stupidly) I didn't want to mess with my certs while going through college; I was much too worried about other things, doing drugs, being stupid, preoccupied with girls, and battling mental problems without realizing it. I'm stable now and taking medicine, I'm on track, focused, and I want to make up for it... if these certs are worth it. I could have my Linux and Network Cert., but I chose not to do them.

The two that I really like are the Comp TIA Linux+ and the Comp TIA Security+. I downloaded the study guides for them. I have six months before I need to find a better job so that I can move out on my own; my roommate is leaving then and I want more stuff to put on my crappy resume other than a short term internship.

TL;DR: What certs are worth it, and is it possible to just study my ass off on them by myself the next six months and take the test on my own?"

Tl;dr: my girlfriend (now my ex-girlfriend) has been putting very little effort into our relationship lately, so I ended it only to find out she had seen her ex-boyfriend and sucked his dick. I'm furious, and now I'm gonna go do my own thing; I'm in first-year University and I'm gonna go live my life the way I want to.

Where to start...
In may 2014, nearing the end of grade 12, I met a girl that's two years younger than myself; lets call her Michelle (this isnt her real name). Michelle and I talk for a few weeks, nothing serious. We flirt, banter, and eventually grow closer; we start talking about each other's past relationships, hookups, and flings. Then the phone calls started; innocent as they were. One night it was very sexual. This was the beginning of June. We ended up hanging out in the beginning of July, and things happened (we got naked, fooled around but no sex; I tried telling myself to be a respectable young man and that I'd stop treating girls like shit, because I have done that many times before. Never cheated, I just never cared; point is, I changed and I'll save that story for another time). 

So we start talking more frequently, and we start seeing each other regularly; few times a week. I started working a full-time office job as an intern in the second week of July, and things were going really well for me and Michelle; her family was cool as hell, we were attracted to one another, and weirdly enough I actually cared about this girl. One afternoon, around 5pm, she invites me to a party; I accept and our plans are set. I notice that she hasn't replied in a few hours (which is unusual for her, being addicted to her cellphone) but I think nothing of it. We go to the party, things are fun, and we have a good time. 

A week later, one of my best friends tells me that she was at a guy's house before that party, and that they had kissed (God only knows what else happened). I confront her in person, she denies it, I press, she cracks, and I flip shit. I drop her off, and when I get home my phone is absolutely blowing up...Michelle texts me about 5 long-ass messages explaining how wrong she was and that she's not going to let me go this easily. We fight, and I eventually decide to forgive her mistake. I confessed that I love her, and that the reason I got so angry is because I care for her. We make-up, and things go better. 

We officially started dating about the 3rd week of July. At some point in early August I explained to her that I'd be off to University in September and that we should hold off on becoming too serious so that neither of us gets hurt. She's cool with it, but I noticed that she stopped trying as hard. I brought it up, we talked it over, and I decided that I would do my absolute best to make it work although I was going to University (which is a 30 minute drive from my hometown, where she also lives). So August was probably the best this relationship ever got...we saw each other multiple times a week, were ""in love"", and were having constant sex (yay). 

End of August approaches, and we both feel the tension. I see her before going off to school, and shes bawling her eyes out saying how she'll miss me and that this just isn't fair. I tell her I'll be back in two weeks, and I go off to school. Frosh week was the time of my life; partied every night, constant drinking, meeting tons of new people. It was fantastic. I go home two weeks later to see Michelle and it feels like nothing's changed; life is perfect. 

This is where I fuck up: I went home EVERY GODDAMN WEEKEND after that, just to see her. I missed her dearly and I couldn't stand not being around her. One small detail; I did EVERYTHING for this girl. I always picked her up, paid for her, supported her, loved her, cared for her, pleased her, and went out of my way countless times to reassure her of my loyalty to her. 

It goes on like this until the weekend of November 7th. We're on her couch Sunday afternoon, and she gets a snapchat from her ex; lets call him Chris. Just to be clear, I have no problem showing her my phone since I have nothing to hide, and if she's having an insecure moment then I want to help anyway I can; I've opened hundreds of messages and snapchats from other women in front of Michelle and it has never caused a problem. So this bugs me; it's her ex. I ask if she can open it so we can see, and she refuses. I explain to her that I'm uncomfortable with it, and she flips; ""you dont trust me, what the hell is wrong with you, you need to trust me I havent done anything"". I get pissed off and I head back to school. I spent the entire week thinking whether or not I should end it with her; after everything I've done for her, this is how she treats me....there isn't a mutual respect. 

I come home on thursday night and I tell myself that this weekend is the real test. So i get together with her thursday night, we go to her friend's party. Things go well. The next day, we spend the entire day together just relaxing; it was great. Saturday I see her for a bit, and she goes to work. Then she invites me out to a party, and I go. I get there and she's happy to see me, we kiss and things go great. I notice she's being very touchy with some other guys, and I confront her and she gets sad that I'm ""no fun""; okay whatever, at this point I'm pissed the fuck off. I went home after that. 

The next day (today), I go see her. She gets in the car and I explain that I need to focus on myself and that our relationship has been causing me a lot of stress, and that I need to focus all my attention on school (I'm an Engineering major and our workload isnt exactly pretty). She gets pissed, slams the door and storms away. Not 20 minutes later she calls me, ""can we talk"". I go back to her house, and she comes outside and she asks why we cant just work something out. I explain to her that I've been killing myself by putting in 200% of the effort and that she barely gives a fuck, and that I dont need this because I have enough to worry about being at school. We both cry knowing that its totally over, she goes inside, and I go home. 

This was about 3pm. She texts me constantly until 8pm saying how she wants to make it work and we need to keep trying. I keep pushing her away saying how I cant do it and that lets try later when I'm not so stressed. I head back to school, and I meet up with my buddy Nick. Nick's younger brother happens to be best friends with Chris, Michelle's ex. Nick shows me a text (which he was previously scared to show me), from his brother that basically says that Michelle had seen Chris and gave him a blowjob. This all happened in the middle of September while I was at school; that's when the text was sent to Nick. I confronted her when I found out, and told her to never contact me again. 

I am fucking furious and I dont know if I'll ever be able to trust another woman as long as I live. For now, I'm gonna spend my years at University improving myself and doing whatever it is that I want to do. I pray that someone will offer their insight. I regret nothing, but Im crushed. "

(Long post, but organized! Sorry in advance.)",[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2mjlwg/made_a_procon_list_for_all_the_b4_firms_im/,"*I received 3 B4 internship offers and am in the ""wine and dine"" mode of recruiting before offers must be signed. I know it's not a decision that will cement the rest of my career, but I want to pick a firm that will put me in the best position in the future. I definitely do NOT want to go through recruiting season again, so an internship to full time offer for a set firm is obviously ideal. I did also read other peoples' posts on similar topics, which helped me compile these pros/cons.*

*Disclaimers: These assumptions are also on the premise that how well I meshed with employees were the same, for the most part. I am also in Los Angeles, so clients, industries, and the like will be based on LA, and surrounding areas. I also am an accounting/finance double major so a bit biased towards financial services, but still very open to different industries. Top industry preferences: Media/Entertainment, Financial Services, Health Care, Real Estate. That being said:*

**Deloitte - Audit**

Pros: Great firm, very professional and timely throughout recruiting. Solid clients, apparently strongest in health care. Threw great events for us, felt like they really invested heavily in recruiting. Very selective in picking final candidates from my university, and surrounding universities, compared to other B4. One of the largest, and continually growing. Name sounds awesome, just sticks to me for some reason. Super fratty, super fun, good vibes every time I've attended an event. Definitely feels like I would enjoy hanging out with the people I work with. Also, Deloitte university. Seriously, holy shit, DU looks amazing. Second hottest girls.

Cons: Known for consulting more than audit. Audit practice smallest of the three firms I'm picking from. Doesn't have the greatest clients, definitely not for financial services (not sure about these last two points, can anyone shed some light?) 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**PwC - Risk Assurance, possible switch to Core post-internship**

Pros: Largest firm and setting itself apart as such. Awesome clients in RA (Disney, Sony, Activision, Riot Games, BoA, etc.) and similarly great ones in Core, just not too familiar with them. Super chill and relaxing vibe all around, sometimes a bit conceited. RA is a growing practice, and love how I can do audit rotations too. Good overall for M&amp;E and FS. Hottest girls by a small margin.

Cons: Extra year to senior seems a bit meh, but not relevant yet for internship... just a side thought. Came off strong during beginning of recruiting and tapered off; became seemingly more indifferent throughout the process. What is this lower pay that I hear about?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**EY - Audit**

Pros: Holy shit, those Fortune 500 companies. Apple, you say? Facebook too? Most start-up and IPOs out of all the B4? Well, shit. Greatest work-life balance? I'll take that. Vision 2020? I'll drink that Kool-Aid. Great for M&amp;E, Real Estate, and FS. I'd love to work for Apple after EY someday...probably not realistically gonna happen, but one can hope. According to /u/vishtratwork, very very close second to PwC, nearly irrelevant margin. I hope I didn't take that comment out of context.

Cons: WORST recruiting experience ever. Highly disorganized, mistakes every stage throughout. I know it doesn't reflect the total image of the firm, but definitely got turned off as I ran into more speed-bumps with these guys. Also a lot of people I met seemed less social. What is this I hear about lowest pay? Makes me sad :(


*In all seriousness, I know that these are all amazing, top-tier firms. I'm not trying to bash on any of them, but these are my genuine opinions that I know some will disagree on. Please chime in on more objective facts and correct me if I'm wrong. I hear so many things about these firms from multiple sources every single day, so I might have mixed shit up.* "

I've taken two programming courses, both in Java, which was one introductory course and another advanced Data Structures and Algorithms one. Along with this I have the general prereqs down of Calc 1-3, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, etc. I plan to finish Computer Architecture, Systems Programming, and Software Methodology courses next semester. 

I think my resume is solid as I have technical work experience(albeit not 100% programming related) and a relatively high GPA/SAT, but I am scared of one thing - my extracurriculars are really lacking. I haven't really used my CS knowledge on anything notable enough to put on my resume yet, and I'm really scared that'll hurt my chances. I am confident that I'm a solid programmer, but I admittedly have been poor when it comes to finding opportunities to apply myself. In addition, I know Rutgers CS isn't the same level as Berkeley/Stanford/CMU/etc, which makes me scared I won't be very competitive when it comes to the positions I want the most.

Ideally I want to work for a more exciting and notable company such as Yahoo, Amazon, Microsoft, AT&amp;T, or something along those lines (relocating isn't a problem). I would really appreciate if somebody could tell me what my chances would be at a company of those calibers, or tell me what a more appropriate plan of action would be to maximize my chances next year.

Any intern stories of similar situations that you went through would also be really helpful! I don't have a big network of CS friends, so I don't really have any paths to follow. 

Thanks a lot guys!"

I cross-compile my code from my laptop to a Beaglebone Black, to which the touchscreen is connected. 

The Beaglebone is running Debian 7.5 and I'm using Qt 4.8.6 to compile my code. 

I've used the following tutorial to get the cross-compiling to work: 

http://embedded.von-kannen.net/2014/05/21/qt-4-8-6-on-beaglebone-black/

During the tutorial at some point you delete linux' desktop manager application (lightdm), because it's incompatible with Qt's QWS window manager. This is fine, however it appears Qt's window manager has mouse acceleration turned on. When I put my finger on the screen the cursor does not appear underneath my finger, but somewhere a bit off and travels at a different speed. 

I can't seem to figure out how to turn off the mouse acceleration, and it seems there isn't a lot of information on the subject.

tl;dr:
Touch screen + Qt's QWS window manager = mouse acceleration.
Want to kill mouse acceleration.

Need help, please.

PS. disabling cursor visibility doesn't help (though that was probably to be expexcted :/)


**edit:**

I'm starting to doubt whether mouse acceleration is actually my real problem at all.
I feel like part of my tslib for the touchscreen hasn't actually installed properly. When I try to run /usr/bin/ts_config or /usr/bin/ts_test I am told they can't find ts_config and ts_open :/

I followed the tutorial though, so what went wrong D: ?

**editedit:**
nope, definitely mouse accel. It goes further the faster I move :/
Since I've killed lightdm, it can only come from QWS I think. There's some library called &lt;QWSCalibratedMouseHandler&gt; but frankly I just have no idea what to do with it and whether it is what I need at all :(. Qt's documentation is always illegible to the untrained T_T

notable:
I found a function that was supposed to tell me if mouse accelaration turned on or not. 

    QScreenCursor* qscursor = new QScreenCursor;
    qscursor-&gt;hide();
    bool aap = qscursor-&gt;isAccelerated();
    qDebug() &lt;&lt; ""acceleration of cursor is "" &lt;&lt; aap;

Assuming I've done it correctly the qDebug value I get is: ""acceleration of cursor is false"""

I posted a shit rant about women here yesterday, and I should NOT have done that. I feel sorry and feel like a dick for doing that, but I was very angry at the time.


I was bullied everyday, for 4 years long. It has done damage to me which I still have not fully recovered from. That was in elemantary school, when I was 7-11 years old, before I graduated for middle school where bullying continued by NEW bullies (one guy from my class being the biggest asshole imaganable). That one guy has done me more grief, pain and frustrations than all of the other bullies that ever got me. I was also bullied by girls. He made fun of me for never having had a girlfriend, for wearing glasses, having a shitty wardrobe at that time and calling me a nerd because I like computers and guitars. I swear that I still feel the frustration coming when I think back about that motherfucking asshole! The bullying didn't stop for me until I left middle school and went to highschool where I attain my current study, Information Technology (IT). I am now doing internship for 20 weeks and than I will graduate.
As for the subject where this post is actually all about, the girls;

Well, what can I say really? I think I am a pretty cool guy to hang out with. I'm pretty proud of myself because I am smart, have a patrtime job and play guitar. In the past I didn't have many friends (I still don't, but I don't need many friends, I need GOOD friends). I fell in love for the first time when I was 6, then again when I moved when I was 8, and again when I was 12. When I was 12 I asked the girl that I liked so much, but she rejected resulting in me crying at night. Poor little NVisser. Well, I hadn't fell in love for 5 years. Sure, I'd seen girls which were very beautiful and that I'd loved to ask out, but I couldn't. The last time was last year, but it turned out she was not my type after all (smoking weed, drinking very heavy boose, fucking a ""friend"" on weekly basis, criminal behavior). I got in a slight depression over her, but I am now out of there and am working on my future and it was totally NOT worth it to even make my hands foul for her! I am now 18 years old (turned 18 in July) and I still camp with self-esteem issues and I usually think negative a lot of the time. I think that might be due to bullying, but I'm not sure. A few months ago I went to a friends' party at his house but I had left after 2 hours. I planned to flirt with some girls right there, and just maybe hooking up with one but I didn't have the guts, and I didn't know what to say. I just sat there, in a dark corner, some girl said to me ""you make me very happy"" in a sarcastic way, and then I went home. I didn't sleep very well that night, either.


As you may have read in my previous posts, I did indeed have a porn/masturbation addiction. I stopped the porn but masturbation is still going. I don't know if it's somehow relevant to my sudden anger/frustation/depression, though. I buy a few new clothes every month, I take care of myself and I try to look the best I could do. Sure, I'm not Brad Pitt or something but no-one's perfect, right? As for hobbies, I'm mostly at home playing guitar, messing around with my computers or just going to hang out with the friends that I have. I hope one day that I can make a girl happy with who I am, and what I can show her (my guitar skills for example) what I can do. For the moment being though, I don't really feel like having a girlfriend. I would LOVE to have one, but I'm pretty sure I need to fix myself first. There's too many flaws I have at this moment which I just cannot let her see. I need to work on my self-esteem too. When I feel better, more secure and have graduated next year (which is before the summer) I will try to hook up with some girls. Heck, I'll even play some shitty boyband songs if they'd like

The position is engineering related and I have worked in the company this summer for an internship. I just graduated with a B.Eng. and am fully capable of doing the job.

In fact, I even know somone in the team that I applied for and contacted her via Linkedin to talk about the position. She gave me a lot of tips and inside information about the position. 

I prepared all weekend, watching videos, writing down my key skills and examples. Preparing for this HR phone interview. I built up so much pressure (as I am unemployed and finally got an interview in my DREAM company). Preparing so much I felt like I was ready but when the call came ...it was a disaster.

I was so nervous my voice was shaking. I couldn't think straight and my voice was not confident. I had trouble in the past with talking to much during an interview and thus I tried to keep my answers short. She asked simple questions like 
what was your role in your internship?
Are you working right now?
When would you be able to be hired?
Tell me about a situation where you got feedback and criticism.
Tell me about a time where you made a change to improve a process.

Those questions seemed simple and answered good.
I messedup when she asked tell me 2 of your best skills that would benifit for this position.

I had all my skills written down with examples of stories and how it would help. Thinking on the spot I picked the best skill but didnt pick the 2nd best skill. 

I also just listed them as I assumed she would ask me to talk more about the skills. I did not give examples and didnt pitch myself. I am so disappointed that all this planning was gone for waste. 

She also asked for my reporting cheifs name (maybe she will get in contact with him).

I know that If I got to the interview stage I am confident I could win them over.

The call lasted 13 min (she didnt want to waste anymore time with me?) 

I am well under experienced (junior with just internship ). 

I feel like giving up...all that preparation gone in the trash. She said she would let me know by the end of the week or next week.

I am so depressed and unmotivated. There is another job i wanted to apply for in the company but they will see my name and since they already interviewed me on the phone they will throw my resume in the trash. fuck."

Apart from that, I've always liked movies, and I am currently doing an internship in a production company. I've found that I don't like this internship as much as I thought and I've found that as much as I like movies maybe the process of making them is not as interesting to me (since I don't see myself as a very creative person). I don't know if I should stick with it for a little more because I've been waiting for this opportunity for SO LONG and the chance to work in production and maybe I will find something that I like or just pursue something that has to do with my major.

**OPTION A:**

* Spring: Intern in Tettnang Germany doing a machine translation project (what I am super interested in) but only make 1000 euro/month (my parents would cover my housing). I would be working approximately full time but have 3 vacation days a month plus weekends and holidays. I would likely not live in tettnang but somewhere close.

* Summer: Intern at a well know software company in San Francisco

* Fall&amp;Spring: Spend my senior year in Austin taking classes like normal.


**OPTION B:**

* Spring: Stay here and take classes

* Summer: Same (Internship in San Fran)

* Fall: Study abroad and take classes in France

* Spring: Spend my last semester in Austin



I feel SO conflicted. I have already had numerous internships and don't need any more experience and the money is crap so neither of those are motivators. I am just nervous that I will be wasting away my semester abroad by working full time instead of going with a group of youngnpeople and taking classes (with less stress). I feel like I have my whole life to work but this is such a great opportunity idk if I can pass it up. But at the same time I will go a whole semester without classes.
I really would love any input at all. I feel like throwing up. I also have a long term boyfriend but he has encouraged me to not consider the relationship in this decision which I agree with."

Let me know and I'll fix it.
---------------------------------------------

Do I have no chance or hope to do something big? Whether it's an internship or a job? Even a pay-less internship at some big company.

I applied to Microsoft, Google, Facebook, DropBox, Box, Quora as well as some others. Representatives from Box and Quora were kind enough to let me know that while my background was good/impressive, they had no open positions for me.

Other companies didn't bother replying. I understand, since they're big companies and have a lot of stuff to do than just to look at me.

Maybe this is the time when reality hits you and makes you feel awful. I though my knowledge of programming and technology would drastically increase my chances of getting a good internship. Although, I was pretty naïve to think that, since there are millions of other people who are probably better than me.

I understand I am not even in a bachelor's program, but the major that I am currently enrolled in is ""Computer Science Transfer"", designed that once you finish two years in this school, you automatically transfer to a 4-year institute for Bachelor's program (obviously a college of your choice, but with certain GPA requirements). So it's not like I am looking for a job with an Associate's degree. I do have plans for Bachelor's and probably Master's.

Do I have no hope to get an internship from one of these top tech companies?

I have also attached my resume (with personal information removed) that I have been sending to everyone. You can find it [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4lcbpbfxqo7b7s8/Resume.docx?dl=0).

If you choose to, please rip apart this Resume and whatever approach I have right now. In fact, I encourage you to. But, I would also appreciate if you tell me where I am going wrong and what I could do better.

Any help is appreciated. Thank You!

First off, which will play a role in this, I am currently a senior who changed majors to Actuarial Science last year. I've attended the career fair at my school and got my name out there to many of the companies I am interested in and applied to many jobs/internships. I was in a unique position of where I was going to graduate during the summer session in July which many employers seemed to have been turned off by. I was going to be available for internships regardless of the online classes I'd be taking in July, but still did not make it past second round interviews.

As for full time offers, I received none of those either, which I like to believe lied heavily on my graduation date as well. I had some nice interviews with a few companies and they reassured me that since I changed majors to become an actuary not too long ago, the fact that I did not have an internship would not be ""held against me"" or reduce my chances of being offered a position. Still, it did not end as I hoped it would and as not offered any positions.

Because I received no offers for an internship or full time position, I am going to graduate next Fall instead and work in one more exam sometime from now until hopefully the upcoming summer, bringing me to two exams passed (which potential employers also assured me was no issue since I've only been studying to become an actuary for ~1 year and that as long as I had another exam passed by graduation, I would be alright which was also no issue for me, I do not expect to have any problems with my next exam). 

Now, for the problem. Since I will be graduating in the Fall of next year, I have another opportunity to attend the career fair and re-apply for jobs through my university in addition to my own outside research on positions. However, I don't feel like people will take me seriously since I still will not have had an internship. I don't really know what I can do to ""make up"" for it and I worry that it may be a never-ending cycle of employers turning my applications down due to not having an internship, but I never really had a real opportunity for one given my age and original expected graduation date.

If anyone has any advice, I would much appreciate it. I know its about a year away, but it worries me to the point where it is taking a toll on my every-day life. I become overwhelmed with anxiety and worry that I sort of shut down. It is quite literally crippling.

I am about halfway through a remote, contract RoR position. 
Before that I was working as an RoR dev for a local company for a year. 
Before that I taught AP computer science at a HS. 


I am looking for advice on what to do when the contract ends. Locally there is a very little demand for Ruby on Rails. Most of the 'tone' is set by the auto industry. My current plan is to try to find another remote position or contract. 
However I would much prefer to work in an office. 
Furthermore, on issue I have is that I am not yet done with school. I am trying my best to change that, but it will take time, and I can not afford to go to class full-time. 
This is an issue because when many see my resume, the education section hurts me. They either ignore the rest of my experience and might offer me a sub par internship (at best) or assume I have graduated (despite it saying otherwise) and be disappointed when that is not the case.

[Thank you so much for doing this AMA. The Supreme Court only releases audio recordings of Oral Arguments, do you feel that this is the best way for the Supreme Court to share the cases with the American people? Do you think having video recordings would change anything related to public perception of cases or would that be irrelevant? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm53c7p?context=5)|I have noticed from questions submitted earlier that there is a misunderstanding about the way audio is released.  It posted online on Friday afternoon of every argument week, not on the same day as arguments take place.  There are rare exceptions,  i.e., the same sex marriage arguments, Obamacare, where the audio is released when the argument is over.  But on a normal day, we do not get audio, though we now do get an unofficial transcript in the afternoon, so I am able to check my notes against that.  Until quite recently, there was no way to check, so we reporters used to gather in the press room afterwards to see who got what precisely, and then we just agreed, that was the quote. 
[How has the SCOTUS changed over the past 20 years and how is it the same? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm53srn?context=5)|The biggest change is that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a Reagan conservative with a centrist bent, has been replaced by Justice Samuel Alito, a George W. Bush appointee, who is a movement conservative. That means that the court has moved in a dramatically more conservative direction--witness Alito's decision last term in the Hobby Lobby case, ruling for the first time ever that some for-profit corporations may be exempt, on religious grounds, from a generally applicable federal law.  
[Hi Nina, thanks for doing this!  Is it difficult to balance having a good relationship with your sources and staying objective? I'm in journalism, too--I would imagine that if you talk to a certain person all the time, you get friendly with them, but you still have to be hard on them. Is that something you find easy now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm53f1g?context=5)|There is a difference between personal friendship and covering an institution.  It sort of is what it is.  You can't trim your professional  sails just because you know and like a justice, for example. You have to report as objectively and interestingly as possible. Sometimes that means you end up writing unflattering things, and sometimes, flattering ones. The one exception to this rule, I must note, is that when I met my late husband, he was a U.S. senator, and I got nowhere near anything he did.

Your work is fantastic and incredibly appreciated.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm53htw?context=5)|Around the time of the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, I did a three part series for ATC on how the case was decided, based on the notes of the justices, which by then were available, and interviews with all the living law clerks who had worked on the decision.  I really like the way it turned out and think it is very revealing on the times and how the decision evolved.

Don't we deserve an explicit heads-up when something has been modified? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm53qd4?context=5)|You got the first such heads up from Justice Ginsburg a short while ago. I suspect others will do likewise, but the truth is that these really are small changes in opinions. You really aren't missing all that much if you don't know; besides which, if the justices don't fess up, the academic bloggers will tell you about it; indeed, that is often how the justices find out they goofed. 
[What was it like doing Inside Washington for 21 years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm5340j?context=5)|It was enormous fun.  The guys became very good friends, including Charles Krauthammer.  When my late husband was very ill, they all pitched in enormously to keep my spirits up, and when I started dating David, Gorden Peterson and his wife Ann gave a party, the purpose of which was to get a look at the new guy!!!

NPR was the first place where there were lots of women, and it was largely because NPR paid so little back then. Women were the only people willing to work for that money, and management got, forgive the expression, more bang for its bucks. 
[Nina,  As a paralegal, you're my favorite NPR personality by far.  What do you think of the recent issue of judicial elections being swayed with outside campaign donations?

Judges, after all, are human beings, and if they are always worrying about how a decision will look in a 30 second ad, that is a very big problem for justice.

Yes, I can check facts more quickly, but I now have to file on multiple platforms. It seems the day is never over now, in terms of how often and for how many venues we file.

But the funniest day recently was the day the clocks were literally spinning in the courtroom (it was the time change day) and Justice Breyer, upon ascending the bench, almost say in Justice Sotomayor's chair.

She often works until 3 or 4 in the morning, then comes into the court in the afternoon. 
[Are you and your team planning on doing anything with John Oliver's doggy Supreme Court footage? I'd honestly rather have your voice over those dogs than the actual audio.

And aside from laughing my head off, I am not doing anything on John Oliver.   No vocal training.  I am blessed with a big, somewhat operatic voice, but that is God's hand, not mine.  My father, see above, always told me that his father had a beautiful singing voice.  
[Should cert granted on the King (ACA\) case scare proponents of the law?

So, supporters of the law are justifiably worried. 
[Hi Nina! So excited you're doing this AMA.  My question: what do you look like?

2ml5up,4,2014-11-17,Strong chance I will not finish my degree. Need advice on my next move.,Csthrowaway2308,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ml5up/strong_chance_i_will_not_finish_my_degree_need/,"Hey guys. Due to financial and personal reasons out of my control, I will likely not be able to finish my degree. I'm currently a 3rd year in Computer Science.

I've looked at questions on this subreddit pertaining to getting a job without a degree, and the general consensus seems to be that, while getting a job without a degree is possible, it requires a strong portfolio and/or job experience. I have no job or interning experience (I was unable to land any paid internships; an unpaid one was always out of the question because I work full time as a delivery driver in order to pay bills and school, so I would not be able to juggle an unpaid internship.) and my github only contains simple, well known algorithms and a fitness web app made using the MEAN Stack.

Ideally, I want to have a strong portfolio by the end of summer 2015, which is likely my last semester until I can no longer continue my degree. I'd really appreciate any advice on what projects I can feasibly get done assuming I have an average of 1-3 hours a day to work on them. I'd also like some advice on whether my plan of action is sound and to know if the fact that I've got an unfinished degree would look bad on a resume or if employers will see it as a strength.

I sincerely appreciate any advice and thank you all for your time.

2mla2e,2,2014-11-17,I [23 M] have a job offer out of state. [22F] girlfriend (fiance?) claims to be supportive. But is she?,888888887777777,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2mla2e/i_23_m_have_a_job_offer_out_of_state_22f/,"A little background information: I have been dating my gf for 2.5 years and am madly in love with her.  We've lived together for over a year and have talked about marriage often.  I actually purchased an engagement ring last week and intend to pop the question when the time is right/I've been able to ask her parents for their blessing.

Two years ago (about 6 months into our relationship), I got an internship at a major company in the Southwest US.  It's 5 hours from school and after becoming so close in our first few months, I asked her to come with me for the summer -- she did.  We lived together and had an amazing summer.  It was the perfect chance to grow as a couple and we've been amazingly close ever since.

Fast forward to now -- I got a job offer to go back to that industry and a similar part of the country.  I graduate in December (1 month!) and she graduates in July 2015.  As most people know, it isn't that easy to get a job right now, so I was thrilled to get an offer (which was even 10k more than the average for my school and the area).  I talked to her a lot about it during the interview process, explaining that I wouldn't take a job there without talking to her first because while I would still be 2 hours from my parents like I am now, she would go from 30 minutes down the road to 5 hours away from hers.  She was supportive and seemingly honest throughout about her intentions of going with me and how much she loved the area.

Now I have this amazing job offer and I can't help stifling my excitement.  When I ask her if she would move there with me, she says of course, she would follow me anywhere.  However, I can't help sensing trepidation in her voice whenever we talk about it.

I know she is scared about living alone for 8 months between my and her graduation, so I plan to pick a May start date and work part time until then -- because I could not handle being apart that long either.  The offer deadline is approaching and I want to accept, but I have this hanging doubt that she is not ok with the relocation on some level.  I've told myself countless times that no job would be worth losing her or causing her to resent me.

This is getting especially difficult because I've been asked to interview at a couple great companies local to her parents home state.  While I would love to take them, I have to respond to my existing offer well before the interview dates and potential offers.  I have already extended the decision date on my offer as much as possible.  She knows all of this and always says quickly, ""Don't even take them (the interviews), we're moving to Arizona and that's that"".





---   
**tl;dr**: Job offer out of college requires relocation far from gf's parents.  I can't tell if she is ok with it.  No idea how to handle this situation."
2mlb64,51,2014-11-17,Graduated with a CS degree but don't like CS anymore. What are my options?,ZeBigBoss,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2mlb64/graduated_with_a_cs_degree_but_dont_like_cs/,"I have completed a bachelor's degree in computer science at a respectable university and I am currently in the first semester of an M.Eng. degree with a focus in computer security. The problem is that I simply don't like computer science anymore.



I did two consulting internships in which I programmed in JavaScript for an ERP system, but didn't like the job because it was too easy and thus boring. I am not the kind of person who will spend their free time staying up to date with the latest tools/technologies or self-teach myself a new programming language or tool. Recently, I was told by a company at a tech fair that they only consider prospects who are participating in multiple open-source projects on GitHub on their personal time. I am not that person either. Most job offers require something that wasn't taught during my bachelor's degree (.NET is a big one, but it's mostly tools and stuff like networking protocols). I feel very jaded with the industry/field as a whole. I enrolled in a Master's degree because I liked the security class I took and wanted to specialize in that, but I found out it's probably the biggest offender in the ""staying up to date on your own free time"" category.



What can someone with a CS degree do that isn't CS?



PS: When I write CS, I mean CS/programming/QA/IT (i.e. sitting at a computer and looking at code for a living). I'm not too keen about business analyst or project management either.



PPS: Sorry if this has been asked before, but I searched the subreddit for similar posts and haven't found any.



**EDIT:** Thank you everyone for the replies and the good advice. It might be the mood I am in or the classes I'm currently taking (no security classes were offered this semester), which would confirm /u/Cheech47's case of the fuck-it's theory.

I think /u/buckus69 put it nicely too when he said
&gt; At the end of the day, development is a job, it doesn't have to be a lifestyle.

I might be under the false impression that you need to have the CS lifestyle to have an interesting CS job. I like to learn new things, just not CS-related things.

I'm considering dropping the Master's or at least shorten it to a Post Graduat Diploma and try to get a harder job than my internships."

Unfortunately for me, finding work in the entertainment industry is beyond cutthroat and I'm finding it hard to come to terms with actually being a failure.

Backstory:
I graduated and moved back in with my parents for six months, saved up a bit of money, and moved in with some friends in Los Angeles. I'm originally from the other side of the country, so this was a big thing for me. However, four months into this job hunt and I am beyond demoralized. Even part time work is difficult to come by. Granted, I know that Los Angeles and the entertainment industry in general is a club that wants none of its members, but I think I may have to do a full reassessment of my existence if I can't make this work. I've gotten a bunch of interviews, but nothing after that. After each one I break it down and try to figure out what I did wrong or what I could have improved, but every time it's the same result. Two weeks ago I got the furthest I had gotten and went to a second interview with a company, but it's been radio silence since then, and I'm not expecting to hear from them. Being positive about this whole debacle can only take me so far.

Aside from my job woes, my money's running out. If I can't find something soon, I'll end up right back east where I don't want to be. If I can't find something in LA/NY or maybe Chicago, then what am I good for? Looking back at my experience, I can find holes of where I could have made a better selection of choices. My work experience is probably slightly under proficient because I lack certain technical qualifications that I just didn't need and was never taught at my old job. I did two internships that both lead to nowhere, and left me gaining little to no more experience than when I started and in my opinion was just a stint of free labor for the employer. I'm hesitant to do another one because of my aforementioned lack of funding.

The whole catch 22 in this scenario is that I need the missing experience that I don't have, but in order to get it, I'd have to find a job in the local market. What's a guy supposed to do when he realizes that everything that he's been building up to for the past five or so years yields a product of nothing?"

You're outspoken on gender issues, you hold a chair at several senate committees related to women's issues. You have a staff team full of male employees, so you're used to men taking orders from you. Even your own husband has a tendency to buckle when confronting you.

But there's one man who doesn't buckle when facing. Quite the opposite, in fact. He's the most unlikely one, a fresh new intern at your office headquarters, so new that he's still tasked with fetching coffee for his seniors. He's so unremarkable that most people who pass through probably don't even notice him.

But he's the only one you will cave for. How many times have you let him fuck you after everyone else had gone home? How many nasty, demeaning names have you let him call you? You stopped giving blowjobs to your own husband after a while because it felt too demeaning, but you'll drop to your knees for him and swallow every last drop he gives you.

-I toked heavily the last two weeks leading up to Monday the 3rd, probably went through 3/4oz-1oz (of course shared with all my buds)

- My test is EARLIEST on February 15. Could be anytime within 3 months of my beginning date in mid May.

My questions are, Should I shave now? or in a week just to be sure the THC is out?  Or should I just wait cut down to 1.5 inches before I take my test knowing I have been clean for long enough for sure?

Also, Im not one to believe any of these detox stuff. People put octane booster in their hair? That's insane.

I feel as though I will be good as long as I take care of the hair that does have THC in it, but preferably only by cutting. 

The way I see it, I have at least 3 months clean (~3.5 to the earliest date) and as much as 5.5 months if they are lazy.

I am currently 26 years old, and knew that I would be unable to pay for college out of high school. So, I got a job right out of school that I would classify as a professional trade in the healthcare industry; I have been doing it for just about six years now. In the process of getting this job, I was required to take some basic, science related classes, and some Spanish. About two years ago I made the decision to return to school for my BA, with the idea that I would try to transition into graduate school and ultimately teaching. History. I have done my research, and am a frequent lurker here, so I understand the dismal job outlook. I believe that my passion for history and for teaching, and strong work ethic, gives me a fair shot at graduate school, but I also understand that I need to get into the correct school, which are incredibly competitive. My questions are what my best options are for moving forward.

I am currently attending a (as far as I know) middle-of-the road state school in the west, with an overall GPA of 3.8 and a History GPA of 4.0. I am still working full time, and attending school part time (about 9 to 12 credit hours/semester), and am currently volunteering and trying for internships at a local museum. At this rate, I should be graduated in about three to four more years. I have fostered some very positive relationships with several professors, who tell me that I have the right mindset and work ethic to be successful. 

The problem I am facing is that there is only one graduate program for History in my state, and it has nothing to do with my interests (which are either Medieval European or pre-industrial European History, broadly), and very few professors in my state place emphasis on my interests. My question is: do I have a chance of acceptance into competitive graduate schools if I keep on my current track? Do you have any advice for a less than traditional, older student trying to get into academia?

Thank you so much for your time, and for any advice. I welcome any questions.

tl;dr: I'm a bit older, and geography is working against me, but I would love to teach and research History. Do I have a shot at graduate school?"

The lack of support and sunlight (Seasonal affective disorder) in this part of the country (I moved away from friends, family, and my SO for this) is making life hard without extra work pressure. I just want to go home to my support network. I have some friends here, but we are not so close.

I don't give two shits about this company. I've done other internships during school and excelled, at companies where the culture was much more suited to my work style and needs as an employee.

The point of this internship was basically to get a return offer, which I doubt I'll get at this point. My manager basically asked me ""do you even want an offer?"" so, yeah... But I'm just at such a low that I don't even want it. I wouldn't want to come back to this company culture anyway, but there is another office closer to my home that I might want to work at (culture varies from team to team, like at any company).

Unfortunately this has also made me question my career path a bit - seeing as this kind of work and culture are pretty common in the industry, I don't know if it is what I want to commit to. I even thought the other day, ""Maybe I should become an electrician and do home automation instead, that could be really cool."" Project management is something I'm good at (previous internship experience), so that's a less drastic change. 

My concern comes mainly from references. I have plenty of good references, but most prospective employers will want to call my most recent manager, right? I'm worried about it if I stay, but I feel like quiting now would look even worse. 

Also, money. Its only one more month and that means 1) I won't have to pay back relocation funds ($1500 for the last month) and 2) will get paid for the last month ($4000 after tax). Being und student loan debt, I need the money. 

Sorry for the vent, but I'd like some perspectives. Thanks!

**tl;dr:** I hate my internship but only have one month left, I'm worried about the references I'll get. "
2mm3o4,1,2014-11-17,"I am down, I fell into a deep hole today.",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/2mm3o4/i_am_down_i_fell_into_a_deep_hole_today/,"I just feel like I need to type out my feelings about all of this. Usually I go on walks, for an hour, two hours, three hours, and sometimes more just to leave my brain alone to naturally collect its thoughts, but today I find myself facing depression, something I have not felt since I lost trust in my family and moved away to college to define myself, and live my life independently.

So, to begin, I met a girl last year, she was interesting, fascinating, and just different. Free, sarcastic, and independent. Our relationship built, and I learned things about her, some unsavory, some amazing. As of now those unsavory things include a proneness towards promiscuity when she back home in California, and a certain affinity for marijuana. Honestly, I do not mind recreational usage, but with her it is different, and I will get to why I believe it is bad for her. Our relationship ended with a bit of sexual touching, and was followed by animosity, and confusion. I tried to figure out if it meant anything at all, but was given no response. Then I departed for roughly 7 months to do an internship. 
Come this year, I return and we hang out, go to dinner regularly, 3 to 5 times a week, and everything seems great. Then like a truck she just becomes depressed, and I start seeing her less and less, she stops going to class, stops going to work, becomes a shut in, and I think maybe it’s me so I give distance,  while still remaining a person to confide in. Let alone time away has not entirely helped because despite all of this there is another guy pursuing her, who can offer her marijuana to escape her depression. Things we’re relatively calm, we made an agreement that she was not ready for a relationship, because of both this depression and wanting to focus on school when she snapped out of it. Though last week, I was with her out of the blue for roughly 5 days, we would hangout, then she would come over and talk, she would then sometime around 8am say she needs to go home to fall asleep, her sleep pattern is all fucked up, and she wants to fix it so she can make more consoling hours and work hours. Fair enough, perhaps she is not comfortable sleeping next to me. Instead, she goes to a “friend” of hers, the one who provides her marijuana, and who she knows has feelings for her, and he begins to give her melatonin so she can fall asleep, and he apparently pops one himself and falls asleep with her. So this begins the first 3 nights. 

The fourth night, she decides to hang out with me, and she begins asking me questions off a Tumblr post, questions in general are something she rarely does, usually I have to lead. So she asks me about 40 most focused on relationships, and the lesser portion on sex. Then I ask her. After the 3rd one, she finally confides in me what has been causing this depressive bout, apparently she had an abusive ex-boyfriend/best friend of four years from back in California, who strangled her, and had sex with her at inappropriate times, and who she felt compelled to sleep with when he got too riled up and aggressive. She felt trained, she couldn’t speak up, she could only do so much, that she cheated the first and only time on someone when this kid acted up again while they weren’t even dating by trying the best friend approach. Then she discussed how her last semi-serious relationship, one which she didn’t give a title too, but decided to move in with, ended after he cheated on her with a stripper, and got violent with her. I felt for her. I assumed something like this had happened, there were too many signs, too many panic attack triggers that I sat through her with to not know it was something as stomach wrenching as this. Eventually we ended up in my room, just cuddling, and she brought up a list of 85 sexual questions, and we began talking about those, and a little touching occurred, but we decided not to go further, and she left for home to take more melatonin. 
Then, on the fifth night, after an awkward situation wherein she met a guy on YikYak(Anonymous Social Board App) and brought him to hang out with us after smoking pot with him, and he was promptly kicked out by her group of female friends for being sketchy as fuck, which I agree with. She doesn’t understand why he is sketchy and tries to convince me that they don’t understand and it is just something you have to be in the “weed” community to see. I tell her there may be some value in the consensus of multiple friends. We leave it at that. Fast forward she comes back to my apartment, we begin questions again, and I ask about the previous night as we cuddle watching Louie. Eventually she finds my porn folder, and begins to ask if she can look at some. Before anything, I want to reaffirm my feelings, so I show her a letter I wrote for her, I want to be clear this is what I am feeling, and if you are not I do not want to be just another guy to have sex with, she has been not having sex because she knows it is bad for her, though she has alluded to doing something else, which is worse for her emotionally and mentally in comparison, I want to know what this is. I get no answer, regardless she comments how she is not as comfortable cuddling me, knowing I have these feelings. At this point I do not know this other guy is falling asleep with her, who she also knows has these feelings for her. Regardless, she begins masturbating, and we set rules, no penetration of any orifice, so she is going and I am going, then eventually I begin to kind of talk into her ear, and sensually touch her body, moving into just more foreplay and her teasing me, but nothing more. 9am rolls around, I feel a bit disappointed in myself, as if I did something wrong. So I leave her to sleep in my bed, while I use the couch, she falls asleep, without melatonin no less.

Then, the sixth day. I find out that she has been falling asleep with this other guy, jealously burns. Depression begins to stir, and I plan to see how tonight goes before making any acquisitions. Something is obviously wrong though, so I ask about what happened last night. I get the response that “I know you can’t control yourself, you are not ready for this, and what you did was shitty, but it doesn’t make you a shitty person, I just planned this to help you realize this about yourself.” I know I fucked up, and I just bawl, I haven’t bawled like that since my mom disowned me. I’m a wreck I try to keep a coherent conversation, but it’s not happening, I try to leave but both her roommates and my roommate were hanging out, we are all friends, and I go on a walk with my roommate. He assures me I did nothing wrong, it’s not my fault, I was what felt honest and natural I broke no boundaries, and she probably took advantage of my own self-doubt to make such a lie and take blame away from herself.

Fast forward, a lot of talking and comfort from her roommates and other friends who agree with my roommate’s conclusion. I understand now, but I am depressed, because I let this girl into a circle of trust that has not been filled in four years, I let her into the very core of myself, somewhere I wanted to filled, somewhere I was scared of being vacant, I felt I could trust her completely, and she just lied to me in such a way to quite literally destroy me. She made me doubt if I can trust myself, if I can have any relationship, if I am some sort of primal sex driven monster. So I confront her, this time I apologize not for the morning of the sixth day, where we had relations, but for the night, when I bawled. I say “I came here to tell you that what I did felt honest, it felt reciprocated, I have nothing to be ashamed of, and I think what you said to me was a lie, that you took advantage to push blame onto me.” No response. I continue “But look, I love you, I thought maybe I didn’t that perhaps I could do the friend thing, that I could abolish these feelings. But I can’t, this is it, this is what I feel, I cannot go back to feeling complacent just being friends.”
Her response, “What does that mean?” I just say it means if we still hang out expect me to feel jealously, expect me to be concerned, to want to help, to want to hold you in my arms, to be completely honest with you, and yet feel pain because I can’t. Her response “If we just stop.” I say, expect me to be sad, to be depressed, to miss you, to find pain in the drudge until perhaps one day it doesn’t hurt. Her response “I don’t burn bridges, I give you the gasoline, you make the decision.” The conversation takes a different turn, in the silence she asks me, how do you describe me. “The embodiment of a free spirit. Reckless, but fun, exciting by dangerous, a rush, the thrill, loving, compassionate, and trustworthy.” I continue to ask her to describe me, and for a moment, a moment, the apathy disappears, “Well, he’s a CS guy, and he’s really good at it, he has big dreams. He’s really good with words, like so good I would love to read a book written by him. But he has trust issues, and he makes assumptions, not a bad amount, or too bad an amount though. Oh, and he wears glasses.” From here the conversation lightens up, we end up on kinky questions again, I begin to not like where this is going, but I want to believe we can trust each other, that I can control myself, some questions come out about her sexual experiences, a myriad of them at that, and all I can see is her naked body with both a faceless man, her ex-boyfriend, and the other guy leading them all, and it just makes me angry, jealous. Eventually the question comes up, was your last sexual experience good or bad, she says badly, I inquire are you referring to me, and she explains she knows it is bad, but she can’t say it was bad. Silence fills the air, I announce that I am leaving, my roommate and I leave.

I forgot to mention that when she returned home for this conversation that we had preemptively set up to have the night before, she came home with the “other guy”, and so much rage filled me, but I suppressed it, I asked no questions. Though my roommate who came for moral support was sitting outside with him and he mentioned that “they” had just woken up, thankfully my roommate convinced him not to interrupt our conversation and he left. Thankfully.


We were never dating, but somehow I still feel betrayed. Now I sit here wondering what will happen to her, what will happen with that other guy, asking how she could lie to me in probably the most profoundly wrong way one can lie, how she could be so apathetic, how now when I masturbate I can only think of her lying next to me and it makes my stomach hurt, and how when I see something like a counter I remember her discussing the gratuitous amounts of counter sex she has had, and just imagine the type of scum she has had relationships with railing her, and it destroys my appetite. I just feel like I can’t do anything, and at the same time I am not sure what to do, it has only been one day, but I am so lost.


Thanks for reading guys, just typing it out helps, and honestly I still don’t know who is right or wrong, but I all I know is I don’t want to burn this bridge, I don’t want to just throw her away like everyone else.

2mma1p,2,2014-11-17,CS Senior Dropout (Money / Family),ProgrammingDropout,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2mma1p/cs_senior_dropout_money_family/,"So I've been forced to leave college (likely temporarily) my senior year for money/family reasons,  but I'm 100% done with my CS / Math courses. I haven't done any internships (I did some research into machine learning, but don't have much to show for it right now.) but I have written an iOS app a few years back that is pretty clean and have a pretty vast library of in-progress projects that may or may not be helpful (I make music in haskell with markov chains and dick around with procedural graphics generation using fractals and raymarching (openGL / metal / whatev) and have a pretty strong familiarity with C family languages) and have taken 7-8 courses via MOOCs or self-study that mostly span data-science type stuff. I also did some fairly intensive multithreadiing in my networking course (honors) and those projects are completed and work nicely.

I can't go back at the moment (I'm sure I will in a year or two), but I do need a source of income. Unfortunately I have very little in the way of corporate networking and while I can boast plenty of CS / Programming skill; I don't know how to turn that into money. My fear is that my personal interests aren't really marketable without a masters/phd or a really strong reputation of some sort. Should I suck it up and try to do some iOS-dev or something high-demand for a while? Would a company consider me (preferably for a position I can learn from) despite a lack of paper credentials?"
2mmd8n,1,2014-11-17,Wherein I thoroughly attempt to justify my terrible choices. Buckle in. It's a long one.,INVICTU5,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2mmd8n/wherein_i_thoroughly_attempt_to_justify_my/,"Hello /r/offmychest. My name is Mason and I'm 20 years old. I'm currently enrolled in courses at university and am attending none of them. In fact, I haven't been for roughly a year. I tried to make this semester work. I went for a month and a half. Then work and money problems got to me again and I've been off again. After I fail out this semester I'll be on exclusion for one year (3 semesters). That's the gist of the situation. Here's the back story:

I was but a wee freshman studying electrical engineering. I was doing alright in my coursework, but it wasn't enough for my parents. I needed to have better grades AND be trying to get a job. Well, summer 2013 I got one. I worked for the residential facilities department at my university. I cleaned out the firm's and made them ready to live in, five days a week, eight hours a day. It was gruelling work, but it paid alright. Until I was fired because my supervisor forgot that we were allowed more than one call -in. Even when I came back with the attendance policy proving him wrong, I wasn't allowed back. I'd just broken up with my girlfriend of a year and a half. Now I'm fired.

Second summer semester starts and I take Calc 1. I hate it, and begin making plans to switch to Information Systems, and attempting to find a new job. 

I find a new job with the A.V. Support department of the university. I love it, but my bosses hate me. My co-workers aren't to fond of me. I'm fired after two months when I learn too much about a relationship between my co-worker and her boss and unwittingly let on that I know in conversation.

I stop going to classes completely. This is fall of 2013. I'm without a job, not attending classes, I drink every night, and the exhaustive amount of aid money my aunt gave me is running thin around the end of November. I risk being evicted from my apartment. I have to get MORE help from my aunt to keep my room.

I found a job as a taxi driver, of all things. I started in January. I love it. I love driving. I love taking to people. I'd make a career out of it if the hours weren't weird and the money so unstable. I also started dating my girlfriend in December. I love her very much, but I'll address her later. I got academic things to talk about right now.

Spring semester started, and it was an absolute joke. I went for maybe two weeks of the semester. After which I quit going entirely and just upped my hours driving my cab. Life was alright. I was making my own money, feeding my own existence. Summer rolled around, and I worked even harder. I worked six days a week at some points.

Cue this semester. I quit my taxi job and went to work at a liquor store the next town over. It didn't pay nearly as well as the taxi job, but the better hours allowed me to go to class more. Then I overslept ONCE. I missed a test. I gave up. I got my taxi job back and quit going to class again, resigning to my fate of being on exclusion.

It was at this time that I started thinking about my future. It just so happened that I remembered an Art of Manliness article I'd read about things you can do with your life that aren't college. My cousin in law (whom I'm great friends with) didn't graduate from college. He's just recently graduated from an electrical apprenticeship. He's very smart, has an amazing apartment, a beautiful wife (my cousin, I know :P ), and an awesome job. And no college. What the hell am I doing?

I've talked to the Savannah IBEW branch and I'll be looking at an Inside Wireman apprenticeship next year ( /r/electricians represent). Here's the thing: MY PARENTS DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS!

&gt; Getting fired last summer? They think it was because the school was unhappy with the summer vacation we took.  If they knew about me getting fired wrongly for calling in, they'd want to know why I called in. They can't know it's because my alarm didn't go off. They'd taunt me and make fun of me for not being mature enough.

&gt;Getting fired for knowing too much? They think my position just got replaced. They can't know that it was for unwittingly running my mouth to my boss. They'd want me to tell H.R. It's a lot more complicated than that. 

&gt; Failing out? They think I'm passing. Hell, they think I'm EXCELLING. They can't know I've failed for three semesters. It'd severely hurt them. It may physically hurt my mother. 

&gt; Moving to Savannah for an apprenticeship? They think I'm getting an internship with Gulfstream Aerospace and have to move down there.

My girlfriend is the only ray of light for me in all of this. She knows everything. She's been so supportive every step of the way. I'm so scared. I want to have my future all planned out, but one false move, one slip of the tongue, one misstep on my end, and it's all over. She's been so supportive and I don't want to seem like I don't have it together. I have headaches all the time. I think they're from dealing with all this.

I don't have a dream career, I just want something I can have a little fun doing and make enough to support myself and a family. I like electricity. At this point, I've basically decided I'd love to be a sparky. Beats the hell out of throwing six years and 60k away on MAYBE getting a job. When I was younger I had such fantastic aspirations. I wanted to do amazing work, and build great big things. Now I'm satisfied with literally anything as long as it pays the bills. I dunno. My girl's the only one I've talked to about this, but I need opinions of some other people. Subreddit, where do I go from here?"

Having a shit ton of schoolwork and other shit in college is really different from sitting at a desk doing a bullshit ""internship"" all summer or typical high school bs. Anyways, /u/trashpile quietly shipped me these back in mid October and I've been wearing them about 3 times a week for the past month. I'm not usually a big picture taker, but here are some of the places I've been, things I've done in these babies.

[Boston Adventures of the Traveling Pants](http://imgur.com/a/z9xJf)

Enough about me, on to the denim itself. So as you can tell from my flair, I've only handled sub-200 dollar raws and boy oh boy there is definitely a difference between this pair and my previous NF, Levis, and 'Qlos. The first thing that jumped out at me was the texture of the fabric in both visual effect and handfeel. The fabric itself was pretty dense and the indigo dye ""pops"" which accentuates the fades. These jeans came in already pretty faded and since I have a fairly non active/adventurous lifestyle, they didn't fade noticeably during my possession of them besides for a very subtle lightening overall (which was probably due to the handwash).

[Anyways, here are some details/fade updates.](http://imgur.com/a/r8uEa)

In terms of fit, these were alright. I've lost a bit of weight since I signed up for the tour and also stopped lower body for aesthetic reasons (muscular balance, I have a hard time building up upper body) so these jeans were a bit fuller than I usually go for. I think some of the other guys on the tour wore these better than I did. In case anyone was wondering, I was wearing an American Apparel henley and H&amp;M canvas parka in these shots. The boots were Golden Fox, which imho gives you 75% of Red Wing quality and aesthetic at a fifth or less of the price.

[Fit pics](http://imgur.com/a/wGgXN)

Finally I would like to thank /u/trashpile for organizing this tour. This was my first experience with higher end japanese denim and while I probably won't be purchasing a pair in the near future, I can now see how they cost what they do and want to eventually own  a pair. Oh by the way, a new raw denim song is in the works!"

2mmmj9,1,2014-11-17,Seeking advice as a recent college graduate (BBA majoring in accounting),BlueAccountant,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2mmmj9/seeking_advice_as_a_recent_college_graduate_bba/,"Long time lurker, first time posting on Reddit so please bear with me if I make any mistake on Reddit etiquette. So here’s a little background on me before I ask my question. I graduated from Temple University with a Bachelor of Business Administration majoring in Accounting on September 2013. My GPA wasn't that great around a 2.7 so it was a bit hard for me to get any internship while I was in college. Wish I have tried harder in attaining an internship or tried harder in college in general. Well I can’t change the pass, as they say water under the bridge. What I can do is change myself now and that is where you guys/girls come in. I need some advice on how to proceed as I’m having a hard time obtaining a job.

I tried applying to bookkeeping, data entry, account payable, entry level accountant, entry level financial analyst, accounting clerk, billing associate and I even tried some internship. So fair I haven’t gotten more than a phone call interview. And even that, they ask the usual question such as my education background, what job did I previous have and what have I been doing the past year. My only job I had was being a Rite Aid store associate which basically rung up customer at the cashier and that was 4-5 years ago. So I pretty much don’t have reference to offer when they say they need 2-3 reference. I know you guys would say how about your college professor? Well it’s already been a year I doubt they remember me. So what have I been doing this past year well mostly looking for some kind of job related to my degree, I did spent some time studying for my CPA for a bit but never got to fully finish studying for the Financial reporting section. I know there’s four part, I thought maybe I study financial reporting section first. Right now I am reading a few books on accounting just to keep my mind from forgetting what I have learned. I’m also reading about how to trade stocks and understanding foreign currency trading as those topic interest me the most and would love to do any job that are related to them. I’m also taking some MOOC (massive open online courses) classes just to occupy my time for a few hours each week. I do regularly check craigslist posting for job opportunity but certain jobs just ask for 2 or more year experiences, which I don’t have. But I do apply for them anyway sometimes when I get brave.

So the question I have at the moment is what can I do or what haven’t I done in order to find someone to hire me. Is it the economy? Is it me? Is it just my degree or major? Is there a place where I can volunteer my time and also get training? I am starting to lose hope in ever finding a job. I just don’t know what to do anymore besides looking through job posting every day and applying but that doesn't seem to be working. I would rather not further my education at the moment because of money issues but I would love to go back and get my MBA down the road say 4-5 years from now.

Thanks for reading and thank you for any comments or advice you may have to start my career.

2mmnej,9,2014-11-17,I think I might have impostor syndrome,BartletForPresident,LadiesofScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/2mmnej/i_think_i_might_have_impostor_syndrome/,"Just some background info about myself: I'm a senior who is going to graduate with a BS in Environmental Science in the spring. I wish to get an MS in Hydrology. 

I've never really considered myself a mathematically inclined person and to be perfectly honest I still don't consider myself one now. Yet the prerequesite for most graduate-level Hydrology programs is one semester of Calculus III and one semester of Differential Equations. Therefore, even though I hadn't taken a math class since my freshman year of college (Calculus II) I decided to take Calculus III and differential equations this year (Calculus III in the fall, Differential Equations in the spring.) I told myself that if things didn't work out, I could always drop Calculus III and apply for an ecology program instead. 

So far, things have worked out pretty okay. I had some trouble understanding a few things, limits in 3D for example, but for the most part, I've understood the material very well. 

Last week, I took the third exam in that class before the final. It was mostly about triple integration and working in polar and spherical coordinates. I found the whole thing incredibly intimidating. I was convinced at the end of the exam that I had flunked it. We just got the exams back today and I got a 90 percent on it. (I got a 90 and an 85 on my previous two exams.) 

I wanted to feel happy but instead, I just felt like there was no way I could be understanding the material in the class so well. This is going to sound rather silly, but I figured that moving into a third dimension would somehow be where I would hit a wall and no longer be good at math. Now I've only moved onto thinking that Diff Eq will be where I will hit a wall and no longer be good at math. 

I've been told by my mentors in my previous internship and by my advisor that I'm ahead of the game but even though I'm an Honors Student, I honestly don't believe it. I feel like I'm behind, especially since I haven't contacted any of the people whose labs I want to work in yet. This is because every time I try, I just end up looking at the work that they're doing on the lab's website and I think ""they don't want me for this sort of work"" and I freak out.  

I honestly am not sure how to get out of this headspace. Has anyone else experienced this?"

I got burned out on school, and decided to find a job so I could move out of my parents house (and finish school part time).

I've got two very cool offers in front of me. But I don't know what the better choice is.

Offer 1) Post series A start-up. Closing in on series B. very good product, probably will sell out to a larger company in the next five years (CEO has very good connections and has done this before.
  
70-75k salary. 0.10-0.15% equity. 

Offer 2) Microsoft. Senior SDE/Web Developer. One of the fastest growing teams which is brand new.
All the Microsoft perks... 

~90k salary. 40k sign on.

I don't know what to choose. Microsoft will offer me the most job security ( l like that ), but the startup may offer more reward along with more risk. The ceo of this start up was a executive of a fortune 500 before and has a good record.

I am in my early 20s, and want to pursue PM roles. I had four internships and a 4 month contract project before this..

Help me choose please. what are your ideas?"

2mmtb3,3,2014-11-17,I think I'm having some sort of mental breakdown (X-post from r/self),Gapinthesidewalk,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2mmtb3/i_think_im_having_some_sort_of_mental_breakdown/,"It's been four months since I moved to Los Angeles. Unfortunately for me, finding work in the entertainment industry is beyond cutthroat and I'm finding it hard to come to terms with actually being a failure.

Backstory: I graduated and moved back in with my parents for six months, saved up a bit of money, and moved in with some friends in Los Angeles. I'm originally from the other side of the country, so this was a big thing for me. However, four months into this job hunt and I am beyond demoralized. Even part time work is difficult to come by. Granted, I know that Los Angeles and the entertainment industry in general is a club that wants none of its members, but I think I may have to do a full reassessment of my existence if I can't make this work. I've gotten a bunch of interviews, but nothing after that. After each one I break it down and try to figure out what I did wrong or what I could have improved, but every time it's the same result. Two weeks ago I got the furthest I had gotten and went to a second interview with a company, but it's been radio silence since then, and I'm not expecting to hear from them. Being positive about this whole debacle can only take me so far.

Aside from my job woes, my money's running out. If I can't find something soon, I'll end up right back east where I don't want to be. If I can't find something in LA/NY or maybe Chicago, then what am I good for? Looking back at my experience, I can find holes of where I could have made a better selection of choices. My work experience is probably slightly under proficient because I lack certain technical qualifications that I just didn't need and was never taught at my old job. I did two internships that both lead to nowhere, and left me gaining little to no more experience than when I started and in my opinion was just a stint of free labor for the employer. I'm hesitant to do another one because of my aforementioned lack of funding.

The whole catch 22 in this scenario is that I need the missing experience that I don't have, but in order to get it, I'd have to find a job in the local market. What's a guy supposed to do when he realizes that everything that he's been building up to for the past five or so years yields a product of nothing?"

I'm just worried about my GPA, my cumulative GPA is 3.33 Freshman: 2.98, Sophomore: 3.5, Junior: 3.6, Senior (current): 4.2-4.5. SAT: 1710-1850. My school has a good relationship with Michigan, I have some good extracurriculars, and I've taken AP CompSci (I have an A), AP Physics B (B+) and AP Physics C (B right now). The thing that really sets me apart though is my essay. I have a brother with autism and it has had a tremendous effect on my life, we were able to bond over video games, which got me into Computer science. In the field of CompSci I've had an internship and I've taught myself to write Python, Java, Javascript, HTML5, and Jquery. I want to apply as a CompSci major but I hear you get held to a higher standard grade-wise. Michigan seems like a great school, most of my friends are applying there, I also want to be a part of the UM Smash community but I don't think its too relevant to the application. Please let me know what you think my chances are and what I can do.

TL;DR: 3.33 Cumulative (2.98 Freshman, 3.56 Sophomore, 3.6 Junior, 4.2-4.5 Senior) SAT 1710-1850, Three AP classes all related to the intended major CompSci. What are my chances? What can I do?"

My true passion has always been video games - I just always brushed it off as a pipedream that I could not make a career out of. Now that I did not get accepted to medical school in the first cycle, I've thought to myself: ""Hell, why not go for it?""

**So, my question(s) is(are):**

*what is the right direction to take to get into the video game industry?

*Computer science vs. Computer Engineering vs. ?

*What are courses I def need to take?

*Go for Master's?

*Internships?

**Maybe a little more detail about my situation would help:**

I have a Bachelor's of Science in BME with minors in Chem and Bio. I have taken a few courses dealing with computers and beginner coding (MatLab and a very small amount of C++), and a couple of courses dealing with CAD programs and models. In Senior Design, I was in charge of the computer models of our product and did stress and fracture testing etc. (not in great detail, but enough to get an A).

Assume money and time are not that restrictive. I'd like to think that courses I've already taken would help and/or count towards the computer field in some sense.


Please be as honest and open as possible, as any single response could greatly influence my future :)"

Some details:
I'm 18, I have pretty good grades in terms of computing and work experience. I've worked for 1 year currently setting up computers, networks and generally being the ""IT Guy"". This was a whole Intern thing basically and during it I went on Microsoft setting up Windows 8 and Cisco ICND1(? I think that was the name?) courses but never did the exam at the end of it.

I love computers, I love how they work I love troubleshooting and I love learning and reading tech news everyday, Basically at the moment i'm in my dream job. but I want to do more and focus on what I am good at and learn more and be better at what I do.

But I keep seeing people saying ""Pick something you are good at and focus on it""

I don't know what to focus on. I know it's very early days for me to be setting my self my actual career until i'm 65 at the age of 18 but it wouldn't hurt to plan.

Networks do interest me but I don't know how to actually set them up. I mean I can configure your basic routers and switches but anything involving a CLI I would have to follow a guide or read up on it first. I've began ordering networking equipment and my own rack just to familiarize myself with setting everything up maybe getting a home server going for learning purposes.


So I don't know, does anyone know what path I should pursue? Maybe I should just wait a couple of years and decide then? Too early? 

I'm not a big fan of scripting and programming but I have taken steps to learn php and code some sites for my work. Basic things like status checkers.

If I missed anything of importance out let me know and i'll add it in.


If this is the wrong place for this heh let me know. Just want some professional advice from people who have been in this stage as well.

However sometimes they pretty much prevent it from happening.

I have a particular example in mind. 1 year ago, while i was doing my internship at the end of my degree, my tutor was really hard to join (Small IT company, often on the move to visit clients) so i was frequently emailing him for questions i had or interventions/decisions i had to take. Sometimes when it was benign he'd email me back, but most of the time and EVERY TIME when it was something important, he'd call me or wait to see me in the office to answer me.

So i only realized it afterwards, but he did nothing in writing that could compromise him, so i could have been in trouble for things i wasn't responsible for. And since he was kind of an asshole i'm starting to think that i dodged a bullet (when i began my internship he talked about engaging me after, and before the end he told me this was going to be done, turns out theses were empty promises , and like the rest they were verbal, nothing in writing...)

now this was last year and I've been over it since, but i'm worried i could in the future be confronted with a guy having a similar attitude. How could i deal with it and force him to get something in writing when he can call me or visit my office if he wants to avoid compromise himself ?

First of all, I have a lot of things to be grateful for. I'm healthy, I'm young (23, F), my whole family is still alive and loves me and supports me, I'm kinda cute, I've survived a potentially life-threatening brain malformation, I'm intelligent, I went to my dream college on a full scholarship, I have a few true friends I can count on, and I'm living in one of the most beautiful places on earth. 


But I'm so fucking depressed and lonely and tired and poor and beaten down that I can't take it anymore. I've been poor my entire life. My parents were shitty alcoholics who supported us on government money and handouts. So I worked my ass off. I worked my ass off in school and at numerous part time jobs while other teenagers got to party and play sports and screw around.

The worked payed off though. I got a full scholarship to NYU's film school, which was one of the happiest moments of my life. However, once again, I was the poorest kid in my realm. Once again, all my friends got to party and explore their creative whims and take unpaid internships, and I hustled and worked crappy jobs just to keep my head above water. I barely got to enjoy my college experience because I was constantly worried about money. I stole toilet paper from the school bathrooms and ate ramen and black beans for months. I lied to my friends about weekend plans just so I wouldn't have to tell them I was once again too broke to go out for drinks. I was homeless multiple times and I stayed on campus over Christmas and Spring Break because I couldn't afford the plane ticket home. 

I thought things would get easier when I graduated and had time to work full time, but it's still the same fucking story. I've been out of school for a couple years now and I'm still in the financial hole. I couldn't stand NYC any longer, so I moved out to Colorado with a close friend. The cost of living is cheap here, and I finally have time to make films, but I can't get a job no matter how hard I try. I feel like I'm just throwing my resume into a black hole. I suspect people can feel the failure emanating off me. Like depression stink lines. I feel like everyone I went to school with is more successful than me. I used to think that all of my hard work and determination was building character, but now I just think it's broken my soul. 

I'm so tired of worrying where next month's rent is coming from or whether I have enough money for eggs and milk. I feel like an idiot for thinking someone like me could become a famous film director. I'm ashamed that after everything I've been through, I have to beg people who didn't graduate high school to help me get a job at the kitchen they work at. Other people seem to know how to find opportunities, talk themselves up, make connections and get started in life, but I'm totally clueless. 

I don't like who I've become. I have a dense ball of anger and resentment and shame inside me and I feel like it's getting heavier every day. I don't want to get too close to anyone because I'm afraid they'll see my angry self-pitying heart. I'm terrified I'm wasting my life being unhappy and yet I don't have the energy to change direction. 

I wish someone would just shake me and say ""this is what you're doing wrong. this is how you can fix it."" Or just hand me a million dollars. Or just give me a good heartfelt hug, I'm so lonely. I'm fucking falling apart.

My life is in tatters right now; I've bitten off more than I can chew in college, I can't get over the guy I dated 4 months ago her and I can't seem to so much as land an interview for my junior internship. I woke up at 3:30 today- I spend an inordinate amount of time procrastinating, I sleep late and I'm running out of motivation. I don't have any drive; every second of my existence is forced, I'm not enthusiastic about anything anymore, I don't want to attend class, I don't want to learn anything new, everything I do is just a means to an end, an attempt to get somewhere that isn't here. I've never felt satisfied in the moment.

I don't know what to call it. Was it naivety? Did the enthusiasm from my younger years stem from being oblivious to the fact that the world is a shitty place. Or is motivation like a fuel source that starts to run out after x number of failures. I went from failure to failure with relative enthusiasm. I used to like swimming. Nobody really encouraged me, I just liked it so I did it. I spent 10 rigorous hours in the pool every week and I loved every second of it. I was never in it to win, but that changed. People's expectations fucked me up. I was enthusiastic about my school work, I loved learning and I used to spend hours of my free time just reading stuff. It all started to go downhill after the depression set in.

But it was really the depression, it was circumstance. I've fallen for two guys in the last 3 years, and god it hurt when it didn't work out. The second time it really hit me hard. His parents made him get married to someone at 19, *while* he was still dating me- I had no idea until they were engaged. The reason it really struck me much was that I realized that there really isn't anything worth standing up for in life. I thought we had something, I thought human connections held more meaning, that notions like 'love' are real, but life just seems so superficial. I've never had any real meaningful connections with anyone in life, I've never even kissed a guy. I don't know what he felt when his parents told him he has to get married to this girl, but he eventually agreed. He had known her for 4 days, she is taller than him, she can't speak English properly and she is like 30. Oh and who the fuck gets married at 19? Just my luck.

I always have something to prove to myself and others. For example, I'm really passionate about economics, everyone I spoke to said it was a challenging and interesting major. Despite the fact that I enjoy subjective stuff like political science, I decided to minor in symbolic systems. Don't get me wrong, I like math, but I made this transition at a time where I wasn't exactly right in the head. I needed to be focused and I've just being coming undone over time. Now I'm so far down the line that I can't retrace my steps.

There were so many failures. I never really lived up to my parents expectations and they continuously compared me to other kids. I was never as smart as some kid or as fast as some other girl at swimming. I never received any from of validation at any point in my life. It doesn't matter that I did well because there was always someone doing better. I don't know what could possible be wrong with my qualifications that precludes even the possibility of an interview. My grades aren't that bad, I have a 3.45 GPA with very technical classes and a major GPA of 3.8, I have high standardized test scores, I attend a good university, I interned at places relevant to my career every summer and I try my best at networking. And it still isn't enough.

So all I have to show for a lifetime of pushing myself and going out of my comfort zone is depression and a general hatred towards my self and others. I've turned into a disillusioned, bitter, self-hating individual, at 20. I don't know how to adapt to this world. If I let my self become hopeful again I risk getting hurt. But if I don't allow hope into my system I'll just become more and more damaged inside. I don't know what to to. I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but my home life was fucked up too. My mum used to cut herself, sometimes in front of me. My dad was regularly abusive and the only reason they're still together is because of cultural pressures. My brother has tried to kill me with a knife and I got bullied a lot in school. I come from an overall dysfunctional background.

I can barely get out bed every morning. Each day gets harder and harder. I don't know what to do. I'm having a complete mental breakdown."

This is my last year on college (EE program) and I've been working my first job as an intern at this company for an year, more or less. It looked like a good oportunity at first: better than average pay, close to the campus, flexible hours, and I was quite motivated to be working there, for the first three months at least. There are some things about the company that I'm not happy about, and I would like a neutral opinion about this matters, since it's my first job, and the advices I'm getting seem to be a little biased...

It's a relatively small company, that grew a lot in the last 3 years, from 20 employees to about a 100 or more. In my opinion (Shared by most of my colleagues) the management does not make a good job, well... managing. There are serious internal communication issues, as of completely disregarding the input of a department until halfway of a project, and the management doesn't think of it as an issue. The projects scopes are not clear and keep changing at the whims of the directors, with no regard to the work we put up. Some key employees are unmotivated and quitting their position, claiming they see no room for growing inside the company. Most of my colleages are inexperienced, straight out of college and are being paid way bellow the average, about twice of what I'm paid as an intern. The most senior engineer there (Except for the founders) doesn't get paid the average salary and he has 20years of experience.

As for my job there, I wasn't given much training when I started, but I took it as normal and tried to do my best. Tried to help with what I could, but with no experience and clear procedures, there wasn't much I could do, so I've been idle for a lot of time and made lots of mistakes. Halfway of the year, some employees quit and they dumped some extra tasks on me. I've taken more responsabilities than a intern should, in my opinion and also in the opinion of my colleagues, and made more mistakes. The work load didn't actually put me down, what really did was the mess in the directives and the lack of assistance from those working with me.

That been said, I'll probably wont stay in the company after graduating, but I'd like some opinions if it's something that I should expect in other companies or what should I do to face this kinds of situations.

Good thing I found this subreddit, I'm mostly gonna vent here though, so here I go!


When I was a kid I was diagnosed with ""attention problems"" but my parents refused to give me any medicine because they thought it was gonna go away eventually. Oh boy they were wrong.


Throughout all highschool I struggled so much to focus in class, 10 minutes was my limit, after that I would begin fidgeting, reading other chapters of my textbook, looking outside and being distacted by crows and so on.
I ended up repeating my last year before university 3 times due to me not being able to focus at all. I somehow made it.


Now I'm nearing my second year of university, currently in an internship, and it is hell on earth atm. I just can't focus, it's a thousand times worse than some years ago. When I try working I have this feeling of my eyes losing focus and the front of my head feeling heavy, it is almost crippling. Once I had decided that I had enough of feeling like this, I start browsing stuff online and fidgeting like crazy. I can't keep my fingers in place (constant finger drumming on my leg).


I'm worried about my future, I already struggle learning anything during / outside of class, everything is either painful or just plain distracting.


I'm scared of getting treatment though, I don't know what to expect, people in France actually look down on people who have this, in general you see documentaries shitting on medication saying that ""hyperactive kids just have a ton of energy, this shit is a scam!"". I don't want to be told that I'm insane or anything.

I honestly dunno what else to say, I lost my train of thought and forgot how I was gonna end this. Whatever.


EDIT: Did some horrendous grammar / spelling mistakes in there, I think some are still around, gotta proofread stuff more :V


EDIT2: I noticed I wrote two different sentences that basically said the same thing.

EDIT3: I appreciate the answers guys, I am feeling a lot better and I understand much better what is going on with me, I have an appointment on friday and hopefully I'll get to sort things out :D!

I feel SO conflicted. I have already had numerous internships and don't need any more experience and the money is crap so neither of those are motivators. I am just nervous that I will be wasting away my semester abroad by working full time instead of going with a group of youngnpeople and taking classes (with less stress). I feel like I have my whole life to work but this is such a great opportunity idk if I can pass it up. But at the same time I will go a whole semester without classes. I really would love any input at all. I feel like throwing up. I also have a long term boyfriend but he has encouraged me to not consider the relationship in this decision which I agree with."
2mo6vh,1,2014-11-18,Estimating salary before getting an offer,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2mo6vh/estimating_salary_before_getting_an_offer/,"About me, I'm currently a college student (computer science) that will be graduating in the spring. I have an IT internship at a small company that pays $10/hr and has no end date. They've spent months training me and seem to like me, so I'm assuming they'll want to offer me a full time position once I graduate.
The problem is I have no clue what kind of salary that offer would include, making it difficult to plan ahead financially and determine my price range for my next apartment and other big purchases. My lease ends pretty much right after I graduate so I'll need to have a lease signed before I start working full time. Also, my parents live 500 miles away, so moving home temporarily while I adjust and figure things out isn't really a viable option. 
So is there any good way to estimate the starting salary for a position our department without getting an offer or blatantly asking someone else how much money they make?
Glassdoor isn't very helpful due to the company's small size, but the 1 IT salary posted was about $48k, although I don't know if that's entry level or if I would be offered a different position that pays differently. "
2mo6ws,11,2014-11-18,New Grad Salary Negotiations in Massachusetts area,mountainmanz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2mo6ws/new_grad_salary_negotiations_in_massachusetts_area/,"Hello cscareerquestions, long time lurker here and now finally time to ask a question. I just got my first offer (yay!) at a reputable network company (named after a major city in CA...) as a Software Engineer I position. The offer was roughly for 66k. Personally, I feel this is low. I have previously interned at the same company for 6 months (salary was about 60k an intern) and have about 2 years of intern experience under my belt at this point from major cs companies. Although maybe I am confused about the starting rate in the Boston area, but I did expect around 80k+.

So my two questions are:
1. Does this seem like a fair salary? I think it is on the lower-side considering past employment with the company and the cost of living in Massachusetts.
2. How should I go about negotiating? I read the very informative salary post posted earlier today and have some ideas. However, I never have negotiated before. As an intern I was just like great, let's go!

Any advice would be great. Hopefully this offer deadline will speed up some other prospects I have for some more leverage."
2moeqb,8,2014-11-18,I don't feel I deserve the love people give me.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2moeqb/i_dont_feel_i_deserve_the_love_people_give_me/,"I've been dealing with depression and various levels of it for the past 7 years. There are times in which I have such a handle on it, it seems entirely manageable and nowhere near the forefront of my thoughts. However, days like today, it's crippling to the point in which I've spent the last 16 hours in bed, missing three of my classes, bawling my eyes out. I apologize for the wall of text that's probably going to ensue. 

Last night, upon celebrating the finishing of a big paper for one of my girlfriends classes, we decided to go to a bar for some drinks. I've been meaning to cut back on my drinking, as I've been getting extremely emotional when I do drink too much, but I kind of struggle to be able to put a cap on when I should stop drinking when I start. I don't puke, I don't get violent, but I get extremely emotional and kind of waterfall everything I'm feeling. This time was the fact that I've felt that I've squandered all these opportunities that I'm given. I blew off high school, pretty content with mediocrity (2.8 GPA). I'm currently at an okay university with a 3.0 GPA, but getting internships and jobs feels so much more difficult compared to those around me. While friends of mine are able to work jobs getting $17-$24 an hour (very good for a student, lots of my friends are at my DREAM university I had been denied from several times), I can't even seem to get a unpaid position. 

This lack of having money is somewhat of a difficult situation, and I know I have nobody to blame for my current situation than my own. However, I am currently studying abroad, and run out of my funds that I had saved up working as a waiter. My family is easily upper middle class (summer house, very comfortable home life). However, my stepfather has always pushed me to have financial accountability and make my own money. In order to pretty much get by, I've had to use my mom's credit card a couple times, which she allows for some things, but certainly not without permission and not for some of the things I've used it for. She hasn't said anything to me about it. But I am absolutely ashamed at the fact, and at this point I'm almost afraid to bring it up. It is a massive source of anxiety on top of the stress of already being in a completely different country. I'm to ashamed to admit to them that I've failed to have enough money to cover my expenses.

Couple the fact that I'm feeling that I'm having a lot of trouble with jobs and money, my stepfather has always pushed me to do better and try harder, but seeing as we've had a strained relationship (parents divorced when I was younger because of my father being an alcoholic), I never really listened to him while I was a kid. However, he his expectations and pressures for me to succeed in school, money and work is ingrained into my mind. I feel that financial and academic success is their key to happiness, and I know I'd be happy if I could get to where I feel that I've ""made it"", but having to borrow take money from my mom (without her permission) and feeling that I've failed academically and in the beginning of my professional life makes me feel like an absolute failure. 

My girlfriend is an absolute angel, she's there for me through absolutely everything. If it wasn't for her being abroad with me, I would be much more suicidal than I've been the past couple months. She's also dealing with serious depression as well while she's abroad with me. She is such an amazing partner, but at times I can't help but finding myself pushing her away, getting mad at her when she doesn't deserve it, and overall feeling like she is a complete better partner than I am. It makes me feel guilty when I realize that I'm doing it, and afterward I apologize for acting like a dick. I feel like I can't control this feeling inside of me that just has so much frustration and anger at her at times when it's completely unprovoked and unreasonable. I can't lose her. But I'm afraid whatever it is inside me will eventually push too far and too hard and I will. I hate myself for it, so much. 

I used to take Lorazepam for my panic attacks, but when they started to make me black out when I drank (even after waiting several days between taking them and drinking) and making me incredibly angry and frustrated at times, so I've stopped taking them. My doctor wants me to take SSRI's when I'm back which shouldn't conflict with alcohol or make me angry, but that can't be until mid-december when I'm back. There is a therapist at my school I can speak with, but it takes weeks to get an appointment. It's feeling like I can't do a lot about what I'm dealing with while I'm abroad, so it's just a waiting game until I get back home and can see my therapist there. 

I feel like a fucking loser. I've blown the opportunities I've been given in life. I'm having trouble with alcohol. I can't get an internship. I lie to my parents about how I'm doing with money. I can't love the people who love me more than anything. My mom, dad, stepdad, aunt (basically my second mom) and girlfriend do SO much for me, I feel so lucky to have a support system as there for me as they are. However, I feel like a burden, a failure, just a fucking piece of work who can't get my shit together and is just going to continue to ruin everything and every chance I get. "
2moi0g,1,2014-11-18,Feeling Alone in my relationship and keep looking at other guys...,detailsinthefabric_4,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2moi0g/feeling_alone_in_my_relationship_and_keep_looking/,"I'm in a real dilemma here, and I'm needing someone to talk to. I don't want a bullshit answer. I want honesty and something I need to hear!

Here's the situation. My boyfriend and I have been dating for three years. He is 20, and I am 19. We have a very good, fun best-friends-in-love type of relationship, a relationship most people would kill for. We are so in sync, open with each other, and just, in short, each other's puzzle piece. 

However, there are a few problems in my relationship that has been going on for years and years and never seem to get fixed. I believe it began after celebrating our first anniversary. I would often get these urges, not sexual or flirty, just kind of reckless... I would always talk to other guys as if I were single. It would go on for a few weeks and then I'd either fess up or purposefully mess up this little fling just to stop my awful behavior. There were times that he caught me, and he still stayed, and I am grateful for that. 

In January, when I got back from vacation (I was gone for two weeks...), I discovered he was sexting another girl. I was livid. Sure I talked to other guys sometimes, but I NEVER sent pictures or even so much let the conversation go that far... We ended up fighting for it for weeks and finally just let the situation go. After that, things were great. 

I did not talk to another guy for about six months after that. But as I became fully committed to him, I began to realize that he was beginning to be inconsistent, not keeping his word and basically throwing in the towel on the romance department. The notes, flowers, sweet good morning texts, and just the little things mainly, all halted to an abrupt stop. I'd get lonely, get the urges, and we'd fight over it like we always do. This has happened perhaps...ten times in the relationship. I notice he's not being consistent, so I call him out on it, then he promises to change and it's just a never ending circle.

He'll promise that he'll stop being so poor in his pursuit for me. I try to put it in perspective, but he doesn't get it. He thinks he does enough for me. I love him very much, but he does not keep his word....ever! He is always failing assignments and putting a lot of dumb priorities before his college classes. I am constantly having to remind him to do a test or an assignment or study. I hate being his mother... When I back off for a while, his grades start to drop, and he begins to lack in the romance department once again.

For a while, I was head over heels with him. We had a huge fight a month or two ago. He finally admitted he never truly got over the flirting I used to do. I argued that it was immature to not let go, as it happened almost three years ago. I always knew he was insecure, but after all this time, I finally realized he did not trust me, even though I was under the impression that I got his forgiveness. I hugged him and told him I understood after he said he was always scared of what was going to happen next in our relationship. I tried to put it in my perspective, but I was angry about his inability to truly forgive me after all this time. He swore he'd stop being so lazy and get his grades up (He had 3 F's on his midterms...), put school first, start treating me special again, and not make me feel so alone.

Things have been fine, honestly. He is always giving me compliments and telling me how great I am...and yet, I feel alone once again. I tried to take the initiative and give him a just-because gift and a sweet homemade invitation to go on a date instead of nagging him to bring that spark back, but it never seems to work. He told me to change my ""nagging"", my tendency to blow up rather than think things through, my stupid games when I argue, and my past infidelity. I have done all of that. Why can't he do it for me?

We talk about marriage and having children, but the more and more time we spend together, the less and less I see that happening. When he is around, we are inseparable. I love him very much, but the way he constantly fails to keep his word makes me very nervous and anxious. I feel alone a lot of the time. 

I am unemployed, and he is always nagging me to get a job. I live with my parents and go to school full-time and have a lot of internship offers. There's stipend pay and some are unpaid, but I always see them as fantastic opportunities. I took on the editorial position at a publishing company and have an internship lined up with the TV station WSRE. He's always complaining that internships aren't real jobs and I need a job and all this nonsense. Sometimes I wish he believed in me. It's not like I'm sitting here lazing around. I apply everywhere I can and call the employers as time goes on to show my interest. I've always supported him. He lost his job and his car in a flood all in one month. I always stood by his side and believed in him. I even helped him pay for his school fees even when I had a little under 200 dollars left in my bank account from my savings. He is very lazy and untidy. At a certain extent I can handle it, but his bedroom looks like a 14 year old boy lives in it. He never cleans it. There's dirt always in his bed and he never does his laundry...like ever. Sometimes he doesn't even wear underwear for days because he's too lazy to do his laundry. He always tells me he'll keep his hygiene, too. I am not picky, but honestly, would it hurt to tweeze your eyebrows or brush your teeth more often? He wears shorts and jeans with nasty stains and hole-covered shirts and has promised he'll buy himself some nice clothes with his paychecks. However, this never happens.


I want to be with him, but his failure to keep his promises has me uneasy. I find myself antsy and wanting the attention of other guys. I tried to talk to him, but he usually tells me ""I'm here babe, you don't have to feel alone."" I feel so guilty. He really truly does a lot for me. He is taking math class with me next semester because he knows I have trouble with math. He comes over a lot even when he lives all the way across town. He is my first long term boyfriend and someone I can picture myself with forever most of the time. Sometimes I have this urge to say goodbye and never look back...because his broken promises and failure to change his ways continue to break my heart. If he can't keep his word, how can I trust him to make me happy? 

This whole situation happens on and off. I stay because I believe things will get better. I've already had ""breaks"" with him where we don't talk. We even broke up and dated other people for a month or two last year. I thought if we had an experience of what it was like to be single, he'd realize what he needed to do to make things right. While I was dating, I realized I had a lot of things I needed to assess. I did. I stopped being so emotionally abusive and so easily-angered. I thought I really did a good job. Why is he failing to put his 100% in this relationship? I thought if I left, he'd finally realize what he needed to do. 

The bad part is, I feel guilty about expecting all of this. We're best friends. We laugh about the same things, like the same movies, music, and video-games, and have the same goals in life. I don't know why he thinks it's so hard to do all these wonderful things. I understand that the honeymoon phase fades, but is it too much to ask to be romanced once and a while? I do my part. I'm always writing him notes and giving him just-because gifts I make myself. I'm always reminding him how much he means to me. I only get sweet things from him when I'm feeling upset or I'm mad at him. He stops his behavior consistently and I do not know what to do to truly make him see that this constant on-and-off isn't right.

What would you do? I'm feeling lonely and crying about it. I'm wanting to leave and just never come back...but part of me is afraid I'm throwing something wonderful away. I'm also afraid I won't find a love like his again. Even if he is constantly on and off with me and plays these dumb games, I know when I'm in his arms, he truly loves me. Why is it so hard to change, then?

I'm really needing some advice. Much appreciated. BE BRUTALLY HONEST. "
2moiec,1,2014-11-18,I am insane. I want to be a clinical psychologist. Should I give up?,[deleted],AcademicPsychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/2moiec/i_am_insane_i_want_to_be_a_clinical_psychologist/,"*Note: This will be a wall of text... I'm sorry. This is also a bit of a vent. Also, I'm trying to not give too much information about myself because I know this is a tiny world.*

I am a 25 year old woman. I have bipolar disorder (type II-ish... it's a long story) with some sort of seasonal component, I am a binge eater, and I have extreme anxiety. I've had these problems from when I was about 10...if not earlier. I've seen a couple of therapists over the past eight years and one thought I almost met criteria for BPD (basically all of the emotional and self-control issues minus the volatile relationships and outbursts, and identity issues) but most of my therapists have vehemently believed that that diagnosis doesn't ring true (I really don't care either way as long as I get help... but I wanted to throw this out there in case it affects your advice). 

I want to say that I am actively trying to better myself. I no longer meet criteria for binge eating disorder, I've lost the first 30-ish pounds of my 180 pounds of excess weight since May and things don't seem to be going backwards for the first time in my life in that realm, I've taken my medication every day since last November, my episodes are not as severe as they were in the past, I have more self-control and awareness, I haven't been hospitalized in 4 years, etc. I'll admit that I screw up a lot and do self-sabatoge but I really am trying. Needless to say, I'm still pretty messed up at this point though. I was really, really mentally f*cked up during my undergrad years and I think I screwed up my CV (a year when I couldn't read when I started Lamictal, a hospitalization and a suicide attempt, two episodes a year, etc.). I did come out of my five year program with an MA though, so I guess it wasn't all that bad.

Academically, I don't look that bad. I have a near-perfect GPA and 90+ percentile general/subject GREs, about 3-4 years research experience with a few first-author posters, a couple of years experience as an adjunct, a couple of doctoral courses and a year of experience in a mental health setting as an intern. However, I'm not in a lab (don't even have a job... I'm too anxious to get out of bed and can't initiate contact with anyone other than my cat without initiating a panic attack), no prospects of a publication in the future, have burned bridges with two people in my department... one of those people was my most recent PI. I hate that these people liked me before I messed up by disappearing during my depressive episodes. What's more? I was rejected from becoming a volunteer at a suicide hotline (probably for my mental health issues...I didn't phrase it as I did here, but I did have to be honest because I could have potentially worked with patients). I don't look very competitive for full-time research positions and now I have a large gap on my CV. I know I've messed up here too.

I adjuncted for a while but that's a dead end for me in this point in my career. About three/four years ago I decided that I would never be a therapist because I'm too crazy and, so, I pushed myself into cog neuro. I have zero interest and even when I tried to like this stuff I would end up flirting with transitional work under experimental PIs and wishing I were with a clinical person... I applied to programs I had no interest in last year just to push myself to consider the future that terrified me so much. It was like pulling teeth. I couldn't bring myself to contact professors because I was embarrassed of myself. I did get an interview one of my nine schools. At one point I realized that the only interviews in the program (I had to talk to 8 people...can't say anything else without giving the program away) that made me want to not kill myself were the ones with clinical faculty. The only professor I actually want to work with there convinced me that I applied to the wrong program. The PI of the lab I was in at the time called my bluff and told me I was making a mistake (basically, having emotional issues won't make you a better neuroscientist... fix yourself and then do what actually interests you). I knew this. I was terrified that what I wanted the most is what I couldn't have.  

I basically don't want to regret going for what I really want. I have a few friends who did and are miserable; they can't finish their programs as a result. I don't want that. I'm also terrified that, I have so much work to do and given that I'm already older, I've screwed over my chances for good. 

I will probably never hold down a traditional academic career and I'm trying to come to terms with that. But to ask me to never see patients or engage in academic research in some way is killing me and I'm paralyzed now. I'm having trouble doing anything with my life and I'm miserable. Every time I pick up any journal article, etc. I feel incredibly guilty but that's the only thing that ultimately makes me happy. My favorite thing to read as a teen was ""Psych Science"" and have been in labs since I was 15/16. I'm scared to reach out to people because I'm scared I might fall off the face of the planet and burn another bridge because everything is now provoking anxiety in me. I'm having trouble doing anything other than hiding under the covers in my parents' house. It's affecting my daily functioning. Any advice for either getting on with this or getting over this goal? In your opinion, what should my next step be? One of my therapists told me that I should totally stop pursuing this another told me the other therapist was an idiot... I agree with both.

Program in the US for Computer Science for admission in Fall 2015. I'm particularly looking at programs with a strong focus in Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science or Computational Neuroscience.

* GPA: 3.5/4
* GRE: 334/340
* TOEFL: 115/120
* Work Experience: 3-month internships at a fairly large software development company and a small firm unrelated to the field.
* Research Experience: Projects in college related to Computer Vision and Machine Learning, a year with an independent UAV development team, currently working on some mobile applications using mining techniques etc. Pending university approval, I will spend my final semester working on my senior undergraduate thesis at a research lab in a major university in the US, which deals in Cognitive Science, Data Analysis, etc. and would certainly count as relevant research experience.
* Extracurriculars: A bit hazy but I've been a member of various student organizations like the university IEEE chapter, the college magazine editorial committee and so on.

What I'm enormously worried about, especially after reading this http://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/25gmig/a_somewhat_notgentle_guide_to_getting_into_grad/, is that some of my grades during my first 2 years at university are fairly terrible, e.g. B's in Calculus I and II, and most glaringly, a C in Linear Algebra. I have improved quite a bit in the last two years though, and I have straight A's in several core CS subjects I'm interested in, like Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, Theory of Computation, Analysis of Algorithms etc.

Considering all this, what are my chances of getting in grad school in the US? Do I completely forget about trying for any university ranked in the top 30 schools?

Throwaway because my friends reddit, pretty sure a certain friend will recognize it anyway so if you do don't mention it to him but feel free to add details you see relevant. 


I met the bf around May. At the time I was in an open relationship and he had a fwb with an ex. We talked and decided to make a go of things and broke it off with the other people. Problem was just a couple weeks later I would leave for a summer internship hundreds of miles away. I thought it was best to wait till I got back to become an official couple but he wanted to go ahead, I really liked him so I agreed. Told him if he was to sleep with anyone else that's fine, I just wanted to know.


Over the summer I was unhappy with the amount of communication. I wanted to Skype a few times a week (didn't have cell service). We talked he agreed to do better, said he was busy with work (which is true). About two weeks before I came back for school I said we should just hold off on things and talk when I return. I was fed up with the level of communication and tired of being the one to initiate all the time. Plus there were several times where he said he would call and never did.


I get back and we talk after a bit of awkwardness. Decide to give it another go. I asked if he had anything to tell me about what he might have done while i was gone, said he didn't sleep with anyone.


A few weeks ago, after about 2 months of the ""new"" dating period but really about 5-6 months of involvement I asked to check his phone because I always had a feeling something wasn't right and i just wanted to be reassured. He said sure. 


First thing I saw was a picture of his ex's pierced vagina. They've been having sex from July-August. We got back together officially end of August/September. He denied it up the point where he couldn't anymore then said it was only once. I called his ex the next morning and found out it was many times. 


He said the few weeks we were together in the beginning wasn't enough to have a LDR. I told him we talked about it and agreed to do it anyway. I know he's sorry. I know he regrets it. I love him and in the couple of weeks since I found out he's really stepped it up. I have permission to go through his phone anytime (I have once, I still don't like doing it). Deleted her contact info, said he wouldn't talk to her at all, and he hasn't really in a while, even before I found out. She would message him and he would ignore it. Reason he did it was because he got lonely and it was just sex like it's always been between them. He lied because he was scared and ashamed.


For some reason I just don't seem to have it in me to break up with him. He's never done anything like this before and I don't think he'll do it again. I know he has low self esteem and I found out the first time I talked to him about communication he thought I was trying to break up with him to be with someone else. I think he's also intimidated by the fact I'm graduating in December and he's a dropout. It's almost like I've had to convince him I actually do like him and want to be with him. It's like he feels I'm going to move on to bigger and better things at any moment. The whole summer is a mess.


I still love him. Should I let go of what happened over the summer since it was kinda of a gray area? If I only look at what has happened since I've been back and we've had time to really get to know each other it's been pretty great. 


Well that's most of it I think. He's had chances to lie to me since but he's been honest, communication has been better, everything has been better since. However the fact still remains, nothing can change what he did. I think I'm trying to decide if I should move forward or move on. Thank you for reading.

After we closed our call I was thinking of it and on Saturday I came to the conclusion that I am really convinced working for him. I then wrote him the following email:

Hello (Employer),

First of all thank you very much again for the nice chat we had.

Secondly, after a lot of thinking about the job at your company I came
to the point that I am tremendously interested in working for/with
you.

Is it possible to fix a date between the 10th and 20th of January for
a meet-up in (the city I would work).

Thank you very much and have a nice weekend,

Until now I didn't receive any reply. Do you think I did something wrong? And before I want to do the next move and call him or write him again I wanted to ask you for advice. At the phone interview he sounded really curious about working with me and I had a really good feeling that I did really good at the interview.

Long story story short, I have an onsite interview coming up (for an internship), and I wasn't exactly sure what to wear from my limited options. I know the place has a fairly loose dress code, however, this is still an interview, so the rule of thumb is generally to dress a little better than normal. My problem is most of my wardrobe is fairly polarized when it comes to formal-ness. As a result, my more ""casual"" option would be jeans and a polo (which I fear might be underdressing a bit for an interview), with the next step up being full biz-casual with dress pants, dress shoes, tucked in button-down (which I think might be a little too formal).

Does anyone have any input on which would be more appropriate?"

I have a Bachelor's of Science in BME with minors in Chem and Bio.

Just a brief introduction. I am currently a junior at a local state university--I don't think it's anything special on a national level, but it seems to have a good accounting program. I had a career that was going nowhere, so I decided to go back to school. I am set to graduate next Fall 2015 with a bachelors of accounting, and I will be CPA eligible at that time as well. I have a 3.94 accounting GPA. 

Since starting my accounting classes at the university, I have worked 2 seasons as a tax ""specialist"", interned with the state auditor's office for 6 months until I took an offer for an internship with the accounting department in the City I live in. I really enjoyed the tax work and the auditing work. It was very interesting and included lots of travel (with auditing) which I liked. I am not in love with governmental accounting, but it was a higher paying internship.

Anyways, like I said earlier, I am set to graduate next fall. I would like to get a high paying job to make this whole going back to school worth it. I am married and have a child. I thought that working as a CPA would have the higher salaries, but the more I read about it, the more I see that salary might not be great and you'll work long hours.  I don't know if I want that in my future--it would be different if I was single. 

My question is....where do I go from here? Should I pursue the CPA internship and get first hand experience in the field? I know a lot of recruiters have said that the work-life balance is manageable and only an issue during tax season, which I suppose I could handle. What are other high paying jobs in the field? I would like to prepare and network with the people I will eventually seek employment from...and I want to start early.

Please help. I keep going around and around in circles. I don't want to be unprepared once fall comes along and I need to find employment. "

2mpezo,3,2014-11-18,"Depression is back, feeling trapped and not sure what else to do",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2mpezo/depression_is_back_feeling_trapped_and_not_sure/,"Hey guys. So I've debated making a throwaway account for a while. I've had depression for a solid few years. I started uni in 2011 and I pretty much hated it from the get go. I'm not sure why but I stayed and kinda ruined myself over it. For the three years I was there I was on and off pills from the doctor. Everytime I would feel better I'd fall out of routine and stop taking them everyday, then at the end of the year I'd be behind on all my work feeling absolutely miserable, so I'd go back to the doctor and get help again. The last doctor I spoke to tried to get me to go to the counselor to speak with them but you needed to wait for an appointment by email and in the end I just didn't bother with it. The last doctor I had was really good actually, and I didn't feel embarrassed speaking to her or anything. I did mention that I think some of my depression may be a result of childhood sexual abuse, and she asked me to go to this sexual abuse clinic place but as it was in part of the city I'd never been to before, and it was a bit of a trek to get there, and I sort of didn't want to speak much about it either really. In the end University finished and I moved my stuff out and headed home, and I live two hours away so I doubt I'd see that doctor again. 

After Uni I got an internship at walt disney world, so moved over to america for 3 months ish. It was really fun but again I found things hard with uni work, I couldn't really enjoy it. I feel like this is the way I'm going to be with a lot of things in life. When I look back I want to kick myself because I was in an amazing position, in an amazing place but I just wasn't 100%. I feel like I'm going to be 40 years old looking at me at 20 years old wondering why I didn't want to get out of bed or do anything else and it hurts. I don't know if I'll ever change. 

I've been told by my family members that they think I'm bipolar. Looking at the symptoms and stuff online it seems to fit. I have periods where I'm depressed, feeling sick on the inside. and then I'll have times where I'm this loud, funny crazy person who's pretty obviously happy. and it's not faking I do genuinely feel happy at these times. I don't know how to go about looking into bipolar, or if this is even enough for me to be considered it or not. But I don't know. I know it's not normal to be this happy one day, and then feeling like this again the next. 

I came back from america and managed to get a graduate job pretty easily. I get up at 5am to be at work for 7am, and then I leave at 3 to be at home around 4pm. I do nothing but lay in my bed all night with my laptop until it's time to get up in the morning and do the same thing again. I do this monday-friday, and on the weekends I usually pack up some stuff and head over to my mums house. I don't particularly enjoy it more there but my friends live closer so it's easier for me to go and do stuff with them, and I know it makes me worse when I don't do that. I'm thinking of getting a car but spending my savings makes me feel uneasy. I feel like I'm not organised at all. I don't know how to fix that though because I'm just finding it hard to do anything at all once I get home from work. 


I want to go back to the doctors again but I'm in a weird position where I'd have to take time off work in the morning to go do it, and I'd have to talk to a new doctor who doesn't know anything. I'd have to explain everything all over again and it just seems hard right now. I want to talk to someone about possibly being bipolar too, but I don't know how to do that either. 

I'm hating work at the moment. I'm enjoying the people I'm with and they like me too, but I just can't handle the workload. We have to hit the targets every week and I know I'm not hitting them at all. I asked my manager if I could get more support for it, but I know the trainers who are giving me more support don't like me, and that's my fault too. I'm just feeling really stuck and trapped. I want to get another job but because of my shitty grades it's hard to do. No one wants to hire a graduate with a low grade even if you write that you had medical problems. I just don't know what else to do right now and I need an outside opinion please."
2mpnli,6,2014-11-18,Reflecting on the call that helped me get sober,ptag2010,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2mpnli/reflecting_on_the_call_that_helped_me_get_sober/,"It was nearing the end of September and I had returned from a trip to a state down south. I was at a conference with college friends of mine and by the third day I had decided to spend it in my room due to the hangover. Drinking in a half-hearted attempt to make myself feel better. I had a fair deal of work due the next week I had hanging over my head I kept convincing myself to tackle, but I was in no state to do so. On Sunday I woke up to go to the airport after being carried by two friends back to my room early the morning before. There was a photo of me lying on the floor in the doorway. My shorts that morning were soaked with piss. It wasn’t like any hangover I had ever experienced before, the end result of what was a five day bender of sorts. My lease changed over while I was away and I had no home to return to, only my life in boxes and a mattress on the floor of a friend’s basement. I had an entire online course to finish which my degree depended on, and a ten page essay and online exam to complete for another. I was supposed to return to my full time internship on Tuesday.

Monday evening came and I experienced an urge to vomit. First the food I had just ate, then it started turning red. Then all red. My friends later asked what was up, and when I admitted what had happened they demanded to rush me to the hospital. I denied it knowing what the impending phone call to my parents would mean. I went to bed for a few hours of terrible sleep, a sweaty mass, 15lbs overweight from the lifestyle, wrapped in my dirty tattered comforter on a mattress in a basement. I woke up and I decided I was too scared to go back to sleep and potentially asphyxiate, so I decided to go to the hospital. I was discharged soon after with the diagnosis of a minor tear in my esophagus.

I made the call to my dad the next morning and admitted everything I was trying wasn’t working and I needed help to begin a sober lifestyle. Three weeks later plans were made solid for me to go to rehab, one week later I was there. Today it has been two months and 18 days since I’ve had a drink. 

When I first wrote this post I meant to reflect on why I was questioning making that call. It admittedly creeps into my mind, why I didn’t just hit the bottle again to help myself sleep and calm my nerves so I could eek through my obligations (I ended up not just passing but doing well in both, by the way) and why I put myself through the financial and emotional experience. I guess some part of me still wants to have that part of my life back where answers were simple. But looking back on the sorry state of life I was living I am overcome with gratitude for my life now, where I’m not hungover during the day and laying awake terrified of my addiction when I can’t sleep. No two situations are alike but I hope if you are struggling you can find the courage to reach out for help."

I am contracted as the onsite IT guy at HostCo, a small bank branch of the large Financial Services branch of a HUGE German car company.

---

I've been battling this one for a few weeks now.

Our COO at HostCo contacted me via email about 4 weeks ago:

&gt; $User's mic is not working on his laptop. Did basic troubleshooting. Please advise.

I head over to $user's office to see what's up. It's an HP 8460p running Win7 Enterprise. Sure enough, the microphone isn't working at all, but the speakers work just fine. I plug in an external mic - no dice.

&gt;""Ok,"" I think, ""the input level could be muted somewhere?""

Open the Sound control panel and check the internal mic properties - full volume.

&gt;Driver issue?

Uninstall windows driver + reboot/reinstall driver from HP + reboot. Nothing.

As a last effort, I open the Sound control panel again and, while monitoring the input devices, plug in the external mic. It appears instantly, so I test it and - nothing. Levels check out, nothing is muted, but no input is being registered. I run this by one of my coworkers over IM, we conclude that it's going to be a warranty claim through HP.

HP gets the claim, and two days later, I get an email saying that it will be covered and that I should be getting a box the next day. Sweet. Three weeks pass by, so I call HP to see WTF is taking so long. Turns out that the box bound for my office was **crushed** by something at *their* warehouse. Awesome. An email would have been nice. 

I notify $user that his laptop will be covered and to expect to ship it out sometime next week. We set up a time convenient for him and start working out a loaner, since all of my crash pool devices are being used by some FDIC interns for a few weeks (gun-to-head finger motion).

Last Friday, I finally get a box from HP with return label and instructions on how to pack it properly, etc. Today, I'm finally able to secure a loaner, an HP 8460p identically-equipped to $user's. 

My plan was to simply swap out the hard drives, but I missed something crucial - Bitlocker. 

*facepalm* 

Thus began the long process of decrypting the hard drive (not difficult, just time-consuming). 

*I decided to do a bit of testing during the process, using my personal 8470p as the recipient of the loaner 8460p's previously-unencrypted HDD. Not surprisingly, it didn't play nice and was a massive headache overall.*

With $User's hard drive finally decrypted (250GB, nearly full) and removed, I nervously installed it into the loaner, closed the cover, and powered it up...

***Success!!***

I ran through a few processes to anticipate anything that might break, but so far it's working well. I shipped off the ""broken"" laptop and gave the fully-functioning loaner back to $user before lunch today, and so far no complaints.

I love Psychology and enjoy every single class I take, and I have been doing very well grades wise. However, I am not finding much interest in working in that field. 

For my internship required by the Psych department, I am working at a local half way house. I originally started doing standard intern-slave jobs until one of their computers took an arrow to the knee, and that's where they found out that I can fix computers. 

Since working on their computers and server two months ago, they have recently considered firing their old IT guy due to his abrasive demeanor and have talked about contracting me. This is the part where my story becomes relevant: I would much rather work in IT than Psychology, but I'm going to be graduating with the wrong degree. 

Do you guys think a second bachelor's in IT would be my best choice, or should I get a master's and learn the bachelor's along the way? I'm assuming that their contract wouldn't be a large sum of money, and I'd end up working part time doing something like Geeksquad. I'd much rather have a formal education and work doing full time IT work when the student loans come-a-knocking.

Edit: By the way, I am only two semesters away from graduating with my degree, my school doesn't offer IT and their CS department isn't adequate, and I am in a long term relationship, so changing my degree now might be a folly."

So here is the important advice part, I have been offered an internship at a growing Top 10 firm office for the spring of 2015, but I have also been offered a FT position at a local firm that is okay. While the top 10 offer is an internship, I enjoyed the office and the people more than I did with the local, plus the local is offering a low salary with what seems like a small growth career path.

In 2008 I graduated with a degree in history and about $30k in student debt. I spent the next 6 years making $10/hour as a veterinary assistant or waitressing and have paid down my debt to $18k (at 6.8% interest). Now I make about $28k/year as a full-time university administrator. I have no other debt, nor do I have any retirement savings. I do own a car with about $4k that I plan to sell soon. I have a $1500 emergency fund.

My quandary: Part of the reason I wanted to work at the university (besides benefits) was so that I could take a course as I worked. I was able to obtain a grant that paid for me to take the introductory course in the computer science department. The course has the sixth highest D/F/drop rate in the university, and I'm getting an A- in the course. I feel good about my growing skillset, I really love the field, and I would really like to take more classes. I am networking like crazy and have come up with a course plan to make me eligible for internships as soon possible (which would both improve my employability and help me pay for more classes). A single course is about $1500 (this a state college and ranks in the top 12 for CS programs nationally).   I have saved enough to take another course next semester, and by selling my car, I could take two additional courses. My hope is that this is an investment to better career opportunities down the road despite its high sticker price now. Again, the course I'm taking RIGHT NOW has been paid for by a grant. 

The department I work for is trying to secure a new position that I am the frontrunner for. I have been told that it could pay between $38-44k annually, and that it might be ready in April 2015. There is nothing set in paper, there is no guaranteed funding for the position yet either. All I know is that if the position can get funding, I am the default candidate for the position and it will probably pay within that range. There are a lot of politics in my department and this could easily never happen, but lately tangible steps have been made that have made this more of a reality. Ultimately it is uncertain though.

I was hoping to begin working part-time in January to take three courses, which would make me ineligible for the full-time time position above that may magically appear in April. I feel guilty potentially passing the position up, like I can't responsibly afford to pass up that kind of pay raise.

I spoke with my SO, whom I live with and have been with for three years. He works as a software engineer and makes good money. Our finances are not combined. I asked if our incomes were combined, and my income (or my lack thereof) actually affected him, what he would want me to do - focus on school and work part-time, or work full-time and make myself available for this potentially higher paying position. He said he would prefer I go to school full-time and not worry about my administrative dead-end jobs. He sees my academic commitment and networking efforts and thinks focusing on CS is a better long-term investment He would like to help pay for school, but I want to exhaust all resources and work part-time to avoid that as much as possible.

Thanks for reading. Any suggestions?

I am applying to major energy companies for internships next summer. I have the opportunity to add a minor to my Finance degree, so I figured either SCM or IS would be the best for job placement, specifically the value of programming and database management. I'm leaning towards IS cause of its versatility. For example, I feel IS could help me get a job in almost all finance settings while SCM may only be most applicable to energy positions. Any insight will be greatly appreciated."

My true passion has always been video games - I just always brushed it off as a pipedream that I could not make a career out of. Now that I did not get accepted to medical school in the first cycle, I've thought to myself: ""Hell, why not go for it?""

**So, my question(s) is(are):**

*what is the right direction to take to get into the video game industry?

*Computer science vs. Computer Engineering vs. ?

*What are courses I def need to take?

*Go for Master's?

*Internships?

**Maybe a little more detail about my situation would help:**

I have a Bachelor's of Science in BME with minors in Chem and Bio. I have taken a few courses dealing with computers and beginner coding (MatLab and a very small amount of C++), and a couple of courses dealing with CAD programs and models. In Senior Design, I was in charge of the computer models of our product and did stress and fracture testing etc. (not in great detail, but enough to get an A).

Assume money and time are not that restrictive. I'd like to think that courses I've already taken would help and/or count towards the computer field in some sense.

Please be as honest and open as possible, as any single response could greatly influence my future :)"

I am not sure what road to take in order to be most successful at doing that; my parents are from an industry where an M.S. means everything, but from what I've heard, this isn't the case in CS.

In terms of me: I am not a ""classroom learner"", am maintaining around a 3.0 GPA in my undergrad, and seem to succeed at my business classes more than my CS classes (more A's in business). I have done 3 internships and research, and pretty much disliked my research experience but really enjoyed my internship experience.

The less school, the better. However, I also like money- and would prefer to maximize it.

At this career fair I met the Ruby manager from ""The Company"". The Company was a small/startup software company not far from the school, at this time they were willing to hire any CS senior (my major and my year). I talked for a bit to the recruiter and then gave my resume as usual. A few weeks later I get an e-mail from the manager asking for an on-site interview for an internship position and we agree to make an interview in a few weeks. A week later, I see a new message in my school e-mail that was sent 30 minutes ago. It was the Android manager of The Company asking about hiring people onto his team. I was excited because I was much more interested in programming on Android than doing Ruby. I e-mailed the Android manager and CC'd the Ruby manager telling them about my current interview planned and asking about joining the Android team. I

 waited two weeks but didn't get a reply. So then it came time for the on-site interview. I met with the Ruby manager and he talked for a couple for minutes. I then mentioned e-mail I sent to him (he claimed that he never saw it) I expressed my interest in joining the Android. So he stepped out and brought the Android manager came into the room. I talked to him about the e-mail I sent (in which he also claimed that he never saw) and be basically told me that he filled up all of the Android positions on his team (despite contacting him about joining his team 30 minutes after he asked every CS undergrad about joining his team).  He walked out and the Ruby manager came back in, I asked if it was possible to still joining the Ruby team (before I mentioned the e-mail he was ready to add me to his team) but now he told me I needed to get more experience with Ruby before I can join. 

My heart sank and I felt like was going to puke when I heard that. I had almost the last half year trying to get a job for when I graduated (even though the The Company was only offering internships, they transition into full time). And at that moment I found an employer that was willing to hire me right there, I just had to try to get the job that I wanted. Because of that, I lost the best opportunity at starting my career. The fault is not all mine though, if either manager decided to look at their e-mails and responded to me, this situation could have been avoid and would of kept my mouth shut. But that didn't happen. 
 
Fast forward to today, I just saw a photo of one my friends who works at The Company. He's smiling with a bunch of my old classmates and even with my crush. I've graduated, unemployed despite my attempts with several other companies, sleeping on my mother's couch (another long, bad story), and just seriously hating my life.

TLDR: An employer who was about to hire me for a position when I asked about another position that I was genuinely interested in but was unaware that that position was filled me. So I was rejected from both positions. Thus losing the best chance at starting my career. "

I friend her on Facebook, we talk, I ask her out, she says yes, so I make plans for that Friday night. The date goes well, (except for the fact that we ate someplace else because the place I chose just happen to be the hottest place in town and was completely booked) She's fine with it, and we go for a nice walk after we eat and just talk. It was a good time. It didn't feel rushed, although she said she wanted to head home at one point because she was tired (It was only 9pm, but she said she only got 3 hours of sleep)

The thing is, the night before, we were talking on the phone and asked what my plans were, I said I was going to take her to a local music venue to watch some music, she then asks if tomorrow we could just get dinner, then the next week if we could both go to a concert because her friend was in a band, etc. I say yes, and I'm already excited because there's a second date when we haven't gone out once yet.

So I walk her back to her dorm, say I had fun, and mention next Friday. She said she has to see how her schedule is and such. I was to nervous to give her a goodbye hug/ kiss, and walk back to the subway. (in retrospect, I should have given her at least a hug)

I wait until Monday(last night) to text her and said that I had an awesome time and to let me know about Friday. I still haven't gotten a text back. How do I proceed?

I'm 20, and she's 18 or 19 (a freshmen in college, didn't ask her specific age) and really cute and we have a lot in common, so I really hope that I didn't blow it."

I look up to this community a lot and need some help. I searched the posts and the faq before this btw! :))

I really like programming. I’m a junior and I am just coming on to realizing this. I like debugging, trying again, making something practical and aesthetically pleasing. I especially like writing code to produce statistical summaries and to make decision-making under uncertainty. Luckily, I’m not bad at it either and am very willing to persist until something is done. 
So…that’s what I want: to be a data analyst. BUT I only have about a year to take as many classes through my school as I can. So please, please, tell me how this looks. 
The good thing is statistical analysis is key to my current major (economics) so I think I have a good chance. *Now, I honestly wish I had done CS and statistics but oh well, that’s life.*

Here's my plan for the upcoming semesters. I bolded everything goal-related:

Spring 2015:

1. **Structured Query Languages**
2. **Software Design**
3. Major class
4. **Internship** (involves front-end web development with CSS, html and javascript + a security clearance)

Summer 2015:

1. **Data Modeling and Design**
2. **Calculus 2**
3. **Java I (8 week session)**
4.**Java II (8 week session) **
5. **Part-time internship** (same internship as above)

Fall 2016:

1. Major class
2. Major class
3. **Statistics-based major class**
4. Health GenEd (ugh)
5. **CS: Discrete Structures**

Spring 2016:

1. Major Capstone
2. **Advanced statistics-based major class**
3. **Linear Algebra with Differential Equations**
4. **Applied Linear Regression**
5. **Either**: Algorithms and Data Structures, Computer Organization, Software Engineering, or Web-based Information Systems (Can I have insight on this? I was thinking Alg and Data Structures is most important class.)


Even though I am confident that I CAN do this, I still feel nervous about whether I’m doing the right thing or if the classes I plan to take are going to lead to where I want to go. I've gotten feedback from a statistics professor and economics professor I respect about this, and they say it's a go. 

**Tl;DR: I really want to be a data analyst, am I on the right track? Is there anything I'm missing? I understand that you learn as you go, but I want to make myself a competitive standout in the job market (if possible).**

But I have an IT degree that I haven't done anything with. You see, in the IT field, they don't care about your degrees. They care about your experience. I have one internship and that's it, but besides that and a cert and my Associate's in IT, I don't have what I really need to get a *really good job* in IT, which is a ton of programs that I can put on a resume and say, ""Hey, I can do this.""

I'm conflicted between two different sides. One side says to write, and write furiously, and to not worry about getting a ""decent job"" where I'll be living a normal life. It says to write more books instead of writing more code (or to begin writing code, as I haven't wrote code in years...). The other side says to get a decent job first where I can support myself *by* myself, and then worry about writing furiously. But what if that's never enough? What if I get that job and suddenly want a lambo and now I have to get a bigger, better job? When does it end?

I also witnessed a close friend come back from getting a Masters of Science from Carnegie Mellon then coming back to SoCal only to start off making just over $60k a year. He would have been better off staying on East Coast. Don't get me wrong,  I also know some people who got decent pay straight off the bat after graduation, but their few positions are dwarfed overwhelmingly by a flood of low paying equivalents. Statistically this discrepancy doesn't show up in the average salary data for the region, which is always reported a lot higher than what I observed from experience. I always thought this was the norm for the entire country until I took a job in Texas. Kids out of high school with no college degree made over $70k a year starting off. I know it's oil and gas so that high pay is artificially inflated, but why is an area with more high concentration of affluency like SoCal so stagnant on good-paying job creation in comparison? "
2mqk0a,1,2014-11-18,18 November 2014,journalthrowaway55,thisismydiary,https://www.reddit.com/r/thisismydiary/comments/2mqk0a/18_november_2014/,"I have decided to use a subreddit as my personal diary.  I need to talk, but the anxiety keeps me quiet arounds friends, family, and doctors.  This is better than talking to myself or saving it in a Word document. No one will connect me.  My roommates can't find this.

This is all going to be rambling and pathetic.  No one will want to read beyond this point.  Watching an angsty manchild wither before your very eyes can only be a pathetic display.

The medicine has plateaued.  Or maybe it has stopped working.  Right now I am sitting on my couch, watching basketball, in my boxers and a t-shirt.  Roommate on the other couch.  I have had a hidden pain inside me for the last few months.  Well, I guess I have always had it in me, but it emerged in a gruesome manner in August.

While the medicine is keeping me from being depressed, the illness has been replaced with an emotionless morbid fascination.  I am not sure if I am missing the way I felt before, but this feels awkward.  I said to myself that I wanted to lose everything about me because I am awful in every way, but being something is better than being nothing.  I guess that is my fear right now.  I am a shell for a soulless monster who can only read about horrible tales and dark  events.

Ever since the roommate mentioned her I have felt the old regrets sweep me over.  The pain of everything came rushing back.  The worst is when I see her in my dreams.  Knowing that it can never be the same gives me agony mixed with nostalgia.  I mock the 90s nostalgia pretty regularly, but looking back on 4 years ago when I was just a kid, everything was okay.

I read the message from her again.  January 2011.  She said she loved me.  Said I was amazing.  Now any thought of her makes me want to throw up.  If there is no other entry that mentions her, my life will be going better.

Childhood regrets are a constant burden.  An off-color joke I made in 8th grade still haunts me from time to time.  Hurr hurr AIDS.  I was a little shit.  Oh well, everyone was at that age.  I need to get over it.

Oh man, the hilarity of this being public is great.  Who would read this...What if someone recognized me?  Maybe it's possible.  If I knew more people.

How will I die any way other than suicide.  There always exists the chance that I have too much to drink and drive into a pole.  No, I wouldn't drive drunk.  Not that drunk, at least.  Maybe a home invasion will go wrong.  Maybe I am gunned down on accident.  Maybe I make a mistake at work and kill myself.  Hey, maybe I have a crazy stalker who will slaughter me.  Maybe I deserve it.

My suicidal thoughts are going away, but they'll be back.  I think right now I am in between failures.  When I see my grades, get a letter from the school about my academics, when a check bounces or I miss out on an internship or job.  I'll get depressed again.  If I somehow find a girl and get dumped.  It's going to happen someday.  Maybe I deserve it.

Okay I know I deserve it.  Why wouldn't I?  I am offering very little.  The problem now is that I realize this, but the medicine is keeping me from being depressed.  My emptiness has changed to a different kind of emptiness.  The real me has been exposed by this Lexapro, this Wellbutrin.  This is me.  I am barren husk of a human being, filled with anxiety and sorrow.  Overstuffed with pain and without the ability to really feel.

Oh man how do I say all of this without coming off this angsty.  Oh well.  This is me.  Is angst really that bad?  I try to not act like a know-it-all.  I don't know anything really.  I'm pretty fucking stupid actually.  Oh well.

I am meeting with my advisor tomorrow.  This is a step in the right direction.  Well I have a couple more holds before I can sign up for classes, but that isn't a big deal.  I'll get that out of the way.  The German homework?  Haha yeah right.  I'm going to fail that class.  Oh well.

I'm running out of steam for today.  I'll get back tomorrow.

Good night."

I know that it is **far** too early to say that my passion is to go to graduate school and get a masters degree. There are so many other ways that life can turn out, I might have my heart set on becoming a Geologist a week from now. 
        
                        
But like the title says, I want to put in the work now so that the door is open later.            
            
**Questions**      
           
1.) I hear that research is essential to get accepted (or am I confusing PhD programs and/or non-engineering programs?) Research is very widely available for Biology and Chem majors, but I've never heard of any research opportunities for Mechanical Engineers. How do I substitute this?        
        
Would internships and extensive extracurricular activity substitute?  
       
2.) My GPA is only a 3.3 at the moment.          
-3.5 Math GPA-                 
-3.5 Science GPA-                     
                   
 This is largely because I was a mediocre high-school student. For instance, I am competing against kids who've already taken Calculus in high school for my Math GPA. So while its brand new to me, they're just reviewing. I am saying this because I expect my spot on the grade distribution bell curve to go up once i'm past Calculus and its a level playing field.                      
I see myself growing very much. Every semester, I gain a bit more of a drive for academics. Its getting to the point to where I am hungry to take more difficult classes and learn what I can from them.  
         
With that last bit in mind, I am confident that I can get at least a 3.5 by the time that I graduate.          
Also something to consider, I am in a transfer program. So while i'm sure that grad school will be examining the entire GPA, if I work hard enough, i'll be able to put *kick ass GPA &gt;3.5 from Ga Tech*, as my graduating GPA resets upon transfer.   
      
So could I get into grad school with a 3.5? Not just can I get in, but can I get into a good one? Worst case scenario, could I do it with a 3.2? 
         
3.) Time to graduation.   
         
It may take me five years to graduate (first semester of pre-req, semester of optional classes), or even 5.5 if I study abroad! 
**Note that the .5 years studying abroad may end up allowing me to take up a research opportunity or internship**    
         
Do grad schools care about fast graduation? 
        

                   
If you were me, right now, what would you be doing? Would you even go to grad school? 

                          
*yes, I do know that the general consensus in Engineering is that Grad school isn't far better than a bachelors degree* "
2mqoec,31,2014-11-18,I graduated from college in May and started my dream job yesterday. Here's how I did it.,CptPoo,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2mqoec/i_graduated_from_college_in_may_and_started_my/,"As the title states, I graduated from college last May with my Master's degree and I've been applying to jobs and interviewing since January. Yesterday I started my dream job with one of the largest tech companies in the world earning a salary that is at the very top of what I wanted to earn. The last 10 months have been extremely challenging and frustrating; since January I've had over 30 interviews with more than 20 different companies. Out of that, I received three offers: two that offered me pitiful salaries (the same hourly wage I've made for the last two years) and the third was the job I started this week.

I learned a lot from browsing this subreddit, among other things, and I wanted to help others by laying out how I managed to get this job. It required a ton of persistence and hard work, but it's paid off in spades and anyone can do what I did if they just put in the effort.

1. **Get a degree.** A lot of people will try to convince you a college degree isn't worth it anymore. In a few instances this might be the case, but in general a degree forms a knowledge foundation that allows you to be more effective. Even a degree in the arts can give you knowledge that helps you be successful (my bachelors degree is in music, and it amazes me how much of it applies to the work I do in the tech industry). The key to getting a degree is to find a way to make it apply to the real world; colleges aren't very good at this so it comes down to your own motivation. It took me 4 years (out of 5 for my bachelor's) to figure this out, and I wish I had learned this sooner. A degree also greatly improves your chances of getting an interview; I know many of the interviews I got with recruiters happened only because I have an MS. A degree doesn't make you qualified for a job, but it does increase the likelihood that a recruiter will take a couple extra seconds to look over your resume while they are skimming through a hundred others. I will add one caveat, make sure there is a demand for a MS in your area of study before pursuing one.
2. **Become an expert in something specific and tangible.** You need to be able to separate yourself from the dozens of other people applying to the same jobs, and you can do this by spending time to learn as much as possible about a subject matter that is particularly important to you. I identified an area of the tech industry that is rapidly emerging and I spent hundreds of hours developing my understanding of it over the last two years. I did this primarily through starting my own news blog where I write articles daily about my particular expertise and over the last year and a half I've published nearly 1,000 short articles. Not only did this give me insight that few people have, but I now have a tangible asset I can show to any potential employers which demonstrates my understanding. 
3. **Never stop developing your technical skills.** This may not apply to everyone, but if you are looking to get a job or perhaps a better position than you are in now, it is vital to continually expand your technical skills. Spend time every single day improving your abilities, even if it is only for a few minutes. I spent numerous hours improving my technical writing, coding, and IT administration skills. Not everything is needed for my new job, but it all goes towards my overall understanding of the industry and makes me far more valuable to the company.
4. **Get experience by any means necessary.** I can't tell you the number of times I've been turned down from a job due to an unspecified “lack of experience” even though I've worked multiple part time jobs in the industry over the last 7 years (even three jobs at once). So I did exactly what I needed to: I got experience. I found non-profit organizations, citizen groups, friends, and whoever else needed my skills and I built up an expansive portfolio of work that I could show to potential employers. Over the summer I worked two unpaid internships: one that developed my technical skills, and another for a non-profit that is at the center of the industry I now work in (more on that later). 
5. **Build a brand.** When someone else thinks of you, they should think “hey, that's the person that knows a lot about [insert].” This goes right along with building an expertise and involves things like building an online presence, getting business cards, and identifying yourself as someone who does [x]. **Make yourself searchable.** I started using my middle name in all of my professional work because it allows people to do a Google search on me and find nearly two pages of results that are direct links to work I've done. In fact, I put “Google me” on the back of my business cards and I've had interviews with people who did exactly that after seeing some of my work on the web.
6. **Network network network.** I know, this sounds cliché, but for me it was the capstone in my job hunt. Remember that unpaid internship I did for a non-profit over the summer? It ended with me attending a major industry conference where I met my new boss. Since I spent so much time on the preceding five areas, I didn't even have to interview for this job because they could find everything they needed to know about me from my work scattered across the web and the mutual contacts we had. Everything else prepared me for the job, networking was what got me the job.

I won't lie, the job market sucks right now, especially for recent graduates. That doesn't mean you can't find a job doing what you love if you put in the time and effort. It won't be easy, but if you stick with it, things could end up working out exactly like they did for me. Feel free to ask me any questions about how I landed this job."

I'm really not that smart I get averageish grades with alot of hard work.

My first and only other real CSish job was doing web development where essentially I had a supervisor to help me out every step of they way.  However I wasn't really given any training or have anyone to show me the ropes for my current job and instead I was just put onto a small project with newly grads and another Coop student.

My manager and everyone else on my development team is located in another building in another city, we do have Instantly Messaging services and screen sharing services but it just doesn't feel enough for me as a way of communicating with my team.

They would often get together to work on problems together where as I am left alone to struggle with something I have never done (or even seen before) on my own.

And even when I ask for help, its never convenient and I often have to wait 90 mins for someone to give me a ""I don't know"". But I do make an effort to get all the help I can get. I really don't get many chances to communicate with my manager much either since hes a Project Manager working on various things, in another city. (Infact I have only seen him once after our interview) 

And during the last week we were getting close to our deadline but yet Im still struggling with my portion of the project. So I started taking work home and working on the weekends, working till 1 in the morning just experimenting and trying to figure out what is wrong with my code and the end still not making any progress.

Im not sure if its the situation that im put in thats giving me so much issues, or maybe its not the situation that in thats giving me so much trouble, maybe working from a remote location is very common in this field, maybe instead its my own incompetency.

What should I do? I want to better myself and learn more! and be able to do more! from this experience. But is this a warning that I am just not fit for this type of a job (maybe Im not adapting fast enough, maybe im not learning fast enough)?

Edit: Grammar!"
2mqupm,3,2014-11-19,"I am 19 and obsessed with escorts, femdom, pron and masturbation and it's ruining my life. How can I fix this?",IamDepresed,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2mqupm/i_am_19_and_obsessed_with_escorts_femdom_pron_and/,"I have been masturbating obsessively since I was 12. At first, it was just pictures of women. Then it turned into videos of girls dominating guys, mainly foot worship. Even more, now I'm obsessed with cuckolding videos.


At first, I would just watch these videos on my computer and masturbate. Then when I turned 18, I started seeing escorts. My first encounter with an escort involved me watching her have sex with her boyfriend (pimp) whilst she dominated and humiliated me. She spat on me, called me all sorts of names and made me eat her boyfriends cum. She also peed on me.


After the session, I felt so humiliated I thought I would never see an escort ever again. Not to mention it cost me upwards of $400 for only 20 mins. Although, I had paid for an hour, she kicked me out after only 20 mins.
Unfortunately, that was only the start. I have seen 20+ other escorts after this for similar scenarios. I feel humiliated, ugly and depressed. It's not that I particularly enjoy these fetishes. I feel as if I am too ugly and fucked up in the head to enjoy normal relationships. To add to this, I've never had a girlfriend.


After seeing all these femdom escorts, I thought maybe I should just try and have normal sex. I saw another escort who said I was cute. She was similar age to me and we had a great time. She even let me stay longer than normal because we had a ""connection"". In fact, we went out to get coffee after the session. I have never felt that way before. It was amazing to see that someone of her stature (she was a babe) found me attractive and enjoyed my company.


It was clear we could never have a relationship due to the circumstance in which we met. She ducked my calls and ignored me when I asked her if we could go on a normal date. I began feeling rejected, lonely and ugly once again. The cycle started all over again. I began seeing femdom escorts once again.


In total, I have spent $6000 in the past year just on escorts. It wouldn't be bad if I had a well paying job but the truth is that I am a university student. I pay for these bizarre fantasies using the money I earn during internships and student loans. Had I refrained from doing this, I would be graduating debt free.


In addition to me being broke, I am also on the verge of failing school. I constantly skip class, assignments and labs to indulge in my addiction. I went from being top of the class to barely passing. I'm at the best engineering school in my country. Just so you can understand the severity, I once skipped a midterm (worth 30%) to go see an escort in another city. I ended up getting a zero on it and my final mark was 65. Had I written the midterm, I would have managed to score a 90+ overall.


When my parents ask me about my marks, I tell them I studied but the test was just too hard. They think I'm always studying when in reality I'm just jerking off or seeing escorts


I tried to stop masturbating as well. The maximum I have gone is 4 days. I'm afraid I'm starting to lose my hair because of this as I started to notice some thinning on the side.


I'm at a total loss and I don't know what to do. This addiction is going to destroy me if I don't stop. I can't talk to any of my family member as a they are very religious and would shun me. Although I have some friends (more like associates), I can't share this with them as that would definitely ruin our friendship.


I figured it may be helpful to share my problem with the folks on reddit to see if they have any advice. I'll probably get banned for posting inappropriate material but I seriously need help. I'm depressed all the time and I hate my self. I'm a fucking loser.


I keep having suicidal thoughts as I feel unworthy of living in this world. At least With me gone, there will be one less fucked up loser in this world. However, every time I think about committing suicide, I end up not doing it because I'm too much of a pussy to hurt myself. 


It didn't always used to be this way. Although I was still watching femdom porn in high school, I was very athletic and what some may consider to be decently attractive. However, I have ruined all that and I'm sure I'll never be able to return to how I was. Unfortunately, their isn't a time machine or I would have used it a long time ago :(
Please help. I am on the brink of giving up on life. I'm not looking for pity as I damn well know this is all my fault. I just need a guiding hand.


I'm sorry for the rant. Believe me, I feel guilty for asking for help. I mean there are people in much more dire situations such as not having enough food or water or even drug addictions. And here I am bitching about my sex addiction. I feel like a filthy disgusting pig for having tcrying about my issues but it has really gotten out of my hand. I'm sorry, I just needed someone yo share this with. Too much crap on my chest right now."

2mr0ij,2,2014-11-19,(C) Mutki,ghtuy,LegendofKorraRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegendofKorraRP/comments/2mr0ij/c_mutki/,"Name: Mukti, but most people call him Mutt

Gender: Male

Age: 21

Element: Air

Occupation: Information broker, con artist, works part time at a curio shop, builds gliders for the students at Air Temple Island

Appearance: About 6 feet tall. He has dark brown hair that would go to just past his shoulders, but he either ties it back or sculpts it with gel. His eyes are a light-gray with flecks of brown, and he wears half-rim wire frame glasses. He's built rather slimly, and shirts tend to hang loose on him, but he can outrun a rabbithorse in a pinch.

Affiliates: 

* Three-eyed Tezu, a combustion bender who's in the center of a crime ring, known as the Night Hawkbats. Mutki is one of his top messengers and informers.

* Kano, a waterbender who owns a curio shop on the south side of Republic City that employs Mutki and Kano's 13-year-old son, Harrok. He mostly sells Water Tribe merch, but he has some rare Fire Nation antiques. Of course, if you know what questions to ask, he can set you up with something nice.

* Carika, his sister. She's two years older than he and lives with her fiance in a town an hour's drive north of the city.

* Yan. No one knows if it's his real name, but Yan is an earthbender, and a member of the Night Hawkbats. Yan often accompanies Mutki on his journeys through the city, offering ""gentle persuasion"" to gain information when Mutki's techniques fail. The two have gone from partners to close friends.

Bio: Mutki was born to the daughter of fire nation colonials, Xing, and Kanan, an earthbender and local blacksmith. He was born in the spring in Makapu village, the same where the fortuneteller Aunt Wu once resided. His father, Kanan, was in fact the son of Poi, the twin who could earthbend and helped divert the lava from the volcano when it erupted last.

He was born two years after his sister, a nonbender. He always felt closer to her than to his parents. His father wanted him to be an earthbender, continuing 5 generations of benders in his family before him. However, when he was around 10, his father realized that he wouldn't be an earthbender. Although the two had a good relationship, Mutki was never on the same page as his father when it came to many things.

His mother was always loving and supportive of both of her children, but saw Mutki as slightly odd. He was always climbing things, hopping around rooftops and trees, and never lacked an excuse to leave the ground.

As mentioned, Mutki left home when he was 16 years old. Deciding that his life had been merely a shadow of his father's, he left in search of something to give him purpose beyond helping out in his father's smithy.

He first went to Senlin, where he got caught up in a gang turf war. He was pulled in by the Fire Flakes, an exclusively firebender group, and forced to be an intern for an informant, Yi. He learned many things about the art of being a courier and messenger, as well as how to fight, and how to escape a fight if needed. Ironically, he used his knowledge of escapology to free himself from forced labor, and left Senlin when he was 17 to travel back north. 

He spent some time as a messenger between two villages on opposite sides of the Great Divide, and made a name for himself as being the fastest to cross the divide. He worked there for a few months, conning travelers as he went. Eventually, he landed a job working the books at an ostrich-horse racetrack in Xenfu, a village near the divide. He ""cooked the books"" to earn some extra coin, and it was around this time that he got the nickname ""Mutt"".

He was 18 when he left Xenfu, and with good reason. This was around the time of Harmonic Convergence, and a week or so later, he awoke one morning and sneezed. Thing is, his sneeze sent him through the ceiling of his apartment, and the one above his. He was a new airbender. He fled the city to avoid trouble, as he couldn't afford the repairs to the apartment complex. 

He made his way to Republic city over the next week or so, stopping in Makapu to catch up with his family. Surprisingly, his father eagerly welcomed him home, apologizing for the flaws in his parenting. The two talked for a long evening, and eventually put all their differences behind them. His dad was even excited about him being an airbender. ""There'd be no air without earth, and on the Earth we all need air, so that's alright in my book"", he had said.

His mother was still supportive of his endeavors, but she resented the fact that he hadn't written. She cooled off a bit when she was told of all her son's relocations, however.

And his sister seemed the least changed of all. They shared jokes and traded stories. She was currently romantically involved with a girl named Kushala, and although she seemed reticent to tell Mutki, he accepted her just the same as ever.

With their reunion over, Mutki left for Republic City. He wanted to go train at the Air Temple. He was a natural to begin with, but his style was based mostly on firebending, using it to extend his punches and kicks. 

Once he got to Republic City, he rented out a small apartment above a shop, called Kano's Polar Antiques. He met the proprietor of the shop, Kano, and was given a job working the shop. Kano's son, Harrok, works as well, and the three divide the shifts - Harrok works weekday mornings (his school meets in the afternoon), Mutki works afternoons (12 to 5), and Kano works weekend mornings. The shop is closed weekend evenings. 

Soon after, his sister and her girlfriend moved to Aigao, an hour north of the city by satomobile.

In his spare time, he went to Air Temple island to train with the other airbenders. He trained for a month, and after that, he built gliders for the other students, based on designs given to him by Tenzin.

This continued for about a year - building gliders and training in the morning, working in the afternoons. On weekends, he would usually just roam the city, exploring by glider or by foot. But his travels brought him to the Dragon Flats neighborhood late one evening. He got cornered by some Triads, but managed to fend them off with his airbending. Eventually some of the Hawkbats heard the scuffle and, siding with the airbender, won the fight. Thanking them for helping him out, one of the waterbenders gave him a card with the face of a hawkbat on the front. On the back there was the name of a restaurant, a name, and a sentence. ""You ever need anything"", he had said, ""that's how you get a hold of us."" They parted ways, and Mutki flew home.

Mutki eventually got involved with the Hawkbats, carrying messages and goods for them by glider across the city. As he got increasingly difficult assignments, he was given a partner to work with, Yan. Yan, being an earthbender, hated flying, even though Mutki had figured a way for both to ride his glider. So, they walked on most of their trips. The two, having grown up in villages not far from each other, quickly became close friends.

Mutki, now known by Mutt to all but Kano and those at the Air Temlple, found himself near the top of the Hawkbats and their allied gangs. He was a well known informant and courier in the city's underworld. He was, for a short time, the personal messenger for the Hawkbat's boss, a combustion bender called Three-Eyed Tezu, but soon bowed out of the position, knowing that he could be of more use elsewhere. His time spent at the temple also decreased. Although Tenzin himself wanted Mutt to go to one of the four Temples, he kindly refused. After all, who could build a glider like he could? He still does that on the side, but now most of his time is spent doing business for the Hawkbats in the City and its neighbors, and working for Kano."

Because of this, all I want to do is get higher than a goddamn kite. Honestly though, I think that's my problem. I've smoked solid for 5 years, met great people and had good times but through all that I feel I've just been in a haze. Memories slip, information is lost, and assignments are forgotten. Because of this I'm pushing 4 C's and an A in my second-to-last semester. That can't happen for my major. I've slept through too many classes and have pissed away responsibility. My parents feel I'm succeeding but I do not. I just feel lost and alone. I need a change. From what posts I'm reading, I feel breaking from weed will initiate change.

I'm a Swedish undergraduate student, and this spring I'm getting my degree in sound- and music production. Before that, however, I'm supposed to get an internship somewhere. Since I'm interested in moving to Berlin after I graduate, I thought it seemed fitting to get an internship there too, so I have some kind of head start. 

What I'm interested in is mostly production companies working with film and music production, but also smaller game studios and music studios. I've tried to do some googling with okay results, but I feel like there must be so many smaller businesses that don't show up on the google searches. This is where you come in.

I'd like some names on companies and studios that I can contact, and also some general advice about internships in Berlin if you have any.

Today it is all coming back to me, its 3 pm, I'm awake since noon and I can't leave bed. I mean, I did go to the toilet once and smoked half a cigarette, but except for that I'm stuck here. My flatmates are working for college, while I'm lying here, crying about my failures, loneliness and hating myself. I feel so hateful and sad that I just want to end it all, but I won't let myself because I made a promise. So that leaves me here, in a state where I might as well be dead, since I can't do anything. So anyways, I'm alive, I'm suffering, I can't talk to anyone about it, I lost my phone a day ago so I can't call family or psychologist, I'm too stuck here to search for my phone. My flatmates are probably sick of me whining all the time already, and they have work to do, so I can't bother them.

How? How can I survive like this? If I fail this semester, my life will fall to pieces, I have nothing anymore, no place at home I can return to, no parents to take me in, they made clear that I have to make it by myself, but I just can't anymore. My father will stop paying if I fail, and I can't work AND go to college, I can't even handle college without the added stress of a job.

I thought university would teach me a few things, raise my career ceiling and maybe give me a shot at the big 4.

I started my first semester like a blitzkrieg. I had enough savings to cover all of my expenses for over a year and a passion for the topic. I was not too happy about spending 4 more years in school, but I was there for the learnin', the earnin' and the opportunities.

By the end of the first semester, I was already about to drop out. I had not learned a single useful thing. I thought that the relevant stuff would come later and kept going. Fast forward 1.5 years later and I am even more bitter about the whole experience. 

The learning part simply isn't there. I've been disappointed by every remotely relevant class, and there haven't been that many. Most of them are all about outdated processes, verbose reports and busywork. There is very little room for useful information or experimentation.

The earning part? I can't tell. I'm passing tens of thousands of dollars worth of salary for a foot in the door I already have. Even if I make a solid $10k more a year with my degree, it'd take me about 20 years to cover the opportunity cost of spending 4 years in school. I don't even know if all that hard work will even give me an advantage.

Finally, there are the opportunities. The ones I get from school are worse that what I get through my website or LinkedIn. My internship salary is less than half of what I usually make. I liked to think my student status helped me secure my Nokia internship, but the interviewer told me they would have made an offer even if I applied as a full time software engineer.

I don't know what to think anymore. I have hated university from day one, but still worked to get good grades. However, I can't bring myself to study anymore because the whole ordeal seems pointless.

2mslur,64,2014-11-19,My 4 important lessons for young men and their 1st internship,vonscharton,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2mslur/my_4_important_lessons_for_young_men_and_their/,"-Shut Up-

You don't really know the differences between theory and practice yet. While it's likely true you're more intelligent than those around you in the office, you haven't learned the exceptions to all the rules you learned in school. 

Find an older guy that's been around the block. Ask him questions like this:

'I learned in school that x + y = z, but I've noticed that we don't do that here. And I've also read that we've had a lot of success because of it in article p and article q. Tell me more about how you came to that decision.'

Older, wiser men will always help out the young studs - as long as you're respectful and shut up.

-Take smart risks-

Do not shy away from risk. Embrace it, then mitigate the possible negative outcomes through your own diligence. Answer every possible question on your own before asking for help. 

If Google can provide an answer to an obvious question, DO NOT ask a co-worker.

If a co-worker can provide an answer to a question, DO NOT ask a superior. 

Your diligence should be unmatched. You'll be rewarded for it by being on the 'right side' of risk. Eventually, people will just think you're lucky.

-Work out-

Your internship will be stressful. You'll have all types of terrible stuff to eat and then you'll go drinking with colleagues. It's important to stay fit, or get fit. 

Do not let the stress of the position effect you. It's akin to crying in public. 

It's like sending a signal that you can't cut it. In investment banking these guys know the signal too well, so they do crazy stuff like find a gym during layovers at the airport.

You can handle this and you need to send the signal of 'competence' to everyone around you.

-Lose like a champion-

You will make so many mistakes. You will be embarrassed. You may be called into HR for something dumb you said. 

Lose like a winner.

If you made an honest error, address it like this:

'Interesting. I didn't catch that. Take me through it again. I don't want to make the same error twice.'

Then move on. Do not dwell on it. It's not that big of deal.

DO NOT let your errors paralyze you. #4 allows for #2.

I'd be interested in hearing from older TRP on this topic. If you're younger, please see #1

2msnxa,3,2014-11-19,26F Just recently started dating a guy after knowing him for almost 4 years and i need help,twiddlemyfiddle,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2msnxa/26f_just_recently_started_dating_a_guy_after/,"I need some kind of help or feedback or suggestions.
Basically what i want to ask is, is it ok to ask for another ""first date""? Just forgetting the past and getting to know each other as if we just met for the first time?

We first met when he was still in a relationship. I was introduced to him by a common friend because our common friend knew that i liked him. We got to know each other and he clearly stated that he was in a committed relationship already. It was fine by me because i wasnt really looking for anything at that time and our common friend was just a really crazy guy looking to hook up anyone together.

We chatted a lot and i got to know him, his life, and his SO. Eventually our conversations became more infrequent and kinda lost touch after a few months.

After over a year of initially knowing him, he contacts me again. We chat but not regularly because i was too busy with school and internship. During this time, i've learned that they broke up and he was too depressed about it. I was his irregular/infrequent confidant for about a year. Then he asked me out. (Wut?) I hesitated but finally gave in because he was persistent. Then after that i disappeared because i was again busy with my life. For about a year, he sometimes leaves messages on my phone or email. Sometimes i would reply but mostly i just leave it unanswered. Being in a relationship was not on the top of my priorities during those times.

About a month ago, i've finished all whats keeping me busy. I finally replied to one of his last messages and things escalated quickly. So here i am, being courted by this guy. I gave him a chance because why not? I made it clear that we need to take things slow and see how things would go. But i cant help hesistating to move things further because i already know about his past, his heartbreak, but i want to know him as a singular person without any attachments.

So... any tips? Suggestions? Anything?

**tl; dr:** knew a guy for 4 years before we started dating. I feel like i know too much and too little about him all at the same time. I just want a fresh start and know him as if we've never met before."

Hi Everyone. I stumbled across this feed the other day when , like  a million other times, the thought of quitting weed was tumbling around my mind. I’ve been smoking more or less every night for the past four or five years but never really saw it as a problem until my final year of art school when I had to dramatically reduce my intake to get work done. It was during this time that I had the realisation that 99% of my social anxiety, depressive tendencies, low motivation and general poor wellbeing were all down to smoking every night.  

After graduating from art school, life got sort of grim for me. It was the first time in my life since I was four years old that I had lived outwith some sort of educational institution. Furthermore, being an artist doesn’t have the usual career ladder attributed to most other professions (internship here then work experience there) so I literally felt miles away from anything without the faintest idea of what to start working towards. This affected my confidence and self esteem drastically. All of a sudden everything about my personality came into question and I turned to weed buffer the panic. Days turned into weeks indoors. Avoiding social situations. Eating unhealthily and generally taking poor care of myself became routine. I formed unhealthy friendships with those who would encourage and join me in smoking extensively. I basically became a shell of my former self. 

Two years on, I’ve had some success in beating my dependency on the substance, but find myself still struggling to kiss it goodbye forever. Part of this process involved seeking therapy. This did help dramatically but emphasis was placed on targeting the root causes of the problems, which demand much more considered and drawn out effort than simply throwing away my weed. I cant even begin to count how many times I’ve flushed my stash down the toilet telling myself it’s the last time.  The longest I quit was for two months, during which time I was amazingly productive and clear headed. I guess I fell off the wagon because I thought that I had changed and my attitude towards it had changed. That’s part of the reason I am writing this; to remind myself that this time, no matter how long I have quit for, returning to dabble is not an option.  I am quitting again because, despite some progress in my ‘career’, I have recently been rejected from a few opportunities that I invested a lot of time in applying for and got my hopes up about. I feel as though nothing is going my way and don’t really know what else to do. I have felt suicidal and contemplated that easy way out quite a lot in recent weeks. I know I could never actually do it because of what it would do to my family, but know that if the thoughts are there, something has to change. I literally feel like I’m at the bottom of everything, so there’s nothing left for it than to grab it by the balls stone cold sober. Perhaps its taken this, hitting bottom with no hope to motivate me towards fighting back. I just wanted to share this because stumbling upon this feed has crystallised a lot of the thoughts and feelings I’ve experienced over the past few years. I literally thought I was alone in my battle with this substance, considering all of my friends seem to be quite comfortable picking it up and dropping it off whenever they see fit. Now I don’t feel alone any more and I get motivation by reading all of your progress. If anybody would like some sort of quitting buddy I would be grateful. Otherwise keep doing what your doing, together we can turn a new page .

I have five main ideas, but I want to hear yours as well! I like it to be as realistic as possible:

1. You are a journalist, and the questions and topic gets a little naughty.

2. You are a fan who happens to meet me. Maybe on a beach / staying in rooms next to each other in a hotel / At a bar or club / At a fan meet up etc...

3. You are a teenager living with his parents. They decide to hire someone to help around the house, little did they know that she is a glamour model. You are a fan, and have jerked off to her countless times.

4. You work in the photography industry, but you aren't a photographer, e.g. Light guy, set up crew, intern, agent etc...

5. You are my lawyer (I'd love to hear your ideas for this scene, as I have never tried it out so I don't really have many ideas. Nothing to do with leaked nudes though!)

Any of these scenes can be fully-con, semi-con, or even non-con if you are interested, but it doesn't matter if you don't like that aspect.

I'd also like to create a threesome scene, so If you are interested in that pick two girls from the list!

Some kinks that I am interested in: Facial, blowjob, titfuck, public, clothed, groping, threesome. I also only roleplay in third person.

I'm always looking to roleplay so don't think that you can't message me a few hours after I posted this :)"

I've been lurking here for several weeks so far as I've become more serious about working in wine. I'm a senior at UC Davis studying managerial economics and have been interested in winemaking. I've taken the introduction course and will be taking a course on grape physiology and growth. 

I'm well aware of what the job entails (long hours and hard work), and I'm somewhat used to that type of work as I've worked on organic farms and at an agricultural research center. My intention is to get experience working and return to UC Davis to obtain a master's in viticulture and enology.

My question to you all is how should I start the job search for harvest interns? I've been thinking of just emailing many wineries in the area (Sonoma, Napa, Russian River, Lodi...) with cover letters and resumes. Is this too forward of an approach? Is it too early to start emailing now for jobs starting in August? Also, do you all think my approach to starting my career in wine will be successful (managerial economics B.S., working harvest for a year, going back to school for a master's)?


Thank you for your input!"

ETF gets money from installing vs. NEH getting card draws, so the two are broadly similar. And heck, no one digs trashed cards out of archives like HB."" It very quickly became apparent that the brilliant synergy of Dedicated Response Team and City Surveillance/Mid-Run Tagging was simply too costly in terms of influence for HB to pull off. However, you could accomplish something similar by replacing DRT and CS with Jinteki's newest asset: Hostile Infrastructure. Instead of having DRT hunt you down for running while tagged, HI blasts you for daring to trash corp cards (any corp cards, anywhere: not just assets and not just installed cards, but cards in R&amp;D or parasiting ice).  
  

I've created a deck to illustrate the core concept, and I've done pretty well with it on OCTGN. However, I want to calibrate everyone's expectations a bit and say that this deck is fun, and it's fairly capable, but I'm confident a better expression of this deck concept is out there.

Deck built on [NetrunnerDB](http://netrunnerdb.com).
***

HB can't ride the Astrotrain, so rather than attempt to go fast advance, I decided to go for a slower game with more work compression and taxation. In recognition of this slower pace, all the agendas are 2-pointers (so the runner can't win without stealing 4 of 'em) and 3 of 'em are **NAPD**s to further slow things down. Also, maximum **Jackson**s to let you bury early agendas when you aren't prepared to score or defend them.    
  

This deck rests on two cards, the first of which is **Hostile Infrastructure**. You absolutely want two of those out, if not all three. Once they're on the table, trashing your cards becomes a very painful action to take and most runners. Furthermore, trashing these cards is a very temporary victory since you'll just dig the card out of archives and reinstall it (getting a free credit along the way). Runners will eventually say, ""screw it"" and leave your cards untrashed. Now, unlike NEARPAD's DRT/Tagging combo, HI doesn't hunt the runner down and punish them. They have to elect to trash something to get damaged, so we need another card to bring the pain to them. This is where the other pillar of the deck, **Ash**, comes in.    
  

An Ash in a remote or protecting R&amp;D makes it so the runner can only access Ash. Normally a runner simply trashes Ash and runs the server again, but now trashing that Ash will cost you three net damage. **Hokusai Grid** combos beautifully off of Ash, making it so a server with [Tax Ice] -&gt; Ash + Hokusai + Agenda costs 2 clicks + 2x[Ice Tax] + 3 credits + 5 net damage to run... plus possibly another 4 credits if the agenda is NAPD. If **Enhanced Login Protocol** is up, then it'll cost them a 3rd click as well. Every other card in the deck is there to let you get to this state faster and more reliably.    
  

The ice is sparse but taxing. The single **Wotan** is meant to be the innermost ice of your scoring remote. Against a competent runner you will rarely, if ever, see **Architect**'s subs fire so he's mainly there to be an unavoidable tax, but this deck is well-equipped to capitalize on it if any subs do go off. You want a Hokusai Grid on R&amp;D to slow down the runner's digging.    
  

**Adonis** and **Pad** provide steady drip income. Combined with the money from your ID and the general inexpensiveness of your cards, you should have few money issues and be able to bounce back from denial attacks fairly quickly. **Executive Boot Camp** exists mainly to let you tutor your HIs since it's so vital that you reach the 2-3 rezzed critical mass. However, they are a nice form of drip economy in their own right AND if you reach a comfortable building up point then they let you tutor **Levy University**. Make no mistake, an unsupported LU is a terrible card. But runners are less enthused to trash it wherever they find it when it's gonna cost them a chunk of their deck. Getting it out allows you to spend a few turns digging the ice out of your deck and making your centrals and your scoring remote a real headache to run. It also solves the ""75% of my ice is in the bottom 20% of my deck"" problem.    
  

**ABT** should be considered a blank 3/2 unless you're desperate or have a Jackson ready to bail you out. **Vitruivius** is usually a blank 3/2 as well (nice because you can bluff 'em out Never Advance style), but if you have the option of over-advancing it, you'll certainly be able to put those tokens to good use. I've found this deck has a lot it wants to do in a turn, especially when a scoring window opens up, and a scored **Efficiency Committee** enables that. The extra click or two needed to Jackson-draw for the next agenda, revive a trashed Ash, and install 'em means EC tokens are always appreciated.     
  

**Green Level Clearance** makes your deck faster, which is good because this deck can be kinda slow. **Archived Memories** makes your archives a revolving door, and **Interns** is simply AM #4.    

***
**Playing the Deck**  

Mulligan unless you have 2x cheap ice, or 1x and a draw accelerator (GLC, Jackson). Early game is you icing HQ and R&amp;D then getting 2 or 3 HIs rezzed as fast as you can without letting the runner steal too many agendas. Mid game is you building up your economy and double- or triple-icing your centrals and scoring remote (possibly with the help of Levy). Late game is opening up scoring windows with a combination of No Advance baiting, net damage, and sheer taxation, then scoring your way to victory. This deck will only flatline very careless runners, but I have had a several end the game with an empty stack.    
  
  
***
**Honorable Mentions**  

*Snare*: You know what's worse than 3 net damage and a tag? 3 net damage and a tag from a card that you dare not trash, even for 0 credits. Trash that snare and suddenly it's 5 or 6 net damage instead. Have Jackson shuffle the snare(s) back into R&amp;D and suddenly your centrals become that much more dangerous to spelunk. I keep waffling between cutting 1x HI or 2x EBC to work in that one snare, but I'm currently leaning towards reliability over rare-but-devastating traps.    
  
  
*The Root/Eliza's Toybox*: With recursion and EBC, you can build a deck of tutoring up asset silver bullets. With the toybox, you could include more big, stompy bioroids to make your servers a nightmare to run (Heimdall 2.0, Janus 1.0), but it's slow and makes your already weak early game weaker. The Root is a fantastic asset and would be very much at home in this deck (it's basically a never-ending, superior-use Adonis) but there simply isn't the influence to spare.    
  
  
*Daily Business Show*: Clickless draw acceleration/agenda burying is lovely, and this deck likes low rez cost, high trash cost assets. I just found that these were competing with Jackson for influence, and Jackson is more useful early and late game (to help you bury or dig for agendas, respectively). Still, it's a close thing.    
  
  
*Encryption Protocol*: There were 3x of these in the early versions of this deck, but I found that once the HIs hit the table, assets go trashed rarely, if ever and their effect was minimal. Rather than adding more tax for the runner, I decided to cut 'em and include more economy/draw acceleration for the corp.    
  
  
*Alix T4LB07*: A fragile asset that the runner suddenly doesn't want to trash, that turns each click advancing your board position (and using your ID ability) into 2 credits. That sounds like an excellent fit, and I'm tempted to swap in one or two. Alix comes in a burst and I normally want a drip. It could be good sitting in the scoring remote during the mid game; if the runner leaves it then you're rich and if they don't then they're poor and missing some cards.    
  
  
*Eve Campaign*: Higher rez cost and slower pay off than Adonis makes it hard to find the space for. The higher trash cost isn't as important in this deck. Could replace Pads but I'm unsure if +5 credits after 8 turns is worth an immediate +3 rez cost.    
  
  
*Haas Arcology AI*: This would allow you to Fast Advance those 3/2s and No Advance the rest of your agendas. Really, it's a slightly worse, 0-influence SanSan but it could work. I'd be tempted to include a Isabel McGuire in the deck to allow me to bounce it (and Adonis/Eve) and reinstall when empty.    
  
  
*Blue Level Clearance/Hedge Fund*: More money and/or draw speed is nice. I found GLC hit the right balance and didn't have the deck space for more.    
  
  
*Diversified Portfolio*: I've had games where one of these would net me 12+ credits. However, it doesn't usually reach Hedge Fund levels of efficiency until the mid game and just about all of my cards are about covering for early game weakness instead of exploiting late game strength. Still, if you're less risk averse than I am, these would make a great replacement for GLC and/or Pad.    
  
  
*Reclamation Order*: In combination with AM, you can recur cards infinitely (step 1: play AMs 1-3, step 2: RO the AMs, step 3: play AMs 1 and 2, step 4: AM the RO, goto step 2 and repeat). Of course, that's way too slow, even though it would let you out-attrition a Netshielded Whizzard. The other use I had for it was to enable me to blaze through my EBCs. I used to have 3x EBCs in my deck and I'd use the first to tutor the second, the second to tutor the third, the third to tutor an asset I actually needed, and then I'd RO all three back into my hand. Now the assets in my deck were within easy reach. That frantic asset tutoring does work, but after I realized the silver bullet asset build wasn't the way to go, I swapped an  EBC for a third Jackson and cut the ROs entirely.    
  
***
**A Final Thought**  

This is a neat deck and with people cleverer than me improving and driving it, it could be a great deck. Just as this is similar to an NBN deck, you could do something like this in Jinteki or Weyland (especially RP and Blue Sun, respectively). But I feel like HB sits at the center of great economy, great ice, great recursion, and access to good tricks (ELP and Ash for work compression as well as a slew of fast advance options). Plus, you see a dozen NEH, RP, and BS decks in every thirteen games ya play, so doing something else is good for the meta, good for the game, and good for the soul."

I go to a small private University in Austin, Texas that is of course overshadowed by the University of Texas. Austin, being a up and coming technical hub, I know I should be able to get many offers from right here in my city. 

My question is that my school's career services is not that strong, and neither are our job fairs. We have the occasional big company like IBM, but not enough new and young tech companies which are everywhere in Austin.

I was able to receive the opportunity to intern at Freescale Semiconductors here in Austin this summer, which is a very competitive internship and high paying. I worked with many Electrical Engineers so was often outmatched, but I am learning a lot. I know having this internship on my resume should draw a lot of interest for me even though they see that I went to my small school.

Also, I do have quite a few connections through my parents friends at companies like IBM, Dell, Freescale, National Instruments, but none at the new up and coming tech companies. Personally I see my self at a tech company that is trying to make a name for itself and is young and appeals to this new generation of software engineers that are not ""nerds."" If that makes sense haha

Finally, my question is where should I start to get some of these positions? Glassdoor.com, indeed.com, linkedin job posts? Or is there something else I can do with some of these companies being in my city?

From humble beginnings in a small country town, to a law school scholarship, to a chair in the US Senate. You're an icon to career-focused women everywhere. You're outspoken on gender issues, you hold a chair at several senate committees related to women's issues. You have a staff team full of male employees, so you're used to men taking orders from you. Even your own husband has a tendency to buckle when confronting you.

But there's one man who doesn't buckle when facing. Quite the opposite, in fact. He's the most unlikely one, a fresh new intern at your office headquarters, so new that he's still tasked with fetching coffee for his seniors. He's so unremarkable that most people who pass through probably don't even notice him.

But he's the only one you will cave for. How many times have you let him fuck you after everyone else had gone home? How many nasty, demeaning names have you let him call you? You stopped giving blowjobs to your own husband after a while because it felt too demeaning, but you'll drop to your knees for him and swallow every last drop he gives you.

And he knows that no matter how many times you swear to yourself that last night was the last time, that it's simply too dangerous to your political career to have an affair with an intern, let alone one where you're so blatantly submissive, you'll be on your knees again.

2mtanb,4,2014-11-19,Realistic Chances of Getting in? MCAT Repeat Offender :(,AnesthesiologyHope,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/2mtanb/realistic_chances_of_getting_in_mcat_repeat/,"Hi,

So I've had a hell of a time considering a Medical Career but the scrub life keeps calling to me. I've been out of college now for about four months, and am currently finishing up two Master's Degrees and holding down a job. 

I'm hoping to apply to Medical School during the next cycle. I'm just going to list my specifics, and hopefully you all can give me a good gauge on whether or not I should expect an acceptance. 

Undergraduate: I majored in Biology, really enjoyed the Ecology/Evolution portion of it, and did considerable research in that field, and even published (in an unknown journal...but still!). I ended up becoming a TA for a professor I greatly admired, and she recommended I consider adding an education component to my degree. At the time, I thought it a great way to cushion my GPA, but it became a bigger cushion years down the line when I wasn't a good Medical Applicant, but still needed a job. Over the summer, I spent time earning my licensure and going through the internship training required to be a teacher in my state. I taught summer school, and am now a full fledged High School Teacher at the age of 22 (everyone makes fun of my age but all in good fun). 

Post-Bacc Work: Over the summer, I enrolled in a Master's of Education Program at a highly ranked University in my State, and concurrently starting taking Mathematics classes at my UG to go towards a Master's in Biostatistics. My EDU Master's in distance learning, with all classes taken at a satellite campus near my home. I took 6 credits over the summer, 15 next this semester, 15 the next semester, and then 6 next summer to finish off the degree. My biostat master's is a bit wonky....I really took it so I could be employed as a Graduate TA. I am a lecturer and teach 2 Stats courses at my Alma Mater, and get about 10K out of the deal...it keeps me busy! I took 2 stats courses this summer, and I plan on taking two next summer, but honestly, I'm not very optimistic that I will complete this degree before matriculating to Medical School hopefully next fall. PS, I go to a really small liberal arts Uni that no one has probably ever heard of.

GPA: So I'm not sure how this works. Upon Graduation, I'd earned a 3.70 cGPA, and a 3.60 sGPA. Now do I add my grad courses into the mix? So now my cGPA is 3.74, and my sGPA is 3.64? But apart from that, in every graduate course I've taken I've received an A, and am on course to receive a 4.00 this semester as well. During Undergrad, I got 3 C's that I found were a blemish on my record (Organic I Lecture, Organic II Lecture, and Anatomy &amp; Physiology II). So, I retook them at my local Community College and got A's in them just because I wanted to prove to myself that I could get my head around these subjects. During Undergrad, I wasn't as motivated a student as I wanted to be, and during my postbacc time, I've tried to over-exert myself in the hopes of proving to myself mainly that I am able to deal with academic and professional goals. 

MCAT: I took it three times, I know HORRENDOUS. First time was when I'd finished my pre-reqs at the end of sophomore year. Stupidly, I thought I was a great science student. I kid you not, I took the exam cold. I want to kill my younger self and all the losers I used to hang out for convincing me this was a good idea. I received a 23. The second time was at the end of Junior year, my intention was to study, but I ended up getting accepted to a 4-month program to study Khmer in Cambodia, so obviously, my studies were affected, and I scored a 28. I had the option of applying to DO Schools, but I really want to pursue Anesthesiology (the doctor that mentors me is one and I kind of just want to be like him lololol so sweet right?!). And I think having an MD would help make me available to a more competitive residency like Anesthesiology. So LAST MCAT. I took it at the end of Senior year after an intense 6 month long study binge. I got a 35, which I was really stoked about. Beat that monster, and subsequently burned all my books (should've sold them...damn Berkley Review books!!). 

EC's: Currently, I volunteer at an NHSC Clinic in DC, and work as an HIV Aids Counselor. I've shadowed extensively. Never been a scribe or anything. I wrote a book last year and published it through Amazon KDP, it sold pretty well around 1.5K copies (which might seem stupidly low to many, but like it got me a nice bit of change). I was also Editor of my Collegiate newspaper and president of Biology Club. 

Research: Published once in UG, published 1 paper in Education since starting, 1 more before the year lets out. I plan on applying to like 4 or 5 MD PHD's not very hopeful though lol




My Reasons for being scared: 1) My MCAT Monstrosity story 2) I really would love in-state. Like I almost NEED In-state. I live in Virginia. If not VA, I'd love to attend UMD but I feel those schools will really look down on me for retaking my MCAT so many times AND retaking pre-reqs at a CC.

Advice??

2mtds9,16,2014-11-19,Is Unitarian Universalism Right For Me?,RavenWing88,UUreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/UUreddit/comments/2mtds9/is_unitarian_universalism_right_for_me/,"As the title says, I have been wondering if Unitarian Universalism is right for me¬, and even my family. Should I really even look into it? I feel like I have explained this multiple times before, but it helps me get to the point I need. I do apologize for this being incredibly long.

I was raised in the Catholic Church, spent 10 years in Catholic school, and was an alter server for 4 years. My parents weren’t Catholic. My dad was baptized and raised in the Catholic Church, but that didn’t really mean much. I was really in Catholic school for the education. By the time I was in 8th grade, I wanted nothing to do with the church. My wife was brought up in a Christian &amp; Missionary Alliance church as well as a non-denominational church. My mother-in-law was a heavy “bible thumper” and one of those “of the devil” types when my wife was a child. Her grandparents, on multiple occasions, have called themselves “Jesus freaks”. My wife wanted nothing to do with God and religion by the time she got out of high school. 

A little over 3 years ago, my wife and I began attending my parent’s non-denominational church. We liked it there. It worked with parts of our belief system. Almost 2 years ago, I began pastoral studies for the church and became their youth pastor. As the year went on, I was really enjoying the work I was doing. However, I could tell that my wife was becoming uncomfortable. She just wasn’t giving me a reason as to why. I was also beginning to see that there were some things not right with the church. After a while, I developed a heart issue and needed to take a step back to get better. That didn’t go well with the elders and I left. A few months after leaving, my wife started searching for who we truly are and what we believe.
When I was younger, my grandfather lived with us. He was a very wise man. He was the one who paid for my tuition for school. The man had a very strong faith, but he never really seemed to attach himself to any form of religion or Christianity. The knowledge that he had of other faiths was amazing. His best friend, who happens to be my Godmother, always said that he was a man who didn’t need church because of how strong his faith was. I wanted to explore what he did. My wife joined with me. After speaking to individuals of other faiths and studying texts, we decided to give my wife’s former Christian and Missionary Alliance church a try. We have been attending for the past few months now with her grandparents. I can see that she still isn’t very comfortable, and neither am I. 

After some long conversation, and my wife explaining to me that I look at things with “Christian colored glasses”, she told me why she is not very comfortable. We have friends with many different faiths. Her closest friend is Wiccan. The two have been talking for years about Christianity and the Wiccan faith because they both share a great interest with the other. While my wife believes in some form of God and Christ, she identifies with the Wiccan faith more than Christianity. She considers herself more of a Christian Wiccan than Christian. As for myself, I have always questioned the idea that Jesus is God. The church that I was the pastor for taught that Jesus was the Son of God, but not God. Christian Deism in a way. I still believe that. She believes that. That belief is probably the biggest thing that made us connect to that church. I don’t believe that others should be persecuted for their color, creed, sexual orientation, and so on. Minus the color part, that was what the church began to do after a while. Unfortunately, that is something that too many Christian churches do.

Because of what we both believe, my wife’s uncle (a wonderful gay man who has dealt with a lot of religious BS) suggested we look at a UU church. We went to one service with him and his husband a few years ago. It was nice but we couldn’t get a real feel for it because it was something that was thrown together the night before. I did some research and found that there is a UU church 5 minutes from us. I have been in touch with the ministerial intern. She gave us a nice idea of what the church is like. We will attend a service next weekend. We are excited about it, but a little hesitant. We both miss the community of a church, as well as the spiritual connection. We want something that will be good for both of us together and separately. Her uncle told us that we might find that at a UU church. The other thing is that my wife and I are expecting our first child. We want to have some base of faith to raise the baby in, but we also want to teach the baby about the other faiths and guide the child in the direction of choosing what is best for them. I know that it is incredibly difficult to do that at a Christian church.

My issue is that all I've learned so far (for the most part) is software development. I'm afraid that if I take this position, which is essentially debug all the way from the hardware level through assembly and even into HLLs, that if I ever wanted to go back into software development in the future the Hiring managers might see ""Validation Engineer"" on my resume and go ""oh, he's not a software guy."" I've really enjoyed the ECE courses I've taken, and I feel I might enjoy working for this company, but I don't want to be locked into this sort of hardware-related position if I choose to move back into software dev in the future. As a side note, it will actually involve some software development, but it's just not in the job title.

2mtq6j,29,2014-11-19,HR complaint filed against me for an incident that happened 5 months ago?,Miz_zou,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2mtq6j/hr_complaint_filed_against_me_for_an_incident/,"Five months ago I went on a work retreat with my entire department. Though I'm not a big drinker,  I didn't realize how quickly the drinks went to my head, and I got drunk.  My intern was asking me stories about my time in college (I went to a big school), and I let slip some sordid details about, as the HR coordinator would later say, ""my conquests."" My bad. 

I was excruciatingly embarrassed the next day.  But when everyone made jokes about it and laughed in a friendly manner, I figured I wasn't as bad as I thought.  When the intern and I were alone, I apologized for having a few too many and asked her if I was inappropriate towards her.  She told me I wasn't, and if it made her uncomfortable she wouldn't accept a ride home.   We got in my car, drove home, and all was good. 

My intern left for the summer but would occasionally text me, FB message, etc, all in a friendly manner.  Nothing sexual. Nothing inappropriate.  Just stuff about movies, her finally turning 21,  and even jokes about my ""conquests"" in college. She more-often-than-not initiated contact. The point is, she clearly wasn't angry/uncomfortable at me, and if she was initiating contact, she wasn't just being nice.

I have all these texts and messages saved. 

She came back this fall, and worked for few weeks part-time (10 hours). We haven't really chatted at all since she's come back. But I figured no big deal.  She's part-time, I'm busy. 

Her last day is this Friday. Yesterday, she had an exit interview, in which she complained about my behavior this past June, reasoning that she wishes that I will ""not treat future interns like I did her."" I'm completely dumbfounded.

According to HR, they want to hire her as a full-time employee, and she's a favorite of the VP of Marketing (my department).  I feel like I'm going to be ostracized/black balled.  

What do I do?"

2mu734,2,2014-11-19,Orlando Radiographer,hopefulninja,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2mu734/orlando_radiographer/,"This is my story. I got my degree in April for x-ray (radiography), something that I completely fell in love with. During my internship, I looked forward to each and every shift. There was nothing that I loved more than taking care of sick people. I would spend my day getting coughed on, sneezed on, vomited on, bled on (for free since I was interning) and I did not care. I wanted to change people's perception of the health care system and made so many people happy. I felt like I was making a change - even if it was a small one.

There was one hospital in particular that really liked me. I thought for sure they would hire me. While my classmates were sweating the market come graduation time, I felt confident. I even thought I was going to be the first one from my class to get a job. Boy, was I wrong! I made contact several times with the hospital after graduation, but none of the replies I was getting seemed too optimistic. ""We're not really sure what's going on with our staffing right now"" or ""we'll get back to you, there's a lot of change happening at the moment."" So comforting. Then it was finally ""we hired someone else."" Awesome, thanks for wasting a month of my life leading me on, my fault for having all of my eggs in one basket though.

Months went by with no luck and my optimism started fading away. Applications I filled out for other hospitals would go from ""received"" to ""not selected"" within a matter of days but my classmates were doing just fine finding jobs. I was getting no calls back and no interviews. It started taking a huge toll on my sanity seeing everyone's posts on facebook about their new job. I started feeling like there was something wrong with me that was keeping me from getting a job.

Had one really good interview about 5 months after graduation and the interviewer told me I was hired. You can imagine how ecstatic I was. On my way home I called everyone to share the good news. ""I finally did it!"" I felt so relieved, I even went out that night and blew all my money. I didn't care. I had a job and my life was going to get better now. Hiring manager said she'd call me by the end of the week. She didn't. The next week I called her, ""oh we're really busy right now but I promise you'll hear back soon."" Then it was ""we hired one person but there's another opening for you, don't worry."" Then it was ""we're fully staffed and we never promised you a job."" WAIT, WHAT?! UMMM...YES YOU DID. But obviously there's no arguing with the hiring manager, right? They are apparently always correct. Clearly I was hallucinating when she told me I had gotten the job.

After that fiasco was when I started getting really upset. Everyone kept asking me about my new job and I had to explain what happened. I felt so defeated and still do. It's been over 7 months now and I have nothing to show for it. My best friend from school found a job and is constantly telling me about all of the stuff she does in her hospital. ""Today I was in surgery and it was gross!"" ""Today I was with the newborns and they are so cute!"" Wow, must be nice. I remember when I was in surgery as a student, it was so much fun. I remember how cute the newborns were when I was interning. I wish I could be you right now.

So here I am, working a minimum wage job that is slowly draining my sanity and my faith in humanity away. Living in my parent's house. Have close to $15,000 in student loans to pay back, and I've already asked the government if I can put them off longer; they don't mind, they'll just pile on the interest. Losing motivation. I'm normally an extremely optimistic person but these past few months have been such a rollercoaster and it's really done a number on my self-esteem. I feel worthless, to say the least. I check job boards every single day and make phone calls/visits as often as I can't seem to get anywhere with anyone. Sometimes I close my eyes and imagine the life I want; my own place, a cat to keep me company, having dinner parties, complaining about bills. I just want to feel like I am actually an adult but I honestly feel like I'm in still a high school student."

I recently took an internship at a wedding video company as an editor. This means that I'll be going through the footage of the day and compiling it into a 3, 6 or 12 minute video.

I was recently talking with a woman who told me that she HATED the 12 minute video she paid thousands of dollars for. She thought the video had too many posed, kind of unnatural shots, and when she views the video, she remembers how she felt awkward at the time, instead of feeling dreamy and in love as the shots are trying to represent. She made the interesting comment that these type of shots look good on a stranger, but when it's someone you know, you realize the whole thing is kind of fake. She would have preferred that the editor use more of the candid shots where smiles are real.

So I'm curious to hear what your experiences were. What did you enjoy or not enjoy about your video? How would you rate it? How did you think it was paced? Is there anything you wanted included that wasn't? What do you enjoy or not enjoy about others' videos?

And of course I'd like to see your videos.

Thanks. :D"

I thought I was stupid because I took all A.P classes in High School and ended up graduating Top 50 in my class, without every studying or opening a text-book.  So naturally I tried doing that freshman year.

I took a semester off to re-evaluate things and went to a smaller University near my home.  I taught myself how to study effectively and I cannot describe the feeling that overwhelmed me when I found out I had the highest grade on a pre-cal test for my professor (I originally took pre-cal freshman year and dropped out of it due to making 2 sub 40's).

I started craving that feeling to excel in every class.  I loved sitting at the front of class and when the professor had a question I would know the answer, or at least have the confidence to give one.

My GPA is near a 3.65 and I qualified into the honors program to get into a fast-track program for my masters (I'm about 2 1/2 years off) and have already begun writing my dissertation for my Ph.D that I want to obtain in Aero-space engineering.

I've landed an internship with highly notable companies the last two summers, and have earned enough to allow me to pay my way through school to not take out loans.

Trust me.  The first time trying to teach yourself to do the work and study is complete fucking shit.  Now I'm about to start taking Quantum level courses where originally I thought those type of classes were reserved for your 'geniuses'.

Don't wait for you to get a 'spark' of motivation because chances are it won't come and you'll continue to procrastinate.  Build a system for yourself and work at it.  Soon you'll realize how satisfying it is walking out of an exam with high confidence.  What it's like not pulling an all-nighter before an exam because you neglected to read the 3-4+ chapters and study the material.  So you get 8-10+ hours of sleep and go into class already knowing everything.

However, since I turned 21, it's hard to say no to going to the bar off campus. Lately when I've been drinking (which is about four nights a week) I've been going a little over the top. I'd say, two drinks too many every night. I obviously can't watch myself and how I act but I'm sure I sound sloppy and say stupid things. My friends and roommates haven't expressed concern to me about my drinking habits but I fear that is because they share them. 

I get anxiety when I can't remember everything that I said the night before. I never fully black out (I haven't since high school) but sometimes there are bits and pieces I don't remember. I'll probably have ten to twelve drinks on average over the course of the night when I'm drinking. Which is a lot.
 
I feel like the reason I'm drinking so much is the college atmosphere - roommates constantly drinking with me. During the summer when I was an intern, I had no problems drinking once or twice a week at most (only on weekends), and waking up and going to the gym and to work during the week. My head was more clear and my body felt healthy. I like to think that once I graduate in the Spring, I'll be able to go back to this routine without issue. 

I can say no to drinking when I'm sober, I guess my real concern is the amount that I'm drinking when I do drink. I have a hard time saying no to the next beer. And the one after that. And the one after that. I don't want to stop drinking, I just want to be able to moderate my drinking better. If I can't learn do that, however, I'll have to stop completely. 

Any advice for me? I feel like some of you had to have been here before. Thanks."

Anyway, about two years ago I was lucky enough to land an internship with a local firm who was implementing SAP.  I was on the Variant Configuration team, and at the time I didn't know what I was getting into.  After my three months as an intern, I was talked into staying at the company to work during the school year.

As I was on a team of only three other people so I was completely immersed in the VC environment.  I was building models independently, making my own changes, and working with SD, MM, and WM.  I was also shuffled around some other projects in the office and got my hands into ABAP.  After 2 years, I had a great toolbox of experience and I was ready to set out into the job market.

At the end of this summer, I was informed that my internship will be ending since the project has stabilized.  I did find another job in Configuration shortly after my position had ended.  I am now working for a company that is implementing a Cincom GURU configuration system.  

Over the last few months, I have been searching up and down for other SAP VC positions and it seems like they are so rare to come by.  Every time I do see one, the company is asking for something like 5-10 years of experience.  

Does anyone have any tips or information that would help me dive back into SAP?  I am graduating from my university this December, and am on the hunt for jobs.  "
2mvvvm,25,2014-11-20,My mother prohibited me to know my father my whole life...,thariq,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2mvvvm/my_mother_prohibited_me_to_know_my_father_my/,"|Beware: Wall of text below. Basically the story of my life. Don't know how to make a tl;dr for that.|

Hello, guys,

So that's my story: my fathers were married for some years, but their relationship has always been shit (it sure had good times, them both said that), and soon after I was born, they divorced. They used to fight a lot, because my mother has always been an annoying person to live with, always wanting things her way, starting fights by no reason (my father said that she'd put notes in his pants with other girls names just for the sake of raging at him, like wtf). My father had his share in the failing of the marriage as he was cocaine addicted and, as my mother, had lot's of traumas and such. After that, my father went away for some years to recover. He traveled to another state, asked his family to intern him in rehab, and tried to start a new life. In the meantime, my mother and grandmother took care of me, but my father's family always helped. 

THE PROBLEM STARTED when he came back from rehab and tried to approach me. Whenever he tried to visit me my mother would flee. She'd go out at the times the judge established he could visit me. She would travel to another city, go out shopping, anything so he couldn't see me. All the while telling me the most horrendous things about him, effectively trying to portrait him as a monster. This happened year after year, and every time my father would try to talk to her about it, she would ask for money. Only after that he would be allowed to see me. My father didn't accept it, and later told me that he wouldn't give her money so he could buy me and do as she wanted. I tell you, I suffered heavily by not having a dad, specially in my childhood. And worst of all, had to keep under my mother's abusive treatment all by myself for my whole life. And so this happened:

Lot's of things happened after my mother divorced the second time (I was about 15 or 16 years old) and I got to know my father. It was a really weird meeting, I didn't know what to think, was pretty confused and can't tell you if I enjoyed it or not, despite the fact that knowing my father was something I wanted subconsciously. My mother found out that it had happened, and when I told her about it, she freaked out. Started swearing me, telling me how I was involved in a plan to drive her crazy, that I was a cynical person, that I was manipulative and selfish. I don't recall being so abused in all my life. She offended my grandmother, my aunt who always supported me and whom I really love, and then, she obliged me to go to my graduation ceremonial, as it all happened in high school prom. That was a really sad moment in my life. After that, I couldn't cope with all the shit that was happening just because of her disagreement of me seeing my father, so I decided to let go, and lost contact with him, once again.

I didn't confront her. I couldn't. I had to bear it since I was a child and I couldn't do anything but accept it and try not to listen most of the rambling speech she was always giving about my father and my step father and other people that despised her.

I started treating myself with a therapist, and then things started to change, little by little, until I got to this point I'm now. I started fighting my mother back. Actually, I got really aggressive towards her every time she wanted fight because I did something she didn't want me to do, when she didn't respect my privacy (something very common), wanted to tell me how should I live my life thinking she knew all my needs.

Eventually, I started talking to my father again. I was very skeptical at first, as I knew he had that problems with drugs, but mostly because of the things my mother told me about him. I started to know him more, I finally knew my two little brothers (14 and 4 years old) and, the most beautiful thing is that they knew who I was, they knew I was their brother and treated me as their brother. I was so happy! I've been keeping in touch with him for the last 6 months or so, and now he's moved to USA and invited me to live with him there (We're from Brazil). I'm reeeally excited with this idea, and that is my plan for next year. I'll finally have the chance to enjoy his company, learn those things a father can teach to his son, and I think he really loves me, by not forgetting me after so many years and by the way our relationship is going. 

My mother knows nothing about it, but I'm pretty sure that she'll blow like a volcano when I tell her. I'm little bit afraid of what can happen when I tell her this, not because I might not be prepared to defend my right to see my father and do what I want, but because I might lose contact with her indefinitely. 

Thoughts? =p"
2mvzpw,1,2014-11-20,Research or software engineering internship for summer after second year undergrad?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2mvzpw/research_or_software_engineering_internship_for/,"Hey,

So I currently have a research project in a field that I'm quite interested in (AI-related) at my university, which is relatively highly ranked for computer science in general. This is something I could take into the summer (potentially for credit but at least for the experience). I'm also applying to summer software engineering internships and have a second-round interview in a few weeks, but I haven't been faring especially well with other companies so far. I haven't taken a Data Structures and Algorithms course yet (will be taking it next semester) and while I've been trying to self-study much of the material, I still don't have a solid grasp of some of the concepts that interview questions cover. Over the next 1-2 semesters I'm confident that I can put in a good amount of time to go over algorithms books and coding interview books, but for this summer's recruiting period would working further on my research project be an acceptable alternative to an internship with a firm?

I don't feel obliged to get an internship simply because some of my peers are, and I'm interested in industry research in the long-term (IBM and the like), but I also don't want to hinder my career because of a decision to forgo interning for a summer.

Any advice would be helpful!"

We've known each other for about 4 months and didn't really start ""dating"" until 3 months. We hit it off on our first date, but we didn't start seeing each other that often until a few weeks in. From there, we basically saw each other everyday. At the point when we started dating, he wasn't sure of his whereabouts. He was in between staying on the west coast or moving back to the east coast. I finish school in December and moving back home as well (on the west coast).

I guess we both knew there was going to be an expiration date, but it just came up so fast. Last night, he told me that he realized that there was no reason why we were ending other than the distance and lack of stability. I couldn't guarantee him my whereabouts following December and he couldn't guarantee me anything either. We had plans to travel around together, but I most likely will be taking on an internship abroad instead of purely traveling. He told me that's awesome, but he doesn't really have the qualifications to do the same thing and he can't just be following me for the hell of it.

At the end of the discussion, he basically told me that no matter what he wanted to stay friends. I told him I couldn't just be friends and unless there was a timeline of getting back together, I can't just be kept on the hook as ""friends"". He just kept urging for me to keep in contact because our situation may change or he may move back.

I have no idea what to do. Everything is so uncertain. I cried my eyes out when he left my place this morning. I'm not sure if it's better to entirely cut ties and let everything go, or try to make it work.

I am so confused."

2mx05v,12,2014-11-20,I don't deserve to feel this way.,Mettalics,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2mx05v/i_dont_deserve_to_feel_this_way/,"I don't deserve to be depressed. I've never been abused, been in a bad relationship, lost a loved one, gone through financial hardship, or experienced any sort of traumatic event. I've been very fortunate, and I look at many people's stories and I feel guilty for my sadness.

Not only has my life been free of hardship, but it has also been full of blessings. 21 years in and I've led a privileged life. My family lives comfortably, I had a wonderful childhood, I go to an excellent university, and I've got an internship lined up at one of the most prestigious firms in the country. Why am I sad? In some ways I want disaster to strike me, if only to justify what I feel.

In my case, it's all about appearance. Ever since I was a little kid people always used to tell me I was self-motivated. Now I realize that they couldn't have been further from the truth. It is not I that motivated me, it was everybody else. I wanted to please my parents, my teachers, my friends. In everything that I did and do, I give my best effort to make people happy. I was, and still am, the ""golden boy"" who never gets into trouble and does well in school. It is why I go to this university and why I have a great job to look forward to. My self-worth lies entirely in the approval of other people and I continually find that I can't make everybody happy. I'm not naive. I know that I can't please everyone, but that doesn't make it hurt any less when I fail.

And boy have I failed, particularly in my relationships with other people. In my efforts to please others, I focused mostly upon my parents and teachers. Friends came last, though that's not to say I didn't have friends. But as we grew up, people began to drink, do drugs, and I only became more timid out of fear of being judged. I engaged with friends at school, but rarely beyond that. Thus, I threw myself into my studies, intent on finding worth in achievement that others would recognize. I even ended up quitting sports to focus on academics. My biggest failure, however, has been how this has affected my relationships with women. I have never even kissed girl, much less had a girlfriend. And that, Reddit, is my biggest regret of all. I have loved a few girls in my life, but my fear of rejection, timidity, and serious attitude have prevented me from obtaining the one thing my attempts to please others have been trying to grasp. Love. 

So can you see where I am? I have climbed so high up this tower and I am desperately lonely up there. I am terrified of falling off, and yet falling would relieve the pressure I've been feeling for years. Either way, I don't feel like I can stay where I am much longer. For all its merits, I don't like my school that much, I'm not sure what I want to do with my life, and most of all, I lack the love I need to continue moving forward.

I apologize sincerely to anyone whom I may have offended with my story. There are so many of you out there that struggle for more serious reasons and I know that I don't deserve to feel this way. I realize that my story is different from most, but if there is anyone out there who can relate, this is my advice: Live for others because that is what makes life worth living, but don't do it at the expense of your own well-being. If you don't take care of yourself, you won't be able to love yourself or anybody else. And if you don't love yourself, you begin to lose yourself.

I'm very excited to have received an offer for my first internship ever. It feels great that someone has recognized some potential in me, and I really want to get the most out of this experience. To both make sure that I learn the most I can, and to make sure that I am a positive asset for the company when I'm there.

During my 3 month stint I will be focussing on backend web development in Scala, which is a language I'm loving to learn, and the Play framework - which is also great.

I was wondering if there are any people here who have done internships, especially at smaller companies,  that could offer some advice. General tips on integrating into a small team? Not stepping on anyone toes. Things like that.

Thanks guys.

P.S: I have to say that without this community and /r/learnprogramming then I sincerely believe I would not have this internship. The amount of good advice on here, and nice people willing to help made the biggest impact on my (short!) professional life so far.

2mxngm,2,2014-11-20,Am I being strung along with this internship?,[deleted],Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/2mxngm/am_i_being_strung_along_with_this_internship/,"Hello everyone, I was wondering if you fine folks could help me to figure out if I am actually going to be hired or not at this alternative local bi-monthly free newspaper for a paid internship.


First off, I thought I had the position immediately after my interview because the EIC asked me to write an 800 word game review, and some short music briefs from press releases, and that we would talk about pay and starting hours the week after I turn in the writing asked of me.

Well that did not happen, and instead the editor said he would like me to be mentored by someone else who does not work at the paper, but has yet to get a hold of that person or give me contact information, and when he let me know about this he specifically referred to me as a “potential intern,” meaning that I think they were not that impressed with my writing. But he also said that my review was well written. 
And they did not print anything that I had written either; not that it was expected, but had almost seemed implied, as they asked me to specifically get everything done by their deadline within three days of my interview, which I did to the best of my abilities in the time allotted. 

I can do a lot more than just reviews and briefs, but they didn't ask me to do anything else, and the editor has been vague at best if they plan to hire me or not. I finally asked him if he would like me to come to the office to speak to him about the starting hours we had discussed and all he said was that they had a deadline, which I believe means that I was bugging and not to ask until after they printed their issue, but it’s been days since then, and I just do not know what to do now. 

I do not have a degree in the field of journalism, and the only experience I have is running a community college paper that I was at for two years (with three impeccable recommendation letters derived from that), but I will have an Associate of Arts in English by the summer, and I do plan to move on to getting a Bachelor degree in journalism eventually. I know that not having much experience or a degree in the field is hurting my chances, but I just do not understand why I was told I would start the next week, and then went to a non-existent mentorship, to wondering if they are going to hire me at all at this point. 

It has now been two full weeks since my interview, and frankly it is torture not knowing if I am going to work there or not, especially since I can barely pay my rent right now, and I have been waiting on finding something else in hopes that this will work out. This is essentially my dream job right now, and could use any help or advice in this situation, as I have no idea what to do from here. 

Also, I have a few questions as well, such as:
Does this kind of thing happen a lot? 

What should I do in order to show that I am willing to go above and beyond to get this position?

What would you do if you were in my situation? 

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

I had a pretty awful bout of Crohn's disease throughout it, and dealing with the constant pain along with a dirt stache and no style to speak of, didn't do anything for my self confidence. I had 1 Long Term Relationship with my ex from senior year of high school for about 4-5 years total. We did split a couple times, and I did find another girlfriend for about a month during that span, but it was relatively uneventful. I never attended college on campus, so I never got that have that 'experimental' phase. Earlier this year, I had a procedure to aid my pain and ever since I've just been feeling much more confident than I've ever felt. Soooo, I plunged into the dating scene.

**Prior to Date** - I had seen the [21/f] (we'll call her Amanda) a few times working the counter at this place where I get lunch. She wasn't there that often -- at least when I went -- but from the first time we met, she was very talkative with me. Having been previously burned by the girl working at a coffee shop I frequent (no pun intended), I chalked this up to her just being nice since I'm the customer and it's just her at her job. But the times where she happened to be working and  happened to stop in, she just seemed to be talking to me a lot more than the other customers...

After the fourth time running in to her, I asked her out. She said 'sure', but wanted me to give her my number. I assume she gets some creeps, and didn't want her number floating around, so I obliged. 2 days later (and about 20 days ago if we are establishing a timeline), she texts me ""heyy it's Amanda"". We chat back and forth, and I find out some things like how's she's doing full-time college, nearly 40 hrs at her job, and an internship. She sounded busy, but we still were texting and sending pictures back and forth a lot.

As our conversation unfolds for a few days, she makes it readily apparent on more than one occasion she thinks I'm very attractive to her. Complements I've honestly never had said to me by any women before. I don't even want to write what she said cause she was laying it on **so thick**, it would definitely seem unbelievable. I had asked her when we could go on the date every other day since we started talking, but she was always busy. Finally, after about 11 days, we go on the date.

**Date** The day of, I made a bad mistake of barely eating anything. I was running on 2 pieces of bread and 2 cups of coffee since 8AM. I was picking her up around 7PM. I got there, and she was visibly excited/nervous, which I found not only cute but reassuring as well. Boosting my confidence in some roundabout way. We make some small talk in the car on the way to the restaurant, and I mention I had forgotten my hoodie so I was going to swing by my place quickly since it was on the way. When we got there, she asked if she could check it out. I obliged, gave her the tour, made some more small talk, both had 1 shot, and then we went on our way to the restaurant.

Small things I really liked right away: She's about 5'8"" - 5'9"" and I'm 6'1"". When we walked together, I didn't have to shorten my stride at all to stay in sync. The second thig was when I stuck my arm out for her to hook her's through, I didn't have to slouch my shoulder or adjust my arm in any awkward position. It just felt very natural.

Anyways -- we have dinner, shoot the shit, talk practically the entire time. Some small talk, exchange some viewpoints on society and our philosophies in life, and all the while we barely checked our phones. I had 1 beer, she had water, but we both had just soup.

Dinner's over, and we decide to watch a movie back at my place. Initially we were going to watch something on Netflix, but once she saw my DVD/Blu-Ray collection, we thumbed through that and talked about movies for a while. I explained the movies that would be bad to watch now because they require focus to get the story (Memento, Fight Club, etc.) Ultimately, she picks out American History X, which I laughed and said was not going to be a great choice, but she insisted.

We start watching, and I'm feeling confident. I start by putting my arm on the back of the couch, then scooching over while we are both laughing at one of my (admittedly) bad jokes, then dropping my hand off the couch onto her shoulder. I wasn't sure how much was going to happen, but eventually we went all the way.

**IT WAS FANTASTIC**

Obviously, when things are in the early goings, people will typically go the extra mile. Well Amanda went 5 extra miles. From oral to intercourse, a vast majority of what occurred I hadn't experienced to that level before. Ever.

Fast forward about 30 minutes and we are back in my bedroom. You know that diet of coffee, bread, soup, and **alcohol** I had for the entire day? That all caught up with me because my body decided to display it's malnourishment by giving me an awful case of vertigo. Not only was I seeing crazy colors, but I could tell my body was making the decision to not allow me to 'finish off', even with me on bottom. She was a bit disappointed I didn't finish, but we dressed up and I drove her home. In front of her place, we made out for a long while again and we said goodnight.

**Post Date** This is where my confusion comes from. We didn't start texting again until a couple days later, but we chatted significantly less than we usually do. We also made no mention of our hookup during the conversation. The day after that (3 days later now) I asked if I could come in at her work place when she was closing (jokingly and with a sexual innuendo). She responded -- and I think jokingly -- ""No thank you sir, you fwb'd me."" I responded, ""Haha, yea I could see how that could lead to things.""

And then no response...**FOR 3 DAYS**

So I got sick of waiting and I texted her 3 days later ""Hey what's up?"" We have a decent sized exchange, and I decided to ask her about having a date in three days. Unfortunately, her schedule isn't set with her job, so she wasn't sure if she would be free next Tues. or not, but if she was, it sounded good.

So again, 3 days pass, and all the while, I don't get responses to my texts (sent 1 per day) other than a couple Snapchats of random stuff (both of which I responded to).

The day of the potential 2nd date comes up, and still no responses about whether she was free or not. I send a Snapchat with a picture of fake tickets (They clearly say ""These are fake"") asking ""Non-refundable. Are we going?"" No response still. So I go see Amanda at work, and she doesn't say hi to me. She asks a co-worker twice with some extra emphasis in her voice that she needs help. Her co-worker comes out and serves me. Once it's time to check out, Amanda takes over to cash me out. We had a brief exchange, but it was all about my order. I get cashed out and as I'm getting my change, she says ""Enjoy your night out.""

Based on the lack of communication from after the date up until that point, I assumed this was her way of giving me a hint. However, this was a place I frequented even before she worked there. So I texted her ""I'll try to grab my grub earlier in the day. I might have to take a late lunch sometimes though. Take it easy."" (usually when she works its later in the day). This was basically my way of saying 'I'll try to get food when you're not there, but it might not work out like that some days. No hard feelings'

Within minutes she replies ""Ok why?"", to which I reply how I thought her not responding the past few days -- either to confirm she's going OR say she's at least busy -- was her way of giving me a hint.

Apparently, THAT'S NOT WHAT IT WAS AT ALL! Apparently when I went to order my food the last time, she was going to text me later about why I was acting weird (whaaa?). And she said she was sorry for sucking at texting and her lack of communication.

Right after that, she (sort of) started texting me a lot again, but it was mainly Snapchats of random things again. Whenever I send a reply text, it takes her a long time to respond to them now.

So does anyone have a clue as to what could possibly be going on with Amanda at this point? If not, what would you ask or how would you proceed to get a more definitive answer?

**TL;DR -- Met a girl, talked a lot before first date, went on said date and had a great time, things have been different since, having trouble getting a read on her.**"
2mycn2,3,2014-11-20,TIFU by letting delusions or grandeur ruin my life,Chasan1986,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2mycn2/tifu_by_letting_delusions_or_grandeur_ruin_my_life/,"	I'm sorry this is long. TLDR, carry on.

       When I was growing up, like most young boys, I had such aspirations for myself. I wanted what most people
 wanted; a career I loved, a wife I cherished, and a life worth living. I believed I was the most astute and
 talented among my friends, but even if that was so, I did nothing but squander any potential. I went through 
the majority of my schooling unnoticed by most, gaining and losing a few friends along the way, largely 
miscreants and deviants like myself. This all changed when I entered my junior year in high school. For 
whatever reason that still eludes me this moment, I became popular with the rejects of society and when 
treading in these circles you tend to be surrounded by drugs and sex and I had a shortage of neither. These 
drug fueled club days ended in my early twenties when I realized that getting fucked up and failing out of 
community college wasn't going to get me any where. I was still as arrogant as ever although I had no basis to 
be, I was simply living in a chemically altered reality of lies and delusions of grandeur. This was the first 
moment in my life that reality struck me. What have I done with my 24 years of life on this Earth? A question I
 constantly asked myself. A question that has the simplest of answers, I threw it away. Wasted. However, 
I convinced myself that I was still young, that there was still time. 

	My life began to briefly turn around after this sober revelation. I realized something had to be done,
 that I needed to progress my life in a meaningful way. Many options were open to me, the Military was 
the first thing that came to mind. Perhaps the discipline would set me straight, but the commitment and 
hard work required scared me away from this option. Something I regret to this day is that I didn't have
 the courage to step forth, a reoccurring theme in my life. Another option was to buckle down and start
 doing well in community college and then hopefully move to a state university. No, I didn't choose this 
either, I didn't want to commit to a degree that I wasn't passionate about and I sacrificed job and financial
 security to pursue a degree in Computer Animation at a private university. I always loved the arts and 
was fairly talented. I loved the school and degree I chose. It was fast paced and alive, constantly changing 
and requiring my full attention. I graduated Valedictorian doing something I loved. “This was it” I thought,
 finally getting my break through. I worked hard to be on top and here I am. I had some friends from 
school try to help me get a internship. I turned that down. Another friend tried to help me get a local small
 time job to break into the industry. I turned that down. I had bigger ambitions. I wasn't going to be held 
back by doing internships and working at the bottom to build myself up. No, instead I created a company 
with a lifelong friend. I invested most everything into this company and we both had the skills we needed
 to succeed. But after nearly a year of my 'friend' never holding up his end of the bargain, it dawned on 
me that he had no interest in running his own business. I was left high and dry with a failed business that 
never got off the ground and burned bridges preventing me from getting into the industry I thought I loved.
 Once again I made the wrong choices. Arrogance.
	Luckily throughout all this I met the most amazing girl. We've been together for years now. 
I don't know why she's with me. She's successful and has a well paying job, she's ambitious and hard working. 
She's everything I'm not. But currently our relationship is loveless and void of any romance. This too is my fault.
 I cheated on her in the past. I betrayed any trust she had in me, I ruined her pure soul. I was her first real relationship.
 Of course at this point I had my share of women and treated her as just another one. Selfish. Arrogant. She stuck
 with me even though I insulted her love, her pure love. This poor girl deserves so much better, but I couldn't
 leave her, no. I needed her. I'm 28 and delivering pizzas in a car that struggles to keep running. I have $50,000
 and counting in student loans. And I make less than $8,000 a year. What am I without her? Without her I would
 very realistically be living on the street. Perhaps where I belong. This is likely why she stays with me. Because 
even after everything I've done to her she's such a loving person that she knows that if she kicked me out I have
 no where to go.
	I write this not for pity or attention, but to hold my self accountable in a way for throwing away more than
 most people in the world ever have. Here I am 28 years old making less than $8,000 delivering shitty pizza to
 ungrateful peoples door. I have an $80,000 degree I can't get a job with. This is what I deserve. This is the empire
 I built. I must wear this crown. Don't be like me. Be grateful for what you have. Don't be like me. Be humble and
 loving. Don't be like me. Achieve."

however, i already have a full time job in IT. it's a very entry level job, but i have been here for five years already. i am not learning anything new and there are really no opportunities to move up - although i've been told this is because i lack a degree. i find this difficult to believe as some of my classmates have sys admin jobs already without their degrees at other companies.

the company has otherwise expressed satisfaction with my work. they encourage me to finish school and i always get great yearly reviews and raises. the job is just mind numbing.

i have saved enough for about two months of expenses. i'd of course try not to quit before getting a sold offer, but i feel like i'm missing great opportunities for what may or may not be a mediocre opportunity at my current company."

2myewv,11,2014-11-20,Help me get on track (college student),[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2myewv/help_me_get_on_track_college_student/,"Hello everyone, I've been lurking around this sub for a couple weeks now and I have to say that all of you are very knowledgeable and helpful. That's why I'm making this post today. Please bear with me on what could be a very long and tedious post to read because of its content and my terrible English (second language).

**Background information:** I'm a CS student that at some point lost track of what he was doing. A big part has to do with; being a minority with not the most fluent English. Having ADHD and not getting that taken care of because of cultural believes (aka ignorance). Being a first generation college student and not having the guidance necessary. As well as working two jobs on top of my academics. But when it comes down to it, all those things are just excuses and I'm not expecting the real world to cut me some slack because of it. Hence why I would really appreciate your help developing a game plan to get myself together. 

**Current situation:** I will be ending the first semester of my junior year in 2 weeks. I'm behind in my program and will most likely graduate a semester late (December 2016). My college career has been difficult and I'm barely getting by with a 3.0 GPA. Last semester I took a Data Structure and Algorithms class and nearly failed out of it, mainly because (I believe) my coding skills where not up to part. I feel like I had a good grasp of the content (enough to get by) but when it came down to assignments that required things like implement your own linkedlist, I struggled coding it and could not even go from a pseudo to actual code. Honestly I'm very ashamed to say it but I simply can't code. The worst part is that I'm retaking the class right now and although my grade will be much better, I'm stock in the same place. I was also planning on getting an internship this summer but with my skill level, minimum GPA, and nothing to show on my resume. That will most likely not going to happen.

**Game plan:** This is where I need your advice. I really want to turn my life around and become a software developer. The problem, there are actually too many resources out there and I can't decide what to do. I was thinking about doing the following:

**By mid-January:**
- Go through this course on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9DF6E4B45C36D411) to help me with my coding skills.
- Complete this Data Structure course on [MIT](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/), which also uses CLRS and I've seen many people recommend this book.

**After:**
- Start CTCI, maybe I get lucky and get an interview? if not it doesn't hurt.
- Try to start a project, which right now I have no idea how. But I'd figure it out later.

If you made it to this point, thank you! Really, even if you have nothing to say I still appreciate that you care enough to read it. Now, does my plan sound like something that could work? Or would I be wasting my time reading and completing those courses? If so, what do you recommend I do?

My background is:

Double major in Math and Computer Science.
Cumulative average ~86% (I thought i can bump this up to around 87~88%)
No significant personal project experience(I know that is lame, I should have done some project on my spare time....)
Course work include : Data Structures(KD Tree, Avl Tree, String matching, etc)
OOP Software Development(Complete a little project on simple game using X11)
Computer Architecture, Basic Compiler Construction(implementing a simple compiler &amp; assembler for a trivial language),Next term I will take Operating System, User Interface, Databases, and Algorithms.

My technical skill include: C++, C, Python, Scheme(But I thought this isn't convincible since i don't have any project experience).

Can anyone help with me? How can I improve in the next 3 month in order to get an internship? Any advices would be greatly appreciated.

I'm back with the announcement that everything's been set up, and the event is planned!

I work at LinkedIn, where each month we hold a special day called ""inDay"" during which employees are encouraged to spend time on something outside of work that's important to them. Whether that's helping others, learning a new skill, or just relaxing, inDay is a day to do something other than your job.

As part of our inDay, I've assembled a team of engineers and web developers who are dedicating part of their day to holding one-on-one mock technical interviews with you. You'll solve real interview questions, and afterwards the interviewer will provide you immediate candid feedback on areas you might want to focus on.

We can handle both **back-end** and **front-end** interview candidates. For this round, we don't have the ability to offer interviews in fields like systems administration or site reliability.

If you are **looking for internships** or you're a **new college graduate**, or if you just haven't interviewed in awhile, we would love to help you practice your interview skills!

Match emails will go out to interviewers around Dec 1, and they'll email you directly to set up a time that works well for both of you. I will also email everyone at that time to let you know if we were able to match you. We will try to handle as many people as we can, but I have a pretty small group. If the event is successful I will definitely try to hold it again in the future.

2myrdb,19,2014-11-21,"First time in a ""regular"" retail job",dvkota,TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/2myrdb/first_time_in_a_regular_retail_job/,"I start soon at a regular retail job, regular to me anyways. Its not a typical retail job where I'm selling items or being a cashier, but I work at a retail store now. 

Prior to getting this job, I had been doing mechanics and welding/fabrication and decided that it was time for a change. I had a really laid back boss at both mechanic jobs, and one cool yet intensely overworked boss at the welding/fabrication gig. 

Unsure if you would consider mechanics a form of retail, I would since we're offering them goods and services. 

My first mechanics job was awesome until maybe 3/4 of the way through it. Great boss up until then. We would have days where we just went canyon carving instead of working, just watched YouTube videos, or just worked on our own vehicles during regular hours. Tons of fun. A good customer had approached us about us painting his car (specifically me) and I was just an intern, no income and no car as of yet. 

I had said yes without knowing what I was getting myself into. I knew body work somewhat decently and I knew how to paint cars, I had painted my bosses during my stay. There would be weekend days where I'd waste gas to come down to work and he wouldn't be there at the shop when I had the car there to work on since I live at an apartment complex and I can't do body work there. He just told me ""Go home, take the day off"" and that bugged me. I explained that I wanted to work on the car and he didnt reply for the rest of the day. I had gotten mad about that, and a friend of his had asked if my boss was avoiding him at all, and so since I was mad, I explained how on one occasion we just wanted to relax as the two of us and canyon carve in an hour and how he would impede us from doing that. Boss didn't like it too much, and I got railed the next day.

From then on it was pretty much downhill. The customer wasnt happy with my bodywork and neither was I. He asked if I could fix his rear panel underneath the trunk and I suggested he take it to a metal worker to fix it, and my boss said ""Nah we can fix it"" and proceeds to ask me to hit it with a hammer while he heats up the metal. The customer takes note of this and all the damage that has occurred and becomes angered. He says he wants to take the car to another shop and did such. Now he comes back saying he wants money to cover the damages and only wants half of it as a lesson to me for undertaking the task without any knowledge of what it takes. 

Since it occurred in his shop and was agreed upon by everyone, he takes the loss and I get fired (I had already quit) but rather than that, I get thrown under the bus and they both agree that I am to pay the money for damages. 

I had quit previously because it was an unpaid internship and he said that with all of his overhead that he could not afford to pay me. I simply just agreed and left, because I wanted money for a car. He then contacts me to meet with both of them at his shop and I asked a friend of mine to come with me to help defend me as I did not trust my boss anymore. We showed up and talked it out and I felt microscopic to these two after that point. Long story short, I was shoved into paying for those damages because my boss didn't have the money to cover them (And I somehow did?)

I later learned after I left that my boss didn't put a single dollar of his own money into the shop. His father paid for everything in the shop as well as the monthly overhead. He was simply just playing real life mechanic simulator. 

My second job was as a diesel mechanic. Great job, awesome pay. My only complaint was that my coworker was a menace to me and liked to think that he owned the entire company. He pulled too much weight for my boss to do anything about it majorly and I felt shit on whenever I was around him (coworker). Ultimately, it took a mental toll on me from being around him so much, that I started coming into work at noon rather than 8 in the morning after my schooling ended, and that combined with my attitude towards him and disagreements ultimately ended my position with that company. 

The welding/fabrication job was the best one I ever had to date (we'll see if that holds up with my newfound job). 

My boss was really cool. Another internship, like my first one, but that was fine. I had gotten introduced to him through my diesel job and always had wanted to learn how to weld. He taught me how to weld, as well as myself learning how to use SolidWorks and a CAD plasma table to cut out parts for whatever we were making that day. He also would pay for my meals if we ever went out for them, which was awesome.

My only complaint was that he was just overworked and underpaid. He owned his business and hadn't taken a day off in what seemed like years. He wasnt run down looking, or anything of that sort. He was just stressed all the time. A few times he had fallen asleep but I dont blame him for the amount of time and effort that he puts into his business. Overall, still a very good experience working with him. I learned a new trade and got to meet some cool people from automotive magazines as well. "
2myrgg,0,2014-11-21,Torn up about career pathways,[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/2myrgg/torn_up_about_career_pathways/,"I need some wise words from you guys. I'm in New Zealand in case it matters. My situation: *1 semester left next year 2015, graduating in July or so.

*Got an internship this summer (November to end of Feb) at a very very successful company in the healthcare sector.

*Grades are OK. B average with A grades in management, planning etc. I specialised in Internal Combustion Engines for my specialisation, which I chose over doing Operations Management specialisation.

*I am very hands on, love working on things, endless ideas for contraptions and mechanisms. Good problem solving skills.

My problem: *My role currently is in Operations Engineering. I didn't choose it, I got put in it. Continuous improvement, cutting time and costs... that sort of thing. I always though I'd rather do that/management than be a design engineer but now that I'm doing it. I HATE IT! It's boring me to death.

*I see the work the product design and other design engineers do and I envy them so much. I feel like I wasted my whole degree learning maths, design skills, thermodyamics and all sorts just to end up doing Ops.

*Even though I hate Ops, I am working my ass off. Trying to impress and trying to do the best I can. My manager is highly impressed even after my first week and I can only get better!

My question:

*Should I continue with ops if they offer me to come back as a graduate? The company helps you to work towards a field you would like to work in, as in I could develop myself to be a design engineer eventually but it seems risky... Is ops the way to go? Is it a better field? It doesn't seem like it. Even the senior ops engineers have a very dull job by the looks of things compared to the senior design engineers.

*Should I maybe just be straight up front with them and say I want to be a design engineer or nothing?

The company pays extremely well and the possibilities are endless and I would have an extremely bright career path with them. However if I don't get a design role, I feel like I should settle for a lesser job elsewhere that still lets me do design work. I feel that if I don't use my design skills I'll lose the basics I learnt at uni and find it difficult to get back in to.

I feel like I can excel highly at ops but be an OK to good design engineer.

What do you guys reckon?

At the time, I was working as an escort/prostitute and having a sort of crisis of faith. I left ""the life"", my husband flipped out and put me in the hospital, and I was able to use that incident to get a restraining order and leave.

Since then, things have been hard, but they've gotten better. My mom kept my children for a couple months, while I made a physical recovery and spent some time at a residential center for mental recovery, but I have them back now. They're doing OK, but my oldest is in counseling and my youngest may end up there - he's being evaluated because he's had a lot of behavior problems that started after all the changes. I'm also doing some counseling for myself both through the church and with a counselor who's worked with other women like me.

I am separated from my husband. A divorce in this state takes a year of separation, but I'm not in a hurry to get remarried,or to free him up to do so. I have been told there is a good chance our marriage is invalid, for multiple reasons, but I don't have the energy for the annulment process right now anyway.

I had to drop my classes because of all that, and I transferred to a community college where my husband can't find me.  I am taking 2 half-semester courses now and doing OK. I will be able to get a Pell grant in spring and help with daycare and a work-study job through the school, and I should be able to get a paid internship in the summer. I'm doing some online work now, but it's a 6 month contract, so I'm still looking for something permanent. 

I am still in church and my oldest 2 are in CCD and enjoying it. Living in a different city now is a good thing, because I don't have to worry about being recognized here. It's still a little weird because I'm scared to get close to people, but I've found a really good parish and it's helped me stay grounded, even though I made look like that crazy lady who keeps crying at adoration, lol.

I've only stopped by this sub a time or two; I'm generally a lurker elsewhere. I just need to get this off my chest.

So I suppose I'll start at the beginning...

My girlfriend and I are both in the same grade in the same (pretty small) program in college. We met 2.5 years ago when we started college. We were generally friends, worked on a group project once during freshman year. She was dating someone else at the time. I had absolutely zero interest in dating her. Fast forward to this last spring (end of sophomore year). We started talking during a group project we were on together. I kinda opened up to her a little more than I was comfortable with and mentioned how I was essentially depressed because of a very stressful semester. She got very concerned and all of the sudden cared a lot about me and my well being.

Through the rest of the semester, we talked and hung out a bit. Nothing serious. During the summer, we were both in the same town for different internships. Early on, she asked to hang out a few times, but I legitimately wasn't able to. Over the course of a few weeks, I proceeded to be very bad at picking up on the blatant clues and hints she was trying to send that she was interested in me. Finally, we go on a ""date,"" I suppose I'll call it that. Then we started hanging out at her place 2-3 times a week. We started going on long walks together. By early July, we're officially dating. Things are fun and fine and great. We hang out around 3-4 times a week. Yada yada yada.

Ok. At this point I'm going to make 3 tangents.

Tangent 1: Through all of this, she is dealing with some medical issues. I don't want to go into a whole lot of detail, but essentially she has a lot of chronic pain that she can't control very well and interferes with her ability to be a 100% normally functioning college-aged human being. She's seen a lot of doctors and done a lot of therapy and doesn't really know what the cause of her issues is. She's kinda giving up on trying to figure out what's wrong.

Tangent 2: We very quickly learned that she is very much a touch-feely ""I want to cuddle all the time"" type of person. I am very much not. For the first two months or so, this isn't an issue.

Tangent 3: This is my first ""serious"" relationship.

Alright, let's fast forward to the start of this semester (late August). We move back into our dorm (we live in the same building, but different floors, still very close to each other). Now that we're super close to each other, she wants to hang out *all the time*. Like, every free moment I have, I should be hanging out with her or else I'm not interested in her or don't actually love her. And every time we hang out should end in a passionate make out session that pushes my comfort levels. I go into retreat mode and kinda pull away. I didn't realize it at the time, but looking back, that's exactly what I did: retreated. She interprets that as me trying to hint that I don't care about her anymore. We talk it out and resolve to try to improve things.

Now, take what happened in that last paragraph and repeat it. We go through that pattern about 3 or 4 times.

It gets increasingly frustrating for both of us. Our classes and schedules are also very demanding. This, compounded with her health issues, compounded with our not-super-sweet-and-rosy relationship is driving her into depression. Like *serious* depression.

About 3 weeks ago, we had a bit of a fight and then big long talk about if our relationship is something we want to continue. I honestly wanted to break up with her then. But we agreed to try to take some steps to improve things.

A few days later, she had a... family emergency. She didn't take it well. She became super depressed and even suicidal. There were a few days where I was afraid to leave her alone because I didn't want her to kill herself. She's since then become a less suicidal and has partially come to terms with the family emergency. But she's still extremely depressed. She keeps saying things like ""I don't see the point in ____ because I can't find any point in being alive.""

I have no idea how to deal with this. I'm not a counselor or psychologist. I literally can't seem to do anything to make her happy. I'll go hang out with her, but no matter how long we cuddle or talk or whatever, she's still sad and still upset with me when I have to go. I don't know how to be the person that she needs right now. And the fact that I'm not what she needs right now is only making things worse. And it's making things hard for me. It is just a fact that it is incredibly hard for me to have to deal with a depressed and suicidal girlfriend. I don't care if it sounds selfish; it's hard. And I'm getting tired of it and it's wearing me out. I'm not 100% over my own depression and being in a relationship that I'm not even enjoying anymore isn't helping.

I honestly just want to end our relationship. I'd love to still be friends afterward, but if that's not possible, so be it. But I don't want to continue to make her life worse by continuing to date her, even though she refuses to recognize that that's what's happening.

And I can't just flat out dump her because I couldn't live with myself if she killed herself over it and that's a terrifyingly real possibility.


Sorry for how rambly that was and for the inevitable grammar mistakes and things that probably just didn't make sense. If you have any advice, I would appreciate it, but please don't feel obligated to try to help me. Really, just thanks for letting me vent.

**tl;dr**: I don't know how to deal with my girlfriend's depression. I feel like continuing our relationship is only making things worse. I want to end it but I don't want her to kill herself."

At this point, I had it. I sent her an email detailing that I am neither tech support nor an intern.

Anyway, I finally (after four months of asking) got a meeting.  Apparently, my program is being resurrected, despite me not hearing about it during my tenure. I have been in this position for four months. They said, essentially, that it will be my job to resurrect the program which the VISTA before me was so shit at that it got cut by United Way.

Also, my VISTA leader, or whoever she is. (She isn't a VISTA) decided that since I decided to state how awful my position has become to the executive director, that she would punish me. She has taken away my ability to work from home on Fridays which are four hour long days. I don't make enough money on those days to make going to the office an economically viable solution, since I live an hour away. She has decided to rescind this privilege as a vindictive measure for bringing my concerns  to the executive director.

What are the ramifications of reporting this kind of thing to the state office? The organization that I'm with is a legit non-profit, they've just bungled this position beyond repair, I feel. My position as tech support was filled by someone else before they saw that I have tech skills. That dude left before I came on, and they replaced a salaried employee with me. I feel taken advantage of and I feel like they've wasted four months of my time. I want to stop this from happening if they apply for future VISTAs (I'm a third year), but I don't want to stop them from getting grant funding, and I certainly don't want to get the other two VISTAs forcibly removed.

My name is Raquel and I recently managed to get a phone interview with a Microsoft recruiter for their Explore Program. If you aren't familiar with this, it is a summer internship program that allows freshmen/sophomore undergrads to participate in a 10 week rotation program within Software Development Engineering, Software Development Engineering in Test, and Project Management. 

Basically, I'm really worried about this interview because I'm pretty new to CS. My entire freshman year, I didn't take any CS courses because I was an EE major. So, the only experience I have with programming is from taking Java and C++ this semester, plus a couple books that I've read on my own. If you've done this program, how experienced were you in CS? How much did you know? What did you do to prepare for your interviews? What kind of questions did they ask?

How do I transition to a new career with no immediate direction?,Badovs-Roc,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2mzz2n/need_a_career_change_at_30_due_to_stressloss_of/,"I've got the job I had always wanted since I was 10 years old(video coordinator in Football), and after 5 years of doing it full time post college I don't think I can do it anymore.  I'm currently working about 90-100 hours a week and I average 75+ over the course of the year.  Largely because of the hours I've lost my passion for the job and my health and relationships have suffered greatly as a result.  I've pursued similar jobs to mine elsewhere but wasn't successful and I feel it has hurt my advancement opportunities(not that they were all that great to begin with) at my current employer.  I've reached a point where I'd almost rather be unemployed than come in to work tomorrow.

I've got a bachelors degree is sports management(I know...but that degree + internships got me where I thought I wanted to be).  Aside from a 3 month stint doing customer support at a software company this is the only work I've done since high school.  I don't really know what I want to do, the only career I ever had a passion for was the one I'm in now and that passion is long gone.  

I currently make about $55k/year and have ~$20k in student loan debt.  I have very little tying me down to my current location so I'd be willing to mov just about anywhere.  Money is not a huge motivator for me, but I'd like to avoid going deeper into debt without any direction or promising job prospects.  I'd love to find a new career where I can start at the bottom and work my way up, but I don't know where to look since all my work experience is in a pretty niche field that I want a clean break from.  I'm not against going back to school, but I'd like to have an idea of what I want to do rather than blindly taking classes looking for a purpose.

I've looked briefly into computer science/programming, and I definitely had an interest in IT at one point before I started on my career path.  I might be interested in pursuing that again as there seems to be demand.  I hit a wall mentally in math shortly after high school and veered away from that path, so my math skills are beyond rusty and i feel like that would be a huge hurdle initially(not dismissing it, just trying to be open).  I've looked into programming bootcamps as a way to get into that field and that feels like an attractive option if I were to commit to that field.  I feel like this is an option but I can't for sure say I'm passionate about it.

Has anybody else started a career change without having a good idea of what direction they wanted to go in? My most immediate concern is honestly getting out of my job, as I'm struggling mentally and physically keeping up with the demands of it and the effect it has had on my relationships and personal life in general is making me pretty depressed.  I really want to stay positive but I think I need to get out very soon."

* How does the application process for internships usually work out in the US?
* What's the salary like for CE/CompSci internships?
* Do companies set a high value on GPA?   
* What criteria do employers generally use when reviewing students' applications?

My CE course does not include a lot of analogue circuitry, so I'm looking for a job in either FPGA, µController development or some hardware-related software engineering. Do you think I've got a chance to score a internship in this area?

It's my first job; I've been here for 3 months (and last year, as an intern, for about 9 months).
I've started to work here because data mining is my passion and I wanted to learn much about it. What I've learned is, however, that their focus is on mostly BI (data warehouses, OLAP, ETL). Only a fraction of their work is about what we call data science. The tools we use are mainly SAS and SQL, and mostly we use it for ETL and data processing.
In the last 3 months I did not have the opportunity to show my skills and use my knowledge in advanced analytics. My boss, a well-known veteran of data, is aware of this and promised that in the long term, I would spend 30-40% of my time with data mining.


Recently, I found a new job opportunity that seems interesting. A company in IT security is right now building up a team of data scientist to design and build data models for their new intelligent, data-driven product. They are players in the international market, which is quite rare for a company from my country. The data scientists there are using open-source tools like R and Python. A friend of mine works there, enjoying his work. He set up and interview for me with the CTO, which went well, and I'm quite sure that I'm going to get an offer.


I've tried to think about as many aspects of changing jobs as possible. This 2nd company is clearly more innovative and has higher ambitions (international product, international conferences etc.). And there I could do data science at a deep level which I think of as exciting but I have no chance of doing at my current employer.

However, I feel I still could learn many things at my current job, both technical (BI, SAS, SQL) and soft skills (meeting more clients, thinking about business problems). I sort of fear that if I quit, I could lose the chance to learn more about these stuff. The 2nd company is clearly specialized in a particular market (IT security) while at my current company I can face several business problems coming from various markets, which is always interesting. I feel that if I quit, my knowledge about business will be too specific, and that would be a limit of my possibilities in my future career.


Could you give me other perspectives? Do you think the fears descirbed are valid? I realize I'm maybe overthinking it but I'd love hear your ideas.

With the kind of programming my company does, we don't see a lot of value in interns. Sure, if you want to come write documentation for us for a few months, we could always use the help. But in terms of getting practice with software development, co-op is a much better fit for us, because there's so much about our software that you need to learn in order to be useful. Even experienced full-time developers take 3-6 months before they're able to really contribute.

So what's your opinion? As a student, what's your advantage to interning instead of co-oping?"

2n13nk,0,2014-11-21,Computer science with cyber security concentration - is it worth to continue my Master's?,NuclearSky,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2n13nk/computer_science_with_cyber_security/,"Hi everyone. I go to a school that has one of those fancy 5-year Master's plans where you can take several graduate courses that count for both your BS and your MS. The acceptance rate for my specific school is very low as they are very selective of who they grant this type of benefits to, which makes my decision a bit harder.

Anyhow, I am on my last semester of BS in CS and already have several grad courses under my belt. I am considering the possibility of not getting funding this upcoming semester (not by lack of trying, long story), so I am trying to weigh out both sides of the coin here.

Right now, I have an internship with a big company that is going rather well, but I'm not doing much related to my goal career, which is cyber security analysis and testing. I was hoping to continue learning about cyber security topics throughout grad school and research, but now I'm wondering if there are other ways to learn and get valuable experience in this field that I haven't considered.

Any and all opinions / experiences are welcome. "

I go to a small private University in Austin, Texas that is of course overshadowed by the University of Texas. Austin, being a up and coming technical hub, I know I should be able to get many offers from right here in my city.
My question is that my school's career services is not that strong, and neither are our job fairs. We have the occasional big company like IBM, but not enough new and young tech companies which are everywhere in Austin.
I was able to receive the opportunity to intern at Freescale Semiconductors here in Austin this summer, which is a very competitive internship and high paying. I worked with many Electrical Engineers so was often outmatched, but I am learning a lot. I know having this internship on my resume should draw a lot of interest for me even though they see that I went to my small school.
Also, I do have quite a few connections through my parents friends at companies like IBM, Dell, Freescale, National Instruments, but none at the new up and coming tech companies. Personally I see my self at a tech company that is trying to make a name for itself and is young and appeals to this new generation of software engineers that are not ""nerds."" If that makes sense haha
Finally, my question is where should I start to get some of these positions? Glassdoor.com, indeed.com, linkedin job posts? Or is there something else I can do with some of these companies being in my city?
Thank you!!"

Also, I'm going to begin a master's next year. I've tried to work so far, but haven't had any luck since I wrapped up my last class in September. I have been going to fall recruiting and I was applying to schools in October. Is it going to look bad if I have a gap? If I do find a seasonal job, is it ok to leave it off of my resume? The master's is in the evening and I'd really like to get internships during the day. So I feel like I wouldn't want to start a regular non-accounting job now only to quit it when school starts. I don't know. I haven't told the agencies about starting school."

To say that the job market for that field is bad would be an understatement. 

There are a few universities that offer 2 year Bachelor of Computer Science degrees for those who already hold another degree. The job outlook for this field seems great and I am actually interested in learning about software development and programming.

I have some questions

1) What is the job market like for a recent graduate without internships or prior experience?

2) I did take some quantitative courses but I have not taken any math since some pre-calculus in High School. How difficult will it be to learn and succeed in the advanced algorithms, probability and calculus courses in a computer science program?

3) Does my lack of a math background mean that the program will be more difficult than it is for other students? Is there a high failure rate in Computer Science?

4) Do employers care whether a person has an Honors Computer Science Degree vs a non-honors one?"

Partly, I had a bad resume which I was able to fix with the help of this subreddit, and partly because I had no job experience what so ever prior to college. Not even a part time job.

2n206g,0,2014-11-21,Seeking help to pay off ~9k Credit Card Debt.,Who_Lee_Oh_,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2n206g/seeking_help_to_pay_off_9k_credit_card_debt/,"Hey Guys,

Like so many of us, I wish I could rewind time to a year or 2 ago and rethink of my CC spending habits... but we all make mistakes, right? I'm looking for some help to clear my CC as smoothly and stress free as possible.

Due to some unforeseen circumstances within the last year, I had to rely on my CC a little to much. Going to school full time, working small hours at my internship and being in a low income family did not help much. 

But now i graduated in May, and started my career as a Software Engineer. I have been working at my job for about 2 months now with a yearly salary of $67,750. I get paid weekly. 

With this new fresh start, I would like to clear out my CC debt. 

My monthly bills (not including CC payments and Student Loans) are: ~$1,500

My monthly student loans will be ~$230. 

Here is the break down of my CC: 

Bank | APR | Current Balance | Max Limit | Min Payment
---|---|---|--- |----
Citibank | 16.49% | 2,213.26 | 2,400 | ~70
Discover* | 0.0% | 3,887 | 4,200 | ~70
PC Richards Store Credit Card | 26.99% | 3,353.02 | 5,000 | ~120

Total CC Debt: 9,943.98

* I opened the Discover card back in August to do a BT.. but then the unforeseen situation happened (that's another story) and had to used both this card and the other card that was part of the BT. The BT offer ends around September '15. 

Credit Karma says my Credit Rating is: 650
Discover says my FICO is: 662 (in October).

* I also bought a car in August b/c i needed it for work. There is no way to get to work without one. Which made my score drop a bit. 

So Personal Finance... please help?

I have been really thinking of consolidating the cards through Lending Club or any other reliable service and making one payment rather then 3 separate payments. 

What would you guys recommend? If consolidating is not a possibility, would you be able to help me set up a monthly plan to tackle this? 

Thank you for taking the time to help me. Any help would definitely ease my stress. "
2n220t,2,2014-11-22,"I've done everything right, so where did it all go wrong? I'm ""successful"" in my life right now, so why do I feel like such a failure?",CloudsTasteGeometric,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2n220t/ive_done_everything_right_so_where_did_it_all_go/,"(Sorry about this rant I just really really need to say this, somewhere, somehow. Any advice of feedback is a huge help)

On paper, lots of things in my life right now paint the picture of success, so why do I feel like such a failure?

I'm about to graduate from college but the prospect of celebrating or feeling any hint of fulfillment or pride seems preposterous; college is easy, only people with Masters or PhD's had it rough enough to feel proud. Besides, nobody hires college graduates any more, a college degree is useless - it makes as much sense to be happy about graduating college as it does to be proud of graduating high school (which I wasn't). It isn't a milestone for me, not even a checkpoint, and in no way is this ""accomplishment"" alleviating me of my self loathing. I would never find a job either way, and after taking grad courses college as a whole is so laughably easy why should I feel proud for being more expensive meat being shoved through the grinder - with no future on the other side?

I recently had a paper of mine published. In an academic journal. As an undergrad. This should make me feel good, right? Why would I? There is no future in the world of academia and that time sink doesn't even fit on a resume. If it were a doctoral thesis maybe I could feel okay, but only if it lined me up for some form of employment.

I've labored and made efforts to do everything ""right"" so where did it all go wrong? I've worked every weekend night and then some since I was 19; working through college helps alleviate debt and looks good on a resume, right? Still in huge debt, nobody cares about my resume because entry level jobs are a myth. I spent my spring and summer vacations working an internship instead of taking time off or going on vacation (an outlandish idea for anyone without a career), fat lot of good that's done for my job search, though. I worked my ass off to get a good score on the GRE, but it wasn't a ""great"" score, and postgraduate school would be just another money sink. I got a head start on the job search, I apply to 5-10 new professional positions each week, research each job, write custom cover letters, and have been met with nothing but rejection. A month before graduation and the job hunt is already defeating me. I'm doing everything right, but it doesn't matter, nobody hires college graduates, entry level jobs are a myth.

Recently broke up with my girlfriend, too busy to keep things alive, but mostly because my Bipolar was an issue; I've worked hard to get treatment and manage my disorder, and I'm pretty successful in that sense, but these sorts of struggles just wind up making me laughably inadequate as a romantic partner in the end, after working as hard as I do to be a good boyfriend. Still, what am I worth to anyone if I can't land a good job? If I can't be the perfect bastion of stoicism and support they'd expect? All I am reminded of is how much of a failure I am despite my ""successes"" and how pathetically empty my professional and personal social networks are now that my schooling and relationships are over.

To all of my peers who are all smiles and cheers about graduating - you have some nerve feeling proud, you graduated! Wo-hoo, so have hundreds of millions of other unemployed imbeciles, what the fuck are you celebrating for? To all of my peers who spent weekends, nights, and school breaks going out, having fun, and travelling - you really have some nerve wasting your own time, having fun is for adults with careers, you're in college - you're supposed to be working all the time! I loathe every one of you indulgent, prideful, idiots. But I don't hate you. I don't like or respect myself enough to justify being angry at you. After all, I've done everything right, and have nothing to show for it.

Sorry about this wall of text, I just need to get it off my chest, I guess. I've been in this head space for way too long now and I don't know how to get out."
2n2296,10,2014-11-22,Non-CS bachelors working towards masters in CS; how to sell it for internships?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2n2296/noncs_bachelors_working_towards_masters_in_cs_how/,"Quick background: I got my undergraduate degree in Cognitive Science, fell in love with the CS in it, especially in the realm of ML/NLP, and now I'm working towards a Masters in CS. I'm currently taking undergraduate prereqs in preparation for graduate coursework. I've completed or am about to complete CS I &amp; II, Discrete I &amp; II, Probstats, and Computer Architecture, and I have a 3.9 CS GPA. I'm taking OS and Data Structures/Algos next semester.

My question is this: how do I position myself for internships? I've been to career fairs and applied for opportunities, but when employers see an expected masters degree on my resume, they expect a lot and I have to explain that I only just started my CS adventure. That ends up being a turn-off for a lot of recruiters, who asked for me to come back when I have more experience and education, after I've taken Algorithms, etc.

How do I sell myself in this kind of situation? Since the last intern fair, I landed a graduate research assistant position in a university bioengineering lab that utilizes machine learning/NLP, which will certainly help, but there's still the matter of my overall elevator pitch and game plan, if that makes sense. I'd really like an internship for next summer, rather than waiting until the next year.

Any advice would be fantastic! Thank you so much."

2n2vbb,11,2014-11-22,My wife is gone and I need help,Ameliahauzer,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2n2vbb/my_wife_is_gone_and_i_need_help/,"You might find odd that i'm choosing no sleep to share my story but you'll understand why once i'm finished. Besides being so farfetched that I doubt any police officer would ever believe in me, if they did pay attention to it they would conclude that i'm the most probable suspect. I can't do anything to help my wife get out alive from where she is if i'm encarcerated
 I was hoping the readers here could have some clues or suggestions because I really don't know what to do. I suppose i'm in shock, i'm a mess hardly believing in anything anymore. I think telling my story here might help me calm down and think things through more clearly, she was always the one that was better under pressure not me, i never thought i'd find myself in a position where I would literally have her life on my hands. Empathy might help people get more envolved with our story so maybe telling you guys a bit about us is mandatory, i think.
 I've thought long and hard these past few hours since I managed to run away and this is the only hypothesis that actually made sense.

 I live in a small farm house just about 40min away from the centre of Montreal. The farm has been on my family for many many years and it ended up in my hands. My mom died of cancer when i was very little and my dad is currently in a nursing home because he has Alzheimer's in a very advanced state.
 For many some years I couldn't care less about it, I was an average law student who just started college when my dad had the outbreak that forced me to deal with the fact that he could no longer take care of himself.  When I finished university I was also an average attorney and in a town where there are a lot of amazing lawyers you can imagine my life was far from what i dreamed for me. 

 I am not a carer, i don't care about anything or better said, i was not a carer until I met Laura. She was a very successful accountant, besides that she was also soft at heart. She did charity events, volunteered in animal shelters,you get the picture, she led her life the best and the most correct way possible. 

 It was on one of those events that we met and i think the only reason she took interest in me  was because i was oozing helplessness. I was her own charity project. I always thought she had a bad case of saviour complex but after sometime of dating her i realized she did upgrade my life to another level. I was dressing better, looking better, enjoying life more, i even found myself helping her in her good will stuff. I was, i have to admit, more proud of what i had become than i had ever been in my life. 

 The only thing that was ruining this picture perfect scenario was my job. Besides failing miserably in every other case, the ones i actually managed to be good was when i was defending guilty people. Turns out i'm very good at defending people when i know they are lying about their innocence and realising that the only way i was ever going to successful was by defending murderers was slowly crushing my spirit.

Laura saw this before I ever did, she was always two steps ahead on me in everything that had to do with emotional intelligence so she spent two years convincing me that maybe, if we were going to live together which was inevitable by now, we should move back to my family farm. I'd shown a growing interest on biological agriculture and well plants in general and she was running out of space to keep all the stray dogs she got off the streets and then refused to put them up for adoption. 

I confess that i was reluntant as i was finally getting somewhere law wise but after two years of reflexion i agreed in reducing my cases and moving to my parents house. She could work at home since her job could be done anywhere, she is a city child so living in the country was this big adventure that was she was looking forward to. I had a bad feeling about it but i just blamed it on my unhappy childhood memories and the solitude of the countryside. I wished I followed my gut but i had no way of even imagining this, truth be told i could never say no to Laura. Not after all she's done for me.

And that's how we've been living for the past 3years. Laura is happier than she's ever been, or at least she looks like it: she has cats that aren't exactly ours they just pass by to say hi everyday; she had her dogs that she likes to give food names to like apple pie and struddel and crumble and petit gateau, she loves the corn fields i planted on the farm and she loves her small herbarium where she keeps all the stuff she needs to make her healthy cooking. Me? I love her and that's more than enough to make it all better than our previous life.

Until last night.

Even if I keep most of my time at home, sometimes I still defend a case in the city because i miss the crowds and the rush. Last week after i left the court i was approached by the other part's intern that had been helping with the case. She was impressed by the way i won the case with so little that the accusation could do to stop me and she asked if i would have a beer with her before going home. She was a small, beautiful thing and she was 22 at best and i might, just might be slightly attracted to her but truth be told the only reason i said yes to her proposition was to indulge my ego. I could have just skipped this part and make you think i was this loyal, dedicated wife but i think i shouldn't for three reasons: first, it might come up in the future investigation and i don't want you all to think i'm a phony; secondly, i'm not perfect but i do love Laura, i would never cheat on her even if i'm obviously playing with fire sometimes; and last but not least, if it wasn't for Veronika i would have even less clues about what happened last night. 

During our time at the bar we talked about a lot of stuff, we flirted a bit i admit but it was all very candid specially because i kept using my left hand to gesture and my wedding was always awkwardly showing. You might say i'm an hipocrite and i don't deny it not for a moment. At some point she started telling me about this rumour that was running around town that some sort of religious cult was making it's establishment  on the outskirts of town. Veronica mentioned she didn't exactly know what they were about or their beliefs but she had two highschool friends who left their life behind to join them.

Some say they are the kind of cults who believe on wierd things like there's a space ship riding a comets tail that is the passport to another dimension and eventually commit mass suicide and the other rumours mention some messianic stuff, about the apocalipse and purification of earth. She even mentioned that she suspects recent increase of missing people in Montreal is not a random coincidence but the direct result of their cult actions. I asked if she isn't watching/reading too much true crime fiction and she proceded to try and explain to me how most of the urban legends created online are actually happening right now all over the world and she recommended this place to me in case I wanted to broad my knowledge of the world. Her words exactly. 
I laughed it off as youth's eagerness to believe in everything and noticed how late it was getting and ended our ~date~ right there. 
 We left the bar and i was still laughing it off and when she kissed my cheek she whispered' careful, you and your wife might be next! You live too isolated, it would probably be a long time before anyone knows you are missing'. I laughed at the time, I brushed it off as she trying to be creepy sexy ( it's a thing believe me). I wish I'd paid more attention to what she said. I wish, at least, i'd stop and think how come she knew where i live...i only mentioned i had a long drive.

I was an idiot, i regretted even accepting the beer as soon as I got my car. Yes, my ego was rubbed but it was just that and it was never going to be worth losing my wife's trust. I'm an idiot and she knows it better than anyone but one day she'll stop thinking i was ever worth her time. The only way i have of proving my worth is getting her alive from the mess we're in and start over. Somewhere else because I'm never sleeping another night at that place.

This is all I had to tell you guys of the times that preceded what happened last night now to what brought me here.

I didn't comment anything about the goddamn cult with Laura, first because she would brush it off and secondly because she is the most profound atheist i know. She would immediatly put a label of crazy people being crazy on the subject and laugh everytime that i mention it. Crazy religious people are as likely to cross her path as aliens in her mind so she would end the subject even if i brought it up. I'm curious more than anything so i did read stuff about them, their activity and so on, i went on their official website and it looked like your average cult. You pay something to help the church and then you have your little piece of heaven assured, you know the type. It did have an elite within the cult, i found some people commenting in foruns that they existed but knew nothing about what it was about. I grew more and more interested but then i had to accept another case in town and dedicated myself to it.

So last night i got home a little late ( I know what you are thinking, no I did not see Veronica after that time at the bar, I just had some stuff to read and I couldn't bring the archive home because it was classified as confidential) and I find these strange women having tea at my place. 
Laura is happily entertaining, happy to have company i guess, i see that they are all dressed in purple and i think they look at us wierdly. I signal Laura to follow me to the porch and as we leave the women with their tea I try to get my wife to explain what's going on. She said these nice ladies came to present themselves since they were moving nearby. That they live in a religious community and they like to know their neighbours. I don't know if it was because i'd read all that stuff online about the cult, the more Laura talked the more I suspected those people and obviously argued with her about letting strangers in. I sounded paranoid i realised but I was absolutely creeped out. I had Veronika's last words on loop in my head and as I said before,  my wife is the best dealing with stressful situations.She just looked at me like i had grown an extra head and shook her head going on and on about how she just wanted to be friendly and how she was actually relieved to have some actual company since i was never home lately. Then she stormed out on me which she never did before, that's when I realized how right she was about me never being around. So I lowered my head and decided to play nice. I wish i didn't.

The women stayed for dinner and i endured their salvation crap for the entire time almost silently. I watched how my wife who would have scoffed everything sat there, talking happily about the Lord just to keep them there, to keep them talking. I thought guilty on how lonely she must have felt these last few days if she is actually endulging this nonsense. You see, Laura was kicked out of her parents house because their religion couldn't deal with a gay daughter. These people seem accepting but you never know.

After they left, we continued our conversation now without anger. She asked me if it had been such a discomfort to be nice to our neighbours and i tried once more to explain why I was so creeped out but she didn't actually listen. At least i know we didn't go to bed angry.

In the middle of the night, I was having trouble sleeping so decided to get a glass of water from the kitchen and found that everything was strangely silent. I mean, we have several dogs and cats and we are in the middle of the country side there's always noises around us. But not tonight and the silence was really innerving. As soon as I turn to go back to bed, I see a shadow with the side of my eye, immediately something hits my head and I pass out.

When i come to my senses I was on the back of a van and Laura is beside me passed out. I try to wake her up but she is not responding in any way.

I had to decide to either go with through with the journey and probably die at the destination or try to escape now and go after them and try to save my wife. There's no way I can jump on a moving van with her passed out, not without risking bumping her head on the road and being the causer of the death of the person I love the most in the world. So I manage to kick the back door, I don't know with what strength, and roll into the road. I hear the van hit the breaks and i manage to get up and run to the middle of the forest besides the road. I hide but i can hear them saying, it sounded like the voice of one of the women that was at the house but it can be just my mind playing tricks, ' don't worry about that one, we only need one of them anyway'.

 I heard the doors closing and the van driving off and I broke down. I finally cried all the stress out, in the middle of the woods and I didn't leave til morning. 

I didn't dare to go home, so I walked to the city instead. I waited beside the office building where I knew Veronika worked and asked for her help. I know, i know... But I didn't tell her anything, just said that I was in trouble and needed her tablet and some clothes. It was the only thing that occured to me. I found a cafe with wifi and I am writing you this looking like shit with borrowed money and borrowed clothes. I need ideas desperately. I can't believe this nightmare is happening to me.

EDIT: I managed to call an ex-client of mine and he has resources, you know what I mean. I'm going to find that cult. it had to be them, who else could have taken her. I'm just waiting for an employee of his to come get me and take me to his headquarters.

2n2w7v,5,2014-11-22,My [21F] girlfriend of 11 months just left me [22M] a week ago because she thinks we cannot help each other.,benderodriguez,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2n2w7v/my_21f_girlfriend_of_11_months_just_left_me_22m_a/,"I met my girlfriend when I joined a co-ed fraternity at the college we attend. We started dating almost immediately and it was pretty great for the most part. We fought sometimes but always seemed to solve the issue and move forward. Our fights got heated sometimes, with name calling, blaming, and bringing up past mistakes being the worst of it (it never turned into physical violence).

Towards the end, she told me that she was depressed and had not felt like herself in a long time. I myself have battled depression pretty much all my life and she would get mad at me for not addressing her concern but I felt like she never expressly talked to me about it. I wanted to be there for her but we did start to drift apart. We spent less time together and the time we did spend together we fought a lot. On my part, I would say somethings in anger that I did not really mean and I could be very controlling. She felt like she could never do anything without me becoming sad, depressed, angry or any combination. 

The final fight that ended the relationship was not really any different than the others, I just think that she could not handle me anymore, especially with how she had started feeling, so she left me saying that we both needed to become happier individuals before being in a committed relationship. She felt my happiness depended entirely on her. I don't necessarily agree with this though (I have an internship I love, I have hobbies [MMA, videogames, crafts] and I have friends outside of our circle). All of my time outside of these things belonged to her and I don't understand how she can't see that. She wants to still be friends (cliche I know) but I truly think she's saying that because she's not yet ready to give up on me, she wants to keep me close to see me change and be ready for our relationship to start again. We still have plans to see a play for Christmas together among things in the future and I commute and she said I can still stay at her place some nights. I'm obviously very sad and we live close and are in the same fraternity so it's impossible not to see each other, but I'm trying to give her space right now.

I want to prove to her that I can be better. I know it's only been a week but I think I'm on track to getting better for myself and her. I've started seeing a counselor for my depression and who can help me control myself when arguments occur and not be so controlling and jealous. I'm coming here because I really love this girl and I can see myself growing old with her and I want some unbiased advice on how to handle this.

---   
**tl;dr**: My girlfriend of 11 months left me last week. We live a block away from each other and are in the same co-ed fraternity so we will still see each other a lot. We're  both going through depression and she left me because she does not think I am a happy enough individual to be in a long term relationship. I want her back and I want to prove I am getting better. "

If anyone wants to redirect me, feel free. Throwaway because he is a redditor.

Background; my boyfriend and I have known each other for 8 years, but we just started dating about 2 months ago. He moved to go to college in another state, so after texting and talking we realized we had feelings for each other.  

As most couples in a LDR, we enjoy sexting and sending dirty pics. I noticed something odd about his penis in the pics, but I wasn't sure if it was just the angle. I also noticed he was uncircumcised. No biggie right? Here's my problem. The a week ago during a Skype session, we got down and dirty and I realized his foreskin didn't retract beyond the head of his penis. Literally, you can't even see where the head of his penis is. I eventually asked him about it and he said he has issues with it, in that it can be painful to retract. His skin is apparently too tight or something and he has considered getting surgery to remove it.

So thoughts started running through my head, the first being hygiene. As a woman who has already had reservations about an uncircumcised penis (never been with a guy with it) I know there's a level of hygiene he can't possibly be doing if he can't retract it. I was really grossed out. 

Second, when we go to have sex, won't the chances of him ripping or tearing be awfully high? He said he has always used condoms, but as I'm on the pill and we've both been tested recently, we were going to forgo it. 

Am I being a horrible person? Am I right to be concerned? We can't get together physically for another 6 months as I'm doing an intense internship and working double shifts on the weekend and he has just started a new job. We're aiming for sometime in June, and while that's far away, I can't stop thinking about it. I know guys are sensitive about their penis so I came here.

Any advice, comments, thoughts, etc is greatly appreciated!

EDIT: WOW, Thanks for all of the comments and personal stories. RIP my inbox. As of now, I will bring up having him see a urologist or his GP to get a professional opinion. Whatever they decide I'm going to support. Thanks again!"

2n3c7j,7,2014-11-22,Post Graduate twentysome with 2k net worth and debt looking for advice.,13ea12,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2n3c7j/post_graduate_twentysome_with_2k_net_worth_and/,"With a networth of about 2k and a degree under my belt, I would imagine I am at the dead center of the current post collegiate spread. At the moment I have a total student loan debt of 8k, but a graduate windfall has pushed my savings to a level where I could pay off the total of my loans. I may be moving in the spring, so what would be the best use of my money? 


With about 10k spread between savings and checking accounts, and an 8k loan with a 4.5% interest rate, what should a twentysome with no retirement fund do? Is it reasonable to open a Roth IRA and put away some money now and start a 3 fund portfolio, or is the better move to keep my capital open for unforeseen future disasters. I know this sub values emergency funds, but is it worth it to start investing in the face of uncertainty. 


In terms of income I work several jobs weekly that do not amount to my career choice (but I do have an unpaid internship that is slowly progressing me to that point) that would put me solidly at the 18k a year range. With regular expenses at about 1k a month, which include student loan payments, is it reasonable to attempt to start a retirement portfolio, knowing that the most I can put down is a few thousand each year, or is my current situation more suited for a readily available cash reservoir.  


As a very recent college graduate I am a bit frustrated as I struggle to find employment where my passion is. While I did not know everyone that graduated with from my college, I do happen to see when my classmates begin to gloat over their newly secured positions, but I’ve also seen terribly driven individuals who have now become trapped in a debt prison. 



TLDR: 
Should I pay off all my debt now or take advantage of the relatively low federal loan interest rate to keep my money open in order to invest/have an emergency fund. Also I may be moving in Spring.

I've been there about six months, but it's really burning me out already. The workload is enormous, every day is insanely stressful, the benefits suck, and I'm working long/odd/sometimesweekend hours.


I knew when I graduated that I was probably going to have to ""pay my dues,"" so to speak, and take a job I didn't particularly love. But my current job is downright unhealthy. I barely have time to eat anything during the night, and I find myself running back and forth to the bathroom to minimize the time away from my desk. Heck, I even have nightmares about missing deadlines at work. Things don't look like they'll improve either; in the unlikely event I were promoted, I'd be looking at even more responsibility and more hours for a marginally-higher salary.

I'm tempted to take another job as soon as I can (even for lower pay), but I'm afraid that having a mere six-month stint on my resume is going to scare off potential employers. Before my current job I held several internship positions, and those were short-term gigs. 

Some friends have advised me to stick it out for at least a year and then start applying elsewhere, while others say my highest priority should be getting out of my current position.

Maybe you guys can get a virtual intern who instead of emails coming to you first they receive the emails reply to the ones they can for example someone asking do your id's have edge to edge holos or something. If the intern cannot answer they forward the email to you then you reply, this could possibly filter out hundreds of emails a  day I don't know just an idea that I wanted to throw out there. "

I'm also looking to hire some co-op students.

I'm noticing the buzz these days is all about internships, not co-ops (if you haven't heard of co-oping, it's basically a recurring internship, and usually alternates semesters instead of being summer-only). 10 years ago when I was going through school, they pushed co-ops heavily. Advantages they cited were that you get to learn more and work on harder projects, because you have enough time with one company to learn the details of what they work on.

My boss agrees with that advantage; there's a lot to learn about our software and field, so hiring someone who will take up 3 months of our time in training and then disappear forever doesn't make much sense.

But on the resumes I'm getting, most students say they're looking for internships. And I hear about interns making crazy amounts of money; some are being paid more than I am as an experienced full-time engineer (one intern said he got $2000/week). Needless to say, my small company doesn't have that kind of money to throw around.

I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. Suddenly I feel like I'm out of touch with what's happening in the rest of the industry.

For employers: how does a small company compete for student talent (either current students or fresh graduates)? I get the sense that I need to be more proactive about seeking out skilled students, but I really don't know what the best ways to do that are.

For students: how do I convince you that it's worthwhile to work for us, given that we're never going to be able to pay you as well as Google or Facebook?"

2n42c6,1,2014-11-22,"(F,21,Singapore) Why I wish I knew more about feminism when I was younger",tralala12310,lifeinapost,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeinapost/comments/2n42c6/f21singapore_why_i_wish_i_knew_more_about/,"My dad never made it a secret. He wished his first child were a boy. 

Even as I was growing up, my relatives would jokingly tell me about how much my dad wanted a boy to continue his family name. I stared at them blankly, unsure of how to respond. And when my mother was pregnant with her third child, all the relatives could talk about was whether it would be the boy my dad always wanted. My sister and I secretly crossed our fingers and hoped that those pesky relatives were wrong.

I am thankful that my mum never shared the same desire for a boy, so she made me feel like I was wanted. I learnt to dread Chinese New Year because my male cousins would always (I mean always) get more money than me. As kids, they would laugh at us girls and talk about how many more new toys they could buy with the extra money they had. I once confronted my uncle and asked why I had five dollars less than my male cousin. Thankfully I was young then and he did not take my ignorance the wrong way. He patted me on the head and said, boys should get more money and that's the way it is.

While I was too young to really understand the situation I was in, I grew up realizing that something was wrong. It took me 19 years to realize that I grew up in an insanely sexist household. Small things my dad did groomed my sister and I to think that we would always be inferior. He told us to cut our hair short because boys have short hair and short hair is therefore, good. When we refused, he called us ugly every time our fringe covered our eyes. He would yell at us when our hair touched our food, and yell even more when we spent money on clips. He told us how boys didn't need clips and how we are just troublesome kids that wanted too much. I brushed all these comments away and never told anyone about how much it bothered me. 

The girls in the family had this tradition. We would pick a day during the June holidays to go shopping for new clothes that we could wear for Chinese New Year (it's early, I know). One day, he came home from work and found out we had shopped. He never really approved of us spending money on new clothes. After all, in his words ""boys only need one shirt and one pair of jeans"". He saw the shopping bags, sat down and refused to look at anything we bought or even speak to us. 

Later that night, I heard my parents quarreling. 

The next day, I was at the patrol station with my mother. Her credit cards were rejected. Thankfully she had cash. 
Even though my dad was the sole breadwinner of the family, he had never willingly given my mother any form of allowance. Every month, my mum would have to ask it from him and every time he would give her a few notes that was barely enough to buy groceries for all of us. I always heard him ask, why are you spending so much money? Why are you always asking me for money?  Sometimes, he would glare at her before handing over the cash. She never said anything back. 

After the incident at the patrol station, my mother no longer had credit cards and hence, no longer had any money to spend. Things got worse between my parents (I never really knew the full story) and money became a huge issue. Not the lack of it, but its distribution among the family. Every cent my mother got, she had to fight for. And even for my allowance, I had to ask for it from my dad, only to have him glare at me and tell me how much money I was spending. 

In reality, I knew I was not spending much. I admired how other children got new things all the time and every time I even showed signs of wanting something, my dad would shoot me down. I grew up not being allowed to want anything new, but because I grew up that way I never really saw it as a problem.

It was not until my internship at AWARE did I realize that I grew up in an extremely unconducive environment. Yes, I lived in a nice condominium but the impact my dad made on my emotional health was damaging. I was shouted at (and once, hit) for the smallest of things and my mum always had to intervene and tell him to stop taking it out on us. He would walk away, without forgetting to turn back and curse at me. He would yell about how he did nothing to deserve this fucking family and that I was a fucking problem in his life. He would yell this in the presence of my two youngest sisters. 

Yet, in front of other relatives, he pretended to care. He spoke to us nicely, but once they left things would break loose. I was once asked to get out of his house because I did not let my male cousin play the game he wanted on the PS2. I tried defending myself, saying that I was in the middle of the game, but was met with more yelling. That argument concluded with ""I'm disowning you"". That was the first time I heard something like that, and it hurt. It was not the last time I heard it from him. I have since been disowned thrice.

It did not take me long to learn to hate myself, for the loudest voice around me was his. All I could hear was what I did wrong and how I made everything bad for everyone. I was 15 when a quarrel over dinner led me to lock myself up in my room and for the first time, try to calm myself down. 

Calm myself down by drawing lines on my left wrist with a penknife. 

The blood scared me at first but for a while, I felt momentarily free from the pain I had in me. Every time he yelled at me, I would just run to my room and lock my doors. When I lay in bed at night thinking about how I hate my life, I turned to the pen knife again. I lost sleep, I lost weight, I lost friends. My grades plummeted. I would not speak to anyone - not my sister, not my teachers, not even my own mother. Whenever someone asked me what happened to my wrist, I would make up an elaborate story about how I fell down along the road. It worked and no one questioned it. 

Self-harm was my way of coping for about a year before I realized I had to stop. I did, but it did not make me feel any better about my life. Instead, I turned to my studies and spent as much time on CCA as I possibly could just to avoid being at home.

Fast forward a couple of years to the summer I interned at AWARE. I helped out with their We Can End All Violence Against Women campaign and realized that there was something called financial violence and emotional abuse. I learnt about how domestic violence is hard to detect as it happened behind closed doors. It was difficult to prove to anyone, let alone the police. I learnt about how the police had failed victims. I picked up phone calls from women facing abuse. These were real women. They didn't just exist in movies, they were here. In Singapore.

I was overwhelmed with emotion as I learnt more about domestic violence. I felt ashamed for being someone who had gone through it. I felt even more ashamed when I saw people speaking out about their experiences but yet, I could not. I felt as if it was a fresh wound that never healed. 

Could I possibly have an abusive father? Does that make me... an abused child?

I was confused. For months I grappled with my past. People thought I had everything - a roof above my head, a family that was intact, relatively good grades - and I never proved them otherwise. People saw my dad as someone who cares a lot about his children, so how could he possibly be abusive? 

It took me almost two years to say this. But I now know I grew up with an abusive dad.

Why did it take me so long to realize this? Maybe because no one told me that he was wrong for treating my mother that way. I was told to believe that money was power, but that power can be abused. Denying my mother of money and hence restricting things she could do was wrong. No one told me it was wrong. Even my mum accepted it as part of her bad marriage. 

There are some things that should not be accepted. Things like punishing me disproportionately for the mistakes I made and hitting me to a point where my mum had to intervene. I was told by my grandma to apologize to my dad so that he would stop shouting, but I refused because I knew he was wrong. But my grandma came into my room that night and told me  how my apology would have solved everything and saved everyone the commotion. I felt guilty for weeks after that. 

Growing up, I was made to feel guilty for every mistake I made. Coupled with the mindset that I should apologize just to make him happy, I could have been in a very dangerous situation. Apologizing would have led him to think that he was right and hence, his actions were justified. They were not. 

You may be asking how my story is related to feminism. It starts off with explicit sexism but then goes on to talk about power in the household. Power in the household is very much a feminist issue, especially with the patriarchal backdrop in Asia. The acceptance that my dad was the breadwinner and hence could do whatever he wants also showed how little we all knew about financial and emotional violence. 

It is still difficult for me to admit this, but I did not have a happy childhood. How many girls out there are experiencing the same thing? Possibly one, possibly more. Whatever it is, my lack of knowledge about domestic violence and how violence is a result from the acceptance of my dad's overwhelming power over all of us has already impacted four lives. My mother, my two sisters and I have all suffered and we continue to do so today. Until 
now, I'm not sure what can be done.

In 2011, an unfortunate event changed my dad's attitude towards family and I guess he is treating all of us better. But there are some days he makes the same mistakes and I have not called him out on it, for I know it would result in a very unpleasant scene. I am just waiting for the day I become financially independent so that I can call him out on all his mistakes and hope he gives my sisters a better life than I have with him. 

I see this as a process. I am realizing that there is violence in my family. I do not have solutions yet, neither do I have the courage to bring it up and confront him. But at least this realization is a step forward, a step towards the happy family that my sisters and I always wanted since we were too young to remember.

Since shortly after high school, I have been working part time in food service while going to classes. So now I'm wondering about how to fit internships into this, because I need experience in my actual field. But for me this is all just a big question mark. I have no idea where to start on internships.

Here are a few of my questions: when am I ready for an internship? After I transfer to university and start actually working on the meat of my CS major, or could I start applying now despite my limited programming experience? How much programming ability am I expected to bring to an internship, and how much will they teach me? Should I be working on a portfolio, doing programming projects in my spare time so I can get ahead of class material? As of now I have only taken 2 programming classes (in Java), because that's all they offer at my community college, so I feel I am very far from being able to work on an actual piece of software.

He's basically been my college sweetheart and we started dating in our junior year. He's the best thing that's ever happened to me. He's super sweet, kind, caring - but we've both entered a rough patch and it's been hard for both of us. After graduation, he immediately got a job in his field. It's a one year contract, and his parents found him a nice apartment in a town 3 hours away and paid for the first months' rent.

Currently: I've been depressed. Not because of him being away, but my current situation. My mom hasn't worked for the past two years because she's always sick, whether it's from her nerve pain, arthritic pain, everything. I'm the oldest, so I'm pitching in 50% of our rent. I've been doing retail until I can find a decent full-time job, and I can't afford to move to another state. I have a younger sister who goes to school full-time and also has a job to support the family, along with two roommates who help with the other half of the rent. We've had cash assistance and food stamps for the past 5 years since my dad won't pay child support (although now, he technically doesn't have to pay for me since I'm over 21).

I have the skill set needed for a job in my field, but I can't catch a break. And every time I'm on Facebook I feel like every other person has a job or an amazing paid internship. All of that combined has really hurt my ego and I've just felt completely depressed for months. I contemplate suicide regularly, but I won't do it since I know that'd just be the easy way out, and things always get worse before they better.

Me and my boyfriend: My boyfriend is always sweet to me and tells me that things will get better. But he also complains to me about his job everyday. He talks about how much he hates being away from me and his friends, and how he refuses to make friends at his new place. I can't help but get so angry with him because he doesn't even realize how well he has it. His parents have helped him with everything - he has no loans, a nice apartment, and they won't take rent from him once he moves back home from work. My apartment is the nice of his basement. And yeah, I get to see our friends everyday, but I can't afford to. We got into a fight today because I told him, through text, that I contemplate jumping off my roof. He called me twice afterwards, so I told him to leave me alone because I didn't want to talk to him or anyone else, and I will just continue to apply to jobs. He said, ""Do what you want.""

I said, ""I love you, btw."", about an hour later. He said, ""Then show it.""

Yeah, I know, terrible communication skills, but I wasn't in any mood to speak to him over the phone. Be blunt people, have I been terrible?"

The invitation seemed intentionally cryptic, and it only said that it's purpose was to talk to top tech students in the state. The focus group ended up being very intimate - only about five students were there including me - and we talked for over an hour and a half with the head of engineering, the heads of recruitment, and the person in charge of college relations.

Despite the fact that this was never specified to be a recruitment session, most of the students were constantly alluding to wanting to work there, and everyone seemed really eager and were treating the session like a job interview. They toured us around the office and gave us food and emphasized things like their company culture in a very recruitment-esque way.

The actual session featured a lot of personal questions, asking about our hobbies and skills and backgrounds, then transitioned into questions about what we looked for in companies and what we thought made a good employer. They were taking very scrupulous notes, even during the parts when we were just talking about ourselves

Then, when it was over, they told us that they would keep our emails for ""future opportunities"" (again cryptic). I received an email thanking me and giving me the emails of the recruiters and head of engineering with nothing but the note that I should ""feel free to contact them with anything.""

I'm not sure what to make of this. Am I just totally misreading this? Was this legitimately just a focus group, or were they trying to recruit us? I'm not sure what I'm supposed to send to the email addresses I was given, and I would feel strange just sending my resume to them and asking about internships (they have none posted online, so I'm assuming they recruit in-person only). Anyone have any advice on how to read this situation?

tl;dr Got invited to a company ""focus group"" that went well, but now not sure how to turn this into a bigger opportunity."

2n5tfs,744,2014-11-23,Pedo mistook me for a child,iSarahBoBarah,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/2n5tfs/pedo_mistook_me_for_a_child/,"This happened about 10 years ago, when I was in my early 20s, still in college. 

For most of my adult life, I looked younger than my actual age. My college is well-known for having taken over the town, to the point that the town is synonymous with the university. I had a work-study job with the America Reads program (college kids tutoring primary school children in reading). I worked for a few hours, 4 days a week. I didn't have a car, so I rode my bike.

Note: one of the reasons why I always looked younger than my age is probably because I am 4'11"".

So,even though I was a college kid, I was one of those types that tried to dress somewhat business casual. I had an internship with a law office, too, so I had to be conscientious about that.

One day, it was during finals, so I had a break from my internship, and I'd overslept, didn't have much clean laundry, I wore a t- shirt and jeans to my job with the primary school kids and had no time to put on make-up. I had to wear my glasses, too, no time for contacts. I was there after the last bell rang, and walked to the bike rack. It was loud and chaotic--parents were picking up their children, and I really wasn't paying attention to anything, just trying to get to my bike so I could get to class. Looking back on it, me being so short and standing amongst kids who were going to ride their bikes home, I must have looked like a kid from a distance.

So, I collected my bike, and walked it put of the school proper, not wanting to accidentally run anyone down. Once I got to the sidewalk, I passed a man who I initially paid no attention to,  as I had assumed he was just there to pick up his child. I'm actually headed to the bus stop just a bit away because I was feeling lazy.

He starts walking next to me though, which I thought was a little weird, but I didn't pay much attention to that either. But he asked me my name, and I told him-- I'm an adult in broad daylight amongst lots of people on the biggest street in my town headed to school. I really had no reason to be afraid. Plus, I could see my bus stop, filled with people.


But then he asks me ""are you going straight home?""

I am weirded out, but I tell him ""no,"" but nothing else.

Then it gets stranger because he asks me if my parents pick me up most of the time, or do I always ride my bike, where am I going, where do I live, etc. all of this in this really weird, rushed jumble at once, not individual questions.

This is the moment I get it though, because, like, it's not uncommon to be asked where do your parents live when you go away to college, but this guy didn't ask, like, in a way of ""how far away?"" But like, what street specifically.

So, this is when I stop and say ""oh my God, do you think I'm a kid? I'm 20!""

He gets this weird look on his face and just walks away. 

I am unnerved and creeped out. This man thought I was a child and was hovering around a primary school around dismissal. 

And yes, I did report it. I never saw him again, though it did get a minor blip in our school newspaper.

2n5u1n,3,2014-11-23,Dukes and Stallion vs Other Muscle Cars Showdown - Los Santos Gearheads Online Magazine,[deleted],GrandTheftAutoV,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV/comments/2n5u1n/dukes_and_stallion_vs_other_muscle_cars_showdown/,"In early 2006, Warren Mullen was driving his Imponte Dukes in Bohan, Liberty City, when the timing belt snapped, ripping the radiator off and snapping some of the suspension at the front left of the car. The Dukes veered right off the side of the road and into the path of an oncoming flatbed truck. Warren was killed instantly, and the damage caused to the engine’s fuel lines caused an explosion that shut down the road for a good few days to the dismay of many local residents, who wanted to get close shots of the wreckage and bodies. 

An investigation found that the housing for the belts was the defective part, having worn away for years in a way that nobody from Imponte had expected to deal with nearly thirty or forty years after the car first hit the streets. A spate of similar accidents with both it and the Classique Stallion prompted backlash at Declasse for not allowing the wrecks into public hands for a cheap source of spare parts rather than keep them for investigation.

Of course, this being the period of economic crash, Declasse had better things to do than try and repair Sixties’ muscle cars, and instead tried to placate the drivers with promises of equal fun in a brand new Premier. It’s unsure how many idiots took up on this offer, but what was the case was that driving a Stallion or Dukes for several years became a thing of exceptional bravery to do, if the bad handling hadn’t already given the cars that reputation.

However, earlier this year, Los Santos Customs unveiled that not only had they managed to find a way to repair the engine housing, but they had bought up several of the old cars stashed in Declasse’s underground car park, and from dejected enthusiasts so these could be sold on later through Southern San Andreas Super Autos. And that’s exactly what’s happened. A good eight years after they became too dangerous to drive more than five feet, these classic muscle cars are now available to roam the streets of Los Santos in.

Doing a review of classic cars is always a bit of a danger, especially with Muscle cars, since there’s very little chance of the owners leaving them ‘stock’. Fortunately, this state of affairs means they’re easily available in great numbers (and great expense) and SSASA was happy enough to lend us a ’69 Stallion convertible in Midnight Purple, and a ’68 Dukes in Harbour Blue. 

The question then came of what to compare them to. After a bit of umm-ing and aah-ing, we decided that the two other iconic cars made by those manufacturers should be included, a 1980 Phoenix and a 1970 Sabre Turbo. Not mine, I should point out – with the money I’ve sunk into my own lady, it wouldn’t be even close to a fair match. Finally, we decided to take along the undisputed king of that time period with a ’64 Vapid Blade to complete the setup of iconic muscle cars. 

Then we had to come up with ideas for a location to test all these. The office intern suggested around Sandy Shores, since that’s a hotbed for muscle car freaks,. This was not what was considered a ‘popular’ opinion. The Lost MC that run the Sandy Shores airfield are not kind to those who want to spend all day doing drag races when they have planes coming in and out with their shipments, and Sandy Shores itself is a hotbed of racism and hostility towards city boys. But the boss thought this was a great idea and so we had to make arrangements. We’re looking for a new intern, by the way.

Fortunately, we found a sympathetic ear in Nils Odder.  Known as ‘Grin’ locally, he’s a regular at the Yellow Jack Inn near Sandy Shores and has been for many years. He’s also the organizer of the stock car events that happen in the desert.

Nils greets us as we turn up at the Jack with the Stallion and Dukes. To our delight, he’s smiling and grinning below the brim of a battered cowboy hat, his gut straining his flannel shirt, but despite his years, he offers a firm and inviting handshake. 

“Always a fan of Declasse metal,” he says with pride, gesturing towards the vehicle he’s brought along for the testing – a crimson and white Sabre Turbo almost identical to how it rolled out the factory. “As it should be,” he says with a firm nod, nose crinkling as he looks to the back of the car. “None o’ this fancy wheelie bars or spoilers or cut hoods fer big blowers.  She’s a beauty an’ y’all ought ta keep her that way.” I reluctantly reveal I have my own modified Sabre, but he seems satisfied that I haven’t ruined it with painted bumpers or roll cages. 

His scowl intensifies as one of our rival cars rolls into the parking lot. A Sunset Red Blade, a donation from the San Andreas Supercar club on the condition that it’s not photographed – it’s in the process of being re-worked, and it was just lucky that we were able to get its’ use before the new engine got put in. “My third son was born in a Vapid. S’why he grew up queer,” he mutters out of the corner of his mouth.  

The Phoenix is the last to arrive, and for even more complicated reasons, we can’t talk about the owner, or take photographs of it. Suffice to say that the owner was a low ranking member of a Hispanic-American gang looking for extra money and he didn’t want to be seen doing something like lending his car to a magazine. With that hanging over our heads, Grin begins to start making arrangements. 

Not only has he closed off some of the roads around the Grand Senora Desert National Park for a time trial with all five cars, but he’s organised a closed road running from Sandy Shores to the highway, exactly three-quarters of a mile long for a drag race. 

Since his boys are still bringing in the tyre barriers needed for the circuit race, we start with the drag race. The Dukes goes first, lined up on the wrong side of the road with no fear of the repercussions. I floor the throttle and grit my teeth, waiting for the explosion of noise and… oddly, I’m disappointed. 

I’m still somewhat taken aback by the lack of drama when the half mile point arrives and I need to navigate a little bend in the road. There’s none of the roar you can get in other muscle cars, and I wonder if this is a side effect of the engine rebuild. I’m told that it got a 32.335, and I’m fairly certain everything will go better than it. 

Well, they all make better noises, but clearly the Dukes has had something turned on in its’ absence from the roads. Only the Blade even gets close with a 32.734, and even then it’s closer to the Stallion and Phoenix with 33.001 and 33.036 respectively. The poor Sabre, despite the noise, can only manage a 33.336. I glance round to Nils to see his expression and he seems surprisingly calm for a guy who watched his car get fifth place. 

“Drag races are for those that can’t drive properly. We’ll see how she does on the circuit.” Words that settle my mind too. As a Sabre owner, this thrashing is embarrassing and I’m hoping the Declasse can bring back some much needed honour to the brand when we return to the Inn to await the track construction. 

It’s a simple enough circuit, all right turns, but as Grin points out, with cars like this, you often need to turn left around the corners anyway. The Stallion goes first, and for such a high up vehicle on its’ suspension, it seems to corner fairly well without any of the wallow that could be expected. It’s not what you would call rapid, but for the convertible version especially, it belies its’ nature with a rather pleasant ride that I managed to experience on the way over here. It adapts to circuit racing well enough, and finishes with a 34.968. Respectable, I thought. 

Grin’s Sabre is next, and you instantly seem to notice the twitchiness of the Declasse around the corner. I narrowly manage to avoid throwing it into a cactus patch on the first corner, and from then on I take it a little easier, but still putting the power down whenever I feel I can. I want this car to do well. With a 34.701, it’s two and a half tenths of a second clear of the Stallion, but I have a suspicion that was due to my banzai driving, and it wouldn’t get that reliably. I get into the Phoenix trying to engage the non-biased part of my head, and get ready for a lap. 

I suddenly have other things to think about. The Phoenix has a horrific amount of oversteer, the heavy car very keen to twitch out on you. Not wanting to incur the wrath of the Aztecas, I do my best to keep it out of the rocks and cacti, though a few trips into the dust and sand happen along the road to a 35.903. Unsurprisingly, our donor takes the car back as soon as it’s done and drives away without a word. 

The Blade is next, and one thing that strikes me with the odd stance of it with the high hood is that it can be very difficult to follow the road in front of you as compared to some of the other cars with a different rake. It takes a bit of track knowledge and pure guts to get the car around the track, but the Blade is a forgiving mistress and puts in a nearly effortless (but terrifying) 33.801. 

Finally, the Dukes. For a bit of background, this is the one with the optional painted roof, and the plastic bumpers rather than the chrome ones. In the older days this would have been the ‘cheaper’ option, probably why LS Customs was able to get their hands on it for the restoration process. For some reason, it doesn’t really fill me with confidence. 

I’m quickly taught the error of my ways. Not only is that quiet engine wonderfully torque-y and urgent on the power delivery, but the machine has wonderful grip and traction, turning without question and powering down the road to the next checkpoint. I never touch the sand with this, nor even come close to spinning off. The time of 33.267, five tenths and a bit clear of the Blade, cements it. Whatever LS Customs has done to the Dukes you can buy, it’s probably the best Muscle Car you can now get, perhaps even over modern ones like the Gauntlet and Dominator. 

It’s an odd feeling I have inside as I drop the keys to the Sabre back into Grin’s hand, and he invites me in for a game of darts and a drink. Over a bottle of Patriot beer, he tells me how he got into organising these events – that track we just raced was where he’d first got into a fight with someone else over a woman in the 60s, and he was challenged to race – his Tornado against the opponent’s Peyote. 

“I lost, of course,” he admits as he lands another perfect 180. “But it got me thinking that there’s something to be said for the thrill of racing real American muscle.” It’s why he worked so hard to start organising these events, the cars now sponsored by some of America’s biggest brands. “Because at the end of the day, it’s not whether your car’s the fastest, it’s how it makes you feel.” He looks at me seriously and I think he can tell what’s going through my mind. The Dukes is the undisputed best Muscle Car in San Andreas right now, and it leaves me completely cold. 

The Blade has left by the time I leave, and I’m given a lift back home in the passenger seat of the Stallion. It occurs to me that this is the one of the two I’d rather have despite its’ lack of modding capabilities and parts at LS Customs. It’s not as good as the Dukes, but it has a feel to it that’s… special. And as Grin said, that’s the whole point of a Muscle car, isn’t it?

**Essential Details**

* Vehicle: Classique (sold as a Declasse) Stallion**
* Retail Price: $71,000
* Engine: 5.6-litre V8 Naturally Aspirated
* Power: 
* Top Speed: 
* 0-60: 

**Pros:** 

* Looks gorgeous
* High ride height means it’s capable off road too
* Suits a lot of different paint schemes

**Cons:** 

* Lack of modification options
* Luck of the draw which version you get from SSASA
* More expensive than some of its’ fellows

**Verdict: 8/10**

Since this is meant to be a head to head with the Dukes, heart says yes, head says no. Wallet also says no, and looking across the Muscle Car range, there’s others that could tempt you away. Also probably isn’t as quick fully modified with no spoiler available to it.

**Essential Details**

* Vehicle: Imponte Dukes
* Retail Price: $62,000
* Engine: 7.4L-litre V8 Supercharged
* Power: 
* Top Speed: 
* 0-60: 

**Pros:** 

* Mind blowing performance
* Good value for money
* Lots of modification options

**Cons:** 

* What colour can you have the secondary in besides chrome or matte black, honestly?
* Lacks a 'spark' to make it a true muscle car

**Verdict: 7/10**

Not driving a Dukes is a sure fire way to lose a Muscle Car race. But somehow it seems to lack some of that soul that makes a true hero. The lack of desire to slide somehow tarnishes an otherwise very nice vehicle "
2n6d0h,9,2014-11-23,What do Quant Devs actually do? Will I need more experience / qualifications?,drp33t,quant,https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/2n6d0h/what_do_quant_devs_actually_do_will_i_need_more/,"I've recently started a software development job (developing and maintaining CFD codes) after completing a PhD in Civil Engineering (where I focused on developing new theoretical fluid models and optimising CFD codes to run on GPUs). However, while I enjoy the job, the pay is not great for my position. As a result, I've been looking at changing fields to finance, and in particular, being a quantitative developer (in London / the UK).

Since I don't know anyone who does quant dev, my questions would be:

1) What does the day-to-day work actually entail for a quant dev? I've read plenty of job descriptions and articles (both here and elsewhere), but I'm happiest when coding and optimising, not necessarily designing the next ""breakthrough"" algorithm.

2) I've got relatively strong experience in C/C++, Fortran, Python and Linux in general, plus a good grounding in stats and numerical methods; is that enough or would I need to go back to uni to do something financial (like [this](http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/postgraduate-study/msc-mathematical-finance-part-time))? Or would staying in my current job to get more programming experience on my CV be a better choice?

3) Are there any firms in the UK that offer internships for these types of positions?"

I had a bad prior experience doing that in undergrad (and I only did half time at that time). I don't want to lose the scholarship. Also, I have started working out again and focusing on my health.

If I took the internship, I wouldn't have to take out so much loans for grad school for the spring semester. Also I would gain tax experience (keep in mind that I also already have a Big 4 tax summer 2015 internship lined up- which I plan to accept a full time offer from if given). 

However, my exercise regimen and overall stress level may increase working and going to school full time. I don't want my grades to suffer. I don't want to be mentally ""taxed"" LOL.

What should I do? If I were to do both full time, how could I fit in exercising- which is very important to my happiness?

2n6r2u,1,2014-11-23,Flatline &amp; Friends: An Forewarning Tale,IAmJacksReveng3,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2n6r2u/flatline_friends_an_forewarning_tale/,"There are but two types of pain: The Pain of Sacrifice and the Pain of Regret. Don't regret that you didn't sacrifice enough. 

**
Hello again! I'm the author of [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2jt910/finding_peace_through_love_nofap_and_selfcontrol/) and my story continues. I was so overwhelmingly grateful for all of your kind words and encouragement that I felt I had to keep telling my fable. We all have contributions to make, knowledge to share; this community thrives because we are all regaining or finding our voices, and they cry in one for a better life. We fall and scrape our shins along the craggy path of uncertainty and failure, but a firm lift is always close behind from those who make sure you don't stay down. So once more, thank you NoFap.

That said, shit's kinda fucked right now. I'm in... the flatline. A few words on what it is and isn't in a bit, but I'm certain I'm in it. The initial wave of benefits associated with NoFap and testosterone retainment has largely become ""normal."" When the porn train halts, vitality dropkicks you in the chest. Poetic sunrises and the laughter of half-Asian children, all that good shit. But as quickly as life springs to action, it heeds a cruel warning that there is no life without sacrifice. Demons thought gone have merely grown stronger, and temptation wears cherry lip gloss. 

**Some Catch-up**
Let's start with the least important part first: My relationships with women. As I left off, I was courting a friend of a friend. Nothing came of it. She broke it off via a text message 4 days after our first date. It sucked, but instead of reading too far into it as I would have in the past, I've taken her reasoning at face value. Surely, I could nitpick moments when we weren't having a great time and attach a half-reason to that to soothe my own ego, but it's not constructive, and it's so much easier to just believe that she wasn't looking for a relationship at the time. Don't do it for a girl, NoFap, do it for yourself. 

**A Career**
And now the uplifting after that sullen bull: my career is taking off! You all had such rave words for my first writing and I really can't express my appreciation. I've wanted to work as a copywriter at an advertising agency for years. After 8 months of pounding the keys and dredging through job boards + an internship where I met my champion, I can proudly say I get paid to put words on paper. I credit the response I got from this community, as that was the only piece of writing above 140 characters that I have ever shared, to assure me that I had reason to trust my gut. Determination comes easy when you force yourself to balk on the mightiest urge of all. How in tune am I with my emotions and the moment? I broke down and wept tears of joy for having accomplished my goal. I whimpered like a baby seal, giggling and patting myself on the back all the while. Both emotionally and financially, things are only getting brighter.

**Flatline.**
So yeah, not a terrible place to be in life. But it's far from perfect. I really want relief, because I'm stressed. Success and stress skip hand in hand. Mo money mo problems, if you would. Release would be easy, but I know it's a false idol. Pixels can't make you happy, only content. But flatline is misery. I feel congested, backed up. My creativity is lacking (REALLY not ideal when starting a career in the creative industry), my gorilla strength from a month ago has vanished, and above all else, I want a woman to appreciate me sexually. I wasn't prepared for these emotions. How could I have been? I'd been an empty husk for years. I'm wound tightly and having difficulty relaxing right now. My confidence has taken a hit for reasons completely beyond my control. 

But I'm committed and optimistic. NoFap hasn't steered me wrong yet, and I know in my heart of hearts that flatline isn't permanent, and that I'll emerge stronger as a result. I've continued my meditation, cold showers, and making sure I get a hefty serving of veggies every meal, and of course, abstaining from porn.

Which is why I need to ask  those who've seen flatline out: What's next? My instincts are telling me to just ""get out there"" and meet strangers. I still live a sheltered, cushy life. I'm not much of a social bug, but I feel that I'd be greatly rewarded by the company of others if I tried to be. I also really want to meet girls. I HAVE to, its primal at this point. I have to leave my basement and put myself around others more often. How do you all meet new people? I'm not looking for a technique so much as a nudge in the right direction. 

I love myself. That's the difference between flatline and depression. This FEELS temporary, not like a life sentence. We'll see this through, brothers, I know you won't let me fail. Addiction doesn't play fair, it stomps your heart and claws at your eyes and always gets it's shots in below the belt, but we're stronger together."

This coming week I'll be interviewing for a position with the company I currently work for. I work as an IT Administrator on a team with one other IT admin and a couple help desk employees. It will be myself and the other IT Admin interviewing for this position. The position will start as a mix between technical and managerial, however with our growth I am sure the position will become mostly managerial soon enough (I'll be asking this question in the interview). 

I have interviewed potential employees for positions in our department before, and because of that feel like I would be more than comfortable being interviewed again for this position (I was hired in as Help Desk and was promoted, so I never had to interview for my current position). I realize a position as a manager will bring different questions and topics in the interview than what I'm used to talking about. That is why I'm hoping to turn to you guys for any help you can offer. I have a list of possible questions that I'm preparing for, and am coming up with some I want to ask myself, but am open to hearing from as many resources as I can find!

What questions or topics of discussion should I be prepared for most?

What questions should I ask the panel of people interviewing me?

What should I avoid talking about or make a point to talk about?

As for my resume that I am touching up now, what are some things I should keep in mind? Should I still include short term internships I had in high school and college? (I have been out of college for 4 years, and have had 2 internships and 2 jobs in the field throughout my life). 

I appreciate any advice or heads up on anything I listed or may have not thought of!

This meant I haven't even contacted my mother and grandmother, whom I love very much.

Two nights ago, I have finally decided on two very important matters and I have felt an extremely heavy burden being lifted from my shoulders.

I have decided that the next time I see my mother I will set strict conditions on her if she ever wanted to see and visit me. I will demand, not request, that she should do the following:

1. Leave my scumbag of a father
2. Do not tell my dick of a brother my whereabouts until I'm ready to tell him myself
3. Only she can visit me, no one else from the family.
4. RESPECT my boyfriend and his mother, putting aside her racist views
and above all else:
5. Respect me and give me the respect I have been, and am entitled to.

I have decided that if she were to disagree with my conditions, I will cut off contact with her forever and refuse to acknowledge her from then onwards.


The second big decision I have made is for me to finally gather up all of my courage to save up and apply for a six month student exchange to Canada and study there before I head off to my internship for my final year at University. I had never imagined that I will be allowed to to overseas on my own, but now that I am the sole driver of my life, I can and I will.

* In job #2, I met all of the qualification, yet didn't get the interview.  The relative of an employee with almost the exact same qualifications was hired.
* Want to know if there is any legal recourse?

First a little background on myself:  I'm a 4-year military veteran that recently graduated with a degree in computer science and IT.  I graduated this May and have been looking for a job since my internship ended in August.

In July I saw that two positions were available at my alma mater that I was more than qualified for.

---

The job requirements for job #1 were:
&gt;""...an associate degree in a technology related field or two years of experience providing information and/or instructional technology support.
&gt;
&gt;""...applicants must have a strong working knowledge of computer technology and hardware, audio/video systems, and video conferencing related equipment, a thorough knowledge of methods for troubleshooting IT equipment issues, effective verbal and written communication skills with the ability to interpret and deliver technical guidance demonstrating strong interpersonal skills.

Preferred requirements for job #1 were:
&gt;""...applicants will have expertise with Interactive Video (ITV) conferencing and/or web streaming technology used for instructional delivery and in instructional design support.""

---

The required job requirements for job #2 were:
&gt;""a baccalaureate degree in Computer Science or related field""

Preferred requirements for job #2 were:
&gt;""Six months experience in a System/Network Management or Technical Support position is preferred (internships acceptable).
&gt;
&gt;""Preferred candidates will have experience with system and network administration and the ability to design, develop, implement, and administer tools to effectively manage IT infrastructure systems using a wide variety of operating systems, programming/scripting languages, databases, utilities and application tools. Candidates should also have strong team, communication, and project skills.""

---

Since I have a BS with two majors that are technology-related, and 2+ years experience (I was a student worker for the department I applied for), and a vet, I was sure that I would at least make it to get an interview.  (I had previously applied to the job #1 in October before graduating, had a phone interview, but not an in person interview, and found out later that none of the people who made it through to on-site interviews had decided to accept the position and that they would start the search again in approximately 6 months.  This leads me to believe that I was obviously qualified from job #1 the first time the position was open.)

The hiring process took an extended time this go round.  I heard nothing for months, asked people I was friendly with that worked there, etc.  I eventually e-mailed the head of the department in September to see how it was going, and was told that it might be a while as the process was in progress still.  Again, I heard nothing back officially on the positions.

I found out today that the positions had been filled.

The person that was hired for job #1 however is the son of a woman that works in the department.  The thing is, he has a communications degree and his work experience is relatively similar to mine (working as a student worker for his mother in the department) except that he worked in the department longer.

The person that was hired for job #2 is also related to a person that works in the department, although I'm not 100% what the relationship is (either uncle-nephew, cousins of some sort).  He has the nearly the same qualifications as I do, as we are friends and graduated within 5 months of one another and worked at the same student worked job together.

It seems that in both cases I'm equally if not more qualified for the job, and was passed over for people who were related to current employees.  In both cases I'm pretty sure that veteran's preference would apply to either position.

Long story short, I'm curious if there is any legal recourse in this matter?"

Greetings lads. I'm an 18 year old who has quite a confusion in my life. Although from a young age I was a very independent kid, I feel like I currently need guidance like never before. I'll try to keep this as short and as structured as possible. Feel free to answer as much of my questions as you want.

Shortly about myself: from eastern Europe, living without parents since 15 (got into the country's best high school in a distant city), dangerously adventurous, very sociable. My father likes to tell me that I have a ""good head"" and I feel like I really do, but this kind of ruined me. I've become a little arrogant and even narcissistic at times, but I'm a master at hiding it and successfully using the placebo effect this gives me. I never did any homework in school, but still got very good or at least decent results. Being able to outsmart people caused me to earn some sociopathic traits, which I both hate and love. I also love aviation more than anything.

Off to the problems I face:

General path, career and finance: I'm currently a freshman in a university. Industrial technology management is what I study. Chose it due to the potential this speciality has, novelty in my country (I will be of the first generation of industrial managers) and management part. I recently got an internship at an aviation services company, but it consists only of working as a phone book filler 4 hours a day, non-paid (3 monhs). Although aviation is what I love and I'd like to work in that company in the future, but lately this internship bothers me a lot. Why? Because I currently live for roughly ~37$ a week and I feel like I should have found a paid job instead of an internship which brings me very little experience. I feel really bad for not being able to engage all the fun stuff my peers are doing due to my financial situation. This even caused me to borrow some money (small amount, which is relatively big to me) which I'm currently unable to return. What would you do in my situation? Buckle up and continue my internship or find a paid job? Maybe I can do something else to earn money without leaving internship?

Friends and women: I am overloaded with social energy and try to use it in the most effective way possible. I read about body language and evolutionary psychology, because I love to have upper hand in communicating and being able to explain why we are the way we are. But this social pragmatism often doesn't sit on the same page with morality. I also really like to often change people I'm communicating with. Usually I get bored with a person in less than a week if I'm continuously get into contact with him. This causes me to go from a person to person befriending them, sucking some social energy from them and then levitating away. It's my drug, it makes me feel good about myself because I'm able to do that so easily. Same goes with girls - I've had only one girlfriend (for a staggering one month) but had countless short-term affairs. It sounds cool and fun, and it sort of is, but then it gets lonely... Problem is that this seems unsolvable. I just can't force myself to be more constant with people, because they get uninteresting so fast. I'm not even able to form an exact question here, but maybe there are guys who are in similar situation and could share their experiences of how to get that long-term loneliness away?

Habits: I have all the worst habits you can imagine. Messy, lack of studying habits, occasional liar, smoker (both weed and cigs), no working out, skipping classes. I prioritize short-term instead of long-term way too much. I feel like a mixture of a hedonist and a nihilist.  I'm conscious of my shortcomings but am unable to change them, because each time I try to, my brain just outsmarts me, finds logical and philosophical grounds to abolish all the commitments I make to myself. The worst thing is that despite all my shitty habits I'm doing fucking great - best high school, best university of my field in the country, good grades at all times (how do you get yourself to study, when you can get good results without doing it?), popular at uni, beloved by both parents and friends. It's very hard to motivate yourself to change when everything is going so well but at the same time it kind of doesn't... I don't trust myself. There is this lump of guilt inside which isn't big enough to move me, but isn't small enough to not bother me. How do I find strength to become a better person, a man?

TL;DR: I'm golden on the outside, rotten on the inside."

Before I start, sorry for my bad english, it's not my main language. I'm still a student in actuary and I've done 3 intership so far. With this experience, I have a good idea of what I like but I'm not sure if there's a path that exist that have everything that I like. 

When I was doing an internship as a consultant in pension, I really liked the finance aspect of it where we had to analyse the invesment proportion of the pension money and in what kind of financial vehicule we were going to invest the money in.

To be fair, the only aspect I really liked in pension was the finance point of view. My favorite internship was in casualty, but it didn't really have a finance aspect to it. What I loved about casuality was analysing data, making models to analyse certain variable etc. 

Is their a path in actuary that would have the analyzing data part but with a finance aspect to it? My future goal is to be fellow and do my CFA as well. Thanks in advance and sorry again for my poor english.

They only request the best five for both, with a 90 character limit, so that's what I've currently decided is the best. I have the option to add either a bronze duke of ed. award or flag football leader but I've decided to leave both out so far. If anyone finds one of them more worthy of being on the list than another, please let me know. 




Assuming my marks and my E.C's/Awards/Employment stay the same, and my essays are at least slightly above average what would you suggest in terms of improvement and the odds of acceptance.




NOTE: One thing I've been worried about over the last few months is a course a re-took from the summer. I was going through some rough stuff at home, and I ended up receiving slightly below the cut-off in advance functions. I'm retaking the course now, and will certainly end up with above a 90%, but will this hurt/prevent me from being accepted to the program?

2n7wjw,2,2014-11-23,Me [18m] with my ex [18f] Broke up after 2 years. feeling lonely and lost. I wish I could do something.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2n7wjw/me_18m_with_my_ex_18f_broke_up_after_2_years/,"Me [18M]  -  Her [18F]

First, a little back story. Lots of words incoming.

We met in our junior year of high school. We got close very fast and started seeing each other. She and I were very close throughout the rest of school, and for 8 months afterwards. We were both always interested in similar things, mainly art. She helped me be more social and gave me a reason to try harder for myself and to pursue my interests. I would not be where I am without her. She was always so understanding and open to anything I wanted to talk about. 

After we graduated, she went on a 7-week trip to France with one of her friends and her family. We talked as much as we could over Skype and I began to feel depressed because I missed her so much. After she got back, it felt like she had changed. She told me she drank pretty often there (lower legal drinking age) and once got very drunk at a club. This bothered me quite a bit because she had never done anything like that before and it hurt to not know what she was doing while we were away. The change didn't really bother me much, but I kept getting a feeling that I didn't know her as well as I had thought.

Anyway, after she got back we began to get closer and closer to each other, and I was having the best few months of my life. She was so unique and unlike any girl I had ever met. I loved all her little quirks and just about everything about her. I still do. We were both extremely happy and I felt really lucky to have someone like her by my side for the future, and she felt the same about me. It felt like it was meant to be, as they say.

After a while she started going to community college to study art, which I hadn't started yet. She took classes for most of the week so we were only able to see each other for the weekends, usually only once a week. This went on for a few months and I was still very happy even if we didn't get to see each other very often. She made a couple of guy friends in her college who she started hangout out with after class and in her free time, who she called her best friends. It really hurt to know that she spent more time with them than she did with me, and that I didn't have any friends who I would say I was close to. She was the person who knew me the best and the person I talked to every day. My best friend.

She started to seem a bit distant for a couple weeks. I asked her about it one night and she told me how she was feeling. She said that she felt like she had matured and that I my mind was still stuck in high school. That she felt like she had to tell me to do things that I really did need to do (apply for college, practice my art more, get a job). She was right, of course, but my laziness and my blind love for her made me only focus on her and I never got anything done for myself. I didn't think it was a big deal and I promised her that I would start trying to get things done.

Three days later she came over and ended it. I have never experienced emotion like I had that night. She kept saying that we were “in different places” and that she had changed. She said that she had been crying every day for the past few days, and was trying to reason with herself about us for three weeks beforehand. She said that she still loved me and that she wanted to be in my life still. That I was important to her. It was very hard to process.

Four weeks later, she seems to be over it. She has gotten both a very good first job and an internship over the four weeks since she left, making me feel very incompetent. She never really showed any signs that she was hurting. We met a week after we broke up and she was emotionless and cold. It was like nothing ever happened. She said it was how she dealt with these kinds of things. Just shutting them out and not thinking about them. Not seeing her show the least bit of emotion just tears me apart.

I feel so clueless as to how to deal with this. I spend most of my time at home at the moment, as I’m waiting to attend college in the spring. Every little thing I see reminds me of her. I’m a bit antisocial so I have very few people I can talk to. We text every now and then, very briefly. She wants to be close to me, but understands if I need some time alone, even if it feels like I could never cut contact with her. I have tried, but I just break the NC very quickly. I know it’s an important part of getting over someone, but the longer I spend not talking to her the lonelier I feel. I couldn't imagine her not even being a part of my life. 

The past few weeks have been hell for me, and nothing really seems to matter except for her. I haven’t begged or tried to get things back together because she seemed so adamant about her decision. Everything just happened so fast and knowing that there’s nothing I can do makes the pain worse. We never had a fight and agreed on just about everything. I really thought we had something special, so it’s been hard for me to believe this is really happening.

I feel like i screwed up my only chance to have a long, happy relationship with her, and that i could have done things differently and it would have worked out. I don't see myself being happy with anyone else. I wish there was something I could do to fix things, but I know there is nothing i can do. She mentioned that we might end up together in the end, but I'm not keeping my hopes up.

Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this. I’ve always just been a lurker here on Reddit so I'm hoping I can get some alleviation for the pain by trying something new. I apologize if I sound selfish or if some things don’t make any sense. This was my first relationship so I’ve never experienced any of these feelings before.

**tl;dr**: Girlfriend broke up suddenly after two years of being very happy together. Feeling torn up, empty, and lost. I feel like I lost my only chance at being with someone who is perfect for me."
2n83l0,6,2014-11-23,"Please, I don't want to die but I just have nothing left to live for and can't keep fighting a world that doesn't want me.",[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2n83l0/please_i_dont_want_to_die_but_i_just_have_nothing/,"I never thought it would come to this but here I am. I have dealt with quite a bit of depression on and off over the past 15 years and wished for death, but this is the first time that I can clearly see myself grabbing a knife and slitting my wrist. I already had it there during my shower today but pulled it away. 


I just finished college and have just started a job in my field. Its miserable, nothing makes sense, I struggle to relate to any of my 20+ years older coworkers, and I just feel like a fool after every question I ask. I already feel like I won't survive if I don't get out now and so intend to quit tomorrow, but between the misery that is this and that was my internship, I feel like I've just wasted the last 4 years of my life on something I've grown to hate and am completely lost as to anything else to do except minimum wage jobs or sales, which I also hate.

My family outright ignores me. I live with my brother and his wife right now and no one batted an eye when I started going immediately to bed after work or when I spent all of Saturday in my room, even skipping meals(all there is is a bed in there, so its not like I could've been watching tv or something). No acknowledgment of me at all right now. Not to mention hundreds of other times they ignored or forgot me, plus the many times my brothers' needs seem to supersede mine( like when I needed the car to get to school, but he wanted to go to the gym, so I had to ride a bike in 90+ heat and be late).

I have no friends left. Often times I'd ask them to do something and be left with excuses or ignored. After a good year of this, I've given up and haven't heard from anyone in months.

My ex-girlfriend used me as a surrogate boyfriend, when we tried to remain friends after breaking up, until she found someone she actually liked, at which point she refused to speak to me again. No reason, no big fight or anything, no goodbye, just silence. I tried to reconnect with her recently, which is when the using was made clear via her best friend, who is an acquaintance of mine.

Finally, people in general just ignore me. Often times people don't even acknowledge when I speak or will talk over me. The other day a woman walking into target ahead of me held the door, so I thanked her, and she gave me a shocked look before saying ""oh, it's actually for that guy."" Not to mention the numerous times I've been called ugly by strangers and children or the guy on the bus who said I look like a rapist or the woman who screamed in terror when I tried to give her a flyer(doing work for my brother that I was never thanked or paid for...).


I guess I just am hoping someone, anyone, can give me a reason not to go through with this. I'm terrified but I am at the end of my rope and nothing else makes sense. I even went for a 5 hour walk in hopes I'd be too tired to go through with it but on coming home, sore and limping, and seeing no one cared that I had left without a word, keys, wallet, or phone, has kinda brought the feelings back."
2n84g9,0,2014-11-23,"""Think Outside the Box"" Real-World Problems with Real-World Rewards",FuSoYa69,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2n84g9/think_outside_the_box_realworld_problems_with/,"This has been making its rounds elsewhere on Reddit but I wanted to alert the folks here.  I recently became aware of a site called [MindSumo](https://www.mindsumo.com/) where you can submit engineering-centric solutions to real-world problems and, possibly, get a cash payout for good ideas. 

You need a .edu email address to sign up.  Typically, rewards for good submissions are $50-$150 with new ""challenges"" submitted continuously.  Once you've accrued $100 you can cash out to Paypal and then as soon as every $25 thereafter.

Get $5 (with promo code: UMICH_SUMO) + $30 bonus added to your account when signing up.  There are also numerous easy ways to get bonuses toward your first $100 payout including completing a profile, writing an article about your experience, submitting your first proposed solution, etc. 

Full disclosure: By using UMICH_SUMO, you get the $5 bonus and I get a $1 referral bonus. 

Proposed solutions can be as complex or simple as you like.  Some might involve simply writing, others some design or sketching, some may even include programming.

Now, some personal thoughts.  

I was a practicing engineer for eight years before returning to school (I'll let you guess where based on the referral code).  In that time, I was faced with a number of challenges that required first-of-a-kind solutions.  I had the good fortune to work with two very experienced engineers who had honed their abilities to derive creative solutions to those problems and who were terrific mentors to me.  I see this website as providing a way for engineering students to practice creative problem solving for real problems, with the added benefit of a potential cash payout.  Depending on the amount of time/work you invest, you also begin building a portfolio of mini-projects when it comes time to discuss ""past work"" during interviews.  Is there the prestige, networking opportunities, or level of experience of an internship.  No.  However, if you show that you're passionate about solving problems and can discuss a novel solution that you developed (regardless of the field), that *will* get the interviewer's attention if they are truly looking for a creative technical worker.

Please don't hesitate to post a comment below if you have a question about MindSumo or, frankly, about what it's like to be an engineer (or about what it's like to be an engineer who returned to school after having worked a while).

**TLDR** Opportunity to practice thinking creatively to solve real problems with potential fiscal reward and low barrier to entry."
2n8a4u,0,2014-11-23,PwC vs. EY Atlanta Spring Internship,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2n8a4u/pwc_vs_ey_atlanta_spring_internship/,"So I did my office visit in PwC and loved it. The head assurance partner and I really hit it off. We ended up talking about SEC football for a half hour. Everyone I talked to was great. 

Now for EY.. I actually did my office visit in Orlando, but the recruiter hooked me up and got me the ATL offer. I talked to a partner, but the conversation was nothing special. I wanted FSO for EY, but ended up getting non-FSO. The partner and recruiter said I should be able to work with some FSO clients for the internship and maybe this can lead to me getting a full-time offer for FSO. I actually haven't met too many associates at EY in Atl.. I do have a few classmates who will be interning with them. My main fear for EY is I end up auditing cash for Coke/Delta for two years.. 

Few more things to consider: 
The EY offer is $2 more than the PwC offer and from what I hear EY won't limit the hours I work as an intern, while PwC will limit my hours to 60 at most. 

Also, I think I eventually want to transfer into FDD or consulting. 

Thanks for hearing me out!

With that, I plan on being a looking for a church and was wondering if you would have any advice for locating one, getting involved, building relationships, etc.

Here is a little bit of background on churches I attended: grew up going to an Orthodox Presbyterian church until around 14, then attended a non-denominational evangelical church until high school. 

In college, I attended a much larger Evangelical church, which I would say leaned somewhat in the middle politically (being in a fairly Liberal city, open to evolution, big focus on being involved in community). One other interesting experience I had was when I was out of state for an internship, I found a small church for a few months (fairly conservative evangelical), but I kinda felt out of place when everyone else was in their late 20s and married, or engaged (my GF was back home at the time)."

2n8jiw,4,2014-11-24,Guilt over wanting to quit undergraduate research position,WiiPu,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/2n8jiw/guilt_over_wanting_to_quit_undergraduate_research/,"I'm a junior in college and I got a position as an undergraduate volunteer research assistant last June. When the professor and I were discussing expectations for my involvement, we decided that the minimum amount of involvement would be ~40hrs/week in the summer and ~13 hrs/week for the fall semester. In the summer I mostly assisted my grad student w/ various tasks, and at the start of the fall semester I got my own project to work on. Well, it's the middle of the fall semester and I think I want to quit after the semester ends. No one in my research group has any idea; they think I want to work in the lab until I graduate (though I have never expressed such sentiments).

However, I learned I'm not very passionate about research and the possibility of grad school, and I haven't been able to balance schoolwork and lab work very effectively (along with bouts of depression/suicidal thoughts). The nature of the work involves setting aside large amounts of time (sometimes up to 7hrs of active work) to complete experiments, and I feel this is very difficult to do with a challenging course load. These facts may be just excuses, though. I'm satisfied with the amount of time I put into the lab during the summer, but I haven't put in near the amount of time that was expected during the fall (~6-8 hrs/week as opposed to 13hrs/week). I do make sure to communicate with my grad student my time difficulties.

My guilt lies in the facts that I:

 1) haven't made any real progress on my project. That is, I have practically nothing to show after a semester's worth of work. It seems that every week during group meetings when we discuss updates in our research I have nothing to present. Every goddamn week, and it's my fault. I know. This ties into my not putting in the hours to get experiments done.

2) The grad student who I work with has invested an incredible amount of time in helping me learn about techniques and concepts about the research, and I haven't contributed anything close to justify the level of support I've received. My leaving the group would be a lost investment when he was expecting me to stay and possibly publish results.

3) I recently received an internship offer at a company for the following summer, and I just told my professor the exciting news. However, I feel that telling him now about want to quit might make him feel used as a means to an end and bad feelings may be had. Though I do value his being one of my references, my sentiments about the group existed long prior to the news about the internship.

The question is, do I continue paying my dues into the next semester, or should I tell my professor my feelings, and what would be the most gracious way to do so? I love being around the grad students and the professor as they are great people and have contributed a lot to my personal development, but I just don't want to do the research anymore.

I don't know, any words of advice would be greatly appreciated. It just made me feel a little better to write this down. Thanks for reading."

The school touts itself as the ""world's honors college"".

I'll be obtaining a B.S. in Computer engineering. Relevant Coursework: Engineering Foundations: Design &amp; Innovation, Engineering Foundations: Digital Logic, Engineering Foundations: Circuit Fundamentals, Engineering Foundations: Simulations &amp; Computational Methods, Engineering Foundations: Instrumentation, Sensors, Actuators; Engineering Materials, Advanced Digital Logic, Computer System Programming, Computer Architecture and Organization, Introduction to Operating Systems, Software Engineering I, Communication Networks, Data Structures and Algorithms, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Introduction to Databases, Foundations of Computer Graphics, Introduction to Game Programming, Game Development Studio I, Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Discrete Math.

I'll be taking Embedded Systems and Statistics and Probability for Engineers next year.

As you can see, I've enough math courses for a math minor, and a large amount of courses shared with Computer Science, Game Development, and broad engineering foundations. Not mentioned above, I've also taken Foundations of Science, which covers physics, chemistry, and biology. I've also taken several technology-oriented humanities.

My current GPA is 3.165. Not too stellar... And my GRE scores are 159/164/4.0

Extracurriculars-wise, I'm the treasurer of my school's Student Interest Group focused on Videogames, videogame culture. I've also done volunteer work as part of my school's engineering group, ""Engineers for Social Impact"", and gone to Sri Lanka to help construct buildings for a village.

I have some internship experience as well. I've worked as an intern at the Abu Dhabi office of Gensler, an architecture firm, and I've also worked at NBCUniversal as an Operations and Technical Services intern, commuting from my home in CA to their office in Universal City. Both paid internships. And the summer prior to college, I worked as a volunteer swim coach at my community's children's swim league.

I've published one paper to I2MTC 2014, and am currently doing capstone research in Computer Vision.

I have 3 professors willing to write my letters of recommendation.

I’m Amy K. Nichols, author of the YA science fiction novel NOW THAT YOU’RE HERE, which will be published by Knopf on December 9.

&amp;nbsp;

Here’s a little about the book:  

One minute Danny was running from the cops, and the next, he jolted awake in an unfamiliar body—his own, but different. Somehow, he’s crossed into a parallel universe. Now his friends are his enemies, his parents are long dead, and studious Eevee is not the mysterious femme fatale he once kissed back home. Then again, this Eevee—a girl who’d rather land an internship at NASA than a date to the prom—may be his only hope of getting home.

&amp;nbsp;

Eevee tells herself she’s only helping him in the name of quantum physics, but there’s something undeniably fascinating about this boy from another dimension . . . a boy who makes her question who she is, and who she might be in another place and time.

&amp;nbsp;

The sequel, WHILE YOU WERE GONE, which will be published the summer of 2015, tells the story of the other Danny and other Eevee in the alternate universe, while changing your understanding of the first book.

I've been setting up other interviews and i'm in a tight spot now. 

Last friday I was offered a full-time salaried position with a local firm. Pay is great, full benefits. Problem is: they would want me to stay in town for my masters and work part-time. I want a masters in taxation which the local college does not offer, and I am very likely leaving the state for a masters. I did not tell them this. Essentially I would be quitting 6 months down the line and lying all along about my plans. 

This wednesday I have an office visit with a top 10 public accounting firm for an internship. An internship would be ideal for my situation - I would like to go to grad school, finish the cpa exam, then come back full time later. 

If that doesn't work out - I have an interview two weeks from today for a seasonal position with a big four firm. If I took a seasonal gig I wouldn't have to be shady and quit a salaried job, plus there might be mobility to move up to an associate position after the seasonal job. 

I've been told that i should immediately accept the salaried position, but keep interviewing. I don't feel that it's right to get their hopes up, nor do I feel that it's right to accept a salaried permanent position then quit a few months down the line. I've been told that I need to look out for myself first, but the shareholders of this local firm are very well connected and I wouldn't want to give myself a bad reputation by screwing them over. Plus if i piss them off they might not sign off on my work experience for the CPA. 

On the other hand - if i don't accept and the other interviews don't go well, i could end up with no job. 

What should I do? "

The only issue that may come up is I'm supposed to do a thesis (for the company I intern with, kind of like a big project that helps better the company) before I graduate and they may consider the one year I have remaining not enough time to do that. Really nervous, but excited at the same time. I think my resume is really quite good and I'm pretty good at interviewing. I just hope the thesis thing isn't too big of an issue :/

I interviewed at a software company at a school career fair and the called me for a phone interview. The interview went well and the recruiter and I seemed to get along well. I'm scheduled to go in for a personal interview soon. However, I began search more and more about the company and a lot of people have told me to stay clear of them. I read some testimonials from past interns saying that they felt the company had poor management and did not gain anything meaningful from the experience..


I went in to talk to someone about it at the career center at my school and managed to actually find a student who had interned there in the past. Even they expressed that they would not recommend interning for them and to pursue other options. I even found out about a nasty lawsuit they are apparently battling right now.

I don't really have the internship yet, but this has gotten me super worried about the position if I do get it. I still have some more options to pursue for summer internships, but I just wanted some input from you guys!"

At 18, got a job in a prepress printing company and went up the ladder from film duplicator to running the entire workflow on the company on night shifts (borderline manager). Worked there for 9 years. Not CS related, I know. 

A year later, I decided to start college in CS related major in a U.S. accredited university in the Dominican Republic. This took approx. 5 years due to the fact that the major has 224 credit hours. Yes, it was extensive and difficult, and without any summer breaks.

Took an IT Helpdesk Intern job in the Dominican Republic for 4 months.

Now 34 years old and recently graduated with a 3.3 GPA and cum laude honor, I have been applying (for about 1-2 weeks) to approximately 60 entry level positions in the NYC, Atlanta, and San Fran areas, and have only gotten 2-3 phone calls regarding temporary 2 weeks or 6 month positions.

Be honest, reddit. Am I just not desirable as a 34 y/o entry level Software Engineer? How can I prove myself? I have a strong desire to make this my main career, just need someone to give me a chance, or a direction on what to do to become extremely desirable. Thanks in advance, guys.

Is this my (30/f) place?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2naosr/my_ex_31m_uses_women_for_money_is_this_my_30f/,"This is long and complicated. He's a redditor so I will be changing names and minor details.

My ex (Bryan) and I dated for 7 years throughout high school and college. Long story short, I found out he was using me emotionally while cheating on me with other women. Basically, he used me as his ""real girlfriend"" and had side chicks that he would deceive for gifts, a way in to clubs/hot spots in NYC, connections, networking, etc. These women had some type of connection, a way in, and had lots of money. He was a med student while we dated but now is a physician. While he was doing this, he got internships, taken to dinner, on vacations, the whole deal. We were long distance so this was fairly easy for him to do. He only saw me every other weekend. He never had feelings for these women, so he claimed. Bryan never scammed or did anything with me. Like I said, I was his ""lets have sex and pretend we're in love"" girl. I had no connection or money for him. I was flat broke. Did he love me at one time? Maybe. Probably not.

I found this out one day while I was in his apartment by snooping in his email. I found out everything and he begged me to stay. Then he got angry and begged me not to tell anyone. He did it for two years while we were together with 18 different women. I didn't want anything to do with him anymore. I wasted 7 years on this guy and couldn't stand to waste another second so I left. I didn't tell anyone. I just up and ran.

Now I'm married with children. I'm very happy. To preface this, I'm completely over Bryan so I am not contemplating ""ratting him out"" for some benefit for me or to get back at him. 

This is why I'm seeking advice. Yesterday I saw Bryan and a girl named Samantha at the grocery store. Holding hands. Bryan did not see me. I know this for a fact. Samantha wouldn't remember me. She was a neighbor of his while he lived in the dorms. She was in a similar medical program. Very sweet girl. We only talked briefly a few times in passing but I could tell she's a kind person. Anyway, Samantha has a disability. I'm not quite sure if it's a mental or social disability but if you met her, you'd be able to tell she is just different. She doesn't quite act her age. She's very socially awkward and it's a bit difficult talking to her. I'd have to repeat my name and who I was many, many times. She would always forget. He's talked poorly about her many times.

Normally, I wouldn't even think about this. I'd just say ""hey, there's Bryan and another sap that got worked in to his bullshit"" but she absolutely has a disability. It makes me feel icky. My husband said just to let it go and I do agree, but there's apart of me that feels like someone should be told. I follow her sister on Twitter and I keep thinking about sending her a message just saying ""Can we talk?"" and checking in. Maybe Bryan changed. Maybe he isn't a creep. However, I highly doubt that's true.

So, what's my place?

I am currently looking for software engineering internships for the summer of 2015.

So I just received an email from a company that I really, really, really want to intern at this summer. The recruiter emailed me asking for more information, essentially wanting an unofficial transcript. So, my transcript isn't great (few Cs, one C-). But I felt like if I could just explain why, it would give a better representation of who I am. 

I am currently a student a top 4 CS university who intended to major in political science, but would later switch to CS. It was really hard at times, and the rigor between the two majors was much different and there was a learning curve for me. But, I chose to learn from this adversity and let it push me forward. My grades don’t represent what I got from my courses, or my understanding of the material. I also participate in hackathons and work on personal projects, so I don’t feel like my grades should define me. Do I bother explaining this to the recruiter who emailed me? 

I don’t want to come off as someone who makes excuses for his short comings, because thats just not who I am. But I kind of want to justify this, but don’t know if it is appropriate. 

This is probably the last roadblock before getting an interview. And I want an interview really, really, really badly."
2nb1hg,3,2014-11-24,I'm a British student looking to do a year at Emory next year (2015-2016) and I have a few questions if you have the time!,emory2015yearout,Emory,https://www.reddit.com/r/Emory/comments/2nb1hg/im_a_british_student_looking_to_do_a_year_at/,"Hi and thanks for taking the time to answer me, and apologies for the ramble ahead.

---

Some background:

I go to University in the UK, studying Finance.  I am in my first year of Uni (just started in September) and career-wise I'm pretty clear on track to go into Finance, having already done a few short internships at banks and probably a summer internship this coming year.  London is a great city, but I have lived here all my life, and if I want to work in the industry I will probably live either here or in New York all my life.  

University in the UK, especially in London, is very different from in America.  There is no 'community' really.  You rent a room or apartment (by yourself usually) in your first year, go to classes, and then go back home.  You (or most people, myself included) definitely have friends to talk to and spend time with, but it feels more like the real world, where you work for a few hours a day, live by yourself, do most work on your own in private study, and then hang out with friends on some evenings and on weekends.  You cook for yourself, live by yourself etc..

In addition, I am half American.  My Dad moved over here for work about 20 years ago, (which is why I have a UK passport and speak with a British accent and grew up here), but I am still an American citizen as well.  He always speaks fondly of his college days, and actually wanted me to go to college in America, but I didn't apply on time.  I got pretty decent SATs though, about 2100, which I understand is about average for Emory.  

So, that said, I'd definitely like to get out of this rainy dump and go somewhere sunny and warm (Atlanta is sunny and warm, right?), and my school offers a second year (I will have *just* turned 19 when I start) at your beautiful campus, but I have a few questions first, which I would be very thankful if you could answer.

--- 

* **How is the business school?**   This is where I would be taking my official courses, although apparently I would also be allowed to do some stuff for fun at the Liberal Arts college (I enjoy politics so perhaps a class in that area).  From your experience, or anyone you know, how is it here?  I know Emory won't technically be on my degree, but I'd still like to make sure it won't be mind-numbingly boring, especially because I know US college is a lot more 'hands-on' than Britain with regards to work. 

*  **Would I find it hard if I wasn't in a dorm?**  Because of some shortage or whatever, international one-year only students can't stay in your dorms.  Instead I would stay at the ""Highland Lake Apartments"" (http://www.highlandlake-apts.com/decatur-apartments/highland-lake/neighborhood/) which actually seem pretty darn nice from the outside.  But they aren't in the school itself.  Especially being an international student who isn't in the main dorms, I am really worried that I might just kind of become a bit of a recluse, especially since I would be in my second year, so I'm guessing I couldn't do all the first year things designed to get people to meet each other.  Which leads me to-

* **How insular is the social community?**.  Clearly I'm not going to be in a fraternity or whatever (I gather those are pretty big at Emory but I'm not sure so please correct me), but as a guy from the UK do you think I would be 'accepted' there, or find it easy/hard to make friends?  Are there open events that lots of new people go to, or would I have to try and get into a frat or a frat event?  Also, I've heard that at some Southern colleges, Football/sports are really big, which I don't know anything about.  Do you think people will be open to teaching me about that sort of thing, or should I study up on that before I go?  

* Meal plans.  Being technically 'off-campus', I have no idea what meal plan to choose.  Also, I think eating on campus would be pretty sad, especially initially, if I didn't know anyone haha. Do most second-year college students still eat on-campus, or do they all go out?  

* Also, what's the situation with alcohol like?  As someone who has been drinking relatively easily (though not to massive excess generally) since 16 and who lives somewhere where 18 is legal age, is the only place people under 21 ever drink at frat parties, or is that just one of many places?  

Overall, I know you obviously don't know me and so on, but do you think I'd find it hard to meet people or fit in, or is it more of an easy-going school?    Thank you so much for answering these questions.  Apologies for disturbing you.  If this type of thing is banned here, please don't hesitate to PM me.

As for education; I was taken out of the state school system when I was 7 - and from there I was home schooled. I completed my A level (equivalents) in July (two years early).

Assuming I do end up getting a full-time offer afterwards, is there a time you generally start? I know the firm says you must have your 150 credits one year after the internship date, so that would be at the end of the spring semester which is when I was planning on graduating with 150 credits...so that's not an issue.


But a lot of people have been telling me I should try to finish one semester early, in December rather than May, because ""busy season is in January there's no work in the summer so they won't want to hire you for then, you'll get passed up for someone who can start in January"".  


So I could do that, but I would have to take a lot more credits than I'm comfortable with. If it was the difference between getting a full time offer or not I wouldn't mind, but I really don't want to do it if there's no reason to. I would be perfectly fine if they wanted me to start after summer, like in August or September closer to the extended deadlines which I assume is another busy season. 


Obviously it'll vary firm to firm, but is there a general rule? I'm just thinking, most people probably graduate in spring anyways, so what's the big deal? "

That seems kind of sad to think about; when alright is good enough, hell it is better than usual. Anyway, I have been seeing a therapist for a few months now, which seems to be going okay, I don't tell here everything, but that just stems from my general distrust of the human race. I was working at the golf course, but now it is winter so I have to find something new. And I was passing my online class, not with a fantastic grade, but passing is better than my usual. 

Then things started to look up. I found a temp job making more than I was before until the holiday season is over, so I will be working while I look for an internship or something. I got an interview for what seems like would be my dream job, working PR for a theatre (The one where they have plays not movies!). And to top it off, I was bar hopping with an old high school buddy of mine and ran into this gorgeous girl that I used to go to college with, I asked her on a date out of nowhere and she said yes! We didn't have anything planned but I would give her details to be figured out later. It looked like for once in my life things were actually going to go my way. 

Wrong. 

I made a call today to set up the interview, they already hired someone else to do the job, they weren't even going to give me the interview anymore. I also got a call from my ex to tell me how she was mad at me for whatever bullshit even though we haven't talked in months, so I got yelled at by her for a while. And to top it off, I asked the girl on Saturday if she would like to go out with me this next Saturday; I was going to take her to this super nice seafood restaurant that she loves, but as of right now, 2 1/2 days later I have still yet to receive any text or call or message from her at all, giving me reason to believe in a drunken state, she accidentally agreed to a date with me, because a girl as beautiful as her would never actually want to go out with a guy like me. But really, how hard would it be to just be an adult and face me about it... It is like someone is playing a sick game on me, where right when things look good it all gets taken away and I am reminded that I am a miserable fucking wreck.

1. Does a first job ""define"" you career? Is it possible to move between sub-fields within software (high-level software, defense industry, embedded systems, etc).

2. Besides salary, benefits, etc., what do you think that I should consider?

3. Do you guys think that it would be ""safer"" to take the job just to guarantee one for after graduation? Perhaps changing to a different one later? Since I have not applied for other jobs yet, perhaps this is really a blessing as it would be too late to find another good job?

4. Other thoughts, advice?

As for my kinks, I have many. Pretty much I have no limits. However some of my biggest ones are ageplay, incest, watersports, panties (this does not mean I like wearing them. It means I find them extremely attractive and well some other things, but I don't wear them! lol), Dom/sub relationships, and light bondage. However this does not mean these are all my kinks or that I am opposed to introducing others to the story. Also, if one is not comfortable with any of them, they do not need to be added to the story.

In reality to you a member of a secret organization of killers, sworn to put an end to all darkness in the world. However, while undercover you discover a young elf who, though is completely doubtful of himself and his skills, is extremely gifted in the ways of mentalism and conjuring of the elements. He just doesn't know how gifted he is yet.
But you sense something dark about his soul, so you take him under your wing as an apprentice and teach him to improve upon his already discover two skills (though he believes his mental skills are unknown to anyone since he never told anyone. You somehow figure it out.). But also you must teach him in the ways of the darkness hidden inside him in order for him to control it and not let it take over him. (Maybe you cause a series of terrible events to occur at the school that somehow lead back to me, and you convince me the only way to live a decent life now is to run away with you. Or you can teach me there in secrecy. I leave all these details open to your creativity. I am not picky and find someone with an imagination attractive!) Ultimately we will fall in love. A tabooed student teacher relationship. Or maybe we just fuck for the hell of it because of the intensity of training and need to blow off steam. Your choice. This was the first long-term style rp idea that I did and what made me want to continue doing them. So it's always a favorite!
___________________________________________________________

(Option #2) Lately there have been several natural disasters happening throughout the country, but mostly in California. You had the understanding that it was just tectonic plate movements due to being on a fault line. But that didn't explain the recent tornado. One day while walking home from school you feel a tremor coming on and look for the nearest safe spot, but be it that you were in the middle of crossing the road, that left you with little to no options. What's worse is that you turned to see what's going on and see a car speeding out of control and without a doubt going to hit you. You close your eyes and accept your fate, until you feel a collision from your back and land on something softer than the ground.

You open your eyes and see me on top of you. ""Oi, you're not light. Get off!"" I say in my accent. Though you cannot pinpoint it's exact origin, you get up immediately. Before you can even thank me or ask any questions, I grab you by the hand and yell, ""let's go!"" i drag you down the alley and without warning you feel a odd sensation of weightlessness and fall to the ground. However it isn't the hard concrete. It's a soft grass plain. The grass is brilliant orange-red, and you are disoriented and confuse. I put out my hand to you and help you up. ""Damn vortex manipulator. Cheap time traveling technology."" you hear me say as I examine a odd looking watch on my wrist. With many questions you look to me, but once again I manage to cut you off with, ""Anywho, sorry about earlier, it was either that or the front end of the car! I'm The Doctor, I don't believe I caught your name."" As I put out my hand to introduce myself. (if you didn't catch it by now, this is a Doctor Who rp idea. I am the doctor and you are the young (maybe even more mature) women I saved from what you think is a natural disaster. However due to faulty technology we are stuck in a different time period until I can get my ship to me. Will you end up being my companion I take on multiple adventures, or will you be just a luck bystander who decides to thank me once we get you home?)
___________________________________________________________

(Option #3) I am a young medical intern who is just trying to become a full fledged doctor. Even though I excelled at my medical classes, I was having a hard time keeping my cool under pressure of the real medical world and you, my head medical doctor have been tasked with teaching us, and you've taken a interest in me. You decide to help me with my pressure and stress issues of being thrown into the real world of a doctor head first. How you do so is your choice.
___________________________________________________________

(Bonus option #4) We have just finished are training at the ninja academy and have become full fledged apprentice ninjas. We will know be broken into teams with varying abilities and skills in order to grow as ninjas and fight for our cause of peace among the kingdoms. I'm a reckless, impulsive, smartass who always has a retort and goes in without ever really having a plan. However though everyone looks down upon me for a past I don't know about, I have a strong will to learn and get stronger.

Maybe you're one of the three comrades who have been assigned to my team and have to put up with me, though we aren't very fond of each other yet. Maybe you've always fancied me but I never noticed you because you were too scared to ever say anything to me. Maybe you're my rival but have a mutual understanding of wanting to get stronger for our own personal reasons. Maybe your my teacher and leader of the group as a full fledged ninja who helps me realize my potential and aid me in growing to become one of the strongest whoever live, included embracing the darkness inside me I don't know about.
___________________________________________________________

(All of these are negotiable. You can say if you want to tweak the roles or have the roles reversed. I left ages, race, body type, and character traits out because I want someone to have the freedom of creating the characters they ultimately want. This includes kinks as well. We can discuss these details before hand and come to an understanding before we start. I am looking for someone who is detailed-oriented and looking to do this for a while. I hope to hear some people! Please include some information about yourself so I don't feel like I'm talking to someone with no interests in this, and include with option you are interested in, unless you have an idea, by which please include it as well. I take it goes without saying that I would like one to be open to correct grammar and spelling for the most part! Happy writing!)

Edit: Sorry, I didn't realize I typed so much and how long it was! If still up, I'm still looking for partners!"
2ncd60,0,2014-11-25,I would like some advice about my internalized sexism in engineering.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2ncd60/i_would_like_some_advice_about_my_internalized/,"I am a college student in engineering. In my last few terms, my grades have been atrocious. My grades have been improving and I recently got a really well paying internship in a specialized field that I am very interested in. I think I got the internship because I am female. I also have a lot more experience in that specific field than most of my classmates but I got some of my earlier experience because of my gender. I fear that people think that I got the job solely because I am a woman in engineering. That somehow, my contributions are lesser because I did not get in on my own merit but some sort of women in engineering privilege. 

I have not heard people say sexist things while in engineering at school or at work. I feel like I have to prove myself now by starting to get good grades so that when I do get good internships, they will think, its because she is smart not because she is female.

My issue right now is, if I do not start getting good grades, my poor performance may be attributed to my gender. If i do get good grades, they will say being female helped. If I don't get good jobs, I could start blaming my gender. And if I continue to get good jobs, people will attribute that to my gender rather than the effort I put into my work. It feels like everything would be an effort in futility.

It just feels like no matter what I do, I will be defined by my gender, and that is not what I want. I just want to study the things I am interested, do interesting work and not have people think I have some sort of privilege because I am working in a male dominated field.

After thinking all of this, I do not feel as motivated to work as hard as I did before getting the internship and that no matter what I do, people will still attribute my employment history to my gender rather than the experience. So much nilihism.

I've been really lucky and have received, or is expecting to receive (final informal meeting the team scheduled, etc.), the following internship offers for summer 2015. I'm feeling a bit unsure and don't know which one is better. It's my last internship before graduation so I don't want to pick the wrong one. Also does anyone know if the following 3 companies accept Fall interns? I'm considering the possibility of deferring one of the internships for Fall term. I appreciate all your inputs. Thank you!!


**Microsoft - Software Design Engineer Intern, Foundry Program**


Pro: Microsoft hires the most new grad PMs and I'm hoping this will get my foot in the door


Con: The Foundry program is not a typical MS internship. It involves making an application as a team of 5 interns, like a full-time school project but you get paid. I won't get to work in a real industry setting.


**Facebook - Project Manager Intern**


Pro: Mostly the prestige, location (Menlo Park), cool product


Con: The description makes it sound like a secretarial job (documentation, scheduling, etc.) but I can try to ask for more responsibilities once I'm there?


**Salesforce - Program Manager Intern**


Pro: The job description is the most interesting. I will get to work with stakeholders to gather, prioritize, and ship features, which is what I really want to do


Con: Less known to people outside the tech world (I'm Asian and making my parents proud is quite important to me)

2ncu0x,2,2014-11-25,Negotiating compensation with very few aces?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ncu0x/negotiating_compensation_with_very_few_aces/,"A while ago I received an internship offer from a pretty reputable tech company that is not in the Valley. Now, my compensation (in their systems group, effectively doing programming) is absolutely great, but if the numbers that have recently been popping up are to trust, their compensation for an SWE internship is about 50% more.

If I end up accepting the offer as is, I'll be quite happy. But I do feel that I should at least think about a negotiation strategy here, if not to actually try to get a better offer, then for the sake of becoming better at it, since as a college student myself and many readers naturally don't have a whole lot of experience negotiating. Besides, I need money about as much as the next student, and getting the absolute best out of a situation seems like a vital skill in the real world.

So, the facts I'm working with:

1. My previous summer's internship totaled to about the same amount, they took care of housing but paid less - the new company doesn't take care of housing. Is there such a thing as ""Hey, I have 3 months more experience than I did last summer, I deserve a raise!""?

2. My offer is less than say the top 30 SV companies, while the SWE offer is highest in the nation and 50% more than mine (if the number that keeps showing up around the internet is not just based on the same damn Quora answer where it originally showed up)

3. My interviews were effectively SWE interviews, and I will be programming, just in a different context I suppose.

I have until mid-spring to accept, so there is a chance that I'll have a competing offer on my hands by then.

Now, I performed well at my previous internship and could have gone back if I wanted to, but they didn't throw an offer my way without me explicitly stating interest. My recruiter was quite persistent in attempting to get me to come back, but I didn't want to waste her time just to get an offer to use as leverage, as I do want to stay in good terms with the company. I recognize that being a bit more cold blooded here might have helped, but live and learn.

There are two possible paths that I can pursue -

1. Extract more details about my current role and about how it differs from the software engineering role. If the differences are actually big enough to the point where I would really prefer the other role even if there was no pay difference, then I should be able to formulate a good argument for getting a switch, and I'd have a better reason to do so than just a few K over a summer.

2. (I think execution here would have to wait until a competing offer, realistically) Take a shot, slap myself around for a bit, and go tell a company that receives thousands of applications that I want more money just because a person of roughly equivalent experience is making much more than me. At a glance this seems ridiculous, but I wouldn't be surprised if some industry veteran had some comments on pulling this off. It's unlikely that I possess the cojones to do so, though.

Comments and personal experiences are greatly appreciated. And as I already expressed, I'm quite happy with the offer, but the reality is that no company will ever negotiate on my behalf. Hopefully this will be beneficial to others in a similar situation."

I had zero work experience or internships. I was really worried about it. Most people i asked told me to stay in school an extra semester to pull it up. While it most certainly limited my choices it was by no means a career killer. If your in the same position know that if you study , get a good personal project and apply to at least 10 jobs a week you will find work. If anybody has any questions i would be happy to answer them.

Edit: I loved hearing about all the others who had a lower GPA and still made it in this field. It was really disheartening every time being turned down for my GPA being too low. I even considered lying a couple times.

Edit2:Thats why I wanted to make this thread so others wouldn't just give up and work outside their field. Or feel like they wasted 4 years. GPA is not everything, you just have to do a little more leg work to find that first job. "
2ndf58,295,2014-11-25,For Which Crispy Pulls Double Duty...,MisterCrispy,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2ndf58/for_which_crispy_pulls_double_duty/,"[Insert Obligatory long time listener, first time caller line here.] I worked at a small TPA (Third Party Administrator) a while back which handled enrollment services and billing for small insurance companies and agencies. Believe me, what the company description lacked in excitement, the people who worked there and ran the company made up for it 10 fold. Some of the strangest people I've ever worked for by far. This is one of my stories. I'll post more if you like this one.

When I first started at this company, we had a network admin. I was initially just a web developer. After about a year, the net admin quit rather abruptly. Upper management (all two of them) was panicking because they didn’t have anyone they could get in right away (they hated dealing with headhunters and preferred direct hire). I had worked in networking before I made the switch to developer so I mentioned I could take care of that in the meantime until they find someone. There is a thin line between bravery and stupidity. At the time, I thought I was “stepping up to the plate” as the phrase goes. In hindsight….not so much. I was really setting myself up for a headache that lasted my entire time there. 

The bright side was that we weren’t a four-9’s shop. There were only 2 times of the day we really truly had to be working as far as upper management was concerned: when we ran billing. We only “guaranteed” uptime during our business hours adjusted for west coast time because one of our clients was in LA. Even then, the guarantee was rather loose as well. Not so much a “guarantee” as it was “we’ll do our best”. It gave us a lot of wiggle room which was good because….our network. My god I still have nightmares about that thing. Still, 99% of the company’s income was made in those two billing time blocks. They were important. (Look, 4th grade teacher, I DO understand foreshadowing!)

The company was always on a shoestring budget. The margins were small and BigBoss preferred to share the profits with the employees (after taking his piece, mind you) rather than investing more in the infrastructure. It’s great if you’re an employee, bad if you are responsible for said infrastructure. What resulted was a hodge podge of used and clearance purchased servers combined with hardware that wasn’t really ready for the big leagues. There were refurbished Compaq DL380s sitting next to a re-purposed HP desktop with an EMachine thrown in for good measure (among other things), you get the picture. I know many are cringing but, as a testament to the former net admin, she made this stuff work and it worked amazingly well for what we asked of it.

So I took over the maintenance of this quagmire of pain. Like I said, the previous person did a phenomenal job setting it up so I didn’t have to do much beyond staying late every now and then to run update and make sure the backups went properly. On its own, it would be a cushy job. Combined with the fact that I was also working mid level web developer and had to stop and go fix people’s desktops constantly or mess with the servers, it was a pain. I did such a good job standing on the necks of giants, however, that BigBoss decided they didn’t need to hire anyone. 

Joy.

So our customer base was growing. I was doing more and more work and having to bounce between the servers and programming was becoming more and more difficult. I finally had enough. I told BigBoss that I either needed some help or he needed to pick one role for me. He said that I was doing such a good job that he’d had to lose me in either position so they were going to look for some help for me. At least someone that could handle the desktop support or, if nothing else, someone I could boss around when dealing with the server stuff. Either one was fine with me….at least so I thought. BigBoss was creative. Like I said, shoestring budget. His solution was to contact the local college and see if any of their computer science majors needed some internships.

Joy.

So I went from having to babysit a network to having to babysit a college kid with zero experience and even less knowledge. Seriously, junior level compsci students should at least know basic troubleshooting by that point, right? I’m guessing there was either a major issue with school quality or the smart kids knew not to take a vaguely defined internship position with a small time software company.

The only arguably qualified person to respond was a kid I will henceforth refer to as “Snotnose”. He wasn’t a brat or anything. He had bad allergies and no sense of hygiene. We learned quickly not to shake hands with him. He knew a bit about troubleshooting having had to keep his family’s computers running. Beyond that, he had a bit to learn and, sadly, it was up to me to teach him enough to be useful. Fast forward a bit. It took a while but Snotnose was finally understanding the basics. He had learned which computers did what, how to run the backups, how to troubleshoot desktops, and to ignore any requests from Madame Wrecks-a-lot (more about her in another story). I felt comfortable giving some slack to his leash. People were now allowed to go to him directly for a certain set of issues and he was under strict instructions to clear it by me if any request were outside of those specific issues. He was happy. I was happy. The world was getting a bit brighter.

Then one day I went to lunch.

I get a frantic call during my lunch break from BigBoss (who was on his lunch break) saying “The sites are down! Customers are calling! Find out what’s happening!”. This was before wi-fi and tethering and such were common so my only choice was to get a doggy bag, pay, then break a few speed limits on my way back to the office. 

I find Snotnose in the conference room with all the servers sitting on the conference table with their cases open and him digging around inside. He must have noticed the slight confusion and urgency in my voice when I politely asked him “WHAT IN THE BLUE F!@#$!@@ DO YOU THINK YOU’RE DOING!?” 

Turns out BigBoss had gotten a sweet deal on some more memory for the servers. He dropped them off on Snotnose’s desk and told him that it was for the servers then BigBoss went to lunch with some clients. This is when I learn that guidelines are only good if they are VERY specific. You see, memory upgrades were allowed...on desktops. I assumed that it was assumed so I didn’t specify it in the list specifically. My god that hurt to type. Anyway, the BigBoss assumed Snotnose would give me the memory and let me know. Snotnose said “oh! Memory! I can do that” then proceeded to try and upgrade the servers….not knowing exactly which server the memory was for. Rather than bring one down and check, he shut down all of them and opened them up to compare.

So to recap, Snotnose brought down the entire network...at once...during one of our two peak traffic times of the day (lunch time and 11:00pm was when various processes ran that moved data around so customers could run certain reports and billing and such). These were the most important times for the network to be up because it meant money coming into the company. It delayed funding. It was a cluster-f.

As I sat there listening to Snotnose explain between sneezes and snorts, I remember thinking this wasn’t helping my inevitable stomach ulcer. As I started to put stuff back together, Snotnose seemed to feel this was the perfect time to try to get me to explain server internals and such. I knew he was just a kid but the downtime was a big problem and his questions weren't helping. Yelling wasn’t going to fix anything at this point. My priority had to be getting the network back up and in the proper order. My anger was rising to the point that my calm.....ish demeanor wasn't going to last.

&gt;Me: Snotnose, go stand with your nose in the corner.

&gt;SN: *laughs*

&gt;Me: Do you see me laughing, wench?

&gt;SN: But I…

&gt;Me: NOSE! CORNER!

He shuffled off and stood in the corner. I got everything back together quickly and get the network back up and running in record time. I think the servers themselves knew how angry I was because they booted up faster than normal considering the new memory wasn’t actually installed yet. 

I went back in my office to test everything out and to send out an email letting the customers know the site was back up along with some BS explanation of why it went down so as not accept blame as a company and not to throw anyone under the bus (regardless of how much they deserved it).

A few hours later, the BigBoss, back from his lunch meeting/golf outing stops by my office.

&gt;BB: Thanks for getting the site back up. What happened?

&gt;Me: Long story.

&gt;BB: Why is Snotnose standing in the corner of the conference room?

&gt;Me: Self-preservation.

I was a construction laborer of sorts, working at a glass shop and for a carpenter;did this stuff from between 23- 35 yrs of age.. I am still not exactly up to industry standard and consider myself “cheap labor” with the appropriate pay.

I am on SSI because of a traumatic brain injury that happened a really long time ago. I suppose I was in denial that it affected my income and life.

I have a car that I bought on a credit card cash advance= 8%  and a one dollar fee. I have AAA plpd on the car, and borrowed $1900 and then a new set of tires, so I’m into it for approx. $2200=1998 Honda Civic, auto, 2 door, gray looks presentable 152 k miles.

Plus I already had credit card debt at $1400 at present I owe- $4200 total and while making the monthly cc payments , haven’t gotten a  pt or ft job and haven’t paid the damn things down much.

I had student loans but eventually went through the Total Permanent Disability (TPD) program and they are gone.
I drove my dad who had cancer to appointments and hung loose doing odd jobs from 1996-1998

Got a driving while impaired in ’99, stayed in my van for most of a year and then moved to a 'hood room to rent near a community college, got an Associates by 2005 and Bachelors in one of those combo programs where you get the “management” Degree but it’s a B Science so it sounded like I knew something, though I am not so swift.
 Thought I was doing good! For myself.. and graduated in “07 TPD went through in 2014, after I paid off a portion of those loans.

I happened to get an apt in public housing and out of the room to rent in the 'hood , in 2007
I always wonder where I will end up, being in that room to rent for 5 ½ years as a 40-45 yr old man made me feel as though I was viewed as a typical derelict sort. And it was a mixture of violence and boredom, wanted to get the H outta there, one day a phone call came saying – Do you still want an apt? yes. I move in that day.
Lotta writing.. money and me have a different relationship, is why I filled you guys in on where I’m coming from.

The Present Time....

I receive $721 and food stamps and Medicaid.
I am actively trying to get onto the Ticket To Work program, seems to be taking the voc rehab people a long time . 
I can earn $1070 per month and still get SSI, I have never had a normal  apt , car, in my life and am like a twenty year old only permanently, as far as money goes.
So, $721
-	Rent =                     $214
-	Car insurance             $58
-	Cable=                      $50
-	Gas=                        $35
-	Credit cards=           $210
-	Misc + girlfriend = the rest + “give and take” , the end.

I am attempting to complete a Health Care Certificate in order to make myself resemble a potential
Employee  meaning I am trying to reinvent myself so that I could get a minor job that may have a similar job waiting In a warmer climate if I ever do move to that warm State.

I recently have been diagnosed with pre diabetes, and have all the trembling and symptoms, nauseous after eating.  I am on a new diet , and am walking every day.

The old me is pretty much gone. I have the best intentions, am a fuck up. Never married,no kids, no family members or relatives , just my gf and her service dog, are my family, and I am supposed to make this grand move to a ‘warmer place’

Am seriously thinking of: drop the cable once the Colbert show goes off as I am required at least to move to a different unit so they can renovate mine                            $50
.. sell the car for minimum                                           $2200, it now has 153500 on it after six months.        Dump the insurance AAA                                                 $58
                             No more gas  ride the crappy bus          35
(My gf won’t come over with me not having cable, probably.) So I have library books, matinees, coffee, and walking her service dog or myself.

I’d be down to $2000 minus the 210 = 1800 and then minus gas + insurance so I could throw $300 toward the cc debt and reach my goal (seriously ) of being right up there with homeless bums who often owe zero.. that’s my goal, no 401 k . zero retirement or vacation for me. Futureless.

I can follow unburyus  and pay off for around a year to reach zero, then I’ll be 53.
It seems – that if I bomb out of a full time job, I can lose a lot because who knows what Social Security rules define disabled, you can’t just assume your former position. 

I was ignorant of the culture of college, lived in a ghetto, ate at soup kitchen places while there, and scrambled, but I keep pretty clean though my clothes are ratty.
 I received no internships and since can’t qualify for much of a job. Consequently a $10 hour job ft will put me where I’m presently at but in jeopardy of being shit-canned again, and then the shit hits the fan for my “old, ass”

What do you guys, think of my predicament, ? I'm not done improving myself, but seem to be just shuffling things and also spinning my wheels, am not recognized by normal society, and waste a lot of time on here, until I pull the plug on cable. 

(There is a bedbug problem at this apt, not in my place, I think, I am going to the food bank today with gf and her service dog-Dogness Ever-stink)

(I applied at manpower, walgreens, a couple grocery stores, movie theater, and more,I will get a job of some kind but the monies don't add up is my problem= I'm either on or off the system, and I will never get a normal apt or car at the dollar per hour I command.)

EDIT - there are nothing but people out there who have it worse than me, I  just have run out of things to change or juggle. The SSI rules = take $65 off your gross earnings, cut the remainder in half , and thats what will remain of your SSI but wages are gross pay, SSI counts net pay or non taxable leaving a person with no improvement for having worked= your on.or off."

2ndspt,1,2014-11-25,"I'm pretty sure that I'm gonna fail a couple of my subjects this semester, and I don't know why I don't feel so bad about it.",blazingarpeggio,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2ndspt/im_pretty_sure_that_im_gonna_fail_a_couple_of_my/,"Computer Science major here. I have 6 subjects total this semester, 5 of them majors (all of them are seasonal), another is just a general political science course. I'm sure that I'm going to pass my Database and my Automata course, hopefully in flying colors. I'm still pretty confident with my Web Programming course and my Political Science course. But my Assembly Programming and Programming Languages courses? No. I am absolutely sure that I'm gonna fail them.

Why? I gotta be honest, I rarely submitted any of my requirements for both classes. It started at the start of the semester. I couldn't really find the time or focus or determination to program anything outside class hours. I'm really lucky that my other courses require submission during the lab session itself, because I could really focus in the environment and the urgency of things or having groupmates involved. But when I get out of class, it's gone. I hardly code outside of class, especially with other things going on with my life. Or maybe I'm just good at making excuses for myself. Either way, I stopped submitting anything. Then it just snowballed from there. The sheer volume of leftover requirements that I needed to do just overwhelmed me... and I just gave up. There were times that I thought that I really should start working on some of them, because honestly, I think I did pretty well with my exams for the Programming Languages course, and I thought that I can still play a little bit of catch up. But then, it was too overwhelming to re-learn a bunch of languages for my old programming exercises (and my project, which, guess what... I'm not doing). It became a cycle, and at one point, I just accepted my fate. And I started to not care.

I know I brought this on myself. If I fail both courses, I'll be left with a warning standing for this semester. I could only take 5 subjects next semester, and I'm in danger of being on probation if I reach warning status again. Which is dangerous, because I already came out of two *simultaneous* dismissals and not studying for a semester, and no, that part of my life was nowhere near unicorns farting rainbows. In fact, it's closer to donkeys sharting on my face. I run the risk of going down the slope again, and if it ever reaches that point again, it's game over for me. And I may or may not be starting to roll off the edge. And what if it I get a failing mark on one of my other courses? Don't even ask me about what will happen when I tell my parents. I don't know. Shit might hit the fan.

Still, for some reason, I feel that it's okay if I fail those two courses. Many of my majors now, although seasonal, aren't prerequisites to many other subjects. I'm more or less still on the right track. I could then take any left-over general education class I have, or that final calculus course that I failed eons ago instead of the only subject that requires passing my Assembly course. I would also have to take a lighter load for next semester, which is in a way good, because I feel that I pushed myself too much with a full 18-unit load. And it won't hold me back from taking my internship during the summer vacation. And if I take those classes again next year, I'll be better prepared. I don't know. This might not be a disaster waiting to happen.

Now excuse me, I need to get back to studying for my exam on Assembly tomorrow."

I have some questions regarding my major. I studied Business administration for two semesters and got into programming at my second semester, really enjoyed it and eventually wanted to switch to a tech related major. I eventually switched to CIS because I could keep all the grades from my two semesters, for which I've worked really hard for. Unfortunatly, I've made the mistake to research the translation ""business informatics"" of the German name ""Wirtschaftsinformatik"" instead of ""CIS"", so I didn't get to read all (negative) opinions the about this major regarding career prospects before making the switch. Now I'm worried that I won't get as good career options as with a CS major for software dev positions  even if'd have a good portfolio of personal projects and work experience from internships. 

Because CIS majors are quite different across schools and countries: In my CIS major, I attend programming classes with the CS majors and will have the option to attend advanced CS classes (e.g. Intro to Artifical Intelligence), so my CIS major isn't all about IT.

If a CIS major is a massive disadvantage if I want to get a software dev position, I have these options:

* I could switch to a CS major next year and probably could finish it with no delays, if I'd take extra classes along my CIS major. (Which I currently do)

* I could attend master courses in the last few semesters of my Bachelor (because I already have finished the courses of 2 semesters), and then add a master in CS after my CIS bachelor. I guess a master should only be necessary if I want to work in a really specialised field like Robotics, Quantitive Finance etc. (?)

My questions are: 

1. Is my CIS major a massive disadvantage if I want to go for a software dev position ?. I'm working on a personal project right now and I'm planning to have a good portfolio ready before I graduate

2. If my CIS major is disadvantage and I should switch: Should I switch to a CS bachelor or keep my CIS bachelor and add a (shorter) master in CS?

It would be great to hear your opinions about this situation. Thanks for your help."

I just returned from court. I had received previous disclosure. Today I received a new disclosure and my screening form....

The form indicates 30 day jail time + probation if I take a plea deal prior to a pretrial.

If I take a plea deal after a preliminary inquiry (pretrial?) or trial date is set I am facing 90 days jail + probation

On top of all of this I'll be on a sex offender registry.

I assumed I'd receive probation or something similar. I assumed maybe a sexual registry. I thought I'd get conditionally discharged with no priors...

I'm obviously going to hire the best lawyer I can find. Fuck money. I'm just in total shock. I'll follow up with more details in a later post. I just need to vent. I'm panicking right now.

I don't even know what lawyer to call. I want the best. I'm a student still in school and my father agreed to pay for a lawyer (I'll pay him back some day). How do I trust if a lawyer is any good? Where do I begin? They kept telling me I was eligible for legal aid but I dont trust that level of lawyers. I've heard of friends getting DUIs dropped by hiring an expensive lawyer.

Jail time for a clean record? I know I havent offered any details. I will follow up when I settle down after class. Will a good lawyer be able to divert this jail time? 

I feel like my entire career is over. This degree I busted my balls for? That internship I spent over a year of my life on? All gone. Over one drunken stupid night.

I have aspirations of become a LEO and am currently in an internship program with a local PD. 

I have heard many opinions on the recent events that have unfolded (both at school and at my internship) and I had a sort of scenario that I witnessed with my own eyes about a year ago. I was wondering if I could present the scenario and ask how you guys would respond to it.

I witnessed this scenario while on the road and I was next to the car that it happened to.

Car #1 was exiting a Wal-Mart parking lot facing eastbound in the right turn lane at a busy intersection and Car #1 was at the front of the queue to turn right. Car #1 is occupied by one M/W. Behind Car #1 was Car #2, a black Jeep. Car #2 is occupied by a F/W driver and a M/W passenger. At this point, Car #1 cannot make the right turn on red because of oncoming traffic that is heading northbound on the busy street. The M/W passenger of Car #2 becomes irate and exits the Jeep and heads for the drivers door of Car #1. The M/W approached the drivers door aggressively and opens it. After the door is open the M/W attempts to pull the driver of Car #1 out of the vehicle. At this point, the driver of Car #1 lurches the car forward and manages to close the door, but cannot get away due to oncoming traffic. M/W of Car #2 then approaches the door again and attempts to pull out the driver of Car #1 again. At this point, traffic subsides and Car #1 manages to merge into traffic and get away safely. 

My question to you guys is,

1. What would you do if you were in Car #1?

2. In this situation, are you justified to protect yourself in any way possible? (ie. concealed weapon)

3. If you did resort to using a weapon, how can you expect police to react once they arrive at the scene?

2nehy4,1,2014-11-25,"Me [23] my boyfriend [33] and my ex [23]. And our lose lose lose situation. Please, please take the time to read. Any advice appreciated.",thestateofdenial,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2nehy4/me_23_my_boyfriend_33_and_my_ex_23_and_our_lose/,"I (F23) am going to try to keep this as short as possible while trying to explain my rational. Some details changed for anonymity. 

My ex, let's call him Derick, and I were together for 8 years. All of my adolescence and adulthood was spent with him; we were together every day, and even roomed together all through college. He is a kind, considerate, amazing guy, and I love him. He isn't very social and is the type of guy that no one would remember at a party; the most common response to us dating is that we are polar opposites. My family, love him as they may, still feels that after 8 years and constant proximity, they do not really know him. 

I, on the other hand, love to go out dancing, love meeting new people, traveling, and am pursuing a semi-successful career as a theater actress. After college he stayed at home to finish an internship and I moved to a city several hours away to continue acting. I have since made a lot of new friends and have been slowly, but surely, getting my name out there and getting paid to be in productions. It looks like I will be offered a contract soon with a traveling theater group, if all goes well in my next few shows. 

Anyway, for the past two years, Derick and I have become home bodies, sitting at home smoking pot and watching shows we'e seen before. I started gaining weight, getting depressed. When I wanted to go out with my friends, he came along. He did not truly have friends of his own (we had many mutual friends, but he had no guy friends he ever hung out one on one with). Derick and I never shared hobbies but have been friends since elementary school and this was comfortable. He was comfortable. The whole relationship was comfortable and I was, for the most part, happy throughout it. 

After I moved, he soon moved up and got a job at a local accounting agency. He moved in with me. I started to feel suffocated. I communicated this and he gave me space. But I didn't find peace in going out with my new friends more or throwing myself into my passion. Because, in the back of my mind, I knew he was sitting at home doing nothing. And I would come home and ask him how his day went and he'd say ""it was okay, I cleaned"" or ""did laundry"" or ""sorted your books"", which always filled me with guilt. I started wondering if we get married, whether or not I would feel trapped. I'd never gotten out there with anyone else before and had no idea who I, as an adult, was without him.

Que my current boyfriend, ""Andrew."" Andrew is a photographer that does a lot of the shooting for the productions I am in. He was nothing more than an acquaintance for a long time but in group settings we often bonded over shared interests. We are both artistic, enjoy studying theater, and have similar goals in the entertainment industry. He is a kind, sweet guy, albeit a little socially awkward at times. 

Andrew and I started texting; this isn't a big deal, I have several male friends that I texted on and off. When I felt like he was beginning to be a bit flirty, I told him I couldn't talk to him anymore. Then I started to think about it. I was developing feelings for him too, which has never happened in the history of my relationship. I felt sick with guilt, and decided I had one of two options. 1.) Recognize that I had a small crush, that this was normal, and that I needed to distance myself from him and just continue on with my life 2.) Consider that this may be a symptom of a bigger relationship issue; that I was no longer really attracted to my boyfriend like I used to be and was started to enjoy his company less and less. 

I decided to go on a break with Derick. I told him my issues, how I was feeling, and that I wanted to go out and find myself and date other people. He was devastated but agreed. During our break, I slept with Andrew. It was my first time with someone else, and it didn't kill me. I didn't feel sad, like I thought I would. I enjoyed myself. I immediately went home after that and told Derick we had to break up.

Fast forward 7 months and I am now with Andrew. We live together and he is loving and caring and head over heels for me. For the first 4 months, I felt good about my decision. But Andrew moves fast. He wants commitment, he wants the promise of marriage in the future. And at first, I thought, yeah, I can see myself with this guy. But after the initial excitement wore off, I fell into a deep depression. I no longer want to do my hobby as much. I cry all the time. I feel sick to my stomach at the thought of spending a life without Derick. When I picture myself walking down the isle, it isn't to Andrew. It is to Derick. 

I have not told Derick about these feelings because I think that is selfish. He has come out of his shell a lot since our break up and I was hoping he would meet someone. Maybe sleep around. And then, after he has had a chance to really see what is out there and what he wants, can decide whether or not he actually wants to be with me again. I feel terrible. I feel like I am leading Andrew on (we live together in a small apartment so breaking up with have financial and severe social repercussions, as I said, we run in the same theater circle), and I miss Derick more every day. I do have feelings for Andrew, but we definitely rushed into things and I am  not yet sure if I want what he wants. I do not know these are genuine feelings or if I am only able to remember the good now that the bad isn't in my face. 

Tl;Dr: Been with bf forever, broke up, want him back maybe. New boyfriend in limbo.

I had a year and a half left to complete to acquire my Bachelor's in History and Minor in Education.  

Prior to leaving school I worked as a Lead Tutor for an elementary school through a program provided by my university. I was hoping that having experience as a Tutor (i've worked with the program for 2 years) would help when it came to getting my teaching credential for history. I was undecided whether i wanted to be a middle school or high school teacher.

Now that I am back home I want to find something that I could do that will look great on my resume and especially when i go back to school to finish with my major. I don't know how long it will be till I go back but it probably won't be anytime soon. 

I would love to have some guidance. My family and friends have done an amazing job helping me cope with my aunt's death and getting me back on my feet but now I want to be able to do something and start building my life back with school not being an option right now.

*The following are skills and passions are things I absolutely love doing.* 

* Reading, writing, learning, or teaching **HISTORY**. 
* I love writing. I am in the processes of writing a couple of shorts stories and I also am working on a script for a television show pilot that I would love to turn in eventually.
* When I was younger i play guitar and now I still do whenever I have the chance. I wanted to go to MI (Musicians Institute) when I was in high school but thought about getting an actual education as a substitute. I would love doing something in music if it was available to me. 

If anyone has any advice or has been in the same position as me I am begging for help here. I don't want to continue working at places like Starbucks or any sort of job that where people are going to constantly nag and bitch at you for not getting their order right. Not that there's anything wrong with people who have these jobs but I'm just trying to push myself to something that I know i could do better and that I would love doing.

I am also open to potential internships that could lead me to acquiring something in my fields.

2nekmb,7,2014-11-25,Considering nursing as a second career after BA in psych. Help! (Sorry it's kinda long),Curiouspichu,StudentNurse,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentNurse/comments/2nekmb/considering_nursing_as_a_second_career_after_ba/,"I'll explain how I got to where I am now, desperately considering nursing after my expectations of what I could do with a bachelors in psychology really hit me.


**Life story**

I graduated in May this year with a BA in psych 3.65 top 15% of class, internships on my resume as I was dead-set on going PH.D. However, once I saw the lengthy schooling requirements (6 years) and the difficult entrance rates (10%?!) I 'noped' and settled on doing a Masters in counseling. 

However, having graduated debt-free and seeing the dismal underpaid salary (starting 36k), I was not about to go through 3 years of schooling and get myself $30,000 or more into debt just to graduate and earn about that much probably doing agency work (which is where they thrust clients into your lap so you don't worry about getting people in the door *BUT*  they easily take 30-50% of your session rate). The downside of this is that you either overwork yourself to make decent money, which is hard considering the nature of counseling, OR you suck up the bad pay and wait a few years to get experience to pass the exam that gives you license to have private practice (and charge what you may but it's like running a personal business). I was not liking this at all. Even worse I wanted to specialize in 'positive psychology' where you focus on wellness instead of just mental illness but it's not too common since it's kind-of, I don't know, squishy stuff. 

**Putting it into context**

I'm the stereotypical minority first generation student who because of government and scholarship aid was able to attend college at all. This means that I come from a broke-as-fuck single mom janitor household. I'm 22 and can't fathom making barely 10k more than my mom makes herself. I have no transportation and no way of being able to pay for gas or insurance and I'm stuck using public transport. I was able to go to college all these years I don't know how (my commute was easily 3 hours a day but I was strictly limited to what times I could register for classes. Thus opportunities for school involvement were limited. Also, taking the bus at 8pm isn't a good idea where I live.) I'd like to become independent sooner than later and help my poor mom. We can't afford going to the doctor too often and have to choose what we want to get treated. Everything is just a mess. I would love to get a job but I hate research and that's the only thing I can sorta get right now and even then, how will I get to work?

**The Plan**

For many reasons I've already stated, psychology didn't turn out how I expected. Tragically I learned about the field of Public Health way too late in the game and couldn't switch majors if I wanted to. I thought about going to grad school for public health but the same logistics apply with more cons to that idea (unsure about job market with MPH, many employers use public health nurses for the same job etc). I'd rather use the next two years to go back to school before I get too settled in my life and have more responsibility.

I've always liked science and nutrition and being healthy. I have a great memory, know I'm dedicated and I'm not super squeamish about blood (I like browsing /r/wtf haha although poo is kinda icky ya know?) I like the idea of teaching people skills to be well and the whole mind/body/spirit thing. So this is where I'm at. I can go to a very nearby community college, get my an AS in nursing in 2 years (accredited) and start working. The program would only set me back at most 10k and I have a wonderful fiance who is willing to help me out transportation-wise if need be. 

**My question then is**

 *Would it be weird if I went into nursing not wanting to be part of the hospital culture?* My goal is to be a public health nurse (**health promotion and disease prevention**), or a certified Holistic nurse. Hell even a school nurse just not the hospital. However, from reading I see many people suggesting nurses get med-surge experience. Not sure how I feel about doing two years post grad med-surge experience since it's not like I'd be applying to jobs that would require that experience me thinks? If I had to something in a hospital I'd do women's health, just not something that's super critical/intense. Maybe you guys can tell me what options outside the hospital there are?

There's also one personal caveat. I'm not really fond of the touching poo part and I'm a little bit of a hypochondriac so it could be a little nerve wracking :/ but if it means dealing with it through school clinicals to get where I need to, I'll do it.

So help? It's been very hard for me to take this 180 degree change.

I worked all summer 50+ hours a week and ended up making close to 30k income for the summer, with about 14k in savings.

I'm at a crossroads now, I really want to move out west for the winter I haven't really been happy where I am now and feel like I need to get out and experience a new place, and some adventure as I've never done anything like this. I have the money to support myself for 6+ months, and guaranteed employment if I come back home for the summer, but not in the technology/computer field.

Today I got an email for a job interview in 2 weeks for an IT Support position, and I was hoping to leave before that. I'm feel like pretty much guaranteed the position as I know people in the management, and the specifically told me to apply, and that they would help me with the job.

I don't really want to ask my parents, because I know they will tell me to stay home and interview and work in IT. I'm in a tough spot because I never did any internships during college, and it has come up in almost every previous job interview I've had and I feel like that's a big hindrance on my eligibility for positions. I have a decent track record for landing interviews, for the 8 positions I've applied for I've had 4 interviews.

At the same time I feel like I'm at a point in my life, where if I take a job I'll be stuck in the 9-5 grind, and I'm not sure I'm ready for that. I really want to get out and experience things, and get away from where I grew up since I've never been away for more than a week or two at a time.

Ideally I'm hoping to head to Bend, OR. And I know the job market is tough there, but I'm hoping to spend most my time at the mountain. I'd like to find some sort of part time internship or software position, but I don't know what my odds really are. It seems theres more jobs there than where I currently live, but I know no one that lives there and at the same time, I only have a few friends where I live now as everyone moved away after school. I am putting myself out on a limb, hoping to find some fun and the way I look at it, now is the time do it. I have minimal belongings, no lease, no real payments other than school loans, which I have money set aside for.

Has anyone been in a position like this? I really want to just pull the trigger and pack my car and go, I've got a few leads on housing while I live there. I'm not sure if I'm ready to settle into the daily adult grind yet."
2nf810,9,2014-11-25,I [25/F] am wondering if my crush/friend [26/M] is lonely and taking advantage of my feelings,gitzy89,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2nf810/i_25f_am_wondering_if_my_crushfriend_26m_is/,"**Tl;dr I have developed feelings for an emotionally-distant guy who (most likely) just wanted to hook up with me before we became good friends. After two years, is he trying to take advantage of my feelings and our friendship because he is lonely during the holidays?**

I [25/F] am your typical silly, social, overweight but (somewhat, sometimes) pretty science girl and he [26/M] is your typical brooding-but-hilarious-and-sweet-underneath, bearded, lazy, ridiculously intelligent guy. We were in school together and were in the same lab for three years, until recently when he graduated and took a job elsewhere.

Our more involved relationship started about two years ago when he got my number and we became texting buddies. I, among others, was convinced he had a crush on me. After he started to get a little sexual and crude in his text messages and work interactions, but then dodging a date opportunity I handed him on a silver platter, I realized he was probably just interested in hooking up. I wasn't at all. 

But I thought he was just shy and selling himself short, so later on I told him I had feelings for him. He did not reciprocate. We more or less just continued on like nothing happened. We texted and saw each other every day at school, went to lunch every day with a group, and built our social and professional lives around each other. We were each other's work boyfriend/girlfriend.

Over the next year, my feelings waxed more often than waned. I tried dating other people, but with him as my source of daily flirtation and frustration, he was an emotional sink hole. I think I just fueled his ego, more or less, but he did do remarkably well at keeping distance where it counted. We never hung out alone, never talked on the telephone, and never even touched each other during this time. We were in stasis, except for a short time when he dated a girl from his high school. During that period, he opened up some about his problems with women and how he keeps emotional distance...yada yada. Like that was hard to imagine.

This past year, however, things have been more wayyyy more interesting.
 
* I tried to drunkenly kiss him on New Year's.  
* He started a secret hookup/relationship with another co-worker just as we were about to take all these work trips AND expensive friend trips which made them all suck *hard* and not worth it. Our texting stalled.  
* He broke it off after two months the exact day I asked him about it. I wasn't accusatory, I just said if he wanted to talk about it to me he could. Our textlationship picked back up and I left for an internship a week later.  
* After summer break, we had a real good talk in person. I got to more clearly express my disapproval of his relationship with a co-worker. He confronted me about my feelings toward him (i.e., New Year's kiss). He expressed regret over hurting both her and me.  
* I confessed what I thought was true at the time, which was that I really just thought we could have been better friends than we actually were because he insisted on being distant. He agreed. And that led to a huge emotional discussion about his relationship with his parents, their divorce, fear of hurting people, and religion. He said he had never told anyone things he told me that night. We hugged and he left town for a couple weeks.  
* A few weeks later, I helped him pack to move and we actually hung out alone for the first time ever. That was great. We sat on the couch and giggled and laughed over various things. I swear he tried giving me a crotch display with his leg awkwardly up on the arm of the couch, which I ignored. We hugged again. He moved the next day.  

Our current situation is that we usually text for hours every day and the conversations are usually initiated, but by no means solely sustained, by me.

This past week, in particular, he has started to make sexual remarks again in the same vein as *two years ago*. I play a little dumb and he ultimately says ""If you aren't in line with where my head is at, it's probably for the best. My mind is a dangerous place."" I know he is lonely in his new city of residence and anticipates being home a lot during the holidays, which is about 3 hours away from where I live. Is he trying to feel out the possibility of a hook up? Or trying to convey legitimate interest now?

Side note: I've lost about 50 lbs in the past year and am probably about 20 lbs smaller than when he first showed interest. I put on weight by eating out with him every day, that asshole.

At any rate, the least probable of those scenarios is the only one that makes me not want to start increasing emotional distance between us. But regardless, I know it needs to happen. It should have happened well over a year ago. He is using me for emotional validation and support, and I am letting him because I need him to need me. But I've been through so much emotionally in the past year it's to the point where even if he were romantically interested with good intentions, I would need a lot of confirmation from him and that's not at all in his nature.

So can you help confirm or deny my suspicions? Is he trying to take advantage of my past feelings and our friendship for a hookup?

* She has been unhappy  

Problems in the Relationship:  
  

* I was 18 when we started dating  
* I have not found a job, lazy loser - (i am in grad school and working through some internships, but have not found gainful employment)  
* I am a leech on my parents finances  
* I am scared of commitment (its has been 7 years, why didn't i get her a ring? financial and scared of her unhappiness)  
* Lately, We have been fighting more  
* I am currently in an internship that is 12 hours away (long term relationship)   
* She dreaded coming home to me  
* We did not like the same shows

* She feels guilty for hanging out with friends when i do not have any  
* I do not have a life outside of her
* She thought she would miss me during this time but she has not  
   
This has caused a lot of various things on my end.  
  
I am a drag on my parents. I should have found a job my now.  
I am not happy. I've been so angry, I don't want to be around other people because i only bring them down.   
I can only be around people with my mask so they won't see and the mask is getting too heavy.  Makes sense why she would not want to be around someone like me. ""I don't miss you"" who would.

What can I do to stay on top of things?",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2nfzzl/19_full_time_student_part_time_job_what_can_i_do/,"Hey, like the title says I'm 19, in my sophomore year studying Mechanical Engineering at a big and pretty well known public state university. I've been working part time (10-15 hours/week) for the past year and make anywhere from $15-20/hr on average (tips). I was wondering what can I do to stay on top of things financially? Here's some info:

* Chase Debit card, my paychecks are direct deposited into my checking account. I'm probably going to open a savings account put a bit in there from every paycheck. Should I apply for a credit card? It seems like it would be a good idea for me to start buying the small things with it just to build credit easily.

* I live in a shared on-campus apartment, currently ~$800/mo including utilities, internet, etc. I know it's expensive, my friends and I were going to look at cheaper places next year. In a contract for rest of the school year, $500 cancellation fee.

* Tuition is just under $13,000/yr (in-state) so with housing that is roughly $20,000/yr.

* Apartment has a kitchen, I try not to eat-out often, make my own food, pretty frugal but still healthy habits here

* Parents have fortunately been very supportive, paid for most of my education so far, only taken out $2,800 in loans so far ($1800 subsidized, $1000 subsidized) but I will definitely have to take more loans out this year and for the rest of school. I'm not sure if they can continue to pay this much every year (sister is starting school soon)

* I always try to keep over $400 in cash as an emergency

* I don't think I can handle more work hours without it affecting my school work (lots of classes, sport, club project leader)

Should I be trying to pay some of the loans now? Or just put a percentage of my rather small income to savings and keep the rest for food/pleasure/whatever?

I'm considering not working at all next quarter to focus on my studies and mostly extracurricular work. I'm doing okay grade wise, could definitely be better. Having this outside project experience will look great on my resume and will definitely help me get a paid full-time summer internship. Is this a good idea or do I just need to get over myself and buckle down and work hard?

Seeing these ""Help I have $XXk or even $XXXk in loans"", posts are frightening and I would like to know how to manage this if/when it happens.

Any input is appreciated! Thanks!"
2ng1at,4,2014-11-25,My Positive Abortion Experience (for those who have questions or are curious),[deleted],abortion,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/2ng1at/my_positive_abortion_experience_for_those_who/,"Please note before you read this that I am Pro-Choice. You may not agree with me or my opinions but that is ok. I respect that people may have a different view than I do and I respect that you are entitled to your own opinion. I am sharing this for any women out there who are afraid or nervous or who may have questions. Please be respectful.

I want to start out by saying that I live in BC, Canada. For those who don't know, in Canada we have universal healthcare and abortion is completely legal. Abortions are covered by our healthcare and do not cost a dime. 

I am 20 years old. The man who got me pregnant (it takes two to tango) is my boyfriend of over three years and he is 23 years old. I missed a period and took a home pregnancy test which came back positive. I was completely devastated and, after confirmation with a doctor, spoke to my boyfriend about our options. After dating for 3 years, and having a couple pregnancy scares, we had already discussed what route we would go should I ever get pregnant (not that we didnt take precautions and do everything to avoid this situation). We are too young to raise a child and are not financially stable. I am in the middle of my university degree and having a child at this point in my life wouldn't be ideal. So I was given a referral to the closest abortion clinic two hours away and they called me and we made an appointment. In BC, there are few clinics so I had to wait three GRUELLING weeks before I could get in. 

I had an ultrasound the day before my appointment at the clinic and was told I was 8 weeks and 5 days pregnant. 

My boyfriend was amazing during this whole process. He deserves the boyfriend of the year award or something because I am such a lucky lady. He reassured me and kept me calm and listened to me cry and did anything I needed. I am so appreciative to have him as my partner.

We drove to the clinic the morning of my appointment. There were actually Pro Life protesters outside the hospital when we were parking. That really freaked me out and upset me, but, thankfully, in British Columbia we have a law that prevents protestors from being outside the clinic. We were far away from their judgement in a completely different building at the hospital. The actual clinic in the hospital has some security you have to go through before you go in so that was reassuring as well.

Once in the clinic I was taken into a room with a counsellor who asked me questions about my personal and family health history (diabetes, heart disease, medication, etc) and then we went over birth control options. I was on contraceptive pills when I got pregnant so I wanted to maybe try a new method. I ended up choosing the Mirena IUD. Thankfully again, my Blue Cross extended medical picked up most of the bill so my boyfriend only paid about $100 for the Mirena. 

He then joined me and the counsellor took us into the recovery/prep room where there were 6 or so beds with other women pre-op or post-op. I got changed into the skirt/robe you wear for the procedure and hooked up to an IV. I was given some pills to help me relax and help with the pain that would come after. 

They then took me into the procedure room where I met the doctor who would be preforming the abortion and the intern who was going to observe/learn. The counsellor got my boyfriend and he was actually allowed to sit facing me and hold my hand the whole time. I was given Fentanyl in my IV which reaaaalllyyy helped me relax. The counsellor/nurse sat on my other side and I was set up in the stirrups. Now.. I'm not a doctor and I'm not really sure of the entire procedure that I had, but this is what was done as far as I'm aware. My abortion was called ""Abortion by Dilation, Suction, and Curettage"". The doctor inserted the speculum, froze my cervix, and preformed the abortion. This was pretty uncomfortable but it was moderate/tolerable pain and I knew it was only temporary. She then inserted the Mirena afterwards which was good because my cervix was already frozen. No discomfort there. I was then taken back into the first room to recover. 

The nurses and counsellors were so so so kind to me. Everyone answered any questions I had and I was given so much information. There is a lot to remember so they gave me printed off lists of what to know and what to avoid. I was so anxious and nervous and scared and they made me feel completely at ease. For something that isn't so great they made it the best experience for me it could have been. At no point did I ever feel judged for my decision whatsoever. I am so grateful for all of the employees who helped me that day. I think that they all deserve a medal for kindness and caring. 

It has been one week since my abortion and I am experiencing mild/tolerable cramping and bleeding. It shouldn't last much longer. Midol has been a big help to manage some of the discomfort. 

If you are an employee at a clinic I just want to say THANK YOU!! You all are wonderful human beings and it's not an easy job to do. I appreciate everything that you do and don't think that your kindness goes unnoticed. I am trying to think of a way to give special thanks to the nurses and counsellors who helped me through my scary day. "

2ngf3i,2,2014-11-26,I wake up...and most days I don't want to.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2ngf3i/i_wake_upand_most_days_i_dont_want_to/,"Let's cut to the chase shall we?
I just don't know how to do it most days, to get that spark to get out of bed, to feel excited and think that this day is going to be better than the next?

I force myself up, make a fake smile even to myself in the mirror, making coffee, as I'm leaving the door to go to work.  Right now I'm a 3rd engineering student living by myself and currently on an internship, and most days I like to stay late, later than anybody else in the office because I don't have anyone, anything to go home to.

As winter's hitting, I wake up and leave usually before the sun rises, and I come back home long after it sets.  Ironic in a way that I'm living my life in darkness.  It becomes haunting after a while, the lack of optimism, the lack of believing things will get better, the lack of knowing...I'll always be alone.

I wasn't always so self-disposed and angry at myself, and there was a time where I felt fairly comfortable sharing all my problems with all my friends and good members of my family.  Now?

I wear a mask, I rarely talk to people and avoid them, just because I know that I think they're my friends, but as soon as I make a mention, I'll hear, ""Dude, you gotta get over it."" or ""Shit happens, don't get so worked up"" and by far the worst is ""Just calm down""

Just calm down huh? Just calm down?  It's so easy, I didn't even think of that, if I could I would fucking calm down, but guess what...I can't.  And that's why I'm cutting you out of my life, because I rather be disappointed by me but not the people I trust...or at least try to.

My mother and I have a great relationship, or so I thought.  It's been a few days on a vacation now and I'm getting so much shit from her, and the irony is I nearly broke down in front of her before this trip and told me that she would always be there for me, and now?  I feel like I don't know who she is.  Her own anger feels like it's pouring over me, and I honestly can't take it anymore.

I said was going to go home next weekend, but as of now I don't feel like going home ever.  I'll lie and slowly cut my contact with her until it's only needed.  I won't tell her my problems, she will no longer be my confidante, and I guess that's just the way things are.

Because I always thought that no matter where you go, no matter what you do, people will always be there for you one way or another, but in this life no one....and I mean no one will ever be there when you need them, or ask to rely on them.  People have a certain threshold for how much they care for someone, something else and these days it feels like I no longer matter enough for anyone to do so.

So don't worry, I won't, I'll keep putting on a happy face.  I'll leave school, go get a masters, move to some far coast city where it's hip and moving.  I'll grow a nice beard, work a 9-5 in an engineering job where I'll pretend to be chipper as ever.  I'll wire a shit ton of money to my folks and family, but I won't go home for the holidays, I won't go home period.  I won't have anyone visit me, and I'll wake up day after day remembering that this is what life is and if there is any shred of humanity in me, I'll act like the best damn person I can be. 

Of course I'll be cynical, of course I'll be mad, of course I'll be depressed, and of course I won't be glad.  But you won't know, and no one ever will, cause I'll put on the same fucking smile day after day in my own lonely world that is.

So don't worry, I just needed to went, like most days, even though I don't want to, I'll wake up. "
2ngk40,0,2014-11-26,CS61A or 61B First?,gobearsgobears,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/2ngk40/cs61a_or_61b_first/,"I know that in general, it's recommended to take CS61A before 61B. However my case is different since I decided to switch to CS very recently. As a Sophomore who JUST made the switch and starting from scratch basically for the CS major, I need to make an informed decision of whether to take 61A or 61B next semester during the spring.

Normally I intended to take 61A first, but my friend who is a declared CS major told me that taking 61B during the summer is not a good idea. He told me that it's the most important class for acquiring internships and such, and thinks that rushing through 61B during the summer will put me at a disadvantage. I'm going to be applying for internships during the Fall of 2015, so I MUST get 61B and 1A finished before then.

He told me to take it during the semester to learn the material more thoroughly. I can just take 61B next semester, and then take 61A during the summer. However I'm concerned about whether taking 61B before 61A is a bad idea. Will I be okay? Another friend who took 61B before 1A said that he was fine. I don't have prior programming experience, but I'm going to do my best to self-study before this semester ends. In terms of professors, both the professors for 61A (DeNero) and 61B (Hug) are very good. I'm actually torn since I heard that DeNero is awesome, and I would love to take 61A with him.

So to distill my question down to a sentence: would taking 61B in the summer as opposed to the semester hurt me in terms of acquiring internships, and will I be at a disadvantage for taking 61B before 61A?

But I am happy none the less.",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2ngpfv/17m_i_am_conflicted_do_i_choose_my_happiness_over/,"   We go to a collegiate high school, so we have to mature at a quicker pace than normal high school student since we have to associate with adults more so than people our own age. I am 17 and a senior, and am seen as highly sociable and mature to people around me-- that being said I do attract a large female crowd. I am notorious for being a ""player"", which I don't think I am. I would say because of the immature high school mindsets of my peers, they mistake me for playing women when I just have come to like the feel of actual dating while they are stuck on high school dating. I do not feel 100% happy in a fully committed relationship, and I hardly think this is the time, since I am young and will be going off soon anyway. My parents are pretty hands off, I buy what I want with intern money and thus am given freedom to do what I want within reason (ha). My girlfriend (who we will call Dana) , is 16 and a junior, doesn't have the same luxuries. Her mom is very uptight and non-sociable, therefore restraining her daughter from a lot when it comes to being a teenager and dating. 

   Well we started talking through a mutual friend, who at the time I was actually messing around with. Dana and I found a connection, and I broke ties with the first friend accordingly and explicitly to keep from any bad feelings between any of us. UPFRONT I told Dana I didn't want a relationship and explained why..weell she seemingly agreed. A few months went by and things were good for me, I was happy just having someone to hang with and be happy with, but she wanted a relationship title. I for one hate titles for many reasons, and explained this to her in the beginning, simply they just bring a sense of entitlement that doesn't work to well with the limitations most high schooler's have (HER SPECIFICALLY)! Well I am the type type to make the person I am with happy, and I caved, giving her the damn titles; it wasn't like I was really talking to anyone else anyways. 

   I just knew with titles would come the clinginess, tracking, ALWAYS wanting to hang, etc, while I just want CHILL (This program we are in is stressful enough I can't handle the normal high school cling). Well it did, which I was okay with since I can adapt, I just wasn't fully happy about it, but for her I did it. I told her that I wanted her parents involved so that we wouldn't be so limited, she agreed, but it took her so long to even bring it up to her parents, who were nodding but haven't made a move or responded to mine. Dana also won't push the issue so she will want to hang but I am not the type to want to go out with her all the time, since I am sociable I can't do what I love most (talk to females) when I'm with my gf, I just want to relax in a home setting anyways since school is so tiring. I have proposed that we stay in, but upon asking her I don't get desirable answers; stuff like she will ask, and gets a no, or her mom is out, or she can't come over cause her mom will disagree. She has asked me if I would want to come over, but will ask me before she gets approval, then leaves me with ""Well I have to ask""...-_- I HATE THAT, because it always falls through.

   It came a time because of this and the clingy on the college campus I wanted space, so I asked for it, she took it pretty bad (might I say this conditioned my brain somewhat) but she allowed for the break. During our like week break, all she could handle, I just relaxed and hung out with other girls that don't require much but the hang. We ended up back together fully.

The problem:

   We have been together 7 almost 8 months, I have still yet to meet her parents, and have offered she meet mine (not really needed they are accepting of whatever I choose), but she lightly refuses to meet mine as well. This factor of no parental involvement has limited us to what we can do. We are always on face time, and she clings as much as I'll allow at school. However, her mom thinks she spends too much time talking to me so a data restriction was put on her phone (Happened maybe our 3rd month together), so now her phone goes off at 10:30 -_-*... I don't always want to have to face time or talk or text, I would like t hang out at each others' houses, human interaction is the best! This is key for me, and even that isn't being met. Yes we ""see"" each other at school but since it's a college and we are on different plans our schedules rarely match and then I intern in the evening so we can't usually hang after school, then I have loads of homework on the weekend since it's college and high school. I am not the commitment type anyways, with lack of interaction that I crave naturally I find myself wanting it elsewhere and it is in abundance should I want it. 

   I would NEVER hurt her since she has helped me overcome so much, and honestly she is my best friend, I tell her everything! I even tell her my uneasiness I have now, but she is so naive. My assistant principle is very close to the students and she is like my second mother, she warned me to not get close to Dana because of my history (I break girls, they start innocent and I corrupt then get bored or so it seems from the outside), being so mature minded in comparison to my peers, and because of how naive Dana is. I didn't listen, now I am in a pickle. I don't think this is working for me, like I am happy cause she is perfect and catering (she does anything I want really), but not fully since all my needs aren't met. 

   I would like to end the official thing we have, but she is my best friend and I was her first so I know she'd be torn. I would like to still hang and what not I just hate titles, and want to be free to actually hang how I want without limitations. How I see it, we are young, I can't limit myself to a semi-perfect situation when I could be playing the field. I don't want to hurt her though, but being with her isn't fully making me happy. I know if I broke it off she would never lose feelings for me, being I was her first, and *hairflip* I am just awesome (hahaha but no seriously).

   What do you all think? Am I wanting too much? Would I be better ending it or just pushing her to talk to her parents? What to do?

TL;DR

   If I'm going to be ""forced"" into a relationship I want a real one, not a high school one. This need isn't met. I love her and all she has done for me, and will do for me-- she is great; I don't want to hurt her. I want more, I am naturally a single type of guy and gave it up for her. I feel I would be more happy should I be set free again especially in this time in my life. I would like to save our relationship as friends and sex partners, but thats so ambitious and really far fetched. Should I push for parental involvement, that would help make the relationship more accommodating for me, or should I cut my losses? How without hurting her."
2nguym,17,2014-11-26,I'm the happiest I have ever been. I am so stoked for life and this whole experience!,[deleted],Psychonaut,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/2nguym/im_the_happiest_i_have_ever_been_i_am_so_stoked/,"So I just want to start off saying I am an avid lurker of this sub. Between this side of the internet and other forums, the help of amazing people in my life, and some really surreal and great experiences of my recent life I have taken a whole 180 on my perception of my life, the world, and this whole experience. Im gonna post my past experiences of my life, my transformation, and who I have become. I see a lot of posts on here of many people posting of ""feeling lost"", no longer being able to face society, questioning everything from friendships to their purpose, and being generally depressed. I have been there and done that. I still have many things to learn to become even happier and more at peace with myself, but since I recently got myself to be really stoked for everything and overcame my negative feelings of life I hope my post can help some of you guys out and this way I can also pass on some advice I have gotten along my journey that helped me be happier and more understanding of the world. 

I was born and raised in Russia. I was never poor but never rich. I was raised by musicians and was always taught to love music. I was raised on music. Never really having much except music my family never got too into materialistic side of things especially in Russia. I moved to America when I was 10 years old and was completly overtaken by comsumerazim. In America, the first thing you are taught is that you can have anything you want if you work hard. My middle childhood was based amongst video games, playing sports, music, television, the next cool gadget, and shit we are told we need. I always felt a little out of place. I would start something up weather it was a cool new hobby or got a new phone and would just as quickly lose interest in it. Why? Maybe because I liked trying new things, I don't really know why. I just always felt a little different and out of place. 

When I was in high school I wasn't the popular kid, but I wasn't the nerd. I played some sports, was an awesome sax player, student council, the works. I fit in. But I hated it. I started questioning everything. This was when I started my ""psychonaut"" journey I guess. I saw how fake high school was and how most of my ""friends"" were just people I was with because we couldn't explore the world and find people we really vibed with. Granted its high school and people say it shouldn't matter… Its still a huge part of your life and a lot of who you become is based upon your experiences as a kid. (for kids in high school reading this.. though I am contradicting myself, no matter how shitty of a time you are having right now because you feel alienated because you are starting to see the world for what it is, it gets a whole lot better after. I fucking promise) Anyways I started smoking pot and drinking a lot. By senior year I hit such a hard depression I left school. I went into independent studies and started going to a lot of music festivals and got introduced to psychedelic drugs. 

This was the beginning of the next step of my life. I started to explore my mind and the world around us. I started to get my thoughts confirmed by being around like minded people. Say what you will about hippies but some of them are really smart. I started to see that everything around us is really fake. First world society is so caught up in cosumarizim. Acid made me really start to question the meaning to things. I started to hate everything. I became very angry. Angry at the government for controlling the people and our lives. I was angry at everyone around me(including myself) being so rich that we could provide for starving families around the world many times over but we are more worried about the next iPhone or the next sale at Macys. I was angry at the dishonesty of people that were in my life(people being friends with me for their own benefit rather than mutual benefit) I was angry at not being able to express my thoughts to people I cared for(it gets tiring talking to random hippies after a while) I became obsessively angry. I hated the world. I hated my life and that I let myself get caught up in it. I tried to express my hate for all of this. I caught off relationships. I joined protests. I started to sell of all of my shit. I started to preach to people, only to have them laugh at me. Though I was beginning my journey into seeing the world for what it is I was accomplishing nothing. I was no longer a depressed high school kid but an angry teenager. I still felt alienated though now knowing there were more people just like me outhere. And that in itself was very frustrating. Seeing 50k subscribes on forums like this and meeting other pissed of psyconauts at music festivals, and other places where we normally gather, and not seeing any change in the world or mainstream thinking. It sucks because at this stage I felt like the world sucked ass and life sucked and there is nothing anyone can really do except blame the government, corporations, and teachers for making our world all about ""you and consumerism""  

The next step of my life was depression. After a bit of time I got tired of being angry and trying to change the world with no avail. I shut myself from the world. I deleted all social networking. Told all my past friends to fuck off. Stopped going to music festivals. Stopped doing drugs and substances.  Became a sad sad kid who just did not care about anything. I felt like I gave up and it was sad. I didn't want life but was too scared of death.

Then I started reading more into spirituality rather than psychedelic movement and how to perceive the word differently. I slowly started resurfacing into the world. I read a lot about buddhism and other like religions and belief systems. I started doing yoga. I started making music more and more. I started meeting more people that had similar interest in the hobbies that I truly enjoyed like making music and snowboarding. I started making my track back into society but with a different perspective. Once you make a dive into finding your spiritual self you start seeing the world through a different eye. 

This was my next step of life. I realized that though the world was fucked, there is so much good that needs to be done, and that its people like you and me who see it for what it is that need to be the front line army of the change. Though things really suck with people starving, and violence everywhere, and people being costumed by materialism its souls like you and I that are here to understand that and change that. As I started really getting in touch with my spirituality and finding out of who I really am rather than what the world is I found out what I wanted to do. I realized through every stage of my life music was there for me. When I was a kid, when I was in high school and feeling alienated, when I was angry and trying to reign hell on the first world society, and when I lost all meaning to reality. Music was my escape. I realized that I will change the world through music. Now I'm an ok musician but I am also smart enough to realize I'm not the next Mozart or the next Jimmie Hendrix. I realized that I need to go to college and get my degree in entertainment law and work my way up in the behind the scenes side of things. Basically my goal now is to be like a producer or a studio head so I can bring amazing music to people around the world. I got my first internship recently as an audio engineer and I am feeling like Im on a certain road to success with this career path. I feel like investing my time into bringing music to people in this world is something that is very giving to our community. Music is the universal language that makes people feel emotions. And emotion is the thing that makes us human. And who knows maybe Ill become a big producer and be able to start an orphanage in Africa one day or something. Either way I am happy with my decision and I have a sense of place in this world. Every once in a while I have the want to go and drop everything to go and just explore the world but I know thats not really what I want. Because to me those thoughts come when times get a little rough. Even as happy as I am now I still have certain self doubt and some fear of small things. Because Im human and not fully “enlightened” individual. Though I have that want to go and just explore the world thats not me. I love the feeling of success and I feel like I will bring along a greater change if I put effort into school and getting far ahead in the first world society. I know what I want to do and i know what I need to do to get there and I am very happy because of it. This is all because I took the time to take a step back from my anger and depression and explore myself and my mind. 

Now this all happened fairly recently and over the course of the last two months I have been in total awe of the world. I have my goals and my dreams set straight and I have been digging deeper and deeper to get in touch with my inner self. With that I started seeing how beautiful the world around me really is. I started to see how green the grass is. I feel the life trees give off. I feel the energy of happy and good people. I am never really sad or angry Im just stoked. Im stoked for life. Our world is so big and vast and beautiful and I have a whole lifetime ahead of me to explore it. I am so stoked to be where I am with the knowledge that I have. I also am stoked to see where I will be in 10 years as far as understanding of the world goes. Every day I have a new understanding of the world. I love everybody and the world is loving me back. I am just constantly happy. This energy that's flowing through the world is not negative at all as I used to think. The earth that lived 2000 years ago is still here and is still very similar to its roots. Many people may be consumed by the first world norms but its changing. More people are starting to go down the same path you and I are on. The change is coming. And we have to be the ones that lead it by being productive with our time. By being good people. By loving the world. Loving the people. And most importantly loving ourselves. Once we can do that more and more people will follow down our footsteps. And soon this anger and depression that we have towards how much the world sucks will go away. I have such high hopes for the future and I just can't wait to see what happens. Good or bad everything will be ok. The Earth is just another one of us. We are all the same thing. We will find a way to prosper and be. This is the beginning of our next journey. 

So with that being said… This was my transformation of thinking from senior year of high school to my freshman year of college. It took me one year to go from being lost, to angry, to very depressed, to spiritual, to super stoked. I still have a long way to go. And you may think what does a 19 year old kid know? I may not know much but I am happy and in love. In love with you and in love with the world. I will bring along change and I know every single one of you will as well. My advice to anyone that is lost or angry: Try to find yourself, and learn to love yourself. One you do, then you can start loving the world and bringing along the change you so much want. One love guys.

2nhc4u,5,2014-11-26,[need advice] How do you deal with candidates who are both arrogant and sub-par?,[deleted],recruiting,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/2nhc4u/need_advice_how_do_you_deal_with_candidates_who/,"For context, I'm an agency recruiter. A big part of my job involves talking to candidates I know I'll never place for market intel. It's not my favorite part of my job, but I digress.

I'm in tech, so arrogance/social ineptitude is par for the course amongst candidates. However, I've recently been dealing with a ton of candidates who are both incredibly arrogant and really bad at marketing themselves. They won't heed my advice regarding their resume, code samples, and search parameters, then complain that I haven't found them a job.

For example, I have an entry-level candidate I first interviewed back in September. He graduated from a decent state school with a BS in CS with a good GPA, just wrapped up his fourth internship. He told me he's ""only open to positions in the gaming industry,"" didn't know what GitHub is, and claimed he had two years' experience in his self-summary. I informed him that four undergraduate internships do not put him in the same category as junior developers so he can't claim two years in his self summary, he needs to put together code samples from his academic work (preferably on GitHub), and that positions in the gaming industry are incredibly competitive. I basically told him he needs to up his game if he wants a gaming job, because he's competing with kids out of MIT and Harvard for them (I recruit in Boston). He scoffed and complained to my manager, who brushed him off and told me to keep him in my back pocket. I just received an email from this kid earlier this week asking if I have anything for him now that he's ""expanded his search."" I'm tempted to just delete it. He has removed the ""two years experience"" from his resume, but still hasn't figured out GitHub. At least he's finally given up on finding a gaming job.

This is just one example - I deal with these kinds of candidates a *lot*, at every seniority level. They don't understand the value in what I do and treat me like an annoyance, then get pissed off when I don't have a job for them.

What do you guys do? My employer would have me stroke these candidates' egos and milk them for market intel, but a lot of the time these candidates' don't actually have any intel because they haven't been interviewing (because they haven't heeded my advice). Should I just kick them to the curb?

Even if you don't have any constructive advice, I would love to hear how you cope. Thanks."
2nhp67,11,2014-11-26,What to do when no one hires you?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2nhp67/what_to_do_when_no_one_hires_you/,"Hi, 

I have about one year left at my university before I graduate with a bachelors in COSC. Problem is I have no real world experience, and there is no way in hell i'm getting an internship. There is literally no reason for a company to pick me up over someone from one of the bigger city colleges in my state with a stronger curriculum(pretty much every other college). ""Yada yada you'll never know if you dont try."" I am trying. The only thing I'll have under my belt when I graduate is a degee, a personal project or two, and a passion for programming. Passion doesn't pay the bills. So what is a good strategy for when the inevitable happens and no one wants to hire me? Sorry if this is pessimistic but seeing the experience everyone else has on this sub and other subs makes me feel pretty lackluster. I hope this helps someone else in my shoes. "
2nhq7i,9,2014-11-26,Am I screwed if I am bad at coding questions and want a software dev job?,fpo98,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2nhq7i/am_i_screwed_if_i_am_bad_at_coding_questions_and/,"I am studying Computer Science and I will be graduating in May and I applied to a few jobs earlier past semester and I got rejected from all of them (couldn't even get past first rounds). I am not sure why but it's probably because my coding questions/answers weren't the best. I have a lot of personal issues / ultimatums going on as well so I sort of just gave up getting a job in general which is probably bad but my life is sort of complicated, I digress.


Anyways, I am just not good at answering the typical coding questions on the spot unless I have done the exact problem beforehand and can solve it from memorization. I just do not think really well under pressure and I could probably be able to solve it under different circumstances albeit still not as fast or as good as others. It is not as though I do not study for this since I have spent countless hours studying for them using one of the coding interview books but it won't help me unless I actually memorize the solutions and get the exact problem or incredibly similar. I know some will likely suggest just interviewing more for practice but I don't think that is practical since I only have one semester left and I also think the problem goes deeper than that and probably won't be ""fixable"" in such a short time span (social anxiety).

I mean, I actually don't think that I would be a bad developer since I actually really enjoy learning things and I can dedicate myself to learning things really quickly. Although I also feel that I probably don't have as much experience with respect to classes, projects, languages learned, internships (my only internship was an unrelated IT internship) compared to many of my peers which again puts me at a disadvantage but I still think that I would be a coder since in the very few group projects that I have worked on, I typically see myself as one of the better coders (granted sample size = 1). The really only thing that I have is a really high GPA (3.98).


This has gotten really long and I don't really know where it's going but I think my point is that I feel like it would be too difficult to get a job and since most companies start off with coding questions, which I am not too great at, I am put at a large disadvantage. This coupled with my other problems in life makes me just not want to even apply for jobs and just give up since the process is so stressful and rejections make me feel like absolute shit.

2nhrtx,0,2014-11-26,Looks like I won't get an internship this summer as a sophomore,gwkuser,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2nhrtx/looks_like_i_wont_get_an_internship_this_summer/,"Hi everyone, I just wanted to first say thank you for clicking on this. I know I am of no value as a student and here I am just shamelessly asking for free consulting (If there's any way I can help you guys out too, let me know!). 

To start things off, I am an ECE major at a top university where top companies recruit at. My **resume to interview conversion rate has been high**, but none of these interviews landed me a single internship. That probably means my skills in solving problems is underdeveloped and I am effectively useless at the moment and/or I just don't fit into the culture of frisbee and free swag and my interviewer can detect that (I'd say with my attitude and personality and interest in finance as a hobby, I'd fit in more with financial services firms). It appears that internship decisions have already been made by a few posts on Facebook saying sophomores got internships at Google. The ideal situation is this:

Get an internship at a smaller company this year

Get an internship at a top company the following year

Graduate in the winter (Gotta love those AP credits) and profit and bro down

Now I really want to stay positive despite the rejections that have taken a great piece of the pie of my soul (If it even exists). Fortunately, I currently have a research job, so I am thinking that I can extend this over the summer. **The question then becomes, should I take summer classes while working in research part time or work in research full time without any classes?** I would have to still attend senior year fall semester due to this capstone design requirement so unfortunately I can't graduate earlier than that. What taking summer classes will allow me to do is take more courses that perhaps relate more with my **dream job at a quantitative hedge fund**. So should I sacrifice some time in research to take summer classes? If you have other suggestions, I am absolutely open to them as well so list them out!

I hope this wasn't too long and sorry if it was. Thanks so much."

2nhv01,925,2014-11-26,How Reddit Was Destroyed (ver2.0),[deleted],conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2nhv01/how_reddit_was_destroyed_ver20/,"1) **The first thing they did was take away r/reddit.com.** 

This took away the only tool for communicating *with* reddit *about* reddit. If you had any concerns about the website as a whole, you could address them through r/all. Taking that away was the first step.

2) **The power now resided in individual subreddits, obviously the most popular ones. There was a power grab to become moderators of these subreddits.**

I remember as the upcoming election loomed, all of a sudden, r/circlejerk (one of the old default subreddits) became completely obsessed with bashing Ron Paul. I am not even a RP supporter, but that was definitely orchestrated, and NOT by some kids trying to be funny.

3) **Once the subreddits were controlled, drastic changes began to occur.**  

I remember when r/IAma was open to anyone and the popularity was decided by voting. Now it is nothing more than a cheap place for celebrities to whore out their products and you need to be ""approved"".

4) **The appearance of shills soon became VERY apparent.** 

All of a sudden new accounts started popping up out of nowhere, cue the birth of r/HailCorporate. Also, around this time, ""feel good"" military posts started appearing, like a soldier coming home to his dog. From brand new accounts that *never* posted again.

[Eglin Air Force Base = Reddit's most addicted city!](http://www.redditblog.com/2013/05/get-ready-for-global-reddit-meetup-day.html)

I would hate to be the poor reddit intern who got fired that day! ""Didn't you read the memo Billy. US military bases are *never* to be included in our yearly stats!!!""

5) **Now we have blatant censorship on r/news, r/worldnews etc... saying that X site is not allowed.** 

What ever happened to letting people vote on the content of this website?

6) **Speaking of voting, they changed that too.**

We now have an entirely new way to view upvote/downvote scores. A user used to be able to see their score. But now, everything is fuzzed. For example, if you made a semi-controversial comment before, but many people agreed, you may have a score like (47/45), leaving you with a -2 next to the comment. Now you just get a -2 and nobody knows if *anyone* agreed with you.

7) **Hey guise, us nerds who run reddit have decided to shuffle all of the front-page subreddits, tee-hee we are so random ^‿^ **

No more r/circlejerk, that pesky subreddit hits too close to home. Lets add 2X to the mix, even though they wanted to remain an anonymous sub, fuck them, we need to show our shareholders we represent the female demographic. Lets also add a bunch of subs that we can use to share propaganda like r/nottheonion.

8) **You are posting too much, please wait...**

It now doesn't matter if you have confirmed your email, or been posting on this site for years. If you anger the wrong mod/admin or your posts aren't doing ""well"", then you get benched.

9) **[Reddit is not a meritocracy](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/the-reddit-front-page-is-not-a-meritocracy/).**

**tl;dr**: Your votes do not matter. The front page is not decided on merit. Different subs are given different algorithms. There is a behind the scene ranking system that gives certain content a ""head-start"" and as we have learned at r/conspiracy, if they don't like our sub, then we are banished from the front page, forever. Just like we were banished from r/bestof, after this [amazing comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1pvksy/what_conspiracy_turned_you_into_a_conspiracy/cd6kofo) that was gilden 8X and received over 3000 upvotes. [They actually gave that user the boot.](http://www.reddit.com/r/altnewz/comments/1q35an/just_for_archives_purposes/) How dare you bring your unique, first-hand perspective to a web-forum!!!

10) **The arrival and subsequent take over of r/undelete.**

Due to the now rampant censorship on the site, users took it into their own hands to bring the truth into the light. They created a part of reddit where users could see what was being deleted. [Nope.](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2m6fsl/on_the_takeover_of_rundelete_and_the_subsequent/)

11) **All of the proper ""checks and balances"" are now in place.** 

R/worldnews has become the ultimate modern-day version of the [Two-Minutes Hate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Minutes_Hate) from George Orwell's 1984:

&gt;a daily period in which Party members of the society of Oceania must watch a film depicting the Party's enemies and express their hatred for them.

But when we really want to drive a point home, the entire front-page gets in on the action!!!



It wasn't always like this. A few years ago, there were just as many disagreements and differences of opinion on reddit, but they were REAL. And the site was still a democracy. People voted and things swung from side to side, everybody learned in the end.

Now we have a completely one-sided mess that pretends to be democratic but is quickly becoming the Fox News of the internet. 

And I believe this can essentially be boiled down to greed. Reddit gets billions of views. The people who run reddit are not the ""cool bloggers"" they try to portray themselves as. There is a head running things, and it is sinister and they are making A LOT of money, and have A LOT of power, and A LOT of influence. 

And they know it. You should too."

I'm currently classified as a Senior taking what would be my third semester in the CprE program, with a planned five semesters left to go. When I graduate I'll have taken 12 semesters (woo?)




Earlier this year I interviewed with three companies. Two of them were for internships next summer, and one was for a co-op.




I accepted an internship with one of the companies a few weeks ago (If I were to rank this internship with the other two, I'd probably find the other two more interesting). They do say that I have the ability to terminate the internship at any time #burningbridges




However, just last week, the company with the co-op calls and offers a position for next summer and fall. Two things that concern me are: Why did they wait 7 weeks to get back? Also the fact that I'll be delaying my graduation another semester is kinda... meh? Not a big deal  I guess. They want to hear from me ASAP if I'll take the position (no pressure apparently).




Finally, the company that I am most interested in has yet to get back to me; their website still says I am in ""interviewing"" status, as of September 25 (you can tell how prompt they are). If they were to call I'd definitely be interested in going there next summer. 


So r/EngineeringStudents, any advice or suggestions here? 




* Any input or advice on taking a co-op as opposed to an internship? It'd be right after my fourth semester in CprE.




* Is the fact that companies are taking 7-8 weeks to get back to me a red flag? The first company responded back in about a week and half. 




* If the last company does end up calling back with an offer, should I just decline everything and go with them?




I hope I wasn't too vague is describing my position; I want to hear ideas from other people who have possibly been in similar situations. "

I have no internship experience prior to my search for one now.  

The only projects i have done so far are the ones at school and those includes:

Right now I'm in the fortunate position that I have offers from four different companies all for software engineering internships:

Box on Storage Team

LinkedIn on Monetization (Team Money)

Bloomreach

Salesforce on Sales Cloud

I was originally hoping to do PM this summer instead but it doesn't seem like that's going to be the case. I worked last summer at LinkedIn as a web developer intern so I definitely know a lot about LinkedIn and the awesome people, culture, and amenities. 

Do you guys know much about the other three companies? Just by offers alone LinkedIn is over 10% higher base than the others, and I know approx what LinkedIn offers new grad intern returnees based on last year's comp (pretty high). I'm caught between choosing because they all have pros and cons (Salesforce, even though right now its the lowest offer monetarily, is in SF)."

Her first relationship was with a guy who seemed nice, he was the younger brother of one of my friends. Turned out he was extremely controlling, to the point where he'd scream at her if she spoke to other men. She stuck by him because she wanted a prom date, and because she was so weak that she wanted him to break up with her. She was done but she wanted him to be done with her. After he was out of the picture, she started being a normal 17 year old and flirting with any guy who gave her attention. Unfortunately, some of those guys were 2 dudes that were my age (5 years older) that worked with her. One guy who was in a serious relationship would ask her to masturbate for him via skype, and his best friend, the other guy, was actively trying to hook up with her. She was unsure about him and mostly tried to avoid him. One night at her job, he asked her to get something from the back, ran in behind her and raped her at work. Everyone at her job turned against her and shamed her, saying she was just trying to get him in trouble, since his mom worked there too, etc. It was terrible and she was really mentally frail. After that my mom had her put in therapy for a while rape kit, etc. But she was insistent that she would not press charges, since she didn't want to face him. 

Anyway, then she graduated high school and went to college a few hours away. We were hopeful for her, but by sophomore year she ""fell"" for this new guy and talked about how it was casual but she really liked him. Eventually they made it official, but he would keep things from her. Like she's not allowed to follow him on twitter or instagram, weird things like that. When me and my siblings pointed out that why was that a big deal etc she freaked out and got extremely defensive. Then, everything started to unfurl. I guess one night this guy caught her texting another guy when she was really drunk. He took her to her room, gave her a giant hickey and took a video of her where he shamed her for her behavior and showed off the hickey he gave her (while she was blackout drunk in the video). He'd constantly tell her he wasn't into her but then do the whole white knight thing to win her back, over and over. She's an RA at her college and he's been causing all these disturbances. We found out he's been banned from her building b/c her residents are complaining. She calls my mom all the time saying he won't leave her room and could she tell him to leave. My mom listens to this guy spout off how my mom doesn't know anything about their relationship and they're adults, she should lay off, then hangs up on my mom. My sister buys this guy food, lets him live in her dorm, and he keeps ignoring her (obvious hint for her to break up with him) but she insists that she can't do it, because she loves him. Her behavior is so warped and she doesn't make much effort to see her therapist. Instead of dealing with her problems, she spreads herself too thin with her college life (partying, sorority, taking on too many classes and internships, RA) and complains about how stressed out she is. We feel bad but she won't listen to any of our advice even when she asks for it. It's driving all of us nuts. She admitted to my mom that her ""boyfriend"" is pushing her now. The last few times we've seen her, she'll look nice but all her clothes smell like strong BO. Another sister of mine saw her dorm and said it smelled terrible, like really strong BO.

I'm at the point where I just can't deal with talking to her because she talks in circles and asks for advice and ignores it right after. She'll try to talk to me but I just can't deal with hearing the same rambling over and over. Saying things like ""yeah I know but I can't, I love him"" over and over. Nothing is getting through to her, and me and my whole family are just at a loss. Are there any good resources I can send her, or any advice for potential things that might get through to her?

Sorry for the rant, we just all hate seeing her spinning out of control more and more."
2ni7vg,43,2014-11-26,"What’s the truth about ISRO, India’s primary space agency?",crypt221b,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2ni7vg/whats_the_truth_about_isro_indias_primary_space/,"What’s the truth about ISRO, India’s primary space agency?

&amp;nbsp;

Ever since I can remember, there weren’t many Indian things I thought highly of. ISRO was a rare exception. Capable of developing and deploying geostationary satellites and cryogenic rocket engines, launching lunar probes which would later go on to confirm presence of water on the moon, and now recently, a spacecraft orbiting Mars. For a country that has one of the biggest slum area, gaining a spot in the top 5 space agencies in the world is a pretty remarkable feat. ISRO made India proud among the world’s intellectual circles.

I always wanted to be a part of ISRO. These scientists and engineers had my utmost respect. You can only imagine how religiously I look up to my Dad who actually worked there! No, he wasn’t a scientist or an engineer. He was a Senior Networks and System Admin, basically in charge of all the computers. But that didn’t alter my regards for him in any way. He was loving, supportive, geeky, and the smartest guy I knew. He was my hero. 

Then I turned 18. The charm wore off. I started noticing weird oddities about ISRO. You know how you have these internal flags that can tell when something’s offbeat. You can’t really explain why since these flags are built from your life experiences and act on instinct. Some of these flags were waving bright red for ISRO. No matter how cool my Dad was, you could ignore these oddities only so many times until you realized that something was fishy about the organization. It was enough to make me give up my seat at IIST and go to US for a computer science degree.

&amp;nbsp;

5th November, 2013.

ISRO had launched and placed the MOM satellite in Earth’s orbit. It was night time. I was in my dorm room with my roommate, Tyler. He was an Arts student and we really got along well. He was busy working on his manga comic, taking up the entire bloody floor but I didn’t mind because he drew the hottest chicks imaginable. I was just getting started on a coding assignment, when got a call from Dad. *Oh snap, I forgot*. I picked up the phone and said, “Hey Dad, congrats! Sorry, I missed the live covera-“. I was cut off mid-sentence. My sister was on the other end, crying uncontrollably. 

After a moment, she gathered herself and said, “Come home, Raj. Dad passed away of a heart attack.” The world around me stopped still, as I tried to grasp the gravity of what she had just said. For a second, I couldn’t speak. 

Swallowing a heavy lump in my throat, I said, “No, what are you saying?! How did this happen!?” 

She said, “I got a call from Dad’s friend saying he just collapsed in his cabin. By the time help arrived, it was all too late.” 

Her words cut deeper than any blade. Tyler looked up at me making an expression as if asking what’s wrong. Trying hard not to break my voice, I said, “Look, don’t worry at all okay? Just take care of Mommy. I’ll be there by tomorrow.” By the time I was looking at international flights rates, I was in tears.

The funeral was attended by all my relatives, family friends, neighbours and a few of Dad’s colleagues from System’s. Though nobody from the core senior team of ISRO came. Cold bastards. From that day on, I loathed ISRO. 

&amp;nbsp;

24th September, 2014.

“So, you’re saying it’s impossible for me to touch anything?” she asked. I was sitting in the college cafeteria, having lunch with Amy, a girl I was dating. She was a Foreign Student Exchange Program student from Dublin and was here for only a semester. An introverted girl which is reason why I liked her. I liked how she wouldn’t start taking selfies at random places. I liked how she preferred parks over restaurants. How she didn’t watch dubbed anime because it was apparently disrespectful towards their original voices. She was smart, funny, artistic and emotionally mature. Also, I figured dating her and having my heart broken after 6 months would be a great way to get over my previous emotional setback.

“Yep, that’s right,” I said. “Electrons are on the outermost shell and they repel each other. So you never really touch anything. What you feel is just… repulsion.”

“Oh…” she said. “Does that mean I’m still a virgin?”

I almost fell off the chair. *Well, so much for introvertism.* “Funny,” I muttered. 

Then, I heard the word “ISRO”. Normally, the ears filters out random noise but certain trigger words when heard, really put you on alert. The TV was playing a piece about how the Orbiter had successfully entered Mar’s orbit. India was the first Asian country to accomplish this feat. I cringed. 

Amy sighed. She said, “You know you need to stop making faces and be proud for once. They did a really great job!”

I said “I don’t have a problem with their job. I have a problem with them.” 

That night, a message alert distracted me. I was lying in bed, busy texting with Amy, doing all the cheesy things one does while in a relationship.

&gt; **Me**: UUUGGGHHH. I think Prof. White mailed us a new assignment. :-(

&gt; **Amy**: Again? This is the 3rd one this weekend! He needs leave you poor kids alone.

&gt; **Me**: I know! It sucks! I better get started with it. Meanwhile, you write him a letter explaining our dire state.

&gt; **Amy**: Haha, sure. Get started now. Goodnight. &lt;3

&gt; **Me**: Goodnight. &lt;3

*Okay, cheesy convo over. Let’s get our hands dirty. *

Tyler said, “You know I’ve seen a lot of couples that do weird stuff but that you two take the cake.” 

“I know,” I said. “That’s why I like her.” 

“No you don’t understand, I’m her classmate. And I barely see her in class. She just hangs out with you all day.”

I smirked and said, “Don’t get me wrong but do I detect a hint of jealousy here?”

“Oh go fuck yourself already. I’m the one who introduced you to her,” he said. “Anyway, I know you want to experience a heartbreak and all, but don’t go overboard. I don’t want to be the one driving you around town for therapy.”

“Yes Tyler, I promise I won’t go psychotic.” I said.

He chuckled. “That’s what they all say.”

I gave him a dismissive look and I opened the mail to see that it wasn’t from Prof. White or any other professor. No, this mail was from an unknown sender. *Spam? Are you kidding me? * I opened it anyway, because I enjoy reading spam mails. They’re always so desperate, I find it rude to simply delete it. Also, their English is incredibly funny. Little did I know what the devil waited for me inside.



&gt; From: neoXXXX@gmail.com

&gt; Subject: Read this now. Urgent. Not spam.

&gt; Are you Raj Singh from Bangalore, India? If so, please reply. We need to talk.

*Interactive spam huh? Well this is new.* I wondered which website decided to sell out my private information. I replied:

&gt; Yes, Neo. I am the one that you seek.

I eagerly wait for a reply but instead of an email, I get a chat message. *You sneaky bastard!* He added me in hangouts chat. This is spamming on a whole new level!

&gt; **Neo**: Look, I need to tell you something very important. Your Dad didn’t simply die, he was murdered.

The smile on my face vanished faster than the speed of light. For a second, I almost fell for it.

&gt; **Me**: Okay who the fuck is this? You think it’s funny? Stop messing around, pal.

&gt; **Neo**: Raj, I am not kidding around. There’s something seriously wrong with ISRO. Now, I’ve always had a fair share of doubt but what happened yesterday definitely hammered the last nail in the coffin.

I decided to play along. I shouldn’t have. But for some reason, he seemed to know what he was talking about.

&gt; **Me**: Okay you have my attention. Speak.

&gt; **Neo**: I’m going to voice call you. Make sure you are alone.

&gt; **Me**: Wait, give me 5 minutes.

I took my laptop and told Tyler I’ll be gone for a while. He smirked and said, “Yeah, just make sure you kids use protection.”

I went to the terrace of my building. It was the only lonely place within close proximity.

I sat near the terrace door and started the voice call. “Okay, speak.”

Neo said, “Thank you for hearing me out since I know it can be hard for you to trust. You see, I started as an intern in System’s back when your father was in charge. I rose to Junior System Admin’s role and was satisfied with the way things were. But what happened yesterday, changed everything. While fixing a computer’s LAN connection in a core lab, I overheard a conversation between two scientists who were walking by. I was under the computer table, sitting patiently for the central server to restart. I’m pretty sure they didn’t notice me there because this is the conversation that followed.”

He pasted a conversation in the chat box. It read:

 “Can you believe we pulled off the Mars mission?”

“I know. So crazy! And I thought that scumbag Systems guy sabotaged everything. With all the data he acquired, he would have destroyed everything we’ve been working on.”

“Don’t speak about him, you moron. He’s been dealt with. Just focus on what’s next.”

“Right, right.”

Chills ran up my spine as every strand of hair in my body stood straight. The cold breeze of the night didn’t help. My voice quivered as I said, “I don’t get it. Why would ISRO scientists murdered my Dad?”

Neo said, “This came as an absolute shock to me to me as well. When I thought about it, the answer was clear. Money. These bastards had manipulated the budget and somehow your father picked up on this. And we all know the audits are pretty much a joke so they were never going to get caught. From what I think, your Dad started collecting evidence to put them behind bars.”

I said, “So you’re saying Dad stole their private data? This makes no sense. Even if you have access to it, the data would encrypted. There’s no way to decrypt it without a key.”

“Yes, you’re right. But if you have physical access to a computer, you can pretty much always get in. There’s all sorts of ways like spywares and keyloggers. Your Dad had the motives and the skills to do it.”

*Fair enough.* I hate to admit it but the guy seemed legit. He knew way too much about ISRO. I had little reason to suspect him. I said, “Okay. So, what do you propose we do?”

“Honestly speaking,” Neo sighed and said, “I don’t really know. Whatever we do, proving it in a court would be next to impossible without any evidence. I didn’t know your father all that well, but from what I can recall, he was a great guy. I just wanted to tell you the truth about your father’s death. I know it’s a long shot, but if you can think of any place where your Dad could have hid the data, it might give you a lead. Maybe a pen-drive or a remote FTP or something like that. I doubt he’d store it on his laptop because it’s too vulnerable and obvious. But yeah… that’s about your only option. You can contact me if you get something, I’ll be checking this email weekly. If something solid turns up, we can go public. Okay? You still there? Hello…” 

My brain was already mining out a memory from its neural chaos. A memory that I had forgotten I once had. It’s funny how your brain works. Your subconscious stores all sorts of memories and keeps it buried deep inside only to be revealed at the perfect opportunity.

I managed to hide the thrill in my voice and said, “Yes, I’m here.”

I thanked him for coming out of the blue and helping me the way he did. We said goodbye and ended the call.

I immediately called my sister and told her to mail me a picture of the poster in our parent’s bedroom as soon as possible. She knew better than to ask why and did it.

I returned to my room. Tyler wasn’t there, probably had gone to spend the night out with his friends. I eagerly waited for my sister’s email, hoping my hunch was right.

Around two years ago, me and my friend were in my parent’s bedroom, finding my Dad’s temperature gun. He gave up and sat on the bed, admiring the huge poster that hung right across the bed. 

“There it is!” I yelled. “Let’s see whose laptop runs cooler now.”

He laughed and said, “You know whoever made this poster is a moron.”

I asked, “Oh, really? Why is that?”

“Well, look at the name of their website.”

The link was written in tiny font, vertically across. I had honestly never cared to read it. I sighed and said, “That’s not a link to their website, smartass. Though, they really are morons. Anyway, let’s go check out the laptops already.”

It’s funny how I recalled that incident, after all these years. The e-mail came in. I opened the attachment and voila! The answer to where Dad hid all the data was staring me right in the face. *The link*. 

I quickly typed the link in the address bar and hit “Enter”. It took me to a Google document that had multiple links, each link redirecting to an anonymous free host, which presumably contained the actual data. It was exactly what I imagined. The link was a bitly link. For those of you who don’t know, a bitly link is a URL shortening service. It’s easy to spot them if you know what you are looking for. They shorten your link into random numbers which is easier to share. Dad used this exploit ingeniously. First, he stored the actual data on multiple anonymous free hosts, whose links were then pasted on a simple Google document made with an anonymous account. That Google document was then converted into a short URL. This meant he didn’t have to depend on a paid hosting. It didn’t leave a digital footprint that could trace it back to him. Heck, he didn’t even need a pen drive, all he needed was that shortened URL. It contained links to all the free hosts. There were probably 2 pages worth of links. That probably amounted to hundreds of gigabytes of data.

However, there was a catch. All those links were password-protected. It was difficult to get around that. Not impossible though.

I thought about it and decided tell Neo. In retrospect, that was the biggest mistake of my life.

&gt; **Me**: Hey, still online? I think I got something.

After 7 minutes, his reply came in.

&gt; **Neo**: Are you serious?

&gt; **Me**: Yes. Hang on, let me I’ll call you.


He took a while to pick up. When he finally did, he blurted out, “What on earth did you find? And that too so quickly?”

I noticed his voice sounded completely different than before. *A voice changer.* He was certainly taking every measure to hide his identity. I said, “Don’t ask me how but I found a bitly link. You know the ones they use to shorten URL? I just really hoped it would reveal something important. Well, guess what? I have the list of all the web hosts Dad used to store his data.”

He said, “No way! I cannot believe you figured it out so fast. This is incredible. Can I see the link please?”

I said, “Yes, of course. I typed it in the chat box. I know it’s a big lead, but the thing is, the data on those servers is still password-protected. So, what I am thinking is, we should probably go to the authorities at this point. Then, get them to mail those web hosts to release the data for investigation. Because most of the time, these free hosting services are always willing to co-operate if they feel we have some ground. What do you say?” 

There was a long pause followed by a strange beep. 


“Oh Raj, you shouldn’t have,” she said. It was unmistakable. That was Amy’s voice on the other end. Then before disconnecting the call, she said, “These things… they make us do horrible things. I’m sorry you got dragged into this. Goodbye.” 

The voice call ended and my world split into two. It took a while for reality sink in. *No! Why would she, of all people? * I tried calling her cellphone but she didn’t pick up. I freaked out like a mad dog. I ran up to her hostel, in the middle of the night, only to find that it was locked. *No, this cannot be happening.* I know I once told I wanted a heartbreak, but this was overkill by a long shot. Unable to take it anymore, I passed out on the hostel corridor.

Two strange things happened after that day. All the free webhosts links stopped working and I never saw Amy again. I asked around and found out she had to leave due to her “medical operation” and wasn’t going to return for the remaining semester. She was gone for good. Her phone number gave a dead tone. Her so-called “friends”, were good acquaintances at best, who didn’t even know she was an Exchange Program student.

I am lost and depressed and scared. I don’t know what my next move should be. I don’t want to go legal without a strong case because it can ultimately backfire and shatter my already devastated life. I am beginning to think that was all just a nightmare. Maybe Tyler was right. I had become psychotic.

Should I go?",rem87062597,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ni8we/got_a_good_but_low_paying_job_have_worked_there/,"I'm going to include way too many details in this post. Here's a quick bullet point timeline:

* Got an internship Sophomore year at a non-profit affiliated with my university doing data visualization websites. Made or helped on 10ish portfolio-grade projects throughout my internship. There were/are awesome, their main purpose is to help students get real world experience. Profits from projects from full time employees are invested back into the program to give more students internships and jobs.
* Graduated, got offered to come on full-time by the non-profit. I became a on-site contractor for my state government doing data visualization websites and general programming tasks. The non-profit offered me this as a stepping stone to get into the industry, I took the job despite the pay because I knew that long term it would be good. The expectation among my bosses was that I'd do this for a year or two and then move onto better jobs with the contacts I make from this job. They have said in the past that they would like me to stay for at least one year.
 * Salary - $40k/year, no benefits for the 1st year, mid-Atlantic region, my area's lower 10th percentile for salary is $63k and the average is $78k
* Work is great, I love my coworkers and I love the work I do. My portfolio is getting awesome and I'm meeting a ton of people. Culture is that of a government office though.

I started my post-college position in early June, 2014. Jump to a couple days ago.

* Make a contact at a company that does a lot of contract work for the state. It's a well established 120ish employee SaaS start-up that is the leader in their industry; when I started working at this job, I always had it in the back of my mind that I'd like to apply here when I wanted to switch jobs. I use their product daily, so I know it well. They have a division within their company that literally does exactly what I do.
* She passes my information onto their senior architect.
* He looked at some of my projects and he sets up a phone call with me, they really really want me to apply because my skills overlap pretty much exactly with what they want.

I really want this job too, but I don't want to leave my current employer after 6 months. They've been awesome and they're expecting a year out of me. I also love my current job, I wouldn't be leaving because I'm unhappy at my current job with the exception of that they're paying me ridiculously low and they won't budge. I'm probably looking at a 100% increase in salary at least, which is a big deal between student loans and an upcoming wedding. I initially said on the phone that I'd like to stay at my current employer for a year but he said he was going to keep trying to get me to apply and I'm thinking about taking him up on the offer. I don't want to stay at my current job for pure obligation when it's against my best interests, but then again, I'm not quite sure what my best interests are in this scenario or if I need to stay for non-obligation reasons like I don't want to burn a bridge.

Any advice? Thanks."
2ni9e9,5,2014-11-26,Moving into data science from other field,[deleted],datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/2ni9e9/moving_into_data_science_from_other_field/,"So I'm a neuroscience PhD student who's considering making the move into data science once I wrap this puppy up. Academically, I'm in a pretty good position (good program, 4.0 GPA, various awards, possibly an independent publication, etc.), but I'm not sure how keen I am on taking the academic route. The seemingly endless hoard of prospective biomedicine postdocs also keeps the wage at an absurdly low level (average is $42 000 a year). I do a lot of computational work in neuroscience (data analysis, visualization, computational modeling), and so while I might not be doing exactly the same type of stuff as data scientists generally do, it is very similar in many ways. My question is what is the best way of breaking into the field with the particular background that I have? On paper, I am encouraged by my school to do an internship during my PhD in an unrelated area of research so I've been thinking about doing that. My worry is that I will spend those months just doing mundane tasks instead of learning to use the tools and techniques commonly used in the field. Ideally, I would like to take those months to get more familiar with databases, machine learning, and in general working with data that comes in lots of different formats.    
    
Given that piece of information, would anyone have any clue what my best bet would be? Is an internship likely to be beneficial for me or should I just graduate and look for data science jobs? What about boot camps?

Imagine those individuals who are carrying the burden of not being hired because of their weight and those being discriminated against on their jobs because of their weight.

Vernon Fraley, former news anchor and reporter for Time Warner Cable News was discriminated against in the beginning of his television career.

“I went to a job fair in Florence, South Carolina after I graduated from college and was talking to a news director about an opening at his station, said Fraley. I’m glad it was an unofficial interview. As we continued to talk, all of a sudden the news director stopped the conversation, looked at me and asked me a disturbing question. First he pointed out that I was a man of size and height and then asked, ‘Do you think you can get a story from someone or get them to talk to you and trust you being a big black guy’? I was stunned! I said yes and asked him what does your size and color have to do with being a good story teller and a good reporter. I wrapped up the conversation and made up my mind that I wouldn’t work for him or the company even if he did offer me a position. I was fortunate to land a position with another station in Florence, South Carolina.”

The big question is why is weight such an issue when it comes to employment? Overweight people believe they should be judged by their credentials and not by their weight.

Obesity researchers have speculated that looks motivate an employer’s reluctance to hire obese people. When applying for high public visibility positions, the overweight and obese may have a harder time landing the job of their choice.

Ohio University psychologists believe the issue of hiring obese people is based on the amount of activity required for the position. An obese person is perceived as not being able to perform the duties. Obesity researchers say that the believed inability of performing the job deters employment, not physical appearance.

“Employers are assuming obese people simply can’t do the job,” said Paula Popovich, an associate professor of psychology at Ohio University and lead author of the study. “It’s not attractiveness, as many have speculated. We found that it’s more a perception that they are fat and they can’t do jobs that require a lot of physical activity. It’s a perception they can’t do the job without actually testing their abilities.”

The older generation believes that our society has definitely changed. Seventy-three-year-old Clemonteen Spivey Wilder from Franklin County said, “Years ago being overweight was a sign of wealth and power. When I was growing up back in the day, skinny children were considered sick looking and the heavier children were considered healthy. I was a small child and my mother would make me eat three meals a day and some. She said that I looked sick and needed to put some meat on my bones. Nowadays the big kids are considered unhealthy with that extra weight. Kids are also developing diabetes at an earlier age. It seems like there’s always something for us to worry about.”

Obesity researchers believe that the advancement in technology is another reason over half of the people in the country are overweight. They believe physical exercise has been engineered out of daily life. That is something to think about because kids don’t go outside to play anymore. They play video games all day and most adults sit or stand in one place while at work.

Mark V. Roehling, an assistant professor of management at Western Michigan University conducted a study interviewing employers on weight discrimination. Roehling said, “many employers he interviewed didn’t hide their prejudice against obese people. One bank manager told him that he would never hire a fat girl.”

There are a number of inferences about obese people being lazy and having poor personal hygiene,” said Roehling. “The discrimination attributes largely to the fact that we tend to blame overweight people for their condition.”

Typical cases of discrimination include employers suddenly shunning a promising applicant after they realize at the interview how big they are, or obese employees getting fired because they no longer “fit the corporate image,” said Roehling.

Obese people have very little legal recourse in these situations. Michigan is the only state with laws that prohibit discrimination based on physical appearance, but there are not any national laws.

Walter Lindstrom, founder and owner of the Obesity Law and Advocacy Center in San Diego, believes overweight people must defend their cases under the Americans with Disabilities Act. An individual that weighs 100 percent more than their ideal weight is eligible for protection under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Lindstrom said he was a victim of discrimination in the late 1980’s while applying for internships in his second and third years at the University of San Diego law school.

“I submitted 200 resumes in two years. I got one call back. I guess I didn’t fit the corporate firm mold,” said Lindstrom.

This experience is why Lindstrom founded the Obesity Law and Advocacy Center in San Diego in 1996. The Center helps fight for those who are denied necessary medical treatment for obesity, morbid obesity and victims of employment discrimination.

There have been some victories under the Americans with Disabilities Act’s guidelines. One landmark case in 1993 ruled in favor of Bonnie Cook, a woman who applied for a job with the Rhode Island Department of Mental Health, Retardation and Hospitals.

The U.S. Court of Appeals found that the state agency discriminated against Cook when they refused to hire her because of her morbid obesity, a condition that would have prevented her from satisfactorily doing the job.

Lindstrom said that using a disability claim has provided the best legal success. There are huge ‘ideological objections’ to using such an argument because many overweight people want to argue that they are disabled, but also say they are perfectly able to do the same work as their thinner colleagues.

Many advocacy groups are working to change the discrimination laws. “Our focus for the last couple of years has been getting obesity recognized as a disabling condition, particularly for Social Security,” says Morgan Downey, executive director of the American Obesity Association in Washington, D.C.

Mack Lee, former news anchor for Time Warner Cable News believes that overweight people are discriminated against in television. Especially when it comes to on-air positions. “I’ve been in the business for 30 years and know for a fact that heavy men are accepted more than heavy women. I don’t know why. All I know is that it’s real. I believe a candidate should be judged by their credentials for an on- air position. Looks should not be a factor.

CNN’s Candy Crowley is a seasoned journalist who has battled with her weight for years. She was promoted to host CNN’s Sunday Show in 2010 and she wonders if her weight loss was a factor in her getting the job.

Several television viewers said they don’t care if the news is delivered by a small or large person. They just want the facts.
Thelma Leathers of Raleigh is a nurse and watches the news every day. She said, “It doesn’t matter to me if a news anchor or reporter is large or small just as long as they deliver the news. Now if I don’t understand what they’re saying I’m going to change the channel. But, weight is not an issue when it comes to me being informed. There’s not a family that does not have an overweight person in it. When I was young, people asked my mother if I was sick because I was so small. I didn’t start gaining weight until my children were in high school. I’ve always weighed between 100 and 125 pounds. I’m still not carrying a lot of weight. I do believe in heredity. Everyone is not going to be small. That’s the way it is”

Pamela Jackson of Raleigh said, “It doesn’t matter to me what the person looks like delivering the news. All I care about is being informed. As long as he or she knows what they’re talking about, weight is not an issue for me.”

Many obesity researchers believe employers should not discriminate against overweight people. They believe that everyone should be treated fairly regardless of weight. Mark Roehling, assistant professor at Western Michigan University believes that weight discrimination is wrong and has other ramifications for corporate America.

“For me it raises an ethical issue, especially for companies that espouse dignity and respect for people,” notes Roehling. “How do you say, ‘We’re going to treat you differently because you’re fat’?”

2nii0k,2,2014-11-26,How The Newsroom Ends (Spoiler Alert!),klaxxon19,Thenewsroom,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thenewsroom/comments/2nii0k/how_the_newsroom_ends_spoiler_alert/,"Jim and Hallie sit in silence in a booth at Hang Chew's. On a television above them, Sloan's show is on, and she is reporting that someone has bought Continental Corp for some ridiculous sum. At the same time, a stock graph for NYSE: SIA appears showing a marked increase in share price. Jim admits he was a dick and apologizes to Hallie, but then starts to recant when he gets a push notification from his phone w/ her article -- a takedown piece on the still-a-fugitive Neal and the leaked government documents. It gets 1.6 millions page views. Hallie tells Jim thanks for everything, but she's got her prize piece and a book deal now. After taking a moment to reassure Jim that he was adequate in bed, Hallie get up and walks off. 

Jim slumps in his seat, devastated, as a mysterious stranger sitting in the booth behind him turns to him and says ""Your friend is going to be fine."" Jim asks how the stranger knows, to which he replies ""I just know. I always just know"", and gets up to leave. A beat later, and another push notification on Jim's phone. ACN reports that the source has come clean and has taken full responsibility. Jim turns around looking puzzled -- who was that mysterious man?

Cut to AWM boardroom. Just as Lucas Pruit's bid for AWM is about to go through, Calvin Trager walks into the board room to announce that Quo Vadimus has just completed a hostile takeover of Savannah Capital and is buying AWM after all, paying off the Lansing Twins for a full $1/share over what Pruitt offered. He gruffly announces that ""Anyone who can't make money off of News Night should get out of the money making business."" and then pointedly stares at the camera for about 10 seconds in silence. Blair looks bitchy and hot and says something about not caring as long as she gets hers before passionately kissing Pruit. Leona and Charlie are so elated that they initiate crazy old drunk sex on the boardroom carpet (off-camera) while Will and Mackenzie have a staring contest that may never end. Don rushes in, tripping over the old fornicators with Sloan walking right in behind him. They say that they don't care what happens to their jobs, but they need to get married right away. Randy happens to be an ordained minister (from the Internet, but who cares) and notary, so Sloan and Don have a quickie wedding followed by a high five and also begin rolling around the boardroom floor in orgiastic glee. Jim and Maggie walk into the room and look at each other, shrug their shoulders in resignation and drop to the floor as well. Rebecca Halliday just stands over all of them observing the scene, looking smoky. Newly-exonerated Neal walks into the room, tripping over Don and Sloan, and cluelessly says ""What did I miss?"" Everyone immediately stops to hug him. Will, Jim, and Don decide to carry Neal into the Newsroom, Rudy-style. 

We follow our gang through the newsroom, where everyone stands and cheers. Red news alerts are going off like crazy and Eliot is on the air trying to give a report about Mohammed Morsi, but no one gives a shit. Charlie throws Gary Cooper a key and tells him to open the bottom drawer on the right side of his desk. Gary says ""I thought that thing was broken"" when he unlocks it and finds rolls of old ticker tape.  Charlie yells from across the room ""I've been saving it for a special occasion!"" and suddenly ticker tape is flying around the newsroom. Intern Jenna drops a tray of coffee. 

Trager walks into an elevator and observes the pandemonium with a calm look on his face as the doors close. 

Trager stands on the roof of the AWM building, looking out for the Bus, which lands just in time. The hatch opens and we see a cane, followed by feet. Nick Fury walks out onto the roof and looks around, announcing ""mmm mmm! I just love it when white people have a happy ending!"" Staring out into the New York skyline, we see the nearly-finished Freedom Tower where the CSC letters are being replaced by a logo for Stark International.

2nim9o,1,2014-11-26,What are the cons of not having a LinkedIn profile?,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2nim9o/what_are_the_cons_of_not_having_a_linkedin_profile/,"Would it significantly impact someone applying for an internship? A graduating student looking for full-time work? An experienced accountant looking for exit opportunities?  

I know you can disable your public LinkedIn profile but anyone who has an account and knows your full name can see your entire profile.  At some point I think it may have been possible to choose which sections could be seen by different degrees of connections, but I can't seem to find that setting anymore.

The reason why I am hesitant to have a profile is because my sister was a victim of stalking.  Before the restraining order was filed, the stalker even went after my mother and made a scene at her job (company name and city basically tells people where you are M-F 9-5) and contacted some of her former employers based on her LinkedIn.  It was more to embarrass her than to physically harm her but still.

This was a year ago and we don't have reason to believe the stalker would do this to me now but I don't want to take any chances.  Soon I'll be starting my school's ""meet the firms"" season in hopes for a summer internship and  I don't want my family's past baggage coming back to ruin me at any point.

Will abstaining from LinkedIn hurt me in networking?  As an alternative, I was thinking of using my first and middle initial with my last name and then a picture viewable only to my connections.  Any suggestions?  Linkedin settings?

I am a bit over seven months into my job as a new hire at Amagoobooksoft. I interned here and – despite being unimpressed with my colleagues during the summer – joined to become part of a 'special projects' group being spun up with a number of industry-renowned engineers and designers; I would've been happy fetching coffee just to spend the time with them! 

That team never came to be, and I am now stuck working on a boring project and spend more time educating and helping my coworkers than they do contributing to my personal development (the entire reason I joined such a big company in the first place!).

I have been marked as a 'High Potential' employee by management, but I am deeply unhappy with the work I've completed and don't feel it's deserving of praise – we simply have extraordinarily low standards for our engineers. It's come to the point where I feel depressed just thinking about work, when I have always been someone overly committed to their job. As an intern at past companies it was not unusual for me to spend 100+ hours a week at the office pouring over source code and spending time talking with engineers across the company about the challenges they faced. Now I only work 10-3 and spend the rest of my time fooling around on TopCoder or taking MOOCs.

Is it too early to consider switching teams within the company, or perhaps leaving altogether? "

I'm currently in the process of writing a research report for my Technical Writing class (I'm a CS undergrad). The topic of my project is whether or not the university I attend does enough to prepare CS students for careers as software engineers after graduation. My interest in this topic stems from my work experience at my internship this past summer as well as my experience with my current job. 

In school, we primarily code in C/C++ and Java. For coding projects, we generally write simple projects that typically run from the command line and usually solve a single problem. As you can imagine, I was in for a bit of a rude awakening this summer when I had my first ever job in software engineering, developing web applications for a financial services company using Microsoft .NET. This type of programming proved to be very different and I spent most of my internship just learning how all these technologies worked (Visual Studio, the .NET framework, SQL Server, Mercurial, etc.). 

Now, I divided my project into five tasks: research tools and protocol used in a commercial setting, collect information from students, ask professors for their opinions, research the pros and cons of specific tools, and prepare the recommendation. Now, I've done 2-3 and have started on 5, which is when it dawned on me that I never really did 1 and 4. 

After thinking about it for a little, I decided perhaps the best way to go about this research would just be to ask people on a popular social networking site with an active Computer Science community, i.e reddit (and perhaps stack overflow as well, depending on how many responses this gets). 

To do this, I put together a short [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/SN2S8QN) that I'd be really grateful if you filled out. If you have anything else to add or hate surveys for some reason, feel free to comment, they will get read. Thanks in advance to everyone who helps me out here, it is very much appreciated!

2njku4,22,2014-11-26,My Abortion Experience,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2njku4/my_abortion_experience/,"Please note before you read this that I am Pro-Choice. You may not agree with me or my opinions but that is ok. I respect that people may have a different view than I do and I respect that you are entitled to your own opinion. I am sharing this for any women out there who are afraid or nervous or who may have questions. Please be respectful.
I want to start out by saying that I live in BC, Canada. For those who don't know, in Canada we have universal healthcare and abortion is completely legal. Abortions are covered by our healthcare and do not cost a dime.
I am 20 years old. The man who got me pregnant (it takes two to tango) is my boyfriend of over three years and he is 23 years old. I missed a period and took a home pregnancy test which came back positive. I was completely devastated and, after confirmation with a doctor, spoke to my boyfriend about our options. After dating for 3 years, and having a couple pregnancy scares, we had already discussed what route we would go should I ever get pregnant (not that we didnt take precautions and do everything to avoid this situation). We are too young to raise a child and are not financially stable. I am in the middle of my university degree and having a child at this point in my life wouldn't be ideal. So I was given a referral to the closest abortion clinic two hours away and they called me and we made an appointment. In BC, there are few clinics so I had to wait three GRUELLING weeks before I could get in.
I had an ultrasound the day before my appointment at the clinic and was told I was 8 weeks and 5 days pregnant.
My boyfriend was amazing during this whole process. He deserves the boyfriend of the year award or something because I am such a lucky lady. He reassured me and kept me calm and listened to me cry and did anything I needed. I am so appreciative to have him as my partner.
We drove to the clinic the morning of my appointment. There were actually Pro Life protesters outside the hospital when we were parking. That really freaked me out and upset me, but, thankfully, in British Columbia we have a law that prevents protestors from being outside the clinic. We were far away from their judgement in a completely different building at the hospital. The actual clinic in the hospital has some security you have to go through before you go in so that was reassuring as well.
Once in the clinic I was taken into a room with a counsellor who asked me questions about my personal and family health history (diabetes, heart disease, medication, etc) and then we went over birth control options. I was on contraceptive pills when I got pregnant so I wanted to maybe try a new method. I ended up choosing the Mirena IUD. Thankfully again, my Blue Cross extended medical picked up most of the bill so my boyfriend only paid about $100 for the Mirena.
He then joined me and the counsellor took us into the recovery/prep room where there were 6 or so beds with other women pre-op or post-op. I got changed into the skirt/robe you wear for the procedure and hooked up to an IV. I was given some pills to help me relax and help with the pain that would come after.
They then took me into the procedure room where I met the doctor who would be preforming the abortion and the intern who was going to observe/learn. The counsellor got my boyfriend and he was actually allowed to sit facing me and hold my hand the whole time. I was given Fentanyl in my IV which reaaaalllyyy helped me relax. The counsellor/nurse sat on my other side and I was set up in the stirrups. Now.. I'm not a doctor and I'm not really sure of the entire procedure that I had, but this is what was done as far as I'm aware. My abortion was called ""Abortion by Dilation, Suction, and Curettage"". The doctor inserted the speculum, froze my cervix, and preformed the abortion. This was pretty uncomfortable but it was moderate/tolerable pain and I knew it was only temporary. She then inserted the Mirena afterwards which was good because my cervix was already frozen. No discomfort there. I was then taken back into the first room to recover.
The nurses and counsellors were so so so kind to me. Everyone answered any questions I had and I was given so much information. There is a lot to remember so they gave me printed off lists of what to know and what to avoid. I was so anxious and nervous and scared and they made me feel completely at ease. For something that isn't so great they made it the best experience for me it could have been. At no point did I ever feel judged for my decision whatsoever. I am so grateful for all of the employees who helped me that day. I think that they all deserve a medal for kindness and caring.
It has been one week since my abortion and I am experiencing mild/tolerable cramping and bleeding. It shouldn't last much longer. Midol has been a big help to manage some of the discomfort.
If you are an employee at a clinic I just want to say THANK YOU!! You all are wonderful human beings and it's not an easy job to do. I appreciate everything that you do and don't think that your kindness goes unnoticed. I am trying to think of a way to give special thanks to the nurses and counsellors who helped me through my scary day."

She does not trust me. 


There are two major issues that came up why she doesn't trust me. 



One: Money and Impulse Buys.

We make about $43,000 a year combined. Although, she has to quit her job for an internship to finish her degree next year. 


I've always had an issue with impulse buys and using my credit cards. Over the past 4 years of living together I've racked up and paid off about $12,000-$15,000 of impulse buys, buying equipment for work, and purchasing lots of books. 


Everything the bill would come due I'd promise that it would be the last time and things would get better. The first time it was $4000 (half of it was reimbursable from work), the second time it was $3000 (3/4 reimbursable from work), the 3rd-5th time it got less and less and less. 


Secondly, following through when I say that i am going to do something.


I work about 60-75 hours a week at my salaried non-profit job. Most days when I get home at 8 or 9pm I'm not really in the mood for anything more than to get horizontal with a good book or the television. She'll ask me to do something like change the laundry, scoop the cat poop, or get something fixed tomorrow and I'll forget or I'll fall asleep. Or she text me during the middle of the day and I won't remember to put it on my calendar. And, once again I will forget to do something I promised to do. With my job getting busier things at home keep slipping. 


All of this (especially the money part) has led my wife to on several occasions to say she doesn't trust me. We've agreed to go to marriage counseling. 


I know for this I don't have any legs to stand on and my wife has every right to be mad at me. 


I've already cut up my credit cards and I am going to pay off the remaining $2500 outstanding I have floating. What can I do to fix this?

2njo0b,4,2014-11-26,I [23f] am severely depressed and don't think my illness is fair to my boyfriend [25m].,confusednsad123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2njo0b/i_23f_am_severely_depressed_and_dont_think_my/,"My boyfriend doesn't have a perfect life but he is doing well. He has a great paying job to cover his own expenses, and has life ambitions. He has finished university.

Me, I am in university. I am doing an internship right now that has been abysmal. My mental health has been a trainwreck. I am severely depressed. I have realized, working 9-5, that this is NOOOOOOOOOT for me. This lifestyle is not for me. These jobs are not for me. I am soooo soooo soooooo unhappy with how I am living. I have an office admin internship right now and I absolutely despise it. My degree (a business degree) is really not equipped for other types of work.

My boyfriend wants

a) kids

b) to travel

c) to buy our own home.

I do not think I can provide him these things. In my future, I see under or un-employment. I think at best, I will work part time in a position. My depression probably isn't the only reason I am hating work. It's NOT for my personality. He wants us to have enough money to afford a home, kids, travel......


And I can tell you that I probably will never earn enough money to have these things. His salary can't support both of us + kids, and I DO NOT expect him to pay my way thru life.

I am very sad. I think he deserves better. someone he can have these things with.

We've been together 6 years. I love him to death. He loves me. But I am so depressed (and out of options; tried therapy...failed. Tried therapy AGAIN...failed. Tried meds. Not really helping. Do not have enough money for specialist psychologists or anything else). 

I think he is better off without me.

What should I do? Set him free so he can pursue this life he wants?

**tl;dr**: I am depressed. I am very unwell, and have been unwell for 10+ years. My partner wants a great life and i do not think I will EVER be in the financial shape to help him achieve this goal."
2nk1u0,2,2014-11-27,Me [27 M] with my GF [27 F] of 4 years. She shows no physical affection. What should I do?,Birdseyeview04,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2nk1u0/me_27_m_with_my_gf_27_f_of_4_years_she_shows_no/,"Ok, so this is a little complicated and I really would love advise on what I should do. I met my now GF back in 2011. We dated for about a year and a half before our first breakup. We are both from florida. I landed my 2nd internship with N.A.S.A and had to move to Washington DC for 5 months away from her. One night i got a drunk call from her, where she expressed that she was flirting with the DJ at some club, and got free drinks from him all night, but nothing physical happened she claimed. Having a lot of things already built up leading to that night, I acted quick on emotions and ended it with her. 3 weeks before her visit to D.C. to see me. 

In our entire relationship we never had sex, not even 2nd base. She wanted to remain celibate until marriage, and being the nice guy i never pressured her to do more than kissing. 

When she came to D.C to visit me, she expressed her desire to experiment and be with women, and in an attempt to hurt me for breaking her heart, she flirted with women in front of me the whole trip. Although I felt she messed up and was the reason for our break up, I still had intentions of moving past her drunk call and moving forward. I got us tickets to the White House, a private tour at NASA HQ, and VIP tickets to see and meet our favorite music artist during her visit.

After three days of dealing with her blatant attempts of trying to hurt me, i told her we couldn't even be friends, and that I wished her well. This was in 2013, spring. I was a year before we had any form of communication again.

Fast forward to 2014 now, she is back in my life. Says she wants a husband, and kids one day, and wants that guy to be me. Since our break up, I've completed school, my internships with NASA, and have started my own business. She still works as a cashier at a department store and hasn't finished her A.A yet. (Not judging)

While we weren't together, she has dated 3 women one after the other. And she admitted to being sexually active with all three of them. So obviously celibacy was thrown out of the window since we've been apart.
There has been a few times that I have invited her over, we laid of the sofa watched movies, and basically just cuddled. No physical activity at all.

Because of sexual limits she put on me the first time we dated, i never initiate anything because i never want to offend her or force myself on her. Its like walking on egg shells. One night she fell asleep on my sofa, and I invited her to come upstairs and sleep next to me. She declined. I covered her up with a blanket and went upstairs to my bed after that. 

A few hours later round 4:00am, she woke up and came into my bedroom, placing her back to me in a spooning position. I wrapped my arms around her, and held her close, and leaned in for kiss. After two pecks on the lips she turned her head away and said ""I have morning breathe, i don't want to kiss you right now"". A few days later she admitted she did that because she thought i would have wanted sex, and she wants us to start slow since we just started dating again.

Normally this wouldn't be a selfish request, most women with self respect won't jump right into sex. However, the only thing I keep thinking of is, within one year you had 3 partners sexually. We have been in each others lives going on 4 years and never moved past kissing. I guess I kind of feel like she isn't sexually attracted to men. I honestly feel like I'm a sense of security to her and so does a few of my friends. She wants to marry a guy and have a family one day, and know that it would take a guy to do it biologically. But Physically she wants no part. 

It's hard to let her go because of our history, and in a way I almost feel we were meant of each other. Another part of me feels I'm holding on because I don't think I can do better. (Guys have insecurities too) 

What should I do?

I changed my major during my sophomore year so I am a bit behind in some of my CS classes. I figured I needed to get experience so I'm looking at internships for summer 2015 right now but I didn't have a lot to put on my resume to begin with. 
My mother works at a software company in the Bay Area, and I asked her about their internship opportunities, hoping I could apply, but she ended up just talking to the hiring manager directly (without telling me until after the fact).

In short, I was told to send my resume and a cover letter to my mom who sent it to the hiring manager. Suddenly, I have a 30 minute phone interview in the near future for a position that I feel like was just randomly picked for me. I've never applied to an internship before so I'm not sure if a 30 minute phone call is standard for screening interns. After looking at the information about the internship online, I feel like I am completely under-qualified for the position - it requires working knowledge of UML and understanding of iterative development methodologies - things that I haven't even begun to touch yet. 

So, now I'm feeling like I was purposely given this to be rejected. Am I just being paranoid? Because it makes more sense when I think about because I really am under-qualified for this and feel like I only got a phone interview because of nepotism but didn't want to reject me outright which is why I wanted to apply to one of her company's internships without her involvement

2nkvd5,36,2014-11-27,[NeedAdvice] Fear is ruining my life,pourquoifaire,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/2nkvd5/needadvice_fear_is_ruining_my_life/,"Hi trainees,

I'm a a french guy, so excuse my english. Some context :

#context

I was born in France, but both of my parents are korean. After a few years, my parents and I returned to Korea. I don't have numerous memories from my childhood (like it was deleted) but for those I can remember I cannot say that it was a wonderfull one. It's more or less chaotic. One day, my mother disappeared : she had left, abandonning us (I had a brother in between). This event traumatized all of us, which eventually lead my father to return to France, taking us.

I didn't speak any words of french, then, but I learned fast (I had to !). My father was severe, and educated me with biographies of great men and litterature. Yet he was quite absent. At the beginning of my teenagehood, I rebelled against the unbearable authority of a man who didn't know how to deal with us. The years that followed were quite terrible. Depression, anxiety. I tried to kill myself several times. I hated my father, my mother, everything. 

I eventually managed to get myself out of it. But such a past cannot be forgotten fast. It took several years to heal. I still do. But by the meantime, I had to get away from my father and lived almost alone since the age of 16. Well, almost.

I must admit that I survived because of the tremendous help that I was given. The first years, my ex-girfriend helped me a lot. The second, I lived at a friends place. The third, I lived between the internship and friends places at week-ends and holidays. The fourth, I had my own place for one years. And now, I have no place and live at my girlfriend (small) place.

# the problem

I must say that I feel far better than the first years. I'm no longer depressed, not even anxious. I've been through a lot of things, and am definitively proud of what I am. Now, I have a phobia that ruins everything... I fear of administration.

Let me explain. Let me give an example : In France, the State helps people like me a lot, especially if we are students. We get scolarships, low-price rent for living. There is no such thing as a student loan here. Don't judge. I woudn't have survived without. The problem is, that to get these help, we must complete papers and I FEAR IT. You just don't imagine how ridiculous it can get. This year : I could have my scolarship, I could have a place to be, etc. Instead, I have no money, I struggle to eat everyday, and I'm at my girlfriend's place and it's not doing well for our relationship (even we are together since 2 years). Just because I didn't complete the fucking paper. Or something else. It could be calling my bank. To post an important file, and I could continue for hours. And since I procrastinate to avoid all of this, it's getting bigger and bigger, ridiculously bigger. 
This is ridiculous. This is sick. I'm tired of it. This gets me crazy. 

This is crazy, because, potentially, I don't have to live all of this at all. My scolarship, given my situation is almost guarantied. I have social workers to help me (but since I fear of this, sometimes I don't go, or I don't have the files they needed to help, so I feel guilty and I don't go, so I'm even more in the deep shit so I feel even more guilty...). My inscription at my second year of College is still not finished (we had began our scholar year at september)... This is driving me crazy because I'm not even sure that I understand myself here... I'm very confused. Today, I was in front of my cellphone because I had to call for important business (there was a mistake in my tax notice that entrave helps). I didn't. I was afraid. I felt guilty because this mistake is because I sent my declaration of taxes to late. I didn't know how to explain. What to say. I gave myself thousand excuses. 

Now, you know that you can't live in this society, especially in France, without filling any files. You have to. But, since I have the phobia of this very task, this is ruining my life, and also the life of people helping me...

I tried several things :

* I tried to concatenate bigs tasks into small ones. I didn't make it.
* I tried to meditate (a lot) to reduice my anxiety level (it worked, but since I'm not doing what I have to do anyway...)
* I tried to control aspects of my life influencing discipline and motivation (diet, sleep, etc)
* I tried to brute force, and go without thinking too much.
* I tried nonzerodays, thexeffect, etc.
* I tried PeachH method

Now, I have made some progress, but this is too slow. I must radically change my attitude, and I think that what I'm really afraid of is to grow up... That somehow deep inside me, I found that my childhood was unfair so I don't want to grow up either. I don't know what it might be. But I have to change, I have to do that. I want to grow up. I want to fight the part of me that still wants to die, wants to be weak, wants living from others help. I don't want this anymore.

So please, I need advice here. Please help me accomplish what I want to do.

TL;DR : I had a traumatic childhood and teenagehood. I thus have a phobia concerning filling paper, for example. I try to get rid of it, but this is getting my life very complicated. I think this the fear of growing up. What do you suggest ?"

I'm tired of failing.,fffoliveira,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/2nl5di/needadvice_im_almost_failing_every_class_of_2014/,"(I do not know if this is the best subreddit to post this, if there are any better please let me know.)

Hello r/getdisciplined

This is my first post in 7 months of reddit. Sorry for lurking, and for my english, but I really need help.

Well, I decided to write this post because I felt defeated today. I will explain:

In the four past days,  I was studying hard for a exam (E2), I did summaries, exercises and although i still have not had a feeling of ""hey, I can get a 8 on this exam"", I was confident. Well, a few hours ago I could not take the exam (E2) because I ended up too late due to traffic. I felt like shit because I studied really hard and just could not take the test because I do not left home earlier. Next Tuesday I will have another exam (E3) which will cover more topics, so it is possible that can be harder. Now I have a chance of failing in this course because I just don't get out of home earlier to make E2.

In elementary school I was a reasonable student, I did not really know how life was difficult. In high school I started giving more value to what I was learning and as consequence I ended up reaching the top of my disciplinarity. Unfortunately at the university, I never managed to establish myself as an average student since I could never get a higher score than 6 in a exam.

Theoretically I am in the third year of Computer Science in a great college in Brazil. But in the practice I'm at the first year/second :( .

I really do not know what's wrong with me. I'm tired of failing the classes of the course.  I'm tired of seeing my friends move forward on the course and I do not. I'm tired of being a mediocre student. I don't want to lie more about ""how much time"" to finish college. Don't wanna be a possible embarrassment to my parents.

//

On the other hand, my life is very ""ok"". I have a healthy relationship with my girlfriend for three years. My family loves me. I'm not a shy person. I'm intern of a relatively large company in my area (CS) with a good salary. The only real problem is the mess that is my academic life.

I am not dependent on Facebook. I use a chrome extension that disables the timeline and the only reason I have facebook,  is to use for college groups. I am not addicted to video games, although I think I'm addicted to porn.

//

I see so many people in poor academic situations here on reddit and I see that some of them were able to turn the tables with support from this community. I would really appreciate some feedback over my situation and if possible some strategy / tip for me to try in the next semester.


**[TLDR;]**

I have a healthy relationship with my girlfriend, a comprehensive family and who loves me, I am sociable and I'm intern in a company that is important in my area(CS).  I was a good student in high school but never took over 6, on a exam, after I entered college.  I am on the third year of ComputerScience in theory, but in practice I am at the first/second year.  I know all conceivable methods to have motivation / learn to study, but no matter how much I study it seems that I can not do well on tests. Practically 2014 for me was '' lost '' academically, seems that I won't pass on any class that I attended this year. I wonder if I'm   hopeless case... "

I've been struggling with a mixture of panic attacks, ptsd, depression and anxiety for most of my life and I've recovered somewhat, but it's come back since August. I started a new temporary job and it's now about to end. I've been rejected for a few internships I was looking forward to and everyone was expecting me to get into, no job applications have led anywhere. Sounds like the typical postgrad experience, right? Then why am I so hopeless? I don't want to feel this way, but I do, and I feel hopeless to dig myself out of it.

I have regular nightmares about car accidents (unrelated, I've never been in a serious one) and my work performance is slipping. I'm constantly on the verge of crying and I know if I just felt a little happier things would be easier. But I don't have any idea how to go about doing that. I've tried relaxation techniques, changing my thinking, but I'm still in this horrible low that I can't dig myself out of. What do I do now?

I get regular exercise every day, I sleep all right, and I take antidepressants that I've been on for the past fiveish years. I'm just lost for further solutions and it's getting more hopeless every day. Honestly while I'm not suicidal now, I can picture myself just letting go and killing myself at 40 if things keep going like this."

2nlijm,10,2014-11-27,Will it ever end? A pretty long post (sorry).,ElephantTrainWoo,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2nlijm/will_it_ever_end_a_pretty_long_post_sorry/,"Hi everyone. I've been feeling pretty shit (once again...) for the past few weeks and just stumbled on this sub, figured I'd post my story. Sorry for the insanely long read. Preface: Currently 24 year old male with ADHD diagnosis. Am 6'4"" and ~145 lbs (1.90 and 65 kg) and have a bunch of physical problems resulting in chronic pain. Not sure if this is the right sub for this story, but fuck it. This is the first time I've shared my feelings with anyone in a looooong time.

I guess my story starts roughly 8-9 years ago, roughly around the time I was 15 or 16. At this point in time I was still in high school, in a bilingual class, highest level of education possible. Ever since I was a small child people (parents, teachers, family etc.) have been expecting me to do great things in life. As a kid with above average intelligence it was expected of me that I'd do as good as possible and go on to university etc etc. Not that my parents were pushy in any way, it's just that it seemed so obvious to everyone that I'd succeed. After my third year of slacking off I got demoted to a lower level of high school education (weird Dutch school systeem, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_Netherlands), as my grades just weren't good enough. Even at this point in time I didn't feel like actually doing anything in order to achieve something. The feeling of accomplishment is not one that I’ve ever strived for or wanted to strive for.

As I went on with the remainder of my high school years I got introduced to new friends, had new experiences and at the age of 17 I tried weed for the first time. Never in my life had I felt something that cleared my mind up as efficiently as that particular drug. Soon after I started lightning up more and more frequently, at first with friends and later by meself. When I hit the legal age to buy marihuana in my country the situation started to spiral out of control. 
I had finished high school, and went on to try and get a HBO (second level of higher education) degree in chemical engineering. Three months after I started with my study my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, it wasn’t particularly big or threatening, but in retrospect it did have a severe impact on my mental state. I’d never been one with a ton of friends, but I can’t say I’ve always been the stereotypical stay in doors type of gamer. I decided that my study wasn’t for me and somehow spend the next six months staying inside, playing upto 18 hours of World of Warcraft a day and smoking weed. Lots and lots of weed. It’s hard to say what came first, gaming or depression, but they sure as hell had a great effect on eachother.
In the outside world I’d never been THAT awesome with people, even though I had friends I was pretty introverted and massively insecure. I had one really good friend and a bunch of people who I’d now consider extra’s in my life. In this phase I started neglecting everyone, I just wasn’t interested in going outside anymore at all, had no motivation to get a job or to study. When I saw sunlight it was only because I went to the shop to get weed.

After 6 months or so I started feeling a little better and with some stimulation from my mother I picked up a new study (social work). As of today I’m still working on it, almost 6 years later. The first year was great, I had awesome classmates and for the first time in my life I felt what it was like to have a truly great group of friends. Somewhere near the end of the year I tried to ask out a girl for the first time in my life (and succeeded) which unluckily ended in nothing. This left me pretty frustrated and had me spiralling back into feeling utter shit about myself. That summer I committed the worst sin I could’ve possibly committed which (if you’re still with me later) had serious consequences for me later in life.

At the end of the summer break my best friends girlfriend cheated on him with me. They were at the end of their relationship and somehow we ended up together. This ended a 10+ year friendship, in retrospect I don’t know what I was thinking. At that point I was feeling so lonely and depressed that any type of attention was alright.  You see my lovelife had never been great, mostly a bunch of friendzoning (due to my own fault) and me not being secure enough to actually do anything.

This act is where things really go from utter shit to absolutele utter horseshit. Six months or so after the deed had been done my girlfriend went in to her first (suicidal) depression. She had already been pretty clingy/low self esteem before that, and it didn’t get any better during her depression. Her parents (divorced ~10 years ago) weren’t up to the task and taking care of it fell into my lap. For the next 1.5 years I was the one she spend nearly every single day with, the one she called whenever she was threatening to commit suicide, the one that found her with cuts in her wrists etc. etc..
You’d think that would be the worst of it, I know I sure did. I’ve never felt the need to victimize myself in any way, but today I just might, so fuck it. It got so much worse than anything I’d ever expected. After  battling with my girlfriends depression (and my own depression) things were going pretty alright. She was doing fine for a while. That’s when the convulsions and temporary paralysis started. Turns out that while she was still dealing with the remainder of depression she developed a conversion disorder. Again everything fell to me. At this point in time I had virtually no friends left, people kind of stop inviting you when you never show up. This is also the year I started my internship, a combination of that + having a serious panic attack which left me lying in bed for an hour + I decided to stop smoking weed. 

At first everything was great, it’s not like it stimulated me to actually do anything in life, even though I was studying I still had no goals. I fucked up my schoolwork but my internship was going great. After a while my girlfriend started doing better and we decided to go on a holiday together. A week after we came back my girlfriend was hospitalized for psychosis for the first time. Again the majority of dealings with her ilnesses fell to me, as her parents still weren’t up to the task. This is when I mentally collapsed. Even with only two months left of my internship, which up to that point had been going great (got a 20/21 point mid-eval) I just couldnt cope anymore. At 23 years of age I experienced a burn out for the first time. Everything had been so awesome and I went right back into burnout/depression. For an entire year I did absolutely nothing but play games all day err day. 

Somewhere at this point my girlfriend moved in with me and my parents, after getting kicked out by both of her parents. This put a severe strain on our relationship. Two people doing absolutely nothing in life seeing eachother everyday is not a very recommendable situation. During this period my girlfriend kept getting worse then better, repeat. We’re still together at this point (4.5 years now) and I just can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. Over the past 4 years I’ve seen the inside of an emergeny room 4 times, she has been hospitalized in a closed enviroment 10+ times, multiple times against her will. I’ve had her threaten to kill me with a knife, I’ve there for her at every turn whenever needed. And all this time I neglected myself. 

When I restarted doing my study after one year of being burned out I decided I wanted to finish my study abroad. I decided before I had even started again, with my mind all made up how next school year was going to be great and I’d finally be finished with a study that I don’t enjoy whatsoever in a carreer path I don’t see myself taking. Faith decided otherwise. Two months before starting again my father got diagnosed with a malignant tumor of 7 centimers in his intestine. Thankfully he survived, but once again I had to a whole bunch of worrying and caring at home.

Because of this my plans got delayed, however at the start of this schoolyear I finally went on to do what I wanted. I’ve now been in India for 3 months and so far things have been pretty good. Atleast up untill the point I realised I don’t miss home whatsoever, which set me right back on a path of mental self destruction. Even though I should be feeling great, I don’t. 

Over the past years I’ve improved so much, in so many ways. When I tell people now that I used to be introverted they look at me like I’m crazy, I’m usually one of the most extraverted people they know. I know I’m capable of lots of things, it just doesn’t feel that way. Ever. I thought that feeling I had when I was 18 and didn’t know what I wanted to do with life would go away. It didn’t. I act like I’ve got self esteem , people generally like me yet I’m always insecure. I thought growing up would fix theses issues, but I guess I haven’t grown up one inch. On the inside I still feel like a 16-20 year old kicking and screaming angrily against the world. 3 Months along the line and I’m not any further with my goals that I wanted to achieve. I just don’t feel like I want to do anything at all.

This time here on my own (with some other people from school) has made me realise one thing. I’m not happy at all, ever, in the situation I’m currently in. People tell me they think I’m cynical, little do they know that I’m actually just super depressed about life. I somehow can’t explain to anyone why I feel life is pretty useless and in the end we all die alone, I can’t explain to them how I have no goals in life and don’t feel the need to achieve whatsoever. Noone ever seems to understand. I feel so unbelievably fucking alone and the only thing that keeps all my worrying away is drinking and smoking weed. 
Because of my nature I’m always there for others. Others have offered to do the same for me. I don’t feel like they truly understand the floodgate of shitty emotions that will pour down on them if I’d ever share anything. Cliffnotes: I dislike myself, who I am and how I act. I’m constantly burdened by everything I perceive as my own wrongdoing and will mentally replay these scenes in my head to the point of insanity. I don’t love my girlfriend anymore, but because she lives in with me I don’t see how I’m ever supposed to end my relationship. I don’t want to achieve, I don’t want to accomplish, I just want to be left alone and do whatever the hell I want to do. In short, I hate my fucking life and I don’t know what I can do to fix this. I feel like I have no purpose. 

Thanks for reading this if you bothered to finish it. This is pretty much a TL;DR of the past 8 years of my life.

2nliw6,5,2014-11-27,"I'm afraid to post this, but I need to be honest with someone.",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2nliw6/im_afraid_to_post_this_but_i_need_to_be_honest/,"I need to get this off my chest, and since I'm not even close to being comfortable talking to friends or family about my emotions or issues, this is the closest I can get to being honest with anyone.

I'm slowly destroying myself, and I can't seem to stop.

I lost my job about mid-August, well, I didn't so much lose my job as my (thankfully paid) internship ended. Since then I've been a complete mess, self-destructive, reclusive, and lazy. I've been on and off depressed since I was 10, and I'm 21 now, and this is the lowest I've ever been. I don't have a job, and although I feel like a complete failure every single day, I can't seem to will myself to find a job in my field of study (I graduated once the internship was over). My day currently consists of waking up whenever, and browsing Reddit/4chan for a while, then going back to bed, masturbating, or doing various drugs. I'll sometimes get semi-motivated and attempt to do something productive, but I'll end up procrastinating and waste time until I feel awful about myself, then I'll get anxious, depressed, and unable to function for the rest of the day, usually resulting in me smoking some pot so I can stop thinking so much. I've lost interest in all of my hobbies, including the hobby that I turned into what was/is going to become my career. I'm becoming reclusive, it gets harder and harder for me to leave the house every day, and I'm afraid I'll run into a situation which destabilizes me. I've been having suicidal thoughts lately, but I haven't acted on it other than getting as far as writing a few notes.

I find myself unable to open up to anyone about this. I'll consider it, then be awake all night trying to figure out how to tell someone, then figure that it's for the best if I don't burden anyone with my problems, so I tell them I'm fine. The rare few times I have let on with some of my friends that something was seriously wrong with me have been as a result of drinking too much, or being on some drug, and telling them usually involves me breaking down in front of them, drunk, and after I freak out I just go home. The next day I wake up, regretting everything, with a hell of a hangover to boot, and I apologize to my friend for freaking out, and try to pretend it didn't happen. I'm sure my friends are actually worried about me, but I can't discuss my emotions without becoming a shaking, sobbing mess so I just tell people I'm fine and try to avoid it. My breakdowns are becoming worse, and I'm becoming more and more alienated from my friends. 

I took some psychedelic mushrooms a month ago (which was obviously a bad decision given my mental state), and had the worst breakdown I've ever had. I ran out of my friend's (A) house, and wandered around, nearly getting hit by a few cars. I managed to call a different friend (B), crying, and seriously freaking out. I managed to find my way back to my A's house where B met up and helped me calm down. The issue is, I don't fully remember what I said to B, but he must have thought it was sexual in nature, since I'm fairly sure he was coming on to me. I'm not 100% sure of this either, since I was still peaking on a large dose of mushrooms as this was all happening. The next day I apologized to everyone involved for freaking out on them, and I haven't spoken to B since. I'm afraid to bring this up with him, since I'm not sure I want to find out the answer. Oddly enough, I still took mushrooms again the following week.

I'm running out of money left over from my previous job, and Christmas is coming up. Christmas is usually a depressing time for me, even when I'm doing well, since my birthday and New Years all surround it, leading to painful introspection and self-hate. Last New Years, after a particularly bad bout of depression, I made a promise with myself to feel better and happier by New Years this year. I haven't made good on that promise, and it looks less and less likely that I will each day. I'm not sure how I'll make it through the holidays, and my family is also worried about me, I still live at home, and I still don't have a job. The longer I spend fighting this and failing, the harder it will be for me to pick up the pieces. I feel like more and more of a failure every day. If I don't end this vicious cycle soon, I'm not sure I'll see 2015.

I'm not sure if anyone can offer advice for me, since I recognize my problems, and I have an inkling about what to do to solve them. I just feel crippled by my depression so I struggle everyday just to force myself out of bed(apologies if this comes off as overly whiny, but it's the truth). Thank you for reading this if you got this far, it feels good to at least be honest with someone, even if that person doesn't know me."

2nlqrl,1,2014-11-27,I know what I want to do with my life; what major do I pick to get there?,recycledstardust,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2nlqrl/i_know_what_i_want_to_do_with_my_life_what_major/,"I'm 16 years old, a senior in high school, and applying to colleges right now.

My whole life, I was sure I wanted to psychology or theatre, which are both very difficult fields to make money in. I knew that I didn't want to go into any serious ""hard sciences"" or math, but I didn't want to get too artsy, either. 


Through research, I found a field called ""Expressive arts therapy"" and that sounds like the most interesting thing ever. I never heard of it before this year, I'd only heard of ""clinical psychologist"" and ""social worker"" and all that. Of course, I think I would be happy working any job that had to do with psychology or theatre (I've been an actor before, I've written plays and had them produced, I've directed plays, and been backstage. I love all of those things equally). But expressive arts therapy seems like a really specifically interesting goal.


I also have finances in mind, so I looked for ways to make more money in expressive arts therapy. The baby boomer generation is getting older and the job growth in the gerontology field is apparently going to skyrocket. I want to get in on this, so I thought ""What if I got a job directing theatre with the elderly in rest homes?""


This sounds super niche and there's always the chance that I'll change my path completely (although the thought of that scares me a bit). Still, I want a job where:

1. I can incorporate lots of creativity and problem solving skills into social situations, because that's what I'm good at.

2. I can experience and help others experience the transformative properties of theatre.

3. I can provide some sort of comfort to people and make their days easier to live (especially if they're in a retirement home and they feel bored or condescended). I want to improve quality of life.

4. I want to work with people who are ""misunderstood"". This is where the selfishness definitely comes in...I'm a female, half-black, LGBT teenager with mental health issues. I've definitely been misunderstood and stigmatized. It makes me want to understand others who seek to be understood, but are often pushed aside (those on the autism spectrum, those with certain mental health challenges, the elderly, young children, immigrants, etc). I find it so enriching for me personally to work with those who are also stereotyped by society because I feel it's a common thread that can bring people together. 


So when applying to colleges, they ask my potential major, and I just don't know what to say. I've already applied to some colleges, under the psychology major (which is SO stupid in hindsight because that's so impacted in every school). I was thinking I could just minor in theatre. I feel like I have a few options but I don't know which is best:

1. Psychology with theatre minor. This is the broadest and I could do it at any school I go to because most schools have a psychology department and a theatre department.

2. Gerontology with theatre minor. This seems like a great option, but I'm scared I'll decide I don't want to work with the older population after all, and I won't ever be able to back out. Also, not many schools I'm applying to offer this.

3. Theatre with psychology minor. This seems like a ridiculous path, but within theatre I could possibly delve more into playwriting, directing, stage management, or theatre education of some sort. This seems unstable to me but it's an option.

4. Expressive arts therapy major. I think this is great and specific, but only one school I'm applying to has this major for undergrads (Lesley University, in Massachusetts). 

5. Social work with theatre minor. I'm not sure about this one because I haven't really researched what it really entails. 



How do I even BEGIN to decide or know which path will lead me to where I want to be? Should I just trust that, because I have a goal in mind, I'll get there somehow through internships and jobs I take? Advice is very appreciated!

2nlquy,0,2014-11-27,Sky kitten (SMA leader) post about Ivory Kantenu,Qwaszert,Eve,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2nlquy/sky_kitten_sma_leader_post_about_ivory_kantenu/,"1. Ivory has been a member of SMA combat for about 18 months. The day i brought ivory into combat as jr cap FC he was a member who sought out more responsibility and in particular with capitals. Ivory recognized a hole with it and set to work immediately to try to fix and organize it into the department we see today. SMA capitals were in a major flux and i personally credit ivory with every success capitals have had since then.

2. Ivory has been a member of the CFC group since before ive know about him. However his role in SMA capitals and thus CFC cap fleets was because i placed him there and with the right people when it was needed. I dont say this to big note i say this because it paints a very clear picture on my personal thoughts with Ivory, and my complete trust and faith in the guy.

3. Over the last 18 months i have watched ivory grow as a eve player and a member of this community from a line member to a person who i was proud to prmote to head of the capitals within the skyteam. Every single promotion ivory was given he earnt with blood sweat and tears missing countless hours of RL time with his wife to offer us nerds some content. To me this suggests that Ivory was never a spy but towards the end slightly misguided.

4. When ever a person is promoted within any department i have purview over they are issued with a blanket notice. ""if i consider you to be a risk in anyway shape or form to this alliance and community i will purge you off the face of the earth."" Ivory was purged because he was a risk.

5. I was standing on the parade ground at work with 104 new navy recruits when i got pinged to fuck and my phone started to ring with skype from CFC leadership. They painted a picture i jumped on the laptop and started to check it. At the same time i was abusing thor and saying im not going thorugh this bullshit with CFC declaring sum1 in our organisation to be a spy again without proof. I sent forth our own BL agents to confirm what was going on and continued to fact check the information i was provided by GIA and other members of CFC leadership.

6. River and i chatted and we authorized the purge of ivorys titan. Knowing full well it still wasnt paid off but also knowing that with the information we had received we couldnt allow the titan to be removed from SMA into BL. Mcloven then demanded to know more as he wasnt happy to purge ivory based on just what we had then knowing full well the ramifications for all of this as other members of leadership had suffered the goon ban hammer before.

7. It was at this time i ended up in a phone call with Mittani, River, Thor, Mcloven and the evidence was laid out in front of me. I still protested to mittens about how i didnt believe ivory had turned cloaks or switched sides. Demanding more proof. It was about this stage that our own agent (separate to the ones who had already confirmed the information) reported back to me again that what we had received was true. I then dug further into our own IT services and thats when we found the nail that closed the lid on Ivorys Coffin. there are 2 things i need you all to take from this.

a. The Mittani does not run SMA. River does with the directorate of SMA. THis means that we do not kick purge or remove people from the alliance because goons tell us too.

b. At no stage did the Mittani or any1 else from goon leadership demand that Ivory be kicked from SMA. This was ordered by myself with the rest of directorate agreeing.

8. Ivory was stripped of all acess and offered a chance to explain himself. To his credit he didn't jump up and say he had been a traitor or changed sides, but tell me one who does. He was then given the opportunity to speak to all his corp mates online and other members of leadership who were around and say goodbye.

9. Ivory will be missed but the fucker isnt dead so lets stop pretending like you cant talk to him ever. He has just been removed from our stuff and wont be allowed back on hes still welcome to fuck around with us in other games and on our gaming server.

10. SMA pulled this trigger not goons and SMA did it based on GIA intelligence and SMA legwork and further intel. What that intel is i wont tell you as i dont think we need too. Leadership is a strong as ever and we introduced the Skyteam intern program in the event that an incident occurred and we needed to replace anyone on the skyteam. The grrr goons shit and omg how can it be true is expected but not justified.

Ivory Kantenu is a long time eve friend of mine and someone who has helped me immensely through the good and the hard times in this community. He has been through the mixer like most of us who have been around Pre purge and survived. He just couldn't survive this. River made a post on an unrelated forum thread the other day and it sums up where ivory stands with me..... even if he is a traitorous little bastard i will be grabbing a beer with when i viist him and maybe Elo when i visit Alberta next year!!

""welded in the fires of countless tears, friendships, girlfriends, wives and hours shed in this communities history."" - Ex River

At the end of the day ivory is and was a important part of this community but a promise was made when i brought him in, and out of that respect and the respect he had earnt with his work i sent him out. Not goons, not river, not some random person."

I'm not from around here and have never seen a housing market this competitive and my buddy is an international student so we have no idea what's up.

1. When do we start looking? My undergrad buddies all say start now but they're all living in IV, does this apply for Goleta/Downtown as well? 
2. We see some nice places that are listed right now on CL and Padmapper but they say available now. Do I contact them anyway to look for a lease starting this summer? 
3. Is it easy to sublet a spaces out around here? We might be getting internships in other places and not be around for the summer but a lot of places have 1 year leases.

I've been looking through some of the posts here, but ordering things from pcpartpicker with combos is way, way, waaaaay cheaper than ordering here through amazon or ebay. So I've been trying my best to put together a really cheap entry-level PC. As for me, I'll mostly use it to do homework(2 monitor full HD), play some League of Legends(at least medium+ 60fps in full HD without shadows), or some other not really PC-intensive tasks(visual novels, films, poker on 2 screens). I don't have much interest in any modern games, so being able to play any of them is optional. As a self-sufficient university student, I'm pretty short on money, and would happily switch out any of these parts if I can cut down on the cost while still being able to do everything I've written above. I'm not really planning on upgrading it for a few years, so that's not a consideration. Do keep in mind that most things on newegg cost less in dollars, than on amazon/ebay in euros.

2nmh11,2,2014-11-27,"My girlfriend (22/f) of almost 2 years dumped me (25/m) 2 weeks after i left for a 4 month stay in Africa. I am still here and she is dating somebody new. I feel lied to, isolated, and deeply hurt.",ThatDudeWithTheEgg,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2nmh11/my_girlfriend_22f_of_almost_2_years_dumped_me_25m/,"My girlfriend and i met each other while we where both just starting uni and we quickly fell very in love and had a very intense and romantic relationship. After a year she switched her studies to a university at the other end of the country (Denmark) and I moved in with in December of last year and took the 3 hour train ride to and from my own university each day (and yes the country really is so small that you can go from one end to the other in 3 hours). 

The first month was fantastic, just getting to go home to her every day. But soon we started fighting more over little and small things alike. At the time I felt like it was just the usual moving in together rough patch kind of deal. But then in march she came home after a party with tears in her eyes, telling me that she had kissed this guy that she had been texting with for a while, which i had made her aware that i thought was coming on to her. I was devastated and i spent 4 hours screaming at her before i kicked her out of the apartment for 2 days while i wondered what to do. When we saw each other again my mind was leaning towards breaking up with her, but as we talked I decided that i loved her too much to give up over this, especially since she told me right away. So i told her that we should try and make it work, but that she would have to accept that she would have to do a lot of work to regain my trust, as well as my rule that she not stop going out with friends, as I felt if she just stayed home she would not be proving anything other than the ability to physically stay away from other guys. She accepted this and she moved back in.

The first month was tough, i failed a few exams because i kept obsessing about what she had done, and in this time she was very supportive and active in trying to help me. But as a few months passed by and both we and I got a lot better, i would still get very annoyed if she was out and didn't respond to my text's in a reasonable amount of time. She started getting annoyed with me, telling me that she doesn't have to write me everything she does when she is out, and this really bugged me because it showed that she did not really comprehend what she had done to me, and her responsibility to help fix it. I realize now that i should have jumped ship at this point, but i didn't, love struck sap i was.

Fast forward to July, and we are doing reasonably well and i am getting ready to leave for Uganda where I am for my 5th semester. Then 3 weeks before i am set to leave, my mother dies and i have to scramble to get her apartment emptied, funeral arranged, etc. My girlfriend was working in another part of the country at this time, but was very supportive over Skype and text. She came to my mothers funeral with me and we spent the day together before she had to leave back for work (which i made her do since i did not want her to loose the much needed paycheck). I was going to leave on August 18th for Uganda and we had the two weeks leading up to it by ourselves in our apartment. The first week was very great, we had fun together at home and just generally enjoying each others company. The final week she started getting very sad and moody, picking fights with me about almost everything. I figured it was just because I would be leaving soon, and i understood her, even though I did not feel the same amount of stress about not being together for 4 months as she did. We had both known since the day we met that i would have to be out of the country for my 5th semester and thus i had come to terms with it and felt it was just something I needed to do.

The day came when i had to leave and she followed me to the airport so we could say a proper goodbye. I boarded the plane and promised i would call her as soon as i arrived. As soon as i got to my hotel in Uganda, in the middle of the night, i called her and we had a nice talk and she seemed excited for me rather than sad.

But after a few days she started to communicate less and less with me and would get very annoyed with me for being ""clingy"" (I was alone, far far from home, so yes i probably was a bit clingy). I got settled in at the university i am attending here as well as managing to arrange a full time internship with a large international governmental organization here, so things were going well for me. She started to pick fights with me about almost everything and we talked less and less. After 2 weeks of being here she was away on a trip with her uni and she did not text me for 24 hours, and did not say that she wouldn't. When she finally called me she was drunk and we got into a huge fight and i hung up. She then texted me the dreaded ""I need a break"" message. I called her up again in a furious rage, how dared she TEXT me this shit. She got defensive and i called her a whore, telling her to have fun fucking all the guys in her class. Not the best way to handle it i know. A few days went by and she called me again in tears telling me she was sorry that she did not at least tell it to me over the phone. She said that she needed the break to learn to be alone because she was very disturbed about how poorly she was handling life when i was gone. I accepted this, and actually saw it as kind of a good thing as she has always had trouble being independent and we left it with her saying she still loved me, guaranteeing me that this was not because she was looking for another guy.

A few weeks passed by with no contact and we started talking again. I was already immensely stressed by my full time internship and evening classes at a foreign university, and just adjusting to life here in general. She started talking to me about how much she missed me, how much she was looking forward to me coming home and holding her, kissing her, even skype sex. This thing went on for about a month until one day she just did not contact me for 24 hours. Wen she contacted me again she said she had to tell me something that would hurt me. I told her to spit it out. Turns out she had brought a guy home to OUR apartment where my stuff still is, and spent an entire day having sex with him. I freaked the fuck out and told her she was the worst person in the world to do this to me. I finally got it out of her that she had been flirting and kissing with this guy for 2 weeks, meaning while she was still writing me how she loved me, missed me, etc. 

I did not sleep that night and went to work in a very sorry state and tried as best i could to get through the day. I kept writing her, calling her every name in the book, which of course just made me more and more angry. She was very unapologetic, saying that she broke it of with me and I had no right to be angry. 2 days after she slept with him she tells me that she has feelings for him and they are now dating, which led me to tell her that if she could change her emotions from me to him so fast, she either never had the or hadn't had them in a long time for me, and she had just been using me for comfort, a point she flat out denied. I did not sleep or eat for a week after this. I kept harassing her for a few days before i finally realized that this was not helping me and that i would never get her to admit she had done anything wrong. So i blocked her on social media, deleted her number and all text conversations. Before I did this, I got her to promise me to at least not have sex with him in the apartment until i get home and can collect my things.

Further complicating matters is that my financials are in a bit of a mess after this trip so i was not really planning on having to find a new apartment. I decided to move in with my father when i get home, at least until i get on my feet. But then my father lost his job, so he now needs to sell his house which makes me technically homeless when i return. I called my ex to inform her that i did not know when i would be able to collect my things when i get back, which she understood. She then said something that puzzled me a lot. Apparently she had gotten on to my facebook, and she tried to make me feel guilty for writing very mean things about her to my friends, i told her to drop it because i needed to went and she shouldn't snoop. This was 2 weeks ago and it was the final time we talked.

Over the last few weeks i have started feeling better, by no means good, but better. I have made a big effort to try to not this ruin my stay here so i have thrown myself into work and school which is all going rather good. The biggest problem I have is in the evenings when i am alone in my room, i have become addicted to always having music in my ears as any silence brings me down. 

I am starting to reach a point where i am glad to be rid of her after she has shown her true colors. However i am starting to struggle more and more with the feeling that the last 2 years have been a lie and that she never really loved me, but was just with me because she could not handle being alone. I know that i loved her very very much and I am scared that if i ever meet somebody else that i will not be able to love or trust that girl as much. In general i try to be hopeful for the future although it is hard because what she has done has brought up many insecurities I thought I thought I was past. I love the work I do here but at the same time it sucks because I am away from every friend i have and i can only write so much with them over text. I am scared of becoming depressed when I return, since i will have no home, and the life i left is in ruins. 

I am returning on December 21st, and i got the opportunity to go back a week earlier, something i declined because i want to finish my internship completely. It is a decision i am proud of. I have been out drinking with a few Ugandan friends of mine to try to forget some of all of this, which has actually been quite helpful, even though i did some things i am not particularly proud of during these nights out. 

So the point of this long post is probably mostly me venting. But also how do I even begin to get to a place where i can start to move on properly when I am stuck so far from home, with no real home to return to? And how do i deal with the anger that she did this to me, and is moving on, seemingly without an ounce of remorse?

TL;DR
Girlfriend of nearly two years dumps me almost immediately after i leave to ""learn to be alone"". Proceeds to fuck another guy in our apartment then starts dating him, showing almost no remorse. I meanwhile am stuck a million miles away, with no real home to return to. How the hell do I get over the anger and move on?"
2nmtcv,3,2014-11-27,I need help.,SirNipply,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/2nmtcv/i_need_help/,"Okay Reddit, I need help. Here's my situation. I'm overweight, that's an understatement. I'm morbidly obese, and I'm sick of it. I've tried for two years to lose weight and have lost weight and gained it back. It's been a terrible and sick roller coaster and I'm afraid I'm done with it. At my biggest I was at 360 pounds, and am currently at 335. 

At the beginning of this year, I had had enough. I got a gym membership, and actually kept a pretty decent schedule with working out an hour a day and eating very healthy. I went from 360 to around 305. Awesome right? I had never been more proud of myself than I was at that moment. I was so close to having a ""2"" at the beginning of my weight. I wanted it, I need it. Then I got a pretty bad sinus infection. So bad, I was sneezing blood and the pressure had built up so bad it got behind my left ear drum and ruptured it. And because of this, ir ruptured my ear drum.

Skip to the beginning of this summer when that happened. A few weeks after, my long distance girlfriend moved in with me to do an internship. This was an unpaid internship. So I had to fully support the both of us financially. I had no issue with that and was for the most part, able to do so. However, because of this, I had to work more hours, losing everyday at the gym, and eat unhealthy foods to support the both of us on a minimum wage income. 

Skip to the beginning of this semester. I had transferred from my towns community college to Florida State University, and had gotten a job as a low paid intern as a Web Developer during the week, and had to keep a job at Goodwill during the weekends. So both of those, on top of going to school full-time has pretty much given me no time to go to a gym. I work over 40 hours a week and when I'm not at work, I'm at school or studying to keep the first semester of my life I've had straight A's. 

So what I need help is, how in the ever living hell, with my busy schedule can I lose weight? I'm eating the way I used to again, but I need to work-out. I need to lose weight. I'm only 21 and lose my breath when I go upstairs. I was almost to the point I could run a mile. I want that again. What can I do with two jobs and full-time school to lose weight?

2nmymp,4,2014-11-27,Me [19 M] and this crush [19 F] Can't keep myself from her.,Saonjeku,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2nmymp/me_19_m_and_this_crush_19_f_cant_keep_myself_from/,"So I just got out of a relationship which I rushed in too early and things weren't working out between this girl because I all of a sudden just stopped liking her. I would say this is because I rushed in too early and let the feelings get the best of me when we should have just stayed friends and get to know each other better. We dated right after we met and pretty much made it official after the second date. Then once college started I just lost feelings for her so I broke up with her because it was just the right thing to do instead of letting it drag on.

I've already had a bad relationship before this one and this is my second time messing up again. I really wanted to do things right and now I'm scared of getting into another relationship in fear of me all of a sudden just not liking this person. 

So fast forward a couple weeks, theres this girl I met at my internship where I volunteer. She is super cool and we connect pretty well. I try not to get too close to her and all, but I can't help myself. I would stay until it was closing time at the internship just to hang out with her if possible and I could tell that I did like her. Soon I got her number from a friend and next thing you know I'm texting her until like one in the morning. I try not to bother her though and text her like 24/7, in the morning and during classes. I don't want to ruin our relationship we have though. I got to talk to her about the recent breakup I just mentioned and she talked about hers too and I just connected more. I was like, man this girl's pretty awesome and all, she's nice, a good girl, pretty athletic and all, into the same things I am, similar views, but she is a little crazy. When I say crazy I mean fun crazy like into raves and such and knows how to have fun. I wouldn't want to ruin a relationship this good. She is almost like a best friend. 

Should I just wait it out...or get closer? Go on a date? I think I just really needed to let this out and get some opinions though.

Could really use some advice and perspective.

Last year during the summer I was doing an internship type deal, and met an amazing girl at a company event. She looks much younger than she is, so it seemed like I was flirting with somebody roughly my own age, only to find out (next day) that she was a bit older than me. This is fine with me, she still acts very cutesy and girly and such, and the age difference does really stick out in my mind when I am with her. We started dating, and we had quite a lot in common - I speak the language of the country where she is from, we are both into philosophy, both open minded (our first sort of date mostly was a discussion about politics, religion, and feminism, pretty much touching all the bases as far as stuff you aren't supposed to talk about on first dates). Turns out she had been planning on leaving the company for some time, and ends up leaving about 3 weeks after I meet her to go to Europe for a one year degree while she figures out next steps in her life. We have sex for the first time the night before she leaves. Is good. We bid our farewells, and part on good terms.

We also stay in touch. She returned to [city] that fall, and I happened to be in town, so we met up and had a nice time together. We continue to be in contact, skyping ever few months or so. Meanwhile I finish up my postgrad degree while she finishes one year degree. I know from a long time that I am going to Asia after I graduate. She looks for jobs in US, Europe, and Asia, and the one in Asia pans out, and it just happens to be in the field she is most interested in, and so she plans to move to the same city at the same time. At no point is her going to Asia ""for me"" or ""us"" discussed, and definitely not implied, as she is an extremely independent girl.

Fast forward to the end of this summer, right before we start work we go on two separate vacations together. No sex, but very kissy and cuddly. Lovely time, couldn't have imagined a better end to my summer. At one point I ask what we are, we had been drinking so she says she is drunk and happy-go-lucky, and doesn't really want to talk about it then. We don't ever really talk about it.

We get to Asia, both extremely busy getting new apartments, jobs, etc. We meet for dinner, very casual. I have to return to US for a week, get back, and try getting back in touch with her. More or less ignored for a week. She goes out a couple nights, gets my messages on fb, says nothing. I am hurt. I recently got through to her, and on the phone tried to ask where this is going. We plan to get coffee soon, and talk, but she is avoiding talking about anything real like its the plague, and seems more interested in casual meet-up than serious discussion.

Here's how I feel about everything. I know the age gap makes things more difficult, probably more so for her than me, and now that she is a place that she will be for a long time, the social consequences of dating somebody younger than herself will be felt much more poignantly. I am not 100% sure what I want, but expected we would be seeing each other more than we are currently. She spends most of her spare time relaxing and reading by herself. She has always been very independent, but I think this shows her priorities somewhat. I have a tendency to be clingy due to trust issues, and she also is an eensy bit self-centered. This leads me to doubt my own perspective on things. Perhaps my being hurt by her keeping me at arm's length is just me being clingy (I don't really know anybody else in town). Maybe she is just being self-centered and wants to keep me around without having to commit to anything. It seems clear from her words and behavior that she does not want a committed relationship either now, or with me. She does want to stay in touch and continue to meet, and she acts as more than a friend would on these occasions. I am completely lost. Have we turned back into just friends, or are we floating around in the void still? Being unsure of what I want, other than to not be ignored as I have been, and at least spending more time with her (which I really enjoy! one of the only people I have met I feel like I can be myself around), how does my dopey ass proceed?

Any and all advice or observations are appreciated.

Thanks!

**TL;DR** I'm [sort of] seeing somebody older than me and have absolutely no clue whether we are in a relationship or not."
2nn6vv,4,2014-11-28,Traveling from USA to Iran with family. Thinking about traveling solo starting from Iran after my parents go back to America. Thoughts?,travelerthrowaway10,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/2nn6vv/traveling_from_usa_to_iran_with_family_thinking/,"I'm going to Iran with my parents to see our family in April of next year. I'll be 21 at the time with very limited international travel experience. 

Outside of the US I've only been to Mexico City (and TJ, but that doesn't really count since it's basically San Diego part 2). I've also never traveled alone (excluding relocating for internships or flying out for interviews).

I've wanted to travel throughout college, but kept putting it off. But I don't want to make anymore excuses! I have 4 months between finishing school and starting work. I will be spending 3 weeks in Iran and I would like to spend another **1 - 2 months** traveling. 

I have been working while going to school/during summer for 4 years and I want to treat myself. My parents will cover my airfare to Iran (after that I'm on my own). I am willing to spend about **$3000 +- $1000**. Honestly, money isn't a huge concern; I have enough saved up and I have a well paying job waiting for me. I don't need luxury anything and I'm totally good with couchsurfing, hostels, etc.

I want a lot of the same things that anybody traveling wants. I'm looking to experience another culture, party, see cool, old shit, and eat some bomb food. I'm down for eating whatever if it looks interesting (I ate grasshoppers in Mexico City for example) and food is definitely really important for me. Other than that, I'm not looking for anything specific, just a bit of excitement before I settle down into the 9 - 5 grind.

So here's my questions:

* Should I travel starting from Iran or go back to America first? 
I'm not worried about fatigue or homesickness (since I'll be with family for the entire duration). Plus, it seems like I'd already be closer to a lot of cool destinations like Turkey, Greece, etc.
*  Assuming I start from Iran, what countries should I visit? I'm honestly down for whatever. I was thinking Europe via Turkey, but I'm 100% open to suggestions. I'm also interested in visiting at least a few different countries.
* What should I expect from the language barrier? I only speak English, Farsi, and a bare minimum amount of Spanish. 
* What can I expect from solo travel? This intimidates me a lot! It's increasingly looking like I won't have anyone to travel with in the 4 months that I have free and I don't want to stay at home and jerk off because I was too afraid to go alone. 

Thanks for reading this long post! I appreciate any advice :)"
2nnbir,1,2014-11-28,Whether to go Full Time or Pursue a Masters,brainguy222,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2nnbir/whether_to_go_full_time_or_pursue_a_masters/,"I've come to the point in my life where i have to make a major decision. I don't know whether i should start a full time job or try to pursue my masters. I'll explain in a minute, but here's a little background. 

I'm a senior in mechanical engineering that is going to graduate in April 2015. However, due to certain project team obligations, i will be busy until November of that year. This also means that i will not be taking any classes that semester. I have a ok (3.2ish) gpa with a long list of extra circular activities. I also have a decent amount of gov secured student debt. 

Now i can do one of two things: 

1. Get a job that starts in Nov 2015
3. Graduate in April 2015 and go directly into grad school starting Jan 2016.  

My problem is that if i start full time in November, i will have used most of my grace period months on my student loans and will begin to pay interest on those almost immediately. Also, i have never had an internship due to my involvement with project team and i'm worried i will be locked into a job for two years without knowing much about it. I want to work in the aerospace industry working with composite structure design. My prospects for jobs in those industries are good due to my ec working with composites.  

On the other hand, i can extend my stay at uni. I might be able to get a gsi position, but i don't qualify for the 5 year masters program, so i will be there for 2 years. This will give me time to get internships and determine more of what i want to do. It also eliminate some of the glass ceilings that are present at some of the companies that i want to work at. Or at least the glass ceilings that I've heard about.  But it delays my graduation and I don't know if i want to do pure engineering for the rest of life. I have a strong managerial side of my personality and i'm really considering wanting to get an MBA at a later point in my life. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation, and would you be able to give any advice on how i should make a decision? Or if you guys have suggestions at all, i would be happy to hear them. I'm really at a loss on how to decide between the options.

2nni1m,13,2014-11-28,IBS-C Never Give Up,[deleted],ibs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/2nni1m/ibsc_never_give_up/,"Before i get started i want to wish everyone who is fighting good luck and also please excuse my grammar :). I'm going to try and keep this as short and concise as possible. The point of me ranting at 3 o'clock in the morning (i live in nyc) is to give some hope to people still in the trenches. I have not beaten it, but I'm starting to win.



Symtoms: 
Sensitive to gluten, rice, corn 
Very bad Headaches 
Extreme constipation (I would go 6+ days with no bowel movements) 
Weak
Tired 
Depressed( I'm a positive person but when i don't feel good i turn into a fucking zombie)
Bloated 
Auto immune attacks.
Anxiety



My battle: It started 3 years ago, my body started getting constipated and bloated when i ate any gluten, it took 6 moths to find out i was gluten sensitive, it was not a fun time. I would almost pass out anytime i ate a slice of pizza. Once we found the antibody in my blood i cut gluten out of my diet, i felt better for a couple of months, but then my colon started being a little bitch again. 

For some reason i would go days without being able to go to the bathroom. I couldn't understand it, i though i was all better. I wasn't able to go to the bathroom regularly, i got weak, dizzy, bad headaches, and much more. After going to my doctor and running a bunch of tests he concluded that i and IBS-C. Over the next 2 years i tried changing my diet and exercising more but still i didn't feel like myself my body just didn't work right. During those two years i was just getting by, i didn't feel really weak our strong. I realize this now because i had to hit rock bottom first. 

This past year (FEB2014-NOV2014) for some reason my symptoms got much worse, i needing to fight everyday just to get out of bed. The food i was eating(rice, corn, and fried foods) stated to effect me differently. The constapation got much worse, it went from 2 day of not having a bowel movement to 6 days. With this the headaches got much worse, and i couldn't be myself. I had to drop 2 classes i was taking in college and i could badly handle the classes i had left. One bad story during this time,(there are many) I was on vacation eating by my cousins, i feel like shit and haven't gone to the bathroom in 4 days. My sisters friends eating with us. After dinner my sister and here friend wanted to go meet some people and they wanted me to take them. At this point i went into the bathroom and just waited and cried. Not being able to go to the bathroom and feeling so anxious and weak i didn't want to walk out and face them. So i waited there for an hour until i finally mustered up the strength to walk out and hurry back to my room. My family knows whats wrong with me but i really don't like other people seeing me at my lowest point.

 I was so upset when the semester ended in May i just fell of a cliff. I could not get out of bed. i spent 2 weeks in my house using enema's to go to the bathroom when i couldn't handle the pain. I though i wouldn't make it, it's a weird thing to have to accept death at a young age. my body felt like it would just give out. I was starting my summer internship on June 6th ( funnyish store, i got a summer internship at a good financial firm for the summer, before my colon went completely crazy i was feeling great, i was at 100% the day i interviewed for the positioned and they loved me so i got the job) fast forward to the start of the internship and i was a mess, i honestly don't know how i got through it. i walked into the office two weeks in and i had had enough, i was about to quit and just walk out(my mom had to drive me in because i was to weak to take the subway). But i spoke with my doctor and he said that even if I'm very constapated make sure to drink a lot of water because it's easy to get dehydrated if a person has extreme constipation. So i did and it helped a little bit. Then i went to a nutritionist and he put me on a special diet, which for the first week i was on it worked perfectly. I felt like myself for the first time in months. It was like i was locked away for so long and i finally got out. Soon after i was back to feeling shitty, not as bad but still i got constipation, weak, dizzy, and anxious. It was very hard to finish the internship but i powered through it. The worst thing about this disease is that i wasn't able to be myself. I could not talk to people with out feeling weak, i couldn't make social connection, i got so anxious all the time for no reason. After i finished i made a commitment that getting better came before everything else. Woking 8-6 during my internship and i i wasn't able to eat the foods i needed at the times i needed to.  

So starting in September i kept strictly to the diet My nutritionist provided. For September and October i had some days were i got home and just collapsed on my bed, and i still didn't go to the bathroom for a day or two. But once my diet was set, i started forcing myself to exercising every day and so are it has been working wonders. I have gotten my hopes up before to i don't want to jinx it but i think i have finally started to win. I wake up in the mooring and i feel like getting out of bed, never thought i would like that feeling.



I have so many memories of me just not being myself, not having the strength to be a normal person. I Couldn't really make any friends, i was just concentrating on surviving. But I'm not sad, on the contrary I've never been happier. I just want the chance to live my life, after going through what i have i was able to learn a lot. There is always light in the darkest places, and if you can pull it out you will become stronger then you ever could have imagined. I was able to realize through my pain and suffering how good everything is. When i feel sick the world is dull, i can't appreciate anything, feel anything, do anything. So when i feel good I'm just happy that i can do simple thing. Even if someone were to punch me in the face i would say it's all good because thank god i can feel it. Maybe it's a little crazy but fuck it.



Treatment: I am treating my IBS-C in 3 ways 

1. Diet: I eat oatmeal for breakfast every other morning, i eat a fish meat or potatoes with salad for lunch, and for dinner i have steamed vegetables with either lentil soup or meat. plus a lot of fruit and no alcohol. 

2. I exercise everyday. I have to exercise at least an hour a day, this is a most recent change. I was so bloated and weak that i didn't have the strength to exercise. I just had to force myself and i feel better for it.

3. sleeping early really seems to help. If i don't get enough sleep my day doesn't usually end well.



I know this is long but i tried to cut it down, there are a lot more bad things that happened like pushing friends away, not going out for drinking/other activities, feeling like shit on dates, just wanting to hide, ect... that i just don't want to go into. Please if your in the fight never give up. Its okay to get down, i sometime look at the life i could be living if i didn't have this disease. You need to hold on to that image of what you can be and give it all you've got.

2nnv22,5,2014-11-28,Social anxiety... and a whole bunch of other problems,msn_throwaway9876,MaleSupportNetwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaleSupportNetwork/comments/2nnv22/social_anxiety_and_a_whole_bunch_of_other_problems/,"I have a lot of problems which all kind of feed into each other, so it’s hard to really know where to start. This is going to be really long, I didn’t want to make it so long but I feel as though I need to go over a lot of things to give you an accurate idea of my situation.

I’ll be 24 by the end of the year and I have longstanding problems with anxiety, particularly social anxiety. I have improved my social anxiety a lot over the years, but it is definitely still there, and I also have a whole bunch of problems caused by having worse social anxiety in the past. I live in Australia, if that provides any context for anything below.

My social life is pretty limited. I graduated from university last year, and in my last year there was a large group of people who all shared classes together, and I made friends with some of them. I see these people maybe every month or so. I don’t really have any other friends at the moment. This year I went traveling and got back a while ago. I’m now trying to work out what career direction I’m going to take next (more on that later).

&amp;nbsp;

One of the biggest reasons that I did not improve things more during uni was because of my parents. They have put a lot of pressure on me in the past in really unhelpful ways.  The biggest example of this is that after my first year of uni they wanted me to get a job. They put a lot of pressure on me to get one but I found it very difficult to apply for places because of my anxiety. The pressure which they put on me made it way, way harder for me to apply for places, and put me under a huge amount of anxiety. I felt like I was a complete failure for not getting a part-time job, and that I was completely incapable of getting or keeping a job (even though I actually had one in high-school). This may be a somewhat melodramatic way of putting it, but it was almost as though they made me feel like I didn’t count as a person unless I had a job.  I was constantly freaking out that my parents were going to criticize me for not applying to enough jobs. It was some of the worst anxiety I have had to deal with.

About a year later I finally managed to get a part-time job, and I thought then I could feel more in control of things. But I found that working late at night made me really tired during the day, and I also had to deal with angry managers who also put me through a lot of anxiety. 

I also still had to deal with my parents who put me pressure about other things.  They mean well and in some ways are probably quite easy going compared to many other parents, but they are neurotic, condescending people who refuse to listen to anything I have to say if they’ve made up their mind. Because of the pressure they’ve put on me in the past they only have to put a bit of pressure on me now and it will throw me into a terrible state of mind. Over the years they’ve put a lot less pressure on me as they realized it didn’t help, but they’ve never completely stopped. They still put me under a significant amount of anxiety, which really interferes with my ability to feel in control of things.

For my last year of uni my parents were happy for me not to work. I thought this way my chance to get in control of my life and improve myself a lot. Unfortunately things did not go as well as I hoped. Earlier I used to get surges of confidence and motivation that I would use to make progress for a bit, but I would always end up losing the surge of motivation when I ended up stressing out about something and feeling like I lost control. I assumed that without the stress of a job I would be able to be in this mindset a lot of the time and I would be able to make a lot of progress. But I didn’t really manage to get into this mindset at all. So while I managed to get good grades and as a result of making friends in class had a better social life than I’d had in years (although I also felt really lonely a lot of the time), I didn’t really make any massive improvement in terms of my anxiety.

&amp;nbsp;

Also generally throughout the year I was hampered by a problem I’m still dealing with, which is that I am really bad at being consistent. I very often ‘fall off the wagon’ and go for some time being very unproductive.  I think there are at least three main reasons for this. One is loneliness. I think I would be a lot better at being motivated and consistent if I had a proper social life. Being lonely often messes with my head and puts me in a weird state of mind.

Another reason I’m not consistent is the internet. I set myself rules like ‘I will only surf the net for fun for half an hour a day’ and try and adhere to them for as long as possible. When I am following the rules I am ok with this. But when I break them I can end up spending all day just endlessly surfing the net. Sometimes I end up doing this for many days in a row, because without the rules I don’t have any self-control. Sometimes I just look at interesting things on reddit and stuff, but a lot of the time I end up reading a whole lot of gender politics and social justice stuff which puts me in a terrible state of mind. The main reason I usually end up breaking the rules I set myself is that I get lonely and the internet kind of makes that easier to deal with.

Another reason I’m not consistent is that I don’t feel in control of things. This is partly caused by my anxiety, and by the fact that I can’t trust myself to be consistent in anything I do.

&amp;nbsp;

Like I said I have managed to make a significant amount of progress over my anxiety compared to where I was when I was 18. I went to a psychologist a few years ago which did help a bit. I tried going to another psychologist last year, but he gave a lot of utterly useless advice like ‘oh just push through your anxiety’ (although maybe this is because I didn’t describe my situation very well. It took my ages to write all this up in a way I feel accurately describes my situation).  I’ve also tried medication for the anxiety but it didn’t help.

Here’s what I see as my biggest problems at the moment:

&amp;nbsp;


-	Not getting too much of a gap on my resume

When I came back from traveling I originally intended to look for a part-time job, which I did do for a while but then I decided to put that on hold in favor of working out my career direction. With the time I have since I came back to traveling plus to the ridiculous amount of time it took to organize my traveling I now have some pretty big gaps on my resume. 

I suspect some people might want to tell me that this is the most important thing to focus on at the moment. I am willing to listen to this, but if you want to give this advice please try and keep in mind that if I get a job that is anything like the other jobs I have had in the past, then the unbearable level of anxiety that it puts me under will probably make it even more difficult for me to focus on anything else, including working out my career direction, and then I will be in a situation I will never be able to get out of.  I don’t really feel as though I have a lot to lose.

&amp;nbsp;


-	Figuring out my career direction

The career I have most seriously considered in the past is becoming an academic (my undergraduate degree in a humanities discipline). On one hand I am inclined not to consider this anymore because of how risky and difficult graduate school is supposed to be. And I definitely don’t think I could handle graduate school until I had improved these problems, because I very nearly failed my last year of uni. But I do find myself re-considering it as an option, partly because I can’t help but think I could be really good at it if didn’t have to deal with anxiety and not having a social life (and I can’t see myself being successful at anything if I don’t manage to overcome all of this). 
What I have been looking at at the moment is computer science. I’ve done a corsera course on programming and taught myself a bit from other sources. It looks interesting.... I think. I might have managed to get myself an internship, but I don’t know if I have yet, and if I don’t come up with any other ideas then it’s looking like my default course of action is going to be to start a masters next year. It feels like it may be a bad idea to make a commitment like that right now, but the problem is if I don’t do that then I have no idea what else I’m going to do next year.
I have considered some other career paths but none of them really in depth. I wish I could have gotten over my anxiety already, because at the moment making this decision feels like a stab in the dark. I don’t know what I can handle if I improve my situation, and I’m pretty sure I won’t be able to handle any sort of career if I don’t improve my situation.

&amp;nbsp;


-	Getting some experience with the opposite sex

Obviously I need to improve my social life in general, but I am particularly worried about this because I have just about no experience with the opposite sex, I have never even kissed. In the past I have put off focusing on this directly because I thought it would be better to work on my anxiety and getting a social life first. However dealing with these problems is taking a lot longer than I thought it would, and as I’m getting older I’m getting scared that this is becoming a more and more serious problem. The thing is though that I am already overwhelmed by everything else I am dealing with that I doubt I will be able to get myself to start asking out girls as well, especially given that I wouldn’t expect it to lead to any positive results any time soon.

&amp;nbsp;

Any solution to these problems is worthless if I don’t have the ability to be consistent. One thing I am going to try and do is go to the gym regularly, because I think regular exercise, especially weight lifting, would help my anxiety a lot. But I have been meaning to go to the gym for ages now, and I never got around to it. That’s the thing: I feel as though if I could just focus on doing one thing – like going to the gym – then I’d be ok, but I can’t do that, because I have all these different problems which I am always stressing out about. It feels as though my life is like a sort of puzzle where I have to deal with everything in exactly the right way and in exactly the right order, otherwise I won’t be consistent and I won’t get anywhere. In the past there was always some reason to think that things might get easier in the future, but now it is getting quite hard to see how things are ever going to get better.

I know that's right in the middle of healthy weight so not a problem, but for some reason, partly because of the stress of working I think, I decided I was fat.

For the whole of October and November, I became obsessed. Exercise every day and eating between 500-900 calories. I lost 1.5 sizes and 14 pounds. It was what I thought about 50% of the time. And then yesterday I just...stopped. I had a talk with my mum which I haven't for a while and just let out all my stresses and worries (of which there were many, not all body related) and now I'm free.

I'm going to eat healthily still (I love veg and I'll probably go for a run every few days) and I like the weight I am now, but if I put on weight, I put on weight and I'm okay with that.

I just wanted to write this post because there might be someone else like me, reading the posts obsessively for tips. Take a step back, think about why you're doing this, and stop before the obsession takes over your life."

-BA, International Relations, meh but recognizable (top 50) USA undergrad  
-MA, International Relations, in a foreign country (#1 in this country, unknown outside of academic circles in the States)  
-Fluently speak a high-demand foreign language  
-Work experience: 2 internships (admin work, second was a position requiring a bilingual), teaching English, research assistant, teaching assistant

My original plan was to go on to a PhD but I've changed my mind. Now I want to find a job in Washington DC or NYC that lets me use my language/international skills. 

Problems:

1. Will be moving with basically no savings. I cannot work another job here due to the work laws of this country. Grad stipend just covers bills without much room to save. I don't even have enough to buy more than one suit. Cannot rent an apartment without security deposit or proof of employment presumably.  

2. No family I can rely on. Literally not even a couch (my family likes me, but they are poor and small and somebody is already crashing there).  

3. After being abroad so long, I don't feel tight enough with my friends from undergrad to just ask them to let me stay with them.  


I definitely need to go home after this program ends. The country in which I am living is very patriarchal (I am a woman) and the jobs available aren't great. However, financially and socially I have no idea how I can actually re-integrate back into the United States. I pretty much can afford a plane ticket back and then I'm just a homeless bum  I guess?

I am a Canada raised Chinese currently looking to perhaps expand into China. I applied for an internship with the Chinese Youth Development Foundation a few weeks ago. I wasn't able to finalize my plans for next year so when asked when I could start working I told them that I would get back to them soon. Yesterday, I got an email asking if I found out or not. Now, my mandarin is probably at a 1st grade level (reading/writing). My spoken mandarin sounds fluent, but I often stumble for words and phrases, and don't know the proper etiquette of speech for almost anything, especially professionally. 

I sent the following message:

Am I right thinking that she got offended? The 好吧？！ makes it seem like it. What I wrote is basically translated from English. Did I say something that implied I had an aggressive tone? Honestly, I tried to be extremely apologetic and friendly (with the !s). Maybe she took it as sarcasm?

I think the worst part for me is that to most people, I have no excuse for this. If I looked like a  foreigner it would be a lot easier....

2np7yz,4,2014-11-28,"[REQUEST] Stumbling over very hard times, and quite short on my rent...",[deleted],Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/2np7yz/request_stumbling_over_very_hard_times_and_quite/,"I'm not sure exactly what to include... I'm pretty nervous writing this.



So, I grew up in foster care from the age of 4 because my mother has issues with severe mental illness, drug addiction, etc.



Though I faced challenges growing up I was always able to excel in school, and in the spring of 2013 I graduated from a great University (with a degree in drama/playwriting). Things have been going well generally; I did a short paid internship with a really great company in my field, I was shortlisted for an MA program and interviewed at Yale which was really nice, and I have been getting noticed for my work. But since I studied/work in the arts and don’t have any sort of family to help me financially, it’s been my shitty retail job that has been paying my bills and keeping me fed and housed- - I live paycheque to paycheque to paycheque. My situation wasn’t glamorous, but it wasn’t tragic or horrible, either. 



Since graduating school I’ve been living in the same city as my mother-- something I haven’t done since I was a very young child. Our relationship is very complicated, awkward, and uncomfortable, as I don’t really know her that well. Most of my memories with her are from supervised visits she barely remembers. But, she is my mother and I do love her dearly. 



About a year ago she went missing (she has since been found). Going missing is unfortunately something that is not out of the ordinary for her. Due to the nature of her mental illness and drug addiction, she has many ups and downs which include being often homeless and engaging in very, very unsafe sex work to feed her drug addiction. But, this time went she went missing it was preceded by a text saying she was going to kill herself. So this time it was much more concerning, and it lasted a lot longer. About 7 months later she contacted me. Since then I’ve been working really hard to try and stay in contact and be more close and supportive, no matter how difficult it is. 



Over the past few months I’ve been giving her a lot of money. In retrospect I know this was very stupid. It began with trying to help get her on her feet, but eventually it became clear she was using again. When she would ask me for money in instances where I fully knew it was for drugs, I ended up giving it to her because I knew the alternative would be very unsafe prostitution. I thought that by giving her money rather than leaving her to her own devices to acquire it, I was keeping things from escalating to where they’ve been so many times before. I did not have enough money to be giving her so much, but I was scraping by. A month ago my hours at work got cut drastically-- I’ve pretty much become a weekend person. I’ve also become quite depressed. And so for the last month I've been desperately trying to find a second job, while fighting to get up every morning.



I feel so stupid and embarrassed—I kept thinking that things would come together, but it’s the end of the month and they haven’t, and rent is due, and I barely have enough for half of it. I’ve been looking up social assistance programs in my city and have begun applying, but those will take some time and my rent is due on the first.



I don’t know what to do. I love reddit, and have heard about r/assistance before, and so I thought I’d post here. I have a promising job interview next week, and so I really hope things are looking up for the future, but right now I’m in a hole with my credit card completely maxed out, and bills to pay. Right now, I’m short about $500…which is a lot, I know. But, anything would help.

PM for paypal info. I also can do an e-interact transfer, or make a GoFundMe.com account if that is necessary 


Sorry for writing so much, I just thought it was necessary to explain myself and how I got into this situation.

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR
I was giving a lot of money to my mother who battles a drug addiction, and my work hours were drastically cut leaving me very broke.

I may be returning to states from overseas with my wife, looking to relocate to Vegas. I have some questions if you might humor me.

Few years back wife/self swept thru Vegas on our way to Zion, Bryce, etc...we liked it well enough to consider moving there at some later date. Its now that later date.

Im originally from CA, southern beaches area. We cant go back.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

I (we) would be moving to LV obviously without jobs. My credit was always excellent, but it appears (checking reports last visit), I have none. Literally. The credit agencies have no record of me. Well, at least its not bad credit eh? 

Will I have problems renting or are there solutions - such as paying a few months up front, taking a shorter or longer lease??

Would it impress if I could produce letters stating accounts from my US bank and my brokerage or offer to write a check on the spot for security, first last + one (?) month?

I'm thinking about having a police check done here to assist job search (apt also?) and one done back in usa as well. Wife must have one for residence visa.

Do they run a check on both applicants? I guess, as we would be making so little, it does sort if make sense. We are both supporting the flat. For my wife this would be a scam, she has no history or background in usa.

Would showing credit card statements from Thailand (both of us), impress a rental agent? 

I'm obviously worried about all this, ironically my credit was excellent and only bounced one check in my life - because I sent it off too quickly and it was processed before my dd hit. 

What about utilities deposits? 

Input please...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

I'm using Trulia Rents (turns up Apt Guide), just poking around, can someone give us some areas (cross roads) of where to avoid please? I have some ideas after reading this sub, but it would be great to get some real borders I can peg on a map.

We are looking I think for Southeast area, near the strip for wife's bus transportation, but very safe.

Also worried about the $$ credit check, seems like it could be a scam, guess can surely ask to see apt first.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Anyone work in hotels??

Can anyone comment on potential housekeeping or similar service jobs for my wife? Her English is quite good and read/write sufficient for such a job. She is now working at a TV station in BKK managing clothing and costumes (manual/no computer). My family has some large motels on the east coast and I'm going to ask my cousins if they will give her an internship and a letter. So, I think for mist hk jobs, her with her sunny smile can land a job. Thing is, I want her to really reach for it first time and try for quality hotels with good staff and managers, not just take anything. Thanks.

*wife waiting for and using bus during daylight hours. Is this a problem?

As for me, I'm going to have a rough go. I never planned on returning and let my IT skills lapse although I'm still good at troubleshooting. I'm getting into SEO and copy writing as a side job, but need a ft job to carry the burden.

I'm looking at soul crushing call center work primarily. Ive not needed to work here really but have stayed occupied teaching and many yrs ago, working as a tour guide. I have other interests, but doubt Id get hired wo experience. Thinking about Slot Technician (school). Id like to work on RVs. I'm a pretty smart guy, have a BA for what its worth.

Ibe done some F/B work thru the years as well.

Finally, what security checks can we expect from hotels or casinos if that was a route to employment? What documents could we produce to make us more employable if any?

I'm most worried about myself, searching job boards there are 100s of housekeeping jobs and my wife has such a winning disposition. Just worry she is so petite, they wont let her push the cart ☺


Sorry, this is a lot to chew on. Thanks for anything.

Especially interested in job market in addition to apartment leasing issues. We are also considering Orlando, FL but I hate FL and know we will hate Orlando.

I already have road trip experience driving cross-country from NYC to the San Francisco Bay Area for a previous internship, so I figured I will do the same to go to my next gig which will be in Houston, TX. I won't be making the trip until sometime in the end of January of 2015 though (I need to get to Houston by the 24th or 25th at the latest). When I drove from NY to CA and back last time, I did it alone, so I figured I'd give ridesharing a try... so if anyone is interested in tagging along for the journey and you are okay with the timeframe I've mentioned, hit me up! I tend to have fairly decent driving endurance, so be prepared to be in a car for 300+ mile periods, limited only by fuel stops. Also, my car is a coupe, so it might not be the roomiest thing out there, but she has decent room up front and is fairly new, so you should be pretty comfortable.

Either way, PM me with questions (and you don't necessarily have to be starting from NYC... if you are somewhere on my route, we might be able to work something out)."

But the thing is huge, and I'm a college student right now, so when I go back home for holidays or go work an internship over the holiday I can't really bring it with me without shipping it, which I don't like doing.  So I'm looking for something more portable - a pc that can fit in a bag so I can carry it on a flight home for winter break for example.  My main purpose would be gaming as well.  Also I feel like I don't need a laptop because whenever I need to game I'm in a stationary place for a month at least, I just go back and forth a lot so I can't bring my main computer all of those times.


My current PC has an i5 3570k and a Radeon HD 7970, so those are things I could feasibly take out of my main rig and just put into my portable rig when I want to use it (though that graphics card is huge so that might be a problem).

My budget would ideally be around $1000, though I could go up to around $1300. 

Any advice on a case that could fit that video card but still be small enough to fit in a bag?  And what else I would need to make this work? I haven't fully built a PC ever so I am pretty green.


I've also considered a couple prebuilt options - something like an ibuypower revolt or some sort of a steam machine because those seem really portable.  I probably won't use this past the next few years too much because I'll be going back and forth a lot less, so upgradability isn't too much of a worry.  So any thoughts on doing something like this?  It would undoubtedly be more money or less performance, but I don't necessarily need this to be a beast, I just need to not go crazy when I'm stuck in a random state by myself at my internship this summer.

It's a two month intensive program, you work 12+ hours a day. And by the end of it they get you a job through their many connections and networks. They 100% guarantee you a paid full time job or internship. 

Now, the price is a little steep. $8,000. But... If they guarantee you work that's just a minor investment you would be making back plus more within the first year? 

Are these things legitimate for finding work? I have no degree and only a few months experience with programming. On their site they even say no prior knowledge of programming is required... Interesting.  

I'm a little skeptical, but I've been reading stories online and they all seem to be promising thus far... I'm still a little worried this is all some elaborate money scheme though. "

I try my best to live within my means but I know I make some impulse buys on occasion. Here are my numbers :

Current monthly income post tax~ 2.4-2.7k (as an intern I'm hourly so month to month does vary.)

My expenses are fairly contained, and in a way subsidized. My parents don't give me everything but they do expect me to take care of food, transport, and rent while I'm interning full time. 

On average during my working term monthly expenses will not exceed $1350 ($950 to rent) 

January my expenses will plummet but my pay will also suffer as I go back to school, so it mostly balances out.

Basically I'm always concerned I'm not doing necessarily the best things with money, mostly because I am well aware that I'm in a better financial situation than most and am extraordinarily grateful. My parents are not particularly bad with money, but they aren't particularly great with it either. They made sure my sister and I could get through school, which I literally can't thank them enough. I just wish they were a bit more careful and I know that with some micromanaging and good spending practices I can be very well off in my own future.

Occasionally I will splurge and buy a cool new toy (sigh..engineering life) but I try to make intelligent purchases..ones that have an asset side to them and a fun side, like a 3D printer.

I'm bracing for the real world, trying to make a 10/10 no-splash entry.

 If anybody can give me encouraging words or suggestions on how to maximize my potential or what types of things I should start thinking about before I graduate, it would be greatly appreciated.

Im about to finish my degree and become a software developer after my internship.

Being the middle child I was always pretty independent and quiet, just going with the flow of things. Well whenever I see my siblings, they just want to drink or smoke. Which is normal perhaps. I am a fellow toker myself, but I keep that to myself and not apart of family. My parents hate it and I respect to not do it around them. 

Anyway, I love them so much, but my sister only wants to smoke or drink anytime we ""hang"" out. My brother is just so lost and has been manipulated into thinking drinking and rebelism is what's cool. Its hard to see because me and him hung out gaming or whatever everyday after school back in the day. We still do play some destiny here and there.

They think that I dont care about them and want nothing to do with them. I try to explain I have dreams, and I want to talk about these types of things, adult things, but they are not on the same page...My sister is engaged and I found out over Facebook and never met him prior. We live an hour from each other. 

This weekend she texted me and asked if I could bring her some buds...she said she really wanted to hang out, but she got the buds and left. I know we are not similar, and I could do better to connect with her and my brother. I am just trying so hard to follow my own dreams. I feel so fucking horrible that I'm basically sick of her shit and don't want to even bother dealing with it...On top of that she will text me things saying our brother needs us. He has some bad depression and has thought suicidal before.So I think about this while trying to work and get school shit done.

My parents are ok. My mom is the one who does all the talking and parenting. My dad is so quiet and passive, he doesnt take action. Honestly, I know my mom has crazy stress and mental issues from this. She is a hell of a woman, but she just can't parent right..Every time I visit home it's a drama fest.

I just had to rant this somewhere. I am so depressed about it I can't have a relationship with anyone, because I don't know what a good relationship is like. I plan to never have a family of my own.


Tldr: brother is majorly depressed, my sister is still living in high school state of mind when she is 26. I want to accomplish so much and I can, but I feel so much guilt for not being there for them. Do I wait this out? Take action now? What do I do?"

So I have a bit of dilemma.

Yesterday I had interviews at two places I thought both interview went really well. Place 1 seemed kinda boring, the salary is average but I could pursue the job during the summer and maybe during the rest of my studies and the team seems cool too. Place 2 seems like the work will be exciting, a lot harder, I will be learning a lot and also pays better, I doubt I'll be able to continue with this job after the internship is over... the team seems intense. But this job really interests me as the place is prestigious in my eyes. The interview was really intense at Place 2 while the interview at Place 1 was quick and easy

Problem is I get very anxious and depressed when I feel I don't perform well, I feel I won't be good enough for Place 2 even if they want me. Place 1 feels like I'm going to be able to do the boring job go back home, make my money and then be completely be able to forget about it at night or during the weekend. I haven't been severely depressed for a good year or more but I feel like Place 2 could trigger it. I also feel that if I don't take Place 2 I might regret it later. Place 1 called me the day of the interview to tell me they wanted me for the job. I wanted to get the answer from Place 2 before telling them I accept.

I thought Monday I would call Place 2 and ask them if they want me because I have another offer and I can't wait, so have to make a choice. I though if Place 2 wants me I'll go there, otherwise I'll just call back Place 1 and tell them I accept their offer. The problem is I don't even know if I want Place 2 anymore even if they want me... This would be my first job in IT so you can understand I am very scared and troubled. I often make bad decision and I really want to make the right one this time.

I hope someone can help me with this decision and thanks for reading.

P.S: English isn't my first language so sorry for the mistakes."

I used to be a very confident guy but that sorta killed something inside me. We had been together for almost six years so I have no idea how to be single.

Two weeks after she broke up with me I got back in touch with Charlotte (not her real name). I used to work with her during our internship at a secondary school. We got along really well but we didn't stay in touch much. Somehow we got back in touch and we started talking. I asked her out via Whatsapp Messenger and she said she'd like to but she told me she hated the the phrase ""going on a date"" so we called it a ""meeting"" for the heck of it. She also said she was really busy so it wouldn't happen right away, which I was fine with.

A few weeks passed and she hadn't mentioned the ""meeting"" anymore. We did talk all day every day. I was getting a little impatient so I asked her about it, but she was still very busy. I realise now that I was desperate for female attention. I got pretty pushy and she decided that she wasn't gonna go out with me anymore because it felt forced. I respected her decision and we gradually stopped talking.

A few weeks ago she messaged me and we started talking again. I still like her (note: I don't have feelings for her but I'd still like to go out with to get to know her better) so I took it easy and didn't think much of it. After a few days of silence she would be the one who would start talking to me every time, even though I haven't seen her in person in almost a year.

Now my problem is this. I want to go out with her but I don't want to be the pushy guy again and ask her out because last time she didn't want to anymore. I like talking to her a lot (I usually hate talking to people via my phone but with her I don't mind) and I don't wanna ruin that. What does her contacting me mean, if anything? Any advice/help would be awesome.

I have no other options so far, and this place needs an answer by December 1st. 

I'm just wondering what you think would be best. Go with the miserable (paid) internship or take my chances searching for other options? 

Thanks so much in advance. My parents and friends haven't been very helpful because we have different world views, but hopefully you guys could help me out.

2nse2e,2,2014-11-29,"Moving to my first job in a State with emissions standards, want to buy a car and road-trip it there.",DemiReticent,whatcarshouldIbuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/2nse2e/moving_to_my_first_job_in_a_state_with_emissions/,"**TL;DR:** what are the chances of buying a car that would meet emissions standards in another state, and where can I find this information when shopping for cars?

----

Answering the questions below:

* I require a car with 4 doors. I need room for cargo or passengers (I plan on carpooling to work with my roommate(s) and maybe some neighbors).
* My price range is under $30000
* I prefer automatic transmissions.
* This car will primarily be used for commuting, and occasionally utility (there is good hiking in Washington and I plan to partake in hiking and probably snow sports).

I'm graduating college in May and I'm moving from Texas to Washington state for my first job. For various reasons, it may make sense logistically for me to buy a car* before the move: I won't have to be without transport or have to rent a car while I shop for one (all while starting my job and ALSO looking for a permanent place to live).

\* I have had a hand-me-down car during high school, and I have rented cars, subsidized by my internships, almost every summer for my internships so I have experience, know what I like and don't like in terms of features. But this will be the first new or lightly-used car I actually buy.

Also because I'm young-ish (just turned 24), my parents may need to co-sign, and it would be really inconvenient for them to come out to Washington just to help me with that aspect unless I already knew exactly what I wanted.

Obviously one option is to go shopping for a car before I move and go there with a plan for exactly what car I want to buy with all the options and an expectation for what I would like to pay.

But a more realistic option is to buy the car here, and do a cross-country road trip with my dad or a friend, and then also have the advantage of taking my valuables (expensive/irreplaceable instruments and a computer that would all be difficult or impossible to safely transport by plane or that I wouldn't want to trust to a moving truck) on a one-way trip to my new home.

One major point to consider is that Washington follows California's emissions standards which are pretty strict compared to other states, especially Texas which has no emissions standards. So when buying a car I would want to make sure that I wouldn't have to turn around right away and replace the emissions system of the car.

So where can I find information about whether a car might meet emissions standards? (Is this even standardized across models of cars, or does it depend on the dealer?) How likely is it that I can find a car I like in Texas that would fit the emissions standards in Washington? Are there particular models of cars that might be more likely to fit the bill (perhaps hybrids)?

2nsimx,4,2014-11-29,"I[20F] have trouble dealing with anger(?) when texting my BF[20M] after he hasn't texted me for a while, help!",throwthrowho,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2nsimx/i20f_have_trouble_dealing_with_anger_when_texting/,"Hey guys and gals,

I am sure this a problem for a bunch of people in this day and age, but I am looking for tips on how to help me with my situation. Also to those who hate texting as a form of communication, I know, I get it, but it's all we have sometimes.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for over a year and we are both in college. I noticed this problem over summer break. We were long distance at this time and only got to see each other maybe three times toward the beginning of it. Our main way of communication was through texting and we maybe called each other every three days. Skype was probably bi weekly and dwindled as time went on as we both had a fairly busy work life. 

Obviously there would be days with little communication, but when it turned into a day or two of little to no communication, I wouldn't feel as excited to respond to him or even feel the need to respond. Examples of what I consider little to no communication for us is a ""How are you?"", then I would respond and wouldn't get a response for a few hours. ""Instead of being all giddy with joy as I usually am when I get a ""Hey, how are you doing? :)"" I felt like ""Oh he finally responded/thought about me"" and wondered why I should text him if he hasn't texted me for so long. I mean I dislike when people regardless if they start a conversation and dont continue, it just irks me. I respond with less than enthuastic texts (Yeah, okay, etc.), which probably makes him not want to respond anyway. I just don't feel the happiness. I don't feel angry either though, hence the title.

Just to make it a little more clear, here's an example that happened not too long ago:

We are both on fall break, again 7 hours away from each other. I don't really enjoy being home, my parents and I don't get along too well, not really excited about Turkey Day, even though the food is delicious. Not having a good time at home, really really bored. He is still at school, he lives near by, not doing much all week then goes to his family's then boom, little communication for two days, and the stupid ""whats up"" ""not much blah blah"" no response shit (might be a pet peeve? or just trying to find an excuse to blame my irrationality on). Day 1: good Day 2: good and understanding (forgot his phone charger) Day 3: finally texts and not good. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN THIS SHIT GUYS, HELP. I get his texts (I miss you/Love you/when do I get to see you?) and I'm like meh. I'm not angry or anything, I just don't want to text him since he hasn't texted me. I respond because I would want him to respond, then I try seeing my bland responses through his eyes, but I can't stop myself. I'm just not as excited to hear from him and I don't have much to say since I've been doing nothing at home. The other days yeah I could've texted him about stuff I did like dinner, shopping, etc, but he wasn't going to respond, so what is the point? 

Sometimes I feel like it's all about him, whenever he wants to text me or do anything for that matter. I don't feel like he goes out of his way to make me feel special sometimes and call me for a quick 5 minutes or break the rules and talk to me for a little, because it makes me happy and I would definitely do it for him. I actually feel like this is a big part of why I act this way.

Honestly, when I don't talk to him for a while I don't feel as attracted to him anymore and over the Summer it caused doubts, and it didn't even happen that much! Probably less than 5 times. Also I definitely felt the disconnect over fall break,  I'm worried what this will do to us when I take off a semester to intern in another state. When we don't talk to each other though, its well warranted. His dad doesn't like it, he's busy, family time, etc. But yet I always end up like this.

Sorry for the long, messy post. It's a giant clusterfuck of thoughts and a rant. I just wanted to hear other people's thoughts on this situation and actually letting me air my troubles has made me feel better like it always does.

TL;DR: I get moody when my boyfriend doesn't text me for a day or two with reasonable cause and I feel less excited to hear from him and talk to him. I just don't wanna respond to him because he didn't really talk to me and I also feel less attracted to him. I don't know what my problem is. I may just need a new hobby."

2nstme,6,2014-11-29,Conflict over whether to quit my research group,WiiPu,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2nstme/conflict_over_whether_to_quit_my_research_group/,"I'm a junior in college and I got a position as an undergraduate volunteer research assistant last June. When the professor and I were discussing expectations for my involvement, we decided that the minimum amount of involvement would be ~40hrs/week in the summer and ~13 hrs/week for the fall semester. In the summer I mostly assisted my grad student w/ various tasks, and at the start of the fall semester I got my own project to work on. Well, it's the middle of the fall semester and I think I want to quit after the semester ends. No one in my research group has any idea; they think I want to work in the lab until I graduate (though I have never expressed such sentiments).

However, I learned I'm not very passionate about the research and the possibility of grad school for the subject, and I haven't been able to balance schoolwork and lab work very effectively (along with bouts of depression/suicidal thoughts). The nature of the work involves setting aside large amounts of time (sometimes up to 7 straight hrs of active work) to complete experiments, and I feel this is very difficult to do with a challenging course load. These facts may be just excuses, though. I'm satisfied with the amount of time I put into the lab during the summer, but I haven't put in near the amount of time that was expected during the fall (~6-8 hrs/week as opposed to 13hrs/week). I do make sure to communicate with my grad student my time difficulties.

My conflict lies in the facts that I:

1) haven't made any real progress on my project. That is, I have practically nothing to show after a semester's worth of work. It seems that every week during group meetings when we discuss updates in our research I have nothing to present. Every goddamn week, and it's my fault. I know. This ties into my not putting in the hours to get experiments done.

2) The grad student who I work with has invested an incredible amount of time in helping me learn about techniques and concepts about the research, and I haven't contributed anything close to justify the level of support I've received. My leaving the group would be a lost investment when he was expecting me to stay and possibly publish results.

3) I recently received an internship offer at a company for the following summer, and I just told my professor the exciting news. However, I feel that telling him now about want to quit might make him feel used as a means to an end and bad feelings may be had. Though I do value his being one of my references, my sentiments about the group existed long prior to the news about the internship. That being said, I don't know how leaving would affect our relationship and the potential for him to still be a valuable reference...

The question is, do I continue paying my dues into the next semester, or should I tell my professor my feelings, and what would be the most gracious way to do so while protecting our relationship? I love being around the grad students and the professor as they are great people and have contributed a lot to my personal development, but I just don't want to do the research anymore. It's not like I wouldn't be doing nothing next semester (there's a tutoring gig that really interests me)

I don't know, any words of advice would be greatly appreciated. It just made me feel a little better to write this down as I am feeling very stressed about the situation. Thanks for reading.

2nt1t3,4,2014-11-29,Has anyone donated to a NICU before?,x-ray_girl,crochet,https://www.reddit.com/r/crochet/comments/2nt1t3/has_anyone_donated_to_a_nicu_before/,"Hello all!

I recently taught myself to crochet and now that I have some experience down I wanted to put my skills to good use.  I would really like to donate hats and other hand made items to a NICU.  

I was wondering if anyone has done this before and can tell me a little bit more about it.  More specifically:

1. How did you find out who accepts donations?  I have looked into a couple hospitals in my home state of CT and in Boston but I haven't really gotten any clear answers or places to start.

2. What materials did you use?  I have come across a couple patterns on Ravelry but I assume there are certain types of yarns that should be avoided for the premie baby's conditions (allergies, etc?)

3. What items did you donate?  I know hats are popular but I've also hear about booties, blankets, things for mothers, bears and cocoons

I would prefer to do it local and by myself instead of mailing them off to some bigger organization who collects them.  I have an internship right now at Boston Children's Hospital so I will be asking around there to see if I can get more information once I go back.  I also have ties to the UCONN NICU in CT where my brother was born premature a long time ago, so I would like to donate to them too if possible.  If anyone has experiences with either NICU and donating I would love to hear.  Thank you!"

2nt8zp,1,2014-11-29,So I'm going to a therapist on Tuesday,Timidor,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2nt8zp/so_im_going_to_a_therapist_on_tuesday/,"TL;DR Brain is trying to kill me, haven't been to one in ~6 years, what should I expect/prepare?

Slight longer version:
So I've been experiencing varying degrees of depression and self loathing literally as long as I can remember (mid-20s now). I went to a counselor for roughly a semester in college, and was in a relationship at the same time, which combined to create what was basically the closest to a ""high point"" I can remember. Unfortunately she was only an intern and so left after that semester leaving me without good access to mental health care. Over the course of 18-24 months I kinda gradually slipped downhill until I'd let depression get the best of me, leading me to lose my relationship, drop out of college, and eventually attempt suicide a few times with varying degrees of dedication (one of which was severe enough to land me in the hospital but I got diagnosed with something besides trying to kill myself so I'm one of only two people who knows that last bit, but I digress).

Since then, I've been just sort of muscling through it. I'll have good hours, days, or rarely weeks where I feel like what I think Normal is supposed to feel like. I'm able to get things done, exercise, do well at my job, even keep my room clean-ish. It's not really manic levels of activity, so I think it's just straight depression taking a break as opposed to bipolar or anything.

Lately, though, a series of fuckups (including transferring out of a shit job to an almost as shitty job just in time to make it so I couldn't transfer into the job I really wanted to have, and losing the one actual friend I had through neglect) brought me to the point where I think my subconsious is trying to kill me. I'm finding myself veering a bit while driving, realizing that I'm walking to where guns are stored rather than back to my room, that kind of thing. Despite not really liking myself I figure I probably ought to get that checked out for the sake of my family and whatever poor bastard would have to mop up my corpse.

So I'm going in to a therapist on Tuesday and have been told to bring ID, insurance, and co-pay. Is there anything else I ought to bring or think about before hand? I'm a little rusty at the whole ""asking for help"" thing.

Thanks in advance."
2nt90w,1,2014-11-29,To gap year or to stay in school?,ctrembs03,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2nt90w/to_gap_year_or_to_stay_in_school/,"Hello Redditors. I've got a situation here and I need your good help. 

Background: I'm a sophomore in a state college (money reasons), currently studying exercise science. I got great grades in high school and took a bunch of APs, and my grades in college are also not bad. However, I have several problems with my college adventure thus far. My college is HUGE, and I feel strongly disconnected from the entire experience. I've got zero passion for what I'm studying, and I feel like I'm surrounded by people who just don't seem like they're going anywhere. Also, I don't really know what I want to do career wise- I'm in the exercise science program simply to get some sort of an undergraduate degree, intending to do my post-undergrad somewhere more specialized to whatever it is I'll end up doing (I do know I want to be in some kind of a therapeutic field working with children, which is why I chose exercise science). While in school full time, I'm also working full time in a desperate attempt to save some money while funding both my education and my general life- I moved out of my childhood home and away from my family, because my dad lost his job recently and he's got a huge family to support (7 kids total, myself included).

So: here I am, a young Redditor, living on her own and working full time, while also going to school full time, for an education I am utterly apathetic for. I've been doing this for three semesters and I'm simply unhappy; I feel like I'm wasting both my time and my money on a future I don't see myself fitting into. I feel like going to this state college was the right decision at the time, money wise, but was really a mistake in disguise, because rather than working towards my future, I'm just putting myself more and more in debt towards something I just don't care that much about. (more background: not caring about school is NOT NORMAL for me. I've always prided myself on doing well, academically, and I have zero motivation to put any effort towards this degree, which is another indicator that I'm doing something wrong with myself.)

Proposed solution: take a gap year. I've got a growing list of things I would do if I had a year wothout studying to do them (volunteer, learn personal financing, learn sign language, work on a children's book...), and it would allow me to intern in different jobs to figure out what the best fit for me is. It would also give me the freedom to leave my current job, which I hate and am only working in because it fits around my school schedule, and work in a daycare or as a general classroom aid to gain professional experience with children. I'd also be able to put real time into building a network of professional contacts, by volunteering within fields that I am interested in, career-wise. Then in a year, when I feel I've got more of a handle on my future and my life skills (I left home when I went to school, and I honestly still don't feel I have all the random everyday adult skills necessary to call myself ""independent"" yet), I can start looking at returning to school to TRULY focus on working towards my future. 

Problem: taking a gap year would mean I have to start paying off my student loans six months after I leave school, and then I'd have to keep paying till they were gone. This isn't impossible, but it would be challenging, and would make it tricky to take out any loans later in life when I go back to school. Also, my parents (who are very conservative and very careful and UTTERLY the opposite of me) keep telling me that once you leave college the ""studying mentality"" disappears and I'll never end up going back, so I'm very paranoid about that.

Here's the thing. I love learning and I have no intention of being a college dropout. However, I don't think going straight into a college (that I  chose only because it was cheap) right after high school with no clear career goals in mind was the right option for me, and I can honestly say that given the chance to go back to my senior year, I would absolutely not do it again.

Please provide insight, Reddit! Now that I'm two years in (no matter what I'm still finishing out next semester), is taking a gap year still a good idea? And if it is, how do I do it? Has anyone else ever been in a similar situation, and if so, what did you do about it?"
2nt9n0,0,2014-11-29,Sylvia wants directions,[deleted],DreamAnalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamAnalysis/comments/2nt9n0/sylvia_wants_directions/,"_This is sort of a lucid dream -- I was half asleep, lying in bed under the covers but awake._


Sylvia wants directions. She says: ""How do I get to that population center
using this vehicle?"" She points towards a part of town that is beyond a
kind of dead spot, an industrial wasteland. The scene is similar to -- but not
identical to -- 3rd and Mariposa in San Francisco. She is pointing somewhere down the tracks --
North -- on third.

Sylvia is a coworker, perhaps an intern or a recent hire. She is French, and
not used to every day English. That is part of why her question is phrased so
oddly. The other part is, she's trying to be funny.

I start to say something like, ""To get to that there yonder population
center..."" in a country accent and then decide to knock it off. I point to a
blue and white streetcar which is to our left -- we are facing west, down a
street that intersects 3rd -- and say, you should run up to that tram stop
(it's on our right) and catch it. But it turns down the street and heads west.
(None of the trams on third ever actually do this, but there is old track laid
in the street that suggests they sometimes did.)

I turn to point north on third, and start to say something about taking a tram
that way. Now my back is to Sylvia, since I was to her right (her north). From
behind, she puts her left arm over my shoulder, pointing north, and presses
herself against my back. She speaks softly, almost directly into my ear: ""If
you want this to go anywhere, you're going to have to take the lead."". She
says something more, kind of angrily; basically that I should understand this already.

We run into the tram stop. But it is actually a great complex of walkways --
curving around each other. It's open at the top and reaches two or more stories
down into the ground.

I say something like, ""Do you want to do it here?"", nervously. I actually feel
a little surprised by her, or anxious. Her aggression is something, is a force.

We go down a few floors. We exit through a sort of dingy concrete area and come
out to a yard behind some houses. The houses are all painted dark, forest
green. We run up to the back of a house. There is a sliding door. I think there
is a baby inside. Sylvia wants to open the door -- to break into the house. I
say something like ""Sylvia? What are you doing?"". I say it gently. She has
already opened the door. We run inside.

I am so afraid. The carpeting is beige, fuzzy. The walls are white. We walk in
the door, through a living room, through a doorway without a door.

We are in a little hall -- really not a hall at all, just a turn-around. To our
right is a kitchen, with a tile floor. It is very small -- just an extension of
the hallway. In front of us, a closed door.

We walk -- almost run -- through the kitchen. We turn right again and now we
are in another living room with a sliding door. There is a little boy standing
there. I think Sylvia tousles his hair. She is ahead of me -- we are separated.

His name might be Jerome. I hear someone -- his mother? Sylvia? -- saying
something in a soft voice about looking for her Jerome.

The closed door -- I have a sense there was a man behind it, who might kill us.
I have a sense of a shadow figure of a man.

Sylvia and I were basically running this whole time. She was in some kind of
hurry.

I become distressed -- it's starting to look more and more like Sylvia has lost
it. I withdraw from the dream, not exactly waking up -- I wasn't asleep -- but
abandoning the fantasy.

_Notes_

* In San Francisco, there is a blue and white street car imported from Zurich.
  It was that one. I lived in Zurich for a year.

* I don't have any French coworkers.

* I have a French woman acquaintance, someone I've run into three times in the past year. We don't know each other at all well. Like Sylvia, her name begins with an ""S"" and she has brown hair.

_I'll do my best to answer questions about my life or what things are like in San Francisco._"

Celts Get: Gorgui Dieng, Chase Budinger
Minnesota Gets: Kendrick Perkins expiring contract, Perry Jones III
OKC Gets: Brandon Bass, Corey Brewer

Minnie dumps Budinger's 2 years because of their logjam on the wing. Bass is a real asset to a champion contender and OKC needs all the help  it can get. The bigs off the bench sounds a lot better as a Bass/Collison duo then a Collison/McGary duo. Also, Brewer is a significant defensive upgrade for their wing positions. Anthony Morrow and Jeremy Lamb aren't cutting it. The steal of this trade would be Dieng though. Celts desperately need a legit rim protector. Although Dieng might not be there yet, Minnie is committed to Pekovic. Dieng isn't getting any tick when Pek comes back from injury. Minnie still gets the intriguing Perry Jones III who would be useless in the playoffs but could be good down the road. 

Celts: Rondo, Bradley, Green, Sully, Dieng with Smart, Thornton, Budinger, Olynyk, Zeller, Pressey as your bench. 

I tried to be as realistic with this trade as I could so that either this could be a job interview for a paid internship with the team or proof that I need a life and that #greenrunsdeep which is to say #toodeep and I probably need an intervention. 

Anyway, hit me with your trades or anything else. First time poster, long time listener.

I am 27 with 2 kids and would rather not relocate my entire family, and would HATE to commute out to the bay area every day. The only local tech jobs I know of are in Folsom (much closer) but as far as I know there is only Intel, IBM, and HP. 

so i have a few questions,
Are these companies enough to put my mind at ease as far as finding an internship in a year and job after I graduate?
Do i simply need to look harder locally, or are all the jobs just in the bay area?
should i expect pay to be dramatically less in the Sacramento area compared to the bay area?
should I be concerned that I will be seeking an internship and employment at the age of 30 with no experience?

Honestly I went back to school because I was tired of wearing down my body, working way to many hours, making way too little money and never seeing my family, I have gotten quite used to living off of roughly 40k a year, all these claims of salaries starting at 80k are making me light headed."

Now, I'm not gonna blame them entirely for it, since I was the one to allow it as I was a sensitive little kid that cried to them over every little problem that was thrown at him and hoped his mom &amp; dad would solve all his problems.

Needless to say, I've grown up with some social anxiety and depression now since I was holed up inside my parent's hoouse and never left instead for school (and now work) - but now I'm waking up and I'm seeing how stupid this is and I want to break free from it all.

But the problem is, I don't know exactly how to. I just recently purchased a car yes, and I'm in my first year of community college studying computer science. But I'm still stuck with a min. wage job to help pay off the college bills while living with my parents. I'm applying for better paying jobs and internships with no luck right now, hopefully something will spring up, but I'm not too optimistic about it. 

And since I never really had any social contact with anyone outside of my mother and father, it's pretty hard for me to have not-awkward conversations with people, who always refer to me as the ""incredibly shy, but nice kid"" though I know deep down they think I'm a weird oddball.



I'm rambling now, basically: I want to stop being referred to as this 'kid' who everyone has to be gentle with and hold his hand, having no friends, and being in this prison, of the mind and physically. How exactly do I break this mold and finally, you know, be a man?"

So I've been lifting for about 2 years, and since coming to University I went from 6"" ~120 lbs to 155lbs. The first half of that I kinda fucked around though, and I've been tracking my calories and taking it seriously for about a year now.

I've been following SS for the majority of that time; however, about 2 months ago I switched to ICF 5x5 (just to change things up) and I've been seeing great gains on that.

In May I'll be moving to San Francisco for an internship. I want to continue bulking right now, but I also don't want to get too high of a BF% before moving (since I'm planning on being shirtless pretty often). So, my question is, what is a realistic goal to have during the next 5 months? For instance, would it be feasible to bulk for 3 months and get to a weight of maybe 170, then spend 2 months cutting to 160ish? Or should I bulk for 2.5 months and cut for 2.5 months?

The reason why I'm asking is because I've never cut before so I'm not sure how long it takes to lose fat... I've read the cutting guide in the FAQ but couldn't find this info.

My lifts are currently:

Bench: 5x5 @ 145lbs

Deadlift: 1x5 @ 235lbs

OHP: 5x5 @ 100lbs

Weighted Pullups: 3x8 @ 5lbs

I wanted to move there since I was 13. My family was aware of this and every time this topic came up, they brushed it off as a joke.

The plan was to graduate university and the moment I get my diploma, board a plane to London. Only get back to visit on holidays or big family events.

My family always wanted me to go for master's. I, naive young guy, was always agreeing with them. In high school, my thinking was that by the time I go to university, I won't be loser any more. Even when I started my bachelor's studies I though that in 3 years, when the time to enrol to master's comes, I won't be loser any more.

Guess what? I graduate bachelor's in 6 months and I'm your typical loser. Fat, kissless virgin. I don't have job, I don't have any interesting hobbies, I don't have any friends. Every time I wait for the train to arrive I wonder if it would be better if I just jumped and always, always think of London and decide not to.

Three weeks ago, I decided that the only thing that could help me was not getting master's and getting a job in London with bachelor's instead. I have no idea if this will make me happier, but the way I see it, it does not matter if I'm miserable here or in London. I want to be software developer and in this field, experience (usually) beats education. I decided to start losing weight, to start improving my CV, to try and get some internships and focus more on school to get good grades. The last semester is typically not that time consuming. Sure, I have to work on my thesis, but I don't have to commute for an hour twice a day, 5 days a week and can work on it from home, so I will have time for all this.

I informed my family that there is a chance I won't be enrolling to master's and didn't get the reaction I hoped for. I got yelled at, shouted at, told that I would be worthless... honestly, three weeks ago I thought I was happier. I had reason to get out of bed other than ""you have to get to class or you will fail it"". Now I just want to give up everything.
